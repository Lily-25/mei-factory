Abstract: Neurosurgical education requires innovative approaches to meet the demands of an evolving field and adequately train the next generation of surgeons. The Sonntag Virtual Reality Laboratory (SVRL) was established to transform neurosurgical education by harnessing immersive technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). Inspired by the legacy of Dr Volker K. H. Sonntag, the SVRL aims to enhance skill acquisition and knowledge retention through high-fidelity simulations, interactive anatomic modules, and advanced spine procedure training. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Neurosurgical education requires innovative approaches to meet the demands of an evolving field and adequately train the next generation of surgeons. The Sonntag Virtual Reality Laboratory (SVRL) was established to transform neurosurgical education by harnessing immersive technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). Inspired by the legacy of Dr Volker K. H. Sonntag, the SVRL aims to enhance skill acquisition and knowledge retention through high-fidelity simulations, interactive anatomic modules, and advanced spine procedure training.A multidisciplinary team of neurosurgeons, medical educators, and technology experts collaborated to align SVRL development with core educational goals. The initial phase focused on curriculum design and assessment metrics, followed by the creation of customized VR, AR, and MR modules targeting essential neurosurgical procedures and concepts. All of these modules underwent iterative testing and refinement to ensure educational value and clinical relevance. METHODS A multidisciplinary team of neurosurgeons, medical educators, and technology experts collaborated to align SVRL development with core educational goals. The initial phase focused on curriculum design and assessment metrics, followed by the creation of customized VR, AR, and MR modules targeting essential neurosurgical procedures and concepts. All of these modules underwent iterative testing and refinement to ensure educational value and clinical relevance.The SVRL has produced innovative applications, including a VR-based freehand pedicle screw placement application, an MR scoliosis module, an ultrarapid artificial intelligence-driven spine model, and a comprehensive VR pathology library. Trainee feedback has been positive, citing improvements in decision-making, technical proficiency, and conceptual understanding.

Abstract: Millennial nurses are quickly becoming the largest generation in the nursing field, next to the baby boomers. As boomers retire, millennials are predicted to become the majority within the next 5 years. There is a lack of attention on the millennials' experiences, skills transfer, policies to protect them, and training to prevent negative stereotyping from boomers. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of millennial nurses' experiences as they collaborate with baby boomer nurses in medical treatment settings. A descriptive qualitative case study methodology was used. There are numerous studies on baby boomers' experiences as they lead or work with millennials. Still, there are very few studies from the millennials' perspectives, and only a few on the generational workplace in the nursing field. Eight female participants were selected for the study—four Black, two Hispanic, and two White participants from seven states in the United States. Six themes emerged from the data that described the millennial nurses' experiences of collaborating with baby boomers: boomers' resistance to change, reverse ageism toward millennials, minimal knowledge transfer, boomers' lack of technical skills, boomers' uncollaborative behavior, and millennials' seeking alternative career opportunities. The study data demonstrated that millennials are eager to collaborate and learn from boomer nurses, despite the perception that the older, more experienced nurses are unwilling to teach them, and millennials desire to be respected for the skills they bring to the field, namely, technology. Collaboration and understanding can be accomplished between the two groups through role-playing in group training, generational and reverse mentoring, and new policies to protect millennial nurses, ensure skills transfer, and improve patient care. The findings of the study could help industrial/organization professionals develop training and policies to increase job satisfaction across generations and enhance retention and efficiency in the medical industry.

Abstract: Conventional medical education faces resource constraints, including limited access to cadavers, difficulties in safely replicating high-risk scenarios, and uneven distribution of training opportunities. Virtual and augmented reality technologies address these issues by providing immersive, interactive simulations that replicate medical environments with high fidelity. Through 3D modeling, real-time rendering, and multisensory feedback, these platforms allow trainees to practice complex procedures risk-free, enhancing skill development and decision-making. Innovations in AI-driven content generation, adaptive learning, and edge computing further improve scalability and effectiveness. By overcoming physical barriers, VR/AR democratizes access to specialized training, reshaping medical education for improved skill acquisition, knowledge retention, and global collaboration.

Abstract: The evolving role of Medical Affairs (MA) has positioned this department as a key element in the development and lifecycle management of pharmaceutical products. In response to internal and external assessments, AstraZeneca (AZ) Spain implemented a transformation of its MA central teams through a newly designed Working Model. This model ensures full engagement across the product lifecycle, spanning early access, pre-launch, launch, and post-launch, balancing global strategy with local execution, enhancing cross-functional collaboration, and timely evidence generation. Central to this transformation is the deployment of four coordinated teams: the Early Asset Strategy Team, the Launch Readiness Team, the Core Value Team, and the Brand Team. These teams follow a structured work methodology and coordination model underpinned by dedicated information management processes that streamline communication and knowledge transfer. Training and capability-building programmes were also introduced to strengthen critical functional and leadership competencies. These changes aim to improve product positioning, accelerate market access, and drive value-based healthcare outcomes. The initiative aligns with broader industry trends emphasising early stakeholder engagement, data integration, and patient-centric strategies. By fostering agility, strategic foresight, and internal consistency, the transformation of MA central teams at AZ Spain provides a replicable model for enhancing MA's contribution to product development and healthcare ecosystem innovation. This article builds on our previous publications about the national ecosystem assessment of stakeholder needs, the definition of our MA transformation framework (articulating the strategic roadmap), and the description of the evolution of in-field MA teams in AZ Spain. Here we detail the transformation of the MA central teams and their working model. Future MA evolution will integrate emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and digital tools, improving stakeholder engagement, evidence generation, and decision making. The transformative potential of AI in anticipating trends and optimising trials will enhance the role of MA in driving innovation and improving patient outcomes.The evolving role of Medical Affairs (MA) has positioned this department as a key element in the development and lifecycle management of pharmaceutical products.

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of green building projects, limited research has explored the factors influencing intergenerational knowledge transfer (IGKT) in this context. As green building projects are increasingly characterized by high environmental standards, technological complexity, and interdisciplinary collaboration, effective knowledge transfer from older to younger employees becomes crucial for ensuring the success and sustainability of these projects. This study addresses this gap by systematically examining the key factors influencing IGKT in green building projects, applying an integrated Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) methodology. Firstly, twelve factors were identified across five dimensions: transfer subjects, inter-subject relationships, transfer objects, transfer channels, and transfer context. Based on expert input, a direct influence matrix was constructed, and centrality and cause degrees were calculated to distinguish causal and result factors. Subsequently, the ISM method was employed to classify the key factors hierarchically and develop a multi-level structural model of their interaction paths. Results show that organizational support climate ranked highest in both centrality and influence, while digital transformation capacity emerged as a key driver in green project environments. Surface-level factors (e.g., knowledge absorption and transmission capability) were highly susceptible; intermediate factors (e.g., motivation, knowledge distance) acted as bridges; and deep-level factors (e.g., knowledge complexity and embeddedness), though lower in centrality, posed long-term structural constraints. This study provides valuable insights for enhancing IGKT and fostering effective cross-generational collaboration, which is essential for advancing sustainable practices in the green building sector.

Full text: 1. Introduction Knowledge creation and transfer have become essential drivers of competitiveness in the modern construction industry [1,2]. Green building projects, which integrate environmentally responsible, resource-efficient and health-oriented strategies throughout the building life cycle, have gained prominence as the sector responds to increasing expectations for sustainability, energy efficiency and environmental stewardship [3]. These projects typically involve sophisticated design requirements, specialized technologies, and interdisciplinary coordination that span architecture, engineering, environmental science and digital construction [4,5,6]. Such characteristics make accumulated experiential knowledge, particularly tacit knowledge relating to material choices, sustainability trade-offs, environmental certification procedures and long-term performance considerations, indispensable for successful project delivery. Ensuring that this knowledge is effectively transferred within projects is therefore crucial for maintaining organizational capability and achieving high-performance outcomes in green building environments.
Intergenerational knowledge transfer (IGKT) refers to the exchange of knowledge, skills and professional experience between employees of different age groups, and in principle it can occur in both directions [7,8]. In green building projects, the direction of knowledge flow is often more complex than in traditional sectors because younger employees are typically more familiar with emerging digital and sustainability technologies such as BIM, smart energy systems and ecological modeling software. At the same time, older employees tend to possess deeply embedded tacit knowledge such as sustainability-oriented judgment, contextual decision experience and long-cycle project implementation insights acquired through repeated exposure to real-world environmental challenges [9,10,11]. Thus, bidirectional or reciprocal learning is certainly possible and does occur in practice. However, this study deliberately focuses on the downward transfer of sustainability-related tacit knowledge from older to younger employees for two reasons. First, organizations worldwide face an accelerating retirement trend, and the potential loss of accumulated sustainability expertise has been identified as a major risk for maintaining green building quality and long-term capability development [12,13]. Second, tacit sustainability knowledge is significantly harder to codify or replace compared to digital skills, making its effective downward transmission a critical challenge for project teams. By clarifying this analytical boundary, the study does not deny the existence or importance of upward or lateral knowledge flows; rather, it isolates a core mechanism of experience-based sustainability knowledge continuity that is most vulnerable to disruption in green building environments and therefore requires focused analytical attention.
In green building project environments, IGKT is shaped by a combination of individual, knowledge-related and contextual factors that jointly affect its effectiveness. Although project teams often engage in horizontal collaboration and cross-disciplinary learning to integrate architectural, engineering and environmental expertise, the intergenerational transmission of experiential sustainability knowledge forms a distinct process that warrants focused examination. Differences in motivation and capability between generations frequently impede this process. Senior employees may be reluctant to share knowledge due to limited incentives or perceived knowledge loss, while younger employees may lack the experiential grounding needed to interpret such information [14,15]. Green building knowledge adds further complexity because much of it is tacit, context-dependent and difficult to codify, including passive energy strategies, ecological site planning, green material integration and environmental certification procedures. These characteristics increase the risk of distortion or incomplete transmission [16,17,18]. Interpersonal distance, including differences in trust, communication habits and cognitive frames, also influences knowledge absorption and interpretation [19,20]. Project-level cultural conditions further shape IGKT outcomes, as green building projects rely on collaborative climates that encourage knowledge sharing and support long-term learning [21,22,23]. Therefore, to improve the effectiveness of IGKT, green building projects must coordinate and optimize multiple dimensions to achieve efficient knowledge inheritance and application.
Drawing on the theory of psychosocial development, Berk [24] distinguishes early, middle and late adulthood, with guiding younger generations identified as a key developmental task in middle adulthood. Building on this perspective, organizational research commonly categorizes employees into older and younger generational groups, typically treating those above 40 as knowledge holders and those 40 or below as recipients of experience-based knowledge [21,25]. Consequently, IGKT in workplaces is often examined as a process in which senior employees transmit accumulated expertise to colleagues at least a decade younger. Although “generation” can theoretically be defined using multiple dimensions such as career stage or digital cognition (for example, digital natives versus digital immigrants), age remains the most widely used and empirically verifiable criterion in organizational and construction research. In project-based environments, age strongly correlates with accumulated tacit knowledge, years of field exposure, role seniority and experience with long-cycle sustainability decision-making. Therefore, for the purposes of this study, age serves as a practical and conceptually consistent proxy for generational position. At the same time, this study acknowledges that generational differences may also manifest in digital proficiencies and career trajectories, and these characteristics are reflected indirectly through the identified factors (e.g., knowledge distance, digital transformation capability).
Although IGKT has been studied in high-tech, manufacturing and healthcare sectors, research explicitly addressing green building projects remains limited [1,4,26]. The green building sector possesses several distinguishing features, including interdisciplinary integration, performance-driven design, long-term lifecycle evaluation and dependence on tacit sustainability knowledge. These characteristics not only increase the complexity of knowledge creation but also intensify the need for structured intergenerational learning. Existing studies have explored factors such as organizational culture, trust, employee attitudes and technological tools [2,27,28]. However, most rely on qualitative interviews or single-method surveys and provide limited insight into how these factors interact to shape IGKT outcomes in sustainability-oriented project environments. Given these gaps, there is a clear need for a structured analytical approach that not only identifies influential factors but also captures their interaction mechanisms within the unique context of green building projects. Unlike traditional knowledge-transfer models, which focus primarily on individual or organizational dimensions, this study proposes a five-dimensional framework (“subject–relationship–object–channel–context”) that reflects the distinctive characteristics of green, intergenerational and project-based work settings. This framework integrates individual capabilities and motivations, generational relationship dynamics, sustainability knowledge attributes, multi-channel communication pathways and project-specific contextual enablers. Such a holistic structure provides a more comprehensive lens for examining how sustainability-related knowledge flows across generations under conditions of high technical uncertainty, temporary team arrangements and strong performance accountability.
To operationalize this framework, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method is adopted to determine the causal influence among factors and distinguish those that act as primary drivers from those that are more dependent [29,30]. Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) is further applied to organize the identified factors into a hierarchical structure, revealing the underlying pathways through which foundational conditions, intermediate mechanisms and surface-level manifestations jointly influence IGKT [31,32]. By integrating these methods, the study moves beyond traditional linear or single-level IGKT models and develops a multi-level analytical structure tailored to the complexities of green construction. The findings contribute theoretically by clarifying how the interplay among five dimensions shapes IGKT in green building contexts, and contribute practically by informing organizations on how to strengthen knowledge continuity and better support the next generation of green building professionals.
The structure is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical foundations of intergenerational knowledge transfer and outlines the identification of influencing factors in green building contexts. Section 3 presents the research design and details the integrated DEMATEL-ISM methodology. Section 4 reports the empirical findings, including the causal relationships and hierarchical structure of the identified factors. Section 5 discusses the theoretical and practical implications of the results. Section 6 provides the conclusions, highlights the study’s limitations and suggests avenues for future research.
2. Literature Review To provide a coherent foundation for the empirical analysis, this section reviews the existing body of knowledge related to IGKT and its relevance to green building project environments. The literature review is structured into three parts: first, an overview of IGKT in organizational settings; second, a synthesis of studies examining knowledge transfer within green building projects; and third, a discussion of the key factor dimensions that influence IGKT based on established communication and knowledge-transfer theories. This structure ensures that the conceptual background of the study is fully articulated before introducing the analytical framework adopted in later sections.
2.1. Intergenerational Knowledge Transfer in Organizations Knowledge transfer refers to the dual knowledge exchange between knowledge providers and receivers, which covers the provision, acquisition, and application of knowledge [33]. Based on the generational differences between knowledge providers and receivers, knowledge transfer can be divided into intragenerational knowledge transfer (i.e., horizontal knowledge transfer between employees of the same generation) and IGKT (i.e., vertical knowledge transfer between employees of different generations) [34]. The initial research on IGKT was concentrated in the fields of sociology and psychology, focusing on knowledge transfer between different generations. Cumming and Henry [35] pointed out the importance of knowledge and skills transfer in intergenerational relationships, arguing that the older generation can help the younger generation adapt to social changes by guiding and imparting experience. Entering the 21st century, research on IGKT has gradually expanded to the fields of organizational behavior and management, and scholars have begun to pay attention to the sources, concepts, processes, and results of IGKT. For example, Beazley et al. [36] investigated how organizations retain their intellectual assets in the face of knowledge losses caused by personnel turnover such as downsizing, layoffs, and the retirement of baby boomers. Harvey [7] conducted a systematic analysis of IGKT strategies within knowledge-intensive organizations and proposed two models of IGKT: the source-recipient and mutual exchange models. Recently, with the advancement of technology and changes in organizational environments, research on IGKT has further deepened. Scholars have begun to focus on digital tools [37], antecedents and outcomes of knowledge transfer [11,28], and IGKT in different organizational contexts [9,10]. However, existing IGKT research has been developed primarily in non-construction sectors, leaving limited understanding of how IGKT operates within the construction industry, particularly in green building project environments.
2.2. Knowledge Transfer and Intergenerational Knowledge Transfer in Green Building Projects Green building projects encompass expertise and technologies from diverse disciplines such as building design, energy systems, and ecological science. In recent years, certain researchers have examined how knowledge is disseminated within green building projects. For instance, Ugolini et al. [38] investigated the processes of knowledge exchange among various parties in ecological infrastructure endeavors and assessed the strengths and weaknesses of distinct cooperation approaches. Perkins and Perkins et al. [39] collected experiential knowledge from field experts involved in construction activities and organized it by category to distribute it to builders and planners. Zou and Alam [40] utilized a green building example to formulate an approach for involving stakeholders to address discrepancies in energy efficiency outcomes. Qiang et al. [41] examined how cooperative relationships develop and transform within green building projects, and recommended strategies to strengthen the flow of expertise and information among participants, aiming to boost the effectiveness of sustainable development efforts. Zhou et al. [42] explored the key factors affecting knowledge transfer among stakeholders in green building projects and outlined some combination strategies for different categories by using a configuration analysis approach. As the research deepens, some scholars have begun to pay attention to the impact of generational differences on knowledge transfer in green building projects. Sanaei et al. [43] divided employees in engineering organizations into four generations based on age and proposed that managers need to determine how to cross generational boundaries to increase organizational knowledge transfer. The results showed that the employees’ generational attributes affect the way knowledge is shared among employees (e.g., meetings, personal discussions, emails, instant messaging, etc.). Crespo Sánchez et al. [44] designed an IGKT model to educate students about energy-saving renovations of residential buildings and spread this knowledge to their families.
Despite these contributions, existing studies seldom examine IGKT in green building projects at a system-wide or structural level. Most research discusses knowledge transfer conceptually or through isolated case examples, leaving unclear how the multiple factors influencing IGKT jointly operate in sustainability-oriented project environments. Green building projects involve complex configurations of technological expertise, interdisciplinary collaboration and evolving regulatory requirements, making intergenerational learning particularly reliant on the interplay among individual, relational and contextual conditions. However, prior studies rarely identify such factors comprehensively or analyze their causal relationships. This lack of methodological depth limits current understanding of how experience-based sustainability knowledge is transmitted from older to younger employees and where the most critical leverage points lie. These gaps highlight the need for a structured analytical approach to map the determinants of IGKT in green building projects and to reveal the hierarchical pathways through which they influence knowledge transfer outcomes.
2.3. Factors Affecting Intergenerational Knowledge Transfer in Green Building Projects As the research on IGKT deepens, scholars begin to focus on the key elements of IGKT. The “5W” model proposed by Lasswell [45] is a classic theoretical framework in the communication field, namely who, what, in which channel, to whom, and with what effect. This model constructs a linear model of the communication process through five basic elements. Under the guidance of communication theory, scholars have proposed the elements that affect knowledge transfer (including subject, object, channel, and context), laying the foundation for subsequent research [46,47]. Whereafter, Joshi et al. [48] incorporated the interaction between the sender and receiver of knowledge as a factor dimension. Combined with earlier research, researchers later categorized the factors impacting knowledge transfer into five main dimensions: subject, relationship, object, channel, and context [49,50]. These five dimensions, while developed in broader knowledge-transfer studies, offer a comprehensive lens through which the determinants of IGKT can be systematically organized.
To ensure that the establishment of the five-dimensional framework is grounded in a rigorous and transparent literature base, a structured review was conducted prior to identifying the influencing factors. Relevant studies were searched in Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar using combined keyword groups that captured both the generational and project-based attributes of the research domain. The search strategy was based on two groups of keywords that had to appear simultaneously in each query. The first group captured intergenerational knowledge processes and included terms such as “intergenerational/cross-generational knowledge/expertise/skill/experience transfer/sharing/exchange/transmission/flow/communication”, or “knowledge transfer/sharing/exchange/transmission/flow across generations”. The second group captured the project-based and construction-related context of this study and included terms such as “construction industry”, “building projects”, “project-based organizations”, “sustainable construction”, and “green building projects”. During the literature search, these two categories of keywords were combined using logical AND to ensure that selected studies addressed both intergenerational knowledge processes and construction or green building project environments.
Peer-reviewed studies were included if they satisfied three criteria: (1) they examined knowledge transfer, sharing or exchange involving different generations or age groups; (2) they were situated within project-based, engineering or construction-related organizational settings, including but not limited to green building projects; and (3) they provided conceptual, empirical or contextual insights relevant to the mechanisms, determinants or barriers of generational knowledge flows. Studies not meeting these conditions or lacking clear relevance to intergenerational exchange in construction environments were excluded. Across the screened literature, recurring analytical emphases were identified on individual attributes, relational dynamics, characteristics of the transferred knowledge, communication channels and contextual conditions, echoing the classical “5W” communication logic. These consistent patterns across diverse studies provide theoretical and empirical justification for structuring the analysis around the five dimensions of subject, relationship, object, channel and context. Accordingly, the following subsections elaborate on the core concepts and representative factors within each dimension.
2.3.1. Subject Factors In the framework of knowledge transfer elements, the characteristics of the subjects involved are central to IGKT, with motivation and ability forming the core determinants. According to Self-Determination Theory (SDT), motivation can be autonomous or controlled, and these forms influence individuals’ willingness to participate in knowledge transfer [51]. Autonomous motivation reflects intrinsic interest, values or self-endorsed goals [52,53]. In IGKT, senior employees may share sustainability-related knowledge because they value mentorship or feel responsible for supporting younger colleagues. Younger employees who show interest in green construction also tend to take the initiative to seek guidance, improving the effectiveness of the transfer process [15,54]. Autonomous motivation enhances persistence and depth in knowledge exchange [55,56]. Controlled motivation, in contrast, arises from external demands or incentives [14]. In green building projects, it may come from certification documentation, managerial requirements or project procedures. While such mechanisms help ensure basic knowledge capture [57,58], they may not be sufficient to elicit the transmission of experience-based sustainability knowledge unless senior staff feel adequately supported or recognized.
Recent studies also emphasize that senior employees’ willingness to transfer knowledge depends on their perceived organizational value, late-career expectations and the availability of appropriate incentives [9,10]. Experienced practitioners are generally more willing to mentor younger colleagues when their expertise in sustainable practices is acknowledged and when mechanisms such as recognition, workload adjustments or dedicated mentoring time are provided [9,10]. Without such support, knowledge providers may hesitate to invest additional effort, particularly when project workloads are high or retirement is approaching. This willingness factor thus represents an important subject-related determinant of IGKT.
Beyond motivation, knowledge transfer also depends on the ability of participants to deliver and absorb knowledge. Knowledge transmission capacity refers to how effectively senior staff can extract, articulate, and share what they know [59]. In green construction, this might involve explaining how to operate high-performance HVAC systems or select low-emission materials. Strong transmission capacity helps ensure that crucial know-how is not lost [60]. On the receiving side, knowledge absorption capacity is about how well junior staff can understand, internalize, and apply new knowledge [61]. Since green projects often involve time-sensitive and technically complex tasks, young professionals with strong absorption capacity, such as the ability to interpret energy simulation data or adapt to new sustainable technologies, are better able to apply knowledge quickly and accurately. This leads to more efficient and effective transfer [11,62].
2.3.2. Relationship Factors Szulanski [33] emphasized that the relationship between the sender and receiver of knowledge plays a vital role in effective knowledge transfer. The nature of the relationship between senior and junior employees forms a foundational condition for IGKT in project environments. To avoid ambiguity in how relationship factors are conceptualized, this study focuses specifically on professional relationships within project organizations rather than personal ties such as family or friendship. Intergenerational exchanges in green building projects primarily occur through formal or semi-formal workplace interactions, including supervisor-subordinate relationships, cross-disciplinary collaboration and peer exchanges within project teams. These professional ties can be examined through established relational dimensions such as trust, communication frequency, perceived approachability and hierarchical distance, ensuring that the concept of “relationship factors” is analytically grounded rather than broadly or subjectively defined.
In green building projects, both “knowledge distance” and “relational distance” significantly influence IGKT effectiveness. Knowledge distance refers to the differences between senior and junior employees in their knowledge base, practical experience, or awareness of sustainability concepts. This includes both technical knowledge distance (e.g., in renewable energy systems) and managerial knowledge distance (e.g., green construction workflows) [63,64]. In the fast-evolving domain of green buildings, senior employees’ expertise may lie in established energy-saving retrofits, whereas junior employees often possess training in emerging technologies like green certification standards, creating a professional disconnect [8,65]. This disconnect can lead to a “knowledge gap,” where junior employees struggle to fully understand or apply green construction know-how shared by senior staff, thereby diminishing the effectiveness of IGKT [64]. In time- and sustainability-driven project settings, this gap is amplified by the transient nature of project teams, where veteran site managers must quickly pass on key know-how such as sustainable material selection or low-carbon implementation practices to newly assigned engineers. Any miscommunication risks resource waste or compliance issues [66].
Relational distance refers to gaps in organizational hierarchy, social ties, and emotional connection between generations [67,68]. When such distance is large, generational value differences are often more pronounced. Senior employees may question the capabilities or commitment of newcomers to green building values and thus become reluctant to share core environmental insights. At the same time, younger employees may hesitate to ask for guidance due to the authority or perceived complexity of experienced staff, especially concerning sustainable technologies or green compliance processes [69]. This generational disconnect further obstructs the effective transfer and implementation of key sustainability practices within green building projects.
2.3.3. Object Factors The object dimension concerns the characteristics of knowledge and how they influence IGKT. Among them, knowledge tacitness, complexity, and embeddedness are especially critical. In green building projects, tacit knowledge often takes the form of senior employees’ hands-on experience with sustainable materials, energy-saving technologies, or site-specific environmental strategies, knowledge that cannot be fully captured in manuals or guidelines [16,70]. Tacit knowledge is hard to express through language or text, and must often be conveyed through observation, mentorship, or shared work. Junior staff, lacking field experience, may struggle to grasp these insights if they rely solely on written materials, leading to knowledge gaps in implementing green practices [70,71]. Knowledge complexity refers to the diversity, interdependence, and evolving nature of knowledge. In green building contexts, complex knowledge may involve interdisciplinary integration, such as coordinating structural design with renewable energy systems or achieving LEED certification, which requires holistic understanding and systems thinking. Young employees may find it challenging to quickly comprehend this complexity due to limited exposure or technical depth [17,18]. Knowledge embeddedness highlights how knowledge is tied to specific contexts like team routines, organizational culture, or site workflows. In green building projects, older employees’ knowledge may be deeply embedded in green procurement processes, stakeholder collaboration habits, or regulatory navigation specific to certain regions or clients [69,72]. If young employees cannot understand these contextual elements, it hampers their ability to absorb and apply the transferred knowledge effectively.
2.3.4. Channel Factors In IGKT within green building projects, transfer channels refer to the methods or media through which knowledge is shared, including both formal and informal channels. Formal channels (e.g., training programs, knowledge systems, documents, and meetings) provide a structured way to transfer knowledge [73,74]. In green building projects, these formal methods, such as training on sustainable design standards, green material specifications, and environmental safety protocols, help junior staff grasp foundational knowledge related to energy efficiency, waste reduction, and eco-certification processes. For instance, during the early phase of green construction, formal training can help young employees systematically understand green technology applications, such as solar integration or rainwater harvesting systems. These tools ensure knowledge consistency across teams and phases. Informal channels include mentoring, daily communication, team collaboration, and social interactions [73,74]. In green building projects, older employees often pass down site-specific strategies for energy-efficient construction or resolving environmental compliance issues through on-the-job coaching and peer learning. Informal communication is especially effective for transferring tacit, experience-based knowledge that is not well documented [20]. Given the dynamic and problem-oriented nature of green construction, informal mentoring, such as guiding a younger colleague through unexpected site-level challenges like waste separation or optimizing HVAC layout for energy savings, helps bridge the theory-practice gap and enhances adaptability.
The effectiveness of IGKT also depends on communication frequency, both online and offline. Online communication, enabled by tools like messaging apps or video calls, is key for fast, wide-area knowledge sharing [21,75]. In green building projects involving dispersed teams or external consultants (e.g., energy analysts or LEED auditors), high-frequency online exchanges support real-time coordination and rapid dissemination of eco-design updates, inspection results, or compliance adjustments [11,20]. For example, senior engineers can upload case-based green construction insights (like how to avoid thermal bridging or manage green material logistics) to a digital platform, helping young professionals quickly retrieve and apply that knowledge. Offline communication, such as site meetings, walkthroughs, and face-to-face coaching, remains irreplaceable for deep knowledge transfer [21,75]. In the context of green building, offline modes like toolbox talks or joint environmental assessments allow experienced workers to guide younger staff in context-specific decisions, such as adjusting construction sequences to minimize environmental impact or verifying green building material use. These interactions help young employees internalize sustainable practices and develop critical thinking skills for site-specific green solutions, which are hard to convey fully through digital means [11,20].
2.3.5. Context Factors The context of knowledge transfer refers to the environmental and background factors affecting the process, mainly including system, technology, structure, and behavior, which greatly influence IGKT effectiveness. In green building projects, a supportive organizational atmosphere is crucial to encourage sharing of specialized sustainable construction knowledge across generations [21,22]. For example, when senior staff feel that their expertise in green technologies and eco-friendly practices is valued and mentoring is encouraged, they are more motivated to guide younger employees. Likewise, young employees supported by management are more proactive in learning about energy-efficient methods, green certifications, and environmental regulations [23]. Organizational structure also significantly impacts IGKT. In complex green building projects involving multiple contractors and stakeholders, rigid hierarchies can block timely knowledge flow about sustainable innovations, while flatter, networked structures promote cross-team and cross-generational exchange of green expertise [8,65,76]. Leadership style matters too: transformational and supportive leaders foster open communication and a culture of continuous learning focused on sustainability, boosting IGKT, while traditional command styles can suppress knowledge sharing [27,77]. With digital transformation advancing in construction, digital capabilities are becoming vital enablers of IGKT in green projects [78,79]. Digital tools such as mobile BIM viewers, cloud-based platforms, and AR/VR training modules help senior experts capture and share tacit knowledge on sustainable building techniques and green material applications in real time. These technologies allow systematic organization and visualization of green construction experience, making it easier for younger staff to learn and apply eco-friendly practices efficiently [2,80].
3. Methodology The research employed a combined approach, which is illustrated in Figure 1. The process begins with case collection, where focus group discussions are conducted with knowledge senders and receivers to identify influencing factors. This is followed by key factors identification, utilizing communication theory to build a theoretical model and a three-step screening process (independent scoring, focus group discussions, and Delphi confirmation) to identify the key factors influencing IGKT. The DEMATEL method is then employed to collect data from experts with over 10 years of industry experience and calculate the direct and total influence matrices. Finally, the ISM method is used to generate the adjacency and reachability matrices, followed by hierarchical decomposition to construct the ISM structural model, revealing the interrelationships among the key factors.
3.1. The Identification of Influencing Factors To explore the core determinants of IGKT in green building projects, this study adopted a two-stage methodological design. Part I focused on case collection, and Part II centered on factor identification. In Part I (case collection), IGKT cases were systematically gathered from completed and ongoing green building projects across diverse contexts. A case was defined as a documented or traceable instance of sustainability-related knowledge transfer between employees of different generations within a real project environment. Cases were identified through project documentation, technical meeting summaries, training archives and referrals from experienced practitioners. Each case had to meet two criteria: (1) it involved knowledge transfer relating to green building technologies, sustainable construction processes or environmental decision-making; and (2) it included at least one senior-junior dyad with a minimum age gap of 10 years. Following these criteria, a total of 37 valid cases were collected, covering a wide range of green building project types, including residential green buildings, commercial and office complexes, industrial and logistics facilities, and public infrastructure projects integrating low-carbon or ecological design principles. These cases provided a rich empirical foundation to examine how intergenerational sustainability knowledge is transferred in practice.
Building on these cases, Part II employed role-based focus group interviews to identify the key factors influencing IGKT. Focus groups were selected because they enable participants to collectively construct meanings, debate interpretations, and reveal shared norms, an approach particularly suitable for knowledge-related and practice-embedded topics such as IGKT [81,82]. Compared with individual interviews, focus groups allow senior and junior practitioners to articulate and refine their views through interaction, thus generating deeper insights into how IGKT operates within real project settings. This methodological choice has also been widely adopted in organizational knowledge and construction management research, where practitioner interaction forms a critical part of experiential knowledge formation.
Drawing from 37 identified IGKT cases, two distinct groups of participants were selected from the collected cases for in-depth interviews: (1) knowledge senders, defined as senior employees (over 40 years old) who regularly transferred sustainability-related knowledge to colleagues at least 10 years younger; and (2) knowledge receivers, identified as junior employees (40 years old or younger) who consistently acquired knowledge from colleagues at least 10 years older in green building practices. All participants possessed substantial professional experience and demonstrated strong communication capabilities. Each group interview lasted 90 to 120 min, with focused discussions examining participants’ perspectives on IGKT in green building projects, particularly emphasizing critical influencing factors and their impacts on transfer effectiveness.
In this study, all interview and questionnaire collection procedures strictly adhered to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (1975, revised in 2013), ensuring respect for participants’ autonomy, privacy, and well-being. Prior to participation, each contributor received a clear information statement describing the study purpose, the voluntary nature of involvement, the measures taken to protect confidentiality, and their right to decline or withdraw at any time without consequences. Only participants who explicitly agreed to these conditions proceeded with the interviews. No personally identifiable information was collected during the discussion, and all responses were anonymized during transcription and analysis, ensuring that no individual could be identified from the research data.
Subsequently, systematic classification and coding of the collected data were conducted to establish a transparent and replicable factor system for the DEMATEL-ISM analysis. At this stage, the aim was to document how the study determined what factors would enter the analytical model, rather than to report empirical results. For this reason, Table 1 and Figure 2 belong to the methodology section: they present the inputs to the analytical procedures, not the outcomes generated by them. Table 1 summarizes the identified factors together with their definitions, supporting literature and the corresponding case numbers from the 37 IGKT cases. The table demonstrates the methodological rigor behind factor selection by evidencing that each factor is simultaneously grounded in prior scholarly work (Section 2) and traceable to at least 10 real project cases. Presenting Table 1 in the methodology section ensures transparency regarding the origin, justification and reliability of the variables used in subsequent modeling, which is essential for methodological validity and reproducibility. Figure 2 presents the factor framework by displaying the set of identified factors within each of the five dimensions (subject, relationship, object, channel and context). The figure visually organizes the factors that have already been justified in Table 1, showing how the study structures these elements before entering the DEMATEL and ISM analyses. By illustrating the dimensional grouping of the variables, Figure 2 serves as an intermediate methodological product that clarifies the architecture of the analytical model.
A methodological placement of Table 1 and Figure 2 is therefore necessary, as both components serve to document how the analytical framework is constructed prior to model execution. They clarify the linkage between the theoretical foundations established in Section 2 and the variables entered into the DEMATEL-ISM procedures, while also laying the groundwork for the subsequent causal and hierarchical analyses presented in the Results section.
3.2. The DEMATEL-ISM Model To understand the complex interactions among the factors influencing IGKT, the DEMATEL-ISM model was selected as an appropriate method. DEMATEL is a system analysis method that identifies causal relationships and influence strength among factors in complex systems. It builds a direct impact matrix, quantifies interactions, and calculates each factor’s centrality (importance) and causality (whether it is a “cause” or “effect”) [29,30]. ISM decomposes complex systems into multi-layer hierarchical structures using matrix operations and logic, converting fuzzy factor relationships into clear hierarchies [31,32]. Combining DEMATEL’s causal analysis with ISM’s hierarchical modeling forms the DEMATEL-ISM method, which can uncover both the cause-and-effect links and layered structure of factors in complex systems [84,85]. Specifically, DEMATEL identifies key driving factors by centrality and causality, while ISM builds a multi-level hierarchy to reveal system structure.
IGKT in green building projects is a complex system involving multiple interrelated factors that often influence each other in a cyclical or indirect manner. The DEMATEL-ISM method is well-suited to this complexity, as it simultaneously reveals causal relationships and hierarchical structures among factors impacting IGKT in sustainable construction contexts [86,87]. Compared with methods like structural equation modeling or path analysis, which assume one-way linear relationships, DEMATEL-ISM can model interdependencies and feedback loops critical to understanding knowledge transfer in green building projects [86]. Furthermore, DEMATEL-ISM clarifies key paths and core elements through hierarchical analysis, making it especially effective for tackling the multifaceted challenges of IGKT in green construction [88]. The specific steps of DEMATEL-ISM model are as follows: Step 1. . Identify system factors and collect data

First, it is necessary to identify the n key factors of the research system, denoted as X 1 , X 2 ,……, X 12 . Then, an expert evaluation form is designed using a 0–4 scale (0 = no influence, 1 = weak influence, 2 = moderate influence, 3 = strong influence, 4 = extremely strong influence) to assess the direct influence between factors. Finally, the expert evaluations are aggregated to construct the direct influence matrix A, where A i j represents the direct influence of factor X i on factor X j .
Step 2. . Normalize the direct impact matrix
After constructing the direct influence matrix, it is necessary to eliminate the influence of dimensionality to ensure the convergence of matrix operations. The original matrix A is normalized by dividing each element by the maximum row sum, resulting in the normalized matrix B . After normalization, the elements of the matrix range between 0 and 1, and the sum of each row does not exceed 1, thereby satisfying the conditions for subsequent matrix inversion. The normalized matrix B can be obtained by Equation (1). (1) B = A max 1 ≤ i ≤ n ( ∑ j = 1 n A i j )

Step 3. . Calculate the total influence matrix
The combined effect of direct and indirect influences is computed through the matrix power series expansion ( C = B + B 2 + B 3 + ⋯ ) . To simplify the computation, matrix inversion is utilized to obtain the total influence matrix C , where the element C i j represents the total influence of X i on X j (including all indirect paths), I is the identity matrix. The total influence matrix C can be obtained by Equation (2). (2) C = B   I − B − 1

Step 4. . Calculate key indicators (influence, centrality, etc.)
By summing the rows of matrix C , the influence degree D i for each factor is obtained, while summing the columns yields the influenced degree R i . Furthermore, the centrality M i (importance) and the causality N i (causal attribute) are calculated. A positive causality value indicates that the factor is a driving factor (cause) in the system, whereas a negative value signifies a dependent factor (effect). (3) D i = ∑ j = 1 n C i j ,   R j = ∑ i = 1 n C i j ,   M i = D i + R i ,   N i = D i − R i

Step 5. . Generate the adjacency matrix
A threshold value λ (e.g., mean, median, or empirical value) is established to transform the continuous total influence matrix E into a binary adjacency matrix, retaining only significant influence relationships (where C i j ≥ λ is set to 1, otherwise 0). Additionally, the selection of the threshold λ requires balancing model complexity with information completeness.
Step 6. . Calculate the reachability matrix
Reflexivity is incorporated into the adjacency matrix E , and the reachability matrix F is derived through transitive closure operations (e.g., Warshall’s algorithm or iterative matrix multiplication). An element F i j = 1 in matrix F indicates the existence of a direct or indirect path from X i to X j , reflecting global reachability. (4) F = E + I k ,   k ≤ n − 1

Step 7. . Hierarchical decomposition
Based on the reachability matrix, the reachable set R ( X i ) , the antecedent set S ( X i ) , and the intersection set T ( X i ) are constructed for each factor. The intersection of R X i and S X i is calculated, and factors with identical elements in the intersection and the reachable set are assigned to the same hierarchical level. Subsequently, the factors at this level are removed, and the process is repeated to determine the hierarchical levels of the remaining factors until all factors in the matrix are eliminated. At this point, all factors are assigned to distinct hierarchical levels, resulting in a structured system hierarchy. (5) R X i = X i | f i j = 1 ,   S X i = X i | f j i = 1 ,   T X i = R X i ∩   S X i

Step 8. . Construct the ISM structural model
The results of the hierarchical decomposition are arranged from the top to the bottom level, and a directed graph is drawn based on the direct influence relationships in the adjacency matrix. In the graph, nodes represent factors, and arrows indicate the direction of influence. This visually illustrates the multi-level hierarchical structure and causal chains of the system, providing decision-makers with intuitive and actionable insights.
3.3. Data Collection Process The data collection process consisted of two stages: factor screening and expert scoring. The first stage refined the preliminary factor list to ensure conceptual clarity and analytical feasibility, while the second stage quantified the direct influence among the retained factors. Before applying DEMATEL, a controlled reduction in factors is necessary because the number of pairwise causal evaluations increases exponentially with the variable count. Prior methodological studies emphasize that DEMATEL becomes difficult to interpret when too many factors create dense causal networks and overlapping causal diagrams [29,89]. Following this guidance, the present study adopted a structured screening procedure to consolidate the factor list before entering the DEMATEL-ISM analysis. A panel of 15 experts was recruited, including senior practitioners from green building enterprises, scholars specializing in sustainable construction management, and knowledge management experts. The panel was deliberately composed to cover the major segments of the green building sector, including design consulting, construction contracting, project supervision, and facility operation. This ensured that the judgment process reflected multiple stages of the project lifecycle. All experts possessed more than ten years of domain experience and were selected to ensure diversity in roles and generational perspectives. In addition, experts were required to have direct experience with intergenerational collaboration or mentoring in project settings, ensuring that their evaluations were grounded in practical IGKT scenarios. This selection strategy aligns with expert elicitation principles recommending heterogeneous yet domain-relevant panels for qualitative judgment tasks [90]. To further ensure reliability, experts’ initial ratings were checked for response completeness and internal consistency before entering the Delphi round.
Factor screening followed three sequential steps. Factor screening followed three sequential steps. First, experts independently rated the relevance and practical significance of the preliminary factors using a 5-point Likert scale. Second, role-based focus group discussions were conducted. Focus groups are widely recognized for their ability to surface shared interpretations and clarify conceptual ambiguities through interactive dialog [82,91]. This step ensured consistent understanding of factor meanings across participants. Third, a Delphi round was implemented to achieve formal consensus. The Delphi method, characterized by anonymity, iteration and controlled feedback, is particularly suitable for refining factor sets in complex decision-making contexts [90,92]. Its structured process minimizes dominance bias, mitigates conformity pressures and yields more stable expert judgments. In this study, experts anonymously reassessed each factor after receiving aggregated feedback, and explicit criteria were applied to eliminate controversial items. A factor was removed if (1) it failed to reach 80% agreement regarding its necessity or practical relevance, (2) experts consistently reported divergent interpretations even after clarification, or (3) it substantially overlapped with another factor and lacked unique analytical value. For example, “organizational structure” did not obtain sufficient consensus, as experts considered it partly embedded within the broader construct of “organizational support climate”, which better reflected the enabling conditions relevant to IGKT in project environments.
In the second stage, a structured questionnaire survey was administered to quantify the direct influence strengths among the 12 factors. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 20 additional experts with substantial experience in green building projects, consistent with purposive sampling principles emphasizing depth over representativeness for expert-based studies [93]. Expert selection criteria included (1) a minimum of ten years of industry experience, (2) involvement in green building project roles, and (3) familiarity with intergenerational collaboration. To strengthen reliability, the sampling frame covered practitioners, designers, consultants and project managers from different sizes and types of green building organizations, ensuring that the direct influence matrix reflected broad industry practice rather than a single sub-sector.
A 0–4 Likert scale was used to measure causal influence intensity between factor pairs. Two rounds of pretesting were conducted to refine wording and ensure face validity, and standardized scoring instructions were provided to reduce interpretation bias. To further address reliability concerns, two consistency checks were implemented: (1) logical consistency screening to identify contradictory or illogical scoring patterns, and (2) cross-review of extreme ratings by two independent researchers. Responses failing these checks were removed and replaced. Anonymized identifiers (E01–E20) were assigned to all questionnaires to avoid social desirability bias. A mixed collection mode was adopted: some experts completed the survey through face-to-face interviews, while others responded via secure online platforms. Two invalid responses were excluded after logical consistency checks, and replacement experts were invited to maintain the target sample size of 20 valid direct influence matrices. Demographic information of the expert respondents is summarized in Table 2.
4. Data Analysis and Results This section presents the empirical results derived from the sequential analytical procedures described in the methodology. It first reports the outcomes of case collection and factor identification, followed by the causal structure revealed through the DEMATEL model, and finally the hierarchical relationships determined by the ISM analysis. Together, these results provide an integrated understanding of how key factors interact to shape IGKT in green building projects.
4.1. Result of Case Collection and Key Factors Identification A total of 37 valid IGKT cases were obtained, representing documented instances of sustainability-related knowledge transfer between senior and junior employees across multiple types of green building projects. These cases spanned residential, commercial, industrial and public-sector projects, and collectively illustrated a wide spectrum of intergenerational exchanges involving green construction technologies, sustainable material selection, energy-efficiency practices, environmental decision-making and regulatory compliance processes. The cases provide concrete evidence of how IGKT occurs in real project environments, highlighting frequent differences in technical experience, sustainability awareness and problem-solving approaches between generations.
Based on the analyzed cases and expert consensus, twelve key factors were identified as the most substantive determinants of IGKT in green building projects. These factors represent the refined set retained after systematic screening and expert evaluation, and they reflect the recurring patterns observed across the 37 cases. The twelve factors are: green knowledge absorption capacity (X1), green knowledge transmission capability (X2), controlled motivation (X3), autonomous motivation (X4), green knowledge distance (X5), intergenerational relationship distance (X6), knowledge complexity (X7), knowledge embeddedness (X8), formal transfer channels (X9), informal transfer channels (X10), digital transformation capacity (X11), and organizational support climate (X12).
These twelve factors constitute the final analytical variable set for the DEMATEL and ISM procedures. They capture the essential subject-level abilities and motivations, relational conditions, characteristics of sustainability knowledge, communication pathways and contextual enablers that were most consistently observed across the 37 IGKT cases and validated by expert judgment.
4.2. Result of the DEMATEL Model Through quantitative processing of the initial data, the direct influence matrix A was derived. Subsequently, following the DEMATEL model procedures, the normalized influence matrix B and the total influence matrix C were sequentially determined. Finally, the influence degree, influenced degree, centrality degree, and cause degree of each factor were calculated, with the results summarized in Table 3. The magnitude of centrality degree reflects the relative importance of each factor in facilitating IGKT in green building projects, with higher values indicating greater significance. Table 3 shows the centrality ranking, i.e., organizational support climate (X12) > green knowledge distance (X6) > green knowledge transmission capability (X2) > green knowledge absorption capacity (X1) > formal transfer channels (X9) > autonomous motivation (X4) > informal transfer channels (X10) > digital transformation capacity (X11) > Intergenerational relationship distance (X6) > Controlled motivation (X3) > Knowledge embeddedness (X8) > Knowledge complexity (X7). Specifically, X12 holds the highest centrality, highlighting its pivotal role in both affecting and being affected by other factors.
The influencing degree indicates the extent to which a factor exerts influence on other factors in the system. For example, X12 has the highest influencing degree (5.255), suggesting it plays a key driving role in the knowledge transfer process. Conversely, X1 has a relatively low influencing degree (3.668), meaning it is more of a receiver than a driver in the system. The influence degree reflects how much a factor is affected by others. The top two influential factors are X2 and X1, indicating they are highly susceptible to external influences and thus represent important outcomes of IGKT.
The cause degree is calculated as the difference between influencing and influenced degrees. A positive cause degree implies a net causal influence (i.e., a driving factor), while a negative value indicates a net result of being influenced. For instance, X7 and X8 have the highest positive cause degrees (1.276), signifying they are fundamental causal variables in the system. On the other hand, X1 and X2 exhibit large negative cause degrees (−1.667 and −1.621, respectively), indicating their roles as outcome variables that rely on upstream support and capability factors.
The mean centrality degree of all factors was calculated as 8.75. This value was introduced to partition the coordinate axes into four quadrants, as illustrated in Figure 3. The x -axis represents centrality degree, while the y -axis denotes cause degree. Cause factors (located above the horizontal line y = 0) directly influence IGKT, whereas result factors (below y = 0) are indirectly influenced by cause factors. The larger the absolute value of the causal degree is, the greater the degree to which the factor affects other factors or is affected by other factors. As shown in Figure 3, seven factors including knowledge complexity (X7), knowledge embeddedness (X8), digital transformation capacity (X11), organizational support climate (X12), informal transfer channels (X10), formal transfer channels (X9), and intergenerational relationship distance (X6) exhibited positive cause degrees, signifying their dominant role as causal factors that exert stronger influences on other factors than they receive. Among the causal factors, X8, X7, X11, and X12 ranked in the top four, indicating that knowledge characteristics and organizational environment (including digital transfer capabilities and organizational support atmosphere) have the greatest impact on other factors. Conversely, X1, X2, X3, X4, and X5 displayed negative cause degrees, classifying them as result factors that are more influenced by external drivers than they contribute. Among the result factors, the result degrees of X1 and X2 ranked first and second, indicating that the knowledge absorption and transmission capabilities are most easily affected by other factors.
4.3. Result of the ISM Model Based on the structural analysis conducted using the ISM approach, the hierarchical relationships among the twelve key IGKT factors were extracted and organized into a multi-level structure. To construct the reachability matrix, a threshold value λ was required to filter out negligible influence values from the total influence matrix. In this study, the threshold λ was set to the mean value of all non-diagonal entries in the total influence matrix, a practice widely adopted in DEMATEL-ISM research because it balances information retention and noise reduction [88,94]. Compared with the median or subjective expert-defined cut-offs, using the mean ensures a more objective and data-driven criterion, allowing weaker and statistically insignificant influence relationships to be removed while preserving the dominant causal structure needed for the ISM hierarchy. This method is particularly suitable for medium-sized factor systems (10–20 variables), where overly strict thresholds may cause excessive information loss, and overly lenient thresholds may produce overly dense networks [89]. After applying this mean-based threshold, the resulting binary adjacency matrix was converted into the final reachability matrix through Boolean operations. Table 4 presents the reachable set, antecedent set and intersection set (R, S and T) for each factor, which form the basis for determining hierarchical levels in the ISM procedure. Using these sets, factors were iteratively assigned to different levels. The resulting hierarchical structure is illustrated in Figure 4.
The system is structured into five layers, with varying degrees of influence and complex causal relationships existing between factors at different levels, including interactions that span across layers. The first layer (L1) comprises surface-level factors, which are typically directly observable and superficial, including green knowledge absorption capacity (X1) and green knowledge transmission capability (X2). These factors have broad reachable sets but are contained in the antecedent sets of most other factors, indicating their high dependence and thus positioning them at the top of the hierarchy. Deep-level factors, which have a fundamental impact on the system, are located at the bottom layer (L5) of the hierarchy and include knowledge complexity (X7), knowledge embeddedness (X8), and digital transformation capacity (X11). They exhibit narrow reachable sets and are not influenced by others, meaning they are foundational drivers in the structure. Intermediate-level factors, which connect surface-level and deep-level factors, are found in the intermediate layers, including autonomous motivation (X4) and knowledge distance (X5) in L2; controlled motivation (X3) and intergenerational relationship distance (X6) in L3; formal transfer channels (X9), informal transfer channels (X10), and organizational support climate (X12) in L4. These layers represent transition nodes, with factors in L2 and L3 gradually transmitting influence from foundational elements to outcome factors, while those in L4 integrate and mediate multiple upstream influences.
5. Discussion This section provides a comprehensive interpretation of the study’s findings and is structured into three subsections to reflect the logical progression from analytical insights to theoretical and practical contributions. First, Section 5.1 presents an in-depth analysis of the 12 key factors, explaining how the DEMATEL-ISM results reveal their roles, interdependencies and hierarchical positions within the IGKT system. This analytical interpretation forms the foundation for broader theoretical reflections. Accordingly, Section 5.2 discusses the theoretical implications by situating the results within existing knowledge-transfer and green construction research, highlighting where the findings align with, extend or diverge from prior studies. Finally, Section 5.3 translates these insights into managerial implications, outlining actionable recommendations for practitioners seeking to strengthen intergenerational sustainability knowledge transfer in green building projects. Together, these three components ensure that the discussion moves beyond reporting results to contextualizing their significance and practical value.
5.1. In-Depth Analysis of the Key Influencing Factors After the identification of 12 key factors affecting IGKT, this study conducted an in-depth analysis using the DEMATEL-ISM method and categorized them into three hierarchical levels: surface-level, intermediate-level, and deep-level factors. This paper will conduct a layered analysis of the operational mechanisms of these factors.
(1) . Analysis of surface-level influencing factors
Green knowledge transmission (X2) and absorption capacity (X1) appear at the surface level and exhibit the highest susceptibility in the system. This indicates that, although these two factors are the most observable indicators of IGKT performance, their functioning is strongly conditioned by deeper organizational, relational and technological determinants. This finding is generally consistent with existing knowledge-transfer literature, which emphasizes that individual knowledge sharing and learning behavior are highly sensitive to contextual cues [11,62]. Previous studies have treated transmission and absorption capacities largely as individual attributes acquired through experience or expertise [7]. However, our analysis reveals a more dependent pattern: both capacities rank extremely low in driving power, suggesting they cannot independently trigger improvement in IGKT effectiveness. This contradicts the assumption in traditional green construction research that enhancing individuals’ technical abilities alone is a sufficiently strong lever for advancing IGKT [66]. Instead, our results show that surface-level capacities reflect outcomes of deeper conditions, particularly organizational support climate (X12) and digital transformation capability (X11). This offers a more systemic explanation for why in many green projects, knowledge-sharing training programs fail to deliver expected results despite considerable investment in skill-based capacity building.
(2) . Analysis of intermediate-level influencing factors
The intermediate-level factors (L2–L4) act as critical bridges linking surface- and deep-level components within green building projects. The L2-level factors include autonomous motivation and green knowledge distance. Green knowledge distance ranks 2nd in centrality, reinforcing existing findings that intergenerational knowledge gaps in technical, digital and experiential domains are major bottlenecks in transfer effectiveness [13,22]. However, compared with prior studies that treat knowledge distance as a static barrier, this study shows that it is moderately influenced by organizational support and digital transformation capability. This expands previous research by demonstrating that digital-organizational interventions can actively narrow generational knowledge gaps, an insight less explored in knowledge-transfer literature. Autonomous motivation also follows prior findings emphasizing the importance of intrinsic motivation for effective sharing [23]. Yet, our results reveal a new mechanism: knowledge complexity and digital maturity significantly affect autonomous motivation, either heightening burdens or enabling streamlined communication. This complements but extends earlier studies that mainly focus on individual psychological drivers [16], by incorporating green project–specific cognitive load and structural conditions.
The L3-level factors include controlled motivation and intergenerational relationship distance. Controlled motivation ranks relatively low in centrality and influencing degree, echoing prior findings that externally driven knowledge sharing often leads to limited long-term engagement [56,58]. However, our results provide new nuance: in green building contexts, where compliance pressures and sustainability KPIs are common, controlled motivation still contributes, but only when supported by strong transfer channels. Intergenerational relationship distance aligns with previous research showing that relational trust and familiarity strongly influence willingness to share [7]. However, this study additionally indicates that digital collaboration platforms such as sustainability-focused project management systems can reduce relationship distance, a factor rarely discussed in the IGKT literature.
(3) . Analysis of deep-level influencing factors in green building projects
Deep-level factors exhibit relatively low centrality (ranked 8th–12th) but high cause degree, particularly digital transformation capability (3rd) and green knowledge embeddedness (2nd), signifying their critical catalytic roles despite weaker structural connectivity. Green knowledge complexity ranks low in centrality but mid-range in influence, indicating its role as a structural constraint. High complexity directly increases the cognitive burden of interpreting sustainability-related knowledge and indirectly reduces the efficiency of formal and informal transfer channels. This result aligns with previous findings that complex technical or process-related knowledge in sustainable construction is more difficult for younger staff to internalize without additional scaffolding [2]. When task-specific sustainability knowledge becomes overly intricate or tacit, it weakens both autonomous motivation (L2) and the effectiveness of communication channels (L4), thereby restricting IGKT.

High complexity directly increases the cognitive burden of interpreting sustainability-related knowledge and indirectly reduces the efficiency of formal and informal transfer channels.

When task-specific sustainability knowledge becomes overly intricate or tacit, it weakens both autonomous motivation (L2) and the effectiveness of communication channels (L4), thereby restricting IGKT. Digital transformation capability ranks 2nd in influence, demonstrating the strongest driving effect among all deep-level variables. While existing studies recognize its role in supporting knowledge processes [79,80], this study uncovers a dual mechanism in which technological empowerment reduces knowledge and relational distances, and institutional reconstruction reshapes the climate, expectations and communication patterns within project teams. This dual effect highlights digital transformation as not only a tool-level facilitator but also a deep structural force reshaping IGKT dynamics in green building environments.
5.2. Theoretical Implications This research offers several key insights into theoretical frameworks. First, this research reconstructs and enriches the multi-dimensional system of IGKT. Previous studies predominantly examine isolated factors such as individual motivation, digital tools or organizational climate [9,10,11,37], often lacking an integrated theoretical model. Consistent with these prior works, our results confirm the importance of individual capability and motivational factors; however, the five-dimensional “subject-relationship-object-channel-context” framework developed in this study offers a more systematic and theoretically grounded lens for understanding IGKT in green building settings. This confirms our expectation that IGKT in sustainability-oriented projects involves multiple interacting layers rather than single-factor influences. By synthesizing literature and empirical case insights, twelve key factors are identified, providing a theoretical structure that captures the multi-level nature of intergenerational sustainability knowledge transfer.
Second, the DEMATEL-ISM results contribute new insights into the hierarchical mechanisms shaping IGKT. It was expected, based on prior research, that organizational support environments would play a substantial role [22,23]. The analysis confirms this expectation: organizational support climate emerges as the most central and influential factor, reinforcing the notion that institutionalized support is essential in intergenerational exchanges. However, an unexpected finding of this study is that surface-level capacities, namely green knowledge transmission and absorption, exert minimal independent influence and instead function primarily as outcomes shaped by deeper contextual and structural drivers. This differs from earlier studies that treat these capacities as primary determinants of IGKT effectiveness [7,11,62]. Our results show that these capacities are highly susceptible to the quality of transfer channels, motivational conditions and digital collaboration tools, suggesting that ability formation is situational rather than static. This finding broadens existing theory by positioning knowledge capacities as adaptive rather than intrinsic attributes.
Third, this research deepens theoretical understanding of digital transformation’s role in IGKT. Prior literature mainly regards digital tools as facilitators that streamline knowledge exchange [78,79,80]. While our results confirm this enabling role, they also reveal an unexpected dual mechanism: digital transformation reshapes not only technological pathways but also the institutional and motivational conditions under which IGKT occurs. Specifically, digital transformation capability simultaneously enhances technological empowerment and contributes to institutional reconstruction by influencing norms, expectations and perceived support within temporary project organizations. This extends the theoretical conversation beyond technological determinism and highlights digital transformation as a deeper systemic catalyst that shapes IGKT behaviors, structures and climates across project-based green building environments.
Overall, the theoretical novelty of this research lies in uncovering multi-level dependencies and revealing that several widely assumed “primary” determinants, such as individual knowledge capacities, are in fact derivative outcomes shaped by deeper organizational and technological forces. These insights refine existing theories of IGKT by demonstrating that sustainable knowledge transfer in green building projects is not merely a behavioral or cognitive process but an embedded, context-dependent system shaped by layered structural conditions.
5.3. Managerial Implications This research offers a range of managerial implications to facilitate IGKT from older to younger employees within green building projects, which mainly includes four levels: (1) Accurately identifying the core role of the organizational support climate. The findings indicate that the support climate within project teams ranks first in both centrality and impact, highlighting its overarching influence on the knowledge transfer system. On the one hand, project leadership can establish targeted knowledge-sharing incentive mechanisms, integrating IGKT indicators into performance reviews or team evaluations. On the other hand, project teams can foster a more open and collaborative working atmosphere by organizing intergenerational exchange activities related to green building themes (e.g., low-carbon construction mentoring, joint sustainability-focused tasks) to reduce generational barriers and improve cohesion on site; (2) Recognizing the strategic value of digital transformation capability to promote integration between technology and on-site project knowledge. Although digital transformation capability is positioned at a deeper systemic level (L5), its high impact ranking (second place) suggests it plays a strong driving role and exhibits high independence within the system. Project teams can introduce and apply various digital tools (e.g., green BIM systems, smart energy monitoring dashboards, cloud platforms for sustainable material tracking) to externalize and visualize senior employees’ tacit knowledge. These tools can help overcome the spatial and temporal constraints of green building projects, enabling younger staff to access critical insights even outside of direct supervision; (3) Optimizing knowledge transfer channels to enhance the effectiveness of intergenerational project communication. The study reveals that both formal and informal channels significantly mediate IGKT at the project level. This suggests that project managers can further standardize formal knowledge transfer mechanisms such as sustainability design reviews, energy-efficiency report discussions, and digital tracking of green construction processes. Simultaneously, they should support informal interaction channels, including eco-site walkthroughs, hands-on learning during the installation of green systems, and experience sharing during sustainable practice demonstrations, to create multidimensional and fluid IGKT pathways; (4) Developing targeted personnel strategies to strengthen knowledge synergy within project teams. The study finds that while knowledge transmission and absorption capacities are located at the surface level, they exhibit the highest susceptibility to influence (ranking first and second, respectively). This implies that project leaders can adopt targeted talent development strategies, such as assigning senior staff to guide green practice implementation, conducting simulation drills for sustainable construction, and creating structured learning opportunities around low-impact construction methods. Enhancing younger employees’ knowledge absorption skills and strengthening older professionals’ ability to articulate their sustainability expertise can significantly improve IGKT efficiency. In addition, incorporating motivational incentives into green project team management can further bridge generational knowledge gaps and foster seamless collaboration in environmentally driven, time-sensitive building environments.
6. Conclusions This study systematically analyzed the critical influencing factors of IGKT from older to younger employees in green building projects by integrating the DEMATEL-ISM approach, revealing their hierarchical structure and interaction mechanisms. The findings are summarized as follows: 12 key factors affecting IGKT were systematically identified from five dimensions: transfer subjects, inter-subject relationships, transfer objects, transfer channels, and transfer context. These include knowledge absorption capacity, knowledge transmission capability, controlled motivation, autonomous motivation, green knowledge distance, intergenerational relationship distance, knowledge complexity, knowledge embeddedness, formal transfer channels, informal transfer channels, digital transformation capacity, and organizational support climate.
Organizational support climate ranks first in centrality and second in influence, confirming its role as the core systemic driver of IGKT. Digital transformation capacity ranks third in influence, indicating that although it is not the strongest driver, it remains a critical deep-level factor that substantially shapes transfer channels, reduces knowledge distance and enhances overall knowledge-flow efficiency. Together, these two factors form a complementary “environment–technology” foundation that underpins effective IGKT in green building projects.
Hierarchically, surface-level factors (i.e., knowledge absorption and transmission capability) exhibited moderate centrality but high susceptibility to influence, suggesting their dependency on deeper-level drivers; intermediate-layer factors (e.g., autonomous motivation and knowledge distance) acted as bridges by mediating inter-subject interactions; deep-layer factors (e.g., knowledge complexity and embeddedness), despite low centrality, emerged as long-term constraints due to their inherent knowledge barriers. By integrating communication theory with hierarchical analysis, this study expands the dynamic framework of IGKT and validates the pivotal roles of the organizational environment and technological capabilities. Practically, it is recommended that green building teams prioritize fostering a supportive organizational culture, accelerate digital transformation, and leverage informal channels to complement formal mechanisms. Additionally, efforts should focus on stimulating senior employees’ autonomous motivation and optimizing knowledge distance to mitigate intergenerational transfer resistance.

There are still certain limitations in this research that warrant further refinement in future work. First the DEMATEL-ISM method primarily explores the interactions and hierarchical relationships among factors but fails to quantify the impact of each factor on the effectiveness of IGKT, making it difficult to provide quantitative optimization recommendations. Future research can integrate methods such as the structural equation modeling (SEM) or Bayesian networks to further quantify the influence of these factors and enhance the precision of the analysis. Furthermore, this study mainly adopts a static analysis approach and does not fully account for the dynamic evolution of the knowledge transfer process. Future research could incorporate system dynamics (SD) or other dynamic simulation methods to develop time-evolution models and explore the long-term evolution of IGKT.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Forests play a key role in achieving the objectives of the European Green Deal due to their multifunctional role. They provide multiple ecosystem services, such as soil formation, nutrient cycling, provisioning of timber, food, and water, climate regulation, and flood control, while also being of central importance for biodiversity conservation (Brockerhoff et al. 2017). However, insect and pathogen pests increasingly threaten forests, alone or after abiotic disturbances such as drought, fire, and storms (Romagnoli et al. 2023). Among pests, invasive alien species are of great concern because they can have a strong impact on forest biodiversity and economy, and many efforts are being made to regulate them in the EU (Ghelardini et al. 2017). In addition, several native pests are expanding their range because of climate change and are called emerging pest species (Jactel et al. 2019; Simler-Williamson et al. 2019). Research is therefore essential to support early detection of emerging and invasive pests, monitor their spread, and inform phytosanitary measures that can prevent or mitigate their impacts. In this context, the Horizon 2020 project HOMED (HOlistic Management of Emerging forest pests and Diseases), coordinated by Hervé Jactel from the National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (France), developed a holistic and multi-actor approach to develop tools and methods for the management of emerging native and non-native pests threatening European forests, focusing on all phases of invasion, from prevention to surveillance to eradication and control. The project also broadened the definition of "forest health", including trees not only in forests, but also in nurseries, urban and rural areas, owing to the key epidemiological role of these components. The major outputs of the project are synthesised in a special issue of the journal NeoBiota, and include a participatory tool for reporting forest damage data (Silvalert), improved multi-funnel traps with generic pheromone attractants (Santoiemma et al. 2024), pioneering studies on pest detection using remote sensing (Nardi et al. 2023), and sustained stakeholder engagement through six targeted policy briefs. Importantly, HOMED underscored the need for interdisciplinary collaboration across forest entomology and pathology, economics, and social sciences, and highlighted the priority of developing innovative tools for the early detection and eradication of pests. Building on this foundation, the Horizon Europe project FORSAID (FORest Surveillance with Artificial Intelligence and Digital technologies), coordinated by Andrea Battisti from the University of Padova (Italy), continues and expands HOMED's legacy. FORSAID focuses on designing a comprehensive and technologically advanced framework for the early detection and surveillance of EU-regulated forest pests, integrating a wide range of innovative tools, including satellite- and drone-based remote sensing, smart traps with automatic monitoring capacity, robotic devices for rapid insect identification, environmental DNA methods for early pest detection, and citizen science approaches supported by mobile applications. Stakeholder engagement is central to this process, ensuring that research outputs are aligned with end-user needs and can be effectively implemented in practice. The project aims to integrate these methods into a coherent and operational monitoring and assessment system for regulated pests, thereby supporting the development of a novel pan-European strategy for forest pest management. FORSAID also ensures continuity and knowledge transfer from HOMED. For example, data on pest distribution collected in HOMED through Silvalert now serves as a baseline for FORSAID remote sensing activities. Generic attractants validated globally in HOMED are being incorporated into next-generation smart traps. Lastly, stakeholder surveys from HOMED provide direct input into FORSAID's research agenda. By maintaining and extending these outputs, FORSAID exemplifies how scientific legacies can be consolidated and advanced across projects. Together, HOMED and FORSAID demonstrate the value of sustained research, innovation, and cross-disciplinary collaboration in forest health management, and their combined contributions highlight the importance of open data, participatory science, and stakeholder-driven approaches in building robust strategies against emerging forest pests.

Abstract: This study presents the e[kent-im] model, a map-based crowdsourcing initiative that digitizes and safeguards urban memory and cultural heritage through community participation and digital tools. The model facilitates the collection, archiving, and dissemination of urban memories by fostering intergenerational knowledge transfer and encouraging civic engagement in heritage preservation. Implemented in the historical center of Kütahya/Türkiye, the project gathered 150 memories and stories from 12 senior participants aged 50–85, which were linked to 303 historical visuals sourced from personal archives. These materials were integrated into a custom-designed web and mobile interface (Mapotic Pro) enriched with metadata categories such as type, period, and location, enabling users to filter and navigate content effectively and watch the videos enriched with participant narratives. A digital city archive matrix was also developed to systematically organize the collected data and support the web-based platform. To assess the platform’s effectiveness, a pilot study with 15 young participants aged 18–28 was conducted. During a self-guided city tour, participants engaged with historical content on the platform and provided feedback through pre- and post-test evaluations. Results indicated heightened awareness of and interest in cultural heritage, demonstrating the model’s potential as both an interactive archive and a tool facilitating intergenerational heritage awareness. Overall, this study highlights the model’s adaptability, scalability, and capacity to bridge generational and technological divides.

Full text: 1. Introduction In the transmission of urban cultural heritage and memory, crowdsourcing emerges as a critical method for understanding the dynamic and multilayered nature of cities and societal memory. A city is composed of diverse elements—streets, alleys, monumental structures, original textures, and public spaces—that function and evolve like a living organism. Given their constantly changing and complex structures, cities require analysis from a broad perspective and diverse descriptive approaches that reflect their versatility [1]. Every trace within the city, whether inherent or later added, evokes memories of the past, stimulates curiosity about forgotten places, and fosters a desire to learn [2]. Streets and residential architecture that developed over time, together with structures from various historical periods—such as inns, baths, mosques, churches, castles, and cemeteries—constitute integral components of urban memory. The names and symbolic associations of these structures further reinforce collective remembrance.
Individual memories, shaped by personal experiences or past events, are transmitted through oral narratives, cultural processes, or personal research [2]. Yet, physical characteristics alone cannot define urban memory. Rather, collective memory emerges from citizens’ stories and recollections, which imbue the city with symbolic meaning. In this context, urban memory and cultural heritage crowd-mapping applications have been identified as effective tools for strengthening collective memory and safeguarding cultural heritage [3]. Such applications revitalize connections between individuals and their past, making heritage more visible and accessible. They not only facilitate the transfer of cultural knowledge but also enhance communities’ sense of ownership and engagement with heritage assets [4,5]. By enabling intergenerational knowledge exchange, participatory heritage platforms enrich social memory and reinforce the bridge between past and present [6].
The preservation and digitization of cultural heritage have long been emphasized in international conventions and scholarly debates. Venice Charter (1964) [7,8] highlighted the need to safeguard both the tangible and intangible values of heritage. Meanwhile, digital technologies have since become powerful instruments in this process [9]. Recent studies underline the role of digital tools in ensuring the sustainability of heritage and raising societal awareness [10,11].
Urban memory, nourished by both individual and collective memory, encompasses a city’s past, cultural heritage, and shared experiences [12,13]. Its multidimensional nature enables it to serve as a bridge between the past and the future, integrating historical, physical, and cultural elements [1,2]. The physical fabric of cities thereby materializes collective memory, reinforcing the preservation and transmission of cultural heritage [14].
Within this perspective, this study aims to develop a digital urban memory transfer model, called e[kent-im], to investigate its benefits for cultural heritage. The model uses crowdsourcing to collect historical photos, images, and spoken and written knowledge to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from elderly urban residents to younger generations. This research focuses on the historical city center of Kütahya as a case study to support digital memory transfer processes. This research investigates the progressive loss of urban memory and intangible heritage in Kütahya, where oral histories and spatial knowledge are not systematically recorded or archived. The research question guiding this study is as follows: how can a map-based crowdsourcing model support the documentation, transmission, and public accessibility of urban memory across generations? Therefore, two hypotheses are generated: (i) integrating tangible heritage (archival visuals and spatial data) with intangible heritage (oral narratives) through a map-based digital platform will significantly enhance users’ understanding and awareness of urban cultural heritage, and (ii) exposure to intergenerational memory transfer—specifically, narratives provided by elderly residents—will produce a measurable positive shift in young participants’ engagement, curiosity, and learning outcomes related to urban cultural heritage.
2. Theoretical Background on Urban Memory, Crowdsourcing and Digital Storytelling Recent scholarship in cultural heritage and urban studies increasingly emphasizes the need to understand urban memory as a dynamic, participatory, and digitally mediated process shaped by everyday practices, spatial experience, and collective narratives. As historic urban environments face growing pressures from tourism-driven transformation and commercialization, researchers have turned to digital tools, crowdsourcing practices, and storytelling platforms to capture, preserve, and disseminate diverse memories of place. Within this context, urban memory is no longer confined to static representations or expert-driven archives, but is increasingly constructed through community participation, user-generated content, and interactive digital environments. However, despite the expanding body of research on participatory heritage, digital storytelling, and crowdsourcing technologies, existing studies often treat these dimensions in isolation, offering limited insight into how they can be systematically integrated to support long-term preservation of urban memory, intergenerational knowledge transfer, and meaningful spatial engagement. In this context, the related literature is discussed across three interrelated dimensions—urban memory, crowdsourcing, and digital storytelling—to frame the conceptual and methodological foundations of the study (Table 1).
Urban memory literature emphasizes the close relationship between everyday spatial practices, collective memory, and the lived experience of place. One study [15] demonstrates this relationship in Misi Village by revealing a clear divergence between tourists’ commerce-driven spatial perceptions and residents’ efforts to sustain urban memory through daily life and traditional practices, highlighting how tourism-oriented transformations risk fragmenting urban memory. Complementing this perspective, ref. [16] underlines the growing role of online narrative applications and social media integrations in preserving historic urban landscapes, suggesting that digital environments can act as alternative memory carriers beyond physical space. Similarly, ref. [17] stresses the importance of crowd participation in archeology and heritage projects, arguing that involving broader segments of society enables more diverse and plural narratives of place to emerge. While these studies collectively underscore the significance of participatory and digitally mediated approaches for sustaining urban memory, they largely focus on either narrative diversification or representational practices, offering limited insight into how structured, map-based digital systems can systematically archive, organize, and transmit urban memory across generations.
Crowdsourcing research on cultural heritage has primarily concentrated on platform design, metadata enrichment, and user engagement strategies. One critical study [18] proposes a criteria-based evaluation framework for crowdsourcing applications that integrates digital storytelling and geotagging, revealing strong public interest in participatory heritage storytelling while also exposing gaps between user expectations and actual engagement. Similarly, ref. [19] addresses the challenge of poor metadata quality in digital heritage platforms by introducing a personalized image annotation recommendation system, emphasizing the role of user-centered design in improving both data quality and participation. Map-based crowdsourcing platforms such as Kbhbilleder.dk further illustrate how spatial interfaces enable users to contribute historical photographs and metadata, primarily driven by personal identity, local history, and community belonging, in the context of Copenhagen City Archive [6]. In parallel, ecosystem-based approaches such as Crowd Heritage aim to combine human and automated enrichment processes to enhance metadata quality at scale [20]. Other studies focus on system reliability, usability, and participation, including mobile crowdsourcing for shared memory management [5] and community-driven sound heritage archives [21]. Despite these advances, much of the literature prioritizes technical enrichment and participation metrics, paying comparatively less attention to how crowdsourced content can serve as an intergenerational urban memory archive embedded within everyday spatial experience.
Digital storytelling scholarship has the potential to support community archives, participation, and intangible cultural heritage. The MNEMOSCOPE model exemplifies this by enabling users to digitally create and visualize collective memories, thereby enriching community archives and encouraging sharing [22]. Gamification and motivational design principles have also been shown to play a critical role in sustaining participation in mobile crowdsourced heritage applications [23]. Other studies focus on social and experiential dimensions of storytelling, such as the impact of digital storytelling environments on older adults’ sense of loneliness [24], and the democratic and participatory production of cultural content through platforms like izTRAVELSicilia [25]. While these works confirm the effectiveness of digital storytelling in engagement and social inclusion, they often treat storytelling as an isolated narrative layer rather than as part of a spatially structured, map-based system that integrates memory, place, and intergenerational knowledge transfer.
Taken together, the literature reveals a fragmented landscape in which urban memory, crowdsourcing, and digital storytelling are frequently addressed as parallel or partially overlapping domains. Existing studies demonstrate the value of participation, digital narration, and spatial interfaces, yet they fall short of offering integrated models that systematically combine map-based crowdsourcing, structured digital archiving, and intergenerational knowledge transfer within a single urban memory framework. This gap underscores the significance of our study, which positions urban memory not only as content to be collected or narrated, but as a digitally mediated, spatially organized, and socially sustained process.
3. Materials and Methods The e[kent-im] digital urban memory transmission model was developed using a multi-layered methodological framework consisting of four main stages: design, crowdsourcing, experience, and evaluation. Each stage was carefully structured to integrate archival research, senior community participation, digital mapping, and user-centered evaluation, ultimately aiming to safeguard and transmit cultural heritage and urban memory in a participatory and sustainable manner (Figure 1).
First, in the design phase, the primary objective was to establish the digital infrastructure and compile the visual and textual materials that comprise the archive’s core. A map-based platform, Mapotic Pro (Czech Republic) was selected to accommodate diverse data types, and enable spatial exploration and user interaction. Archival research played a central role in this stage: historical photographs, drawings, and documents were collected from libraries, institutional and personal archives, and published material. These materials were digitized in high resolution, cataloged, and enriched with contextual descriptions. Each visual item was then categorized by type and geolocated when possible, forming the foundation of the digital city archive matrix that organizes the material in a searchable, structured format.
The second phase, crowdsourcing, focused on gathering oral narratives and lived experiences from senior participants with first-hand knowledge of the city’s cultural and urban past. Participants were presented with visual materials to prompt memory recall, leading to the narration of stories, personal memories, and local traditions. These oral contributions were recorded, transcribed, and coded according to narrative type, theme, and associated visual material. When locations were uncertain, participants provided spatial clues that helped geolocate historical photographs, making them active contributors in reconstructing lost or transformed urban elements. The integration of oral, visual, and written data created a multimodal repository that captured both tangible and intangible heritage.
To evaluate this platform, during the experience phase, 15 young participants (aged 18–25) used the digital interface during self-guided walks in the historical center of Kütahya. The platform allowed users to navigate mapped content, explore thematic routes, and engage with photographs and narratives associated with specific locations. This hybrid interaction model, combining in situ exploration with digital storytelling, enabled participants to develop a deeper and more situated understanding of the city’s historical layers. Pre- and post-test evaluations were conducted via a comparative analysis. Overall, the four-phase methodology demonstrated the potential of map-based crowdsourcing to preserve, enrich, and transmit urban memory in a participatory and accessible manner (Figure 2).
4. Results The case study of the study has been conducted in the historical city center of Kütahya/Türkiye, a city deeply layered with the legacies of multiple civilizations, including Phrygians, Romans, Byzantines, Seljuks, Germiyanids, and Ottomans. Kütahya, a historic city in Mid Anatolia, was chosen as the pilot site due to its wealth of surviving cultural assets, its layered urban morphology, and the availability of diverse historical documents and community memories.
In this respect, the project extends beyond creating a repository; it develops a participatory digital heritage ecosystem, which fosters civic engagement, cultural continuity, and new practices of heritage consumption and co-production. The results of the e[kent-im] model case study are outlined below:
4.1. Design Phase As it was detailed in the methodology section, in the first design phase, a map-based interface was developed to integrate multiple data types (visual, oral, and textual). Archival research was conducted in libraries, institutional archives, private collections, and even social media platforms. A substantial visual repository was compiled, including more than 1300 paintings by Ahmet Yakupoglu, painter, who meticulously documented the urban fabric of Kütahya throughout the twentieth century. These were supplemented by historical photographs, ranging from black-and-white images from the late 19th century to color photographs from the mid-20th century (Figure 3).
Each visual was carefully indexed with metadata, including title, creator, date, source, and location. Where possible, lost or transformed urban elements (such as demolished mosques, hamams, or commercial buildings) were geolocated on the map, enabling a comparative reading of urban change.
The digital interface of the e[kent-im] model was designed for both web and mobile access, ensuring accessibility for users across groups. The entry page displayed a map marked with the locations of collected content, accompanied by a side panel providing project information, metadata, and the latest updates. Categories—such as photographs, drawings, memories, stories, and routes—were clearly structured and filterable, allowing users to navigate the content effectively (Figure 4). The platform can be reached via [27].
4.2. Crowdsourcing Phase As for the senior participant group, in-depth oral history interviews were conducted with 12 people (aged 50–85). Participants were randomly approached within the local community, without the intention of forming a statistically representative sample, as the primary objective was conceptual and spatial mapping of urban memory rather than demographic generalization. Gender balance was intentionally considered, and participants were selected from everyday local roles, including male shopkeepers and female housewives, to reflect lived urban practices. Each interview lasted between 1 and 2 h and was conducted using historical photographs and images integrated into the e[kent-im] platform to stimulate memory recall and narrative production.
Oral narratives were recorded, edited, and categorized into three types: memories, stories, and independent narratives. In total, 150 oral narratives were collected, with women generally contributing more stories than men. These narratives covered a wide spectrum of urban life: architecture; neighborhood relations; religious practices; commercial spaces; everyday rituals; and intangible traditions such as weddings, circumcisions, folk songs, and seasonal festivities (Figure 5).
Narratives were transformed into short videos by embedding audio recordings with relevant visuals. These were then uploaded to YouTube and integrated into the e[kent-im] platform via embedding tools.
The collected visual and narrative data were integrated into a custom-designed web-based interface and systematically organized using a Digital City Archive Matrix (Table S1), in which both tangible and intangible heritage layers were categorized, tagged, and structured using metadata parameters. This phase prioritized depth, richness, and narrative diversity over participant quantity, in line with qualitative heritage research practices. The sample coding of this archive is shown in Figure 6, visual and verbal metadata code are used to create visual and verbal codes for each item.
4.3. Experience and Evaluation Phases The experience phase focused on enabling young participants (15 person, aged 18–28) to explore the digital archive through interactive and situated engagement with the urban environment. Participant selection did not aim for statistical randomness or representativeness, as the study follows a qualitative, exploratory research design. Instead, a maximum variation approach was adopted to capture diverse lived experiences of urban memory. Among older participants, diversity was ensured through everyday social roles (e.g., local shopkeepers and homemakers), gender balance, and long-term residency in the historical center, rather than formal educational or socioeconomic classification. For the younger group, participants included both locals and non-local visitors, enabling the exploration of different levels of familiarity with the city. This approach was intentionally chosen to minimize selective bias at the experiential level and to support context-sensitive and analytically generalizable findings.
Within the scope of the study, several walking routes were defined in the historic city center of Kütahya (Figure 7). These routes were designed to include key locations that best represent the city’s historical narrative and intersect with points where archival data were available within the e[kent-im] interface. The selected routes were subsequently integrated into the digital map of the platform. They were instructed to focus on observing, learning about, and experiencing the urban environment during the walk. No navigational directions were provided along the route.
Following the completion of the walk, participants were asked to sit in an indoor setting and respond to the first set of survey questions based solely on the knowledge and impressions they had acquired during the physical exploration of the city. After completing the pre-test evaluation, participants were then invited to explore the same routes digitally through the interface. At this stage, they examined historical visual materials and oral narratives provided by senior participants, allowing them to access layers of urban memory not immediately visible during the walk. Based on this additional digital engagement, participants completed post-test evaluations and in-depth interviews were recorded for open-ended questions.
Throughout the walking phase, participants were observed unobtrusively. Each session lasted approximately 1.5–2 h. They were allowed to stop, examine locations of interest, and enter spaces freely, without any form of intervention by the researchers. At the end of the route, participants used their mobile devices in an appropriate indoor environment to further explore the interface and complete the survey process.
For the evaluation phase, data were collected using semi-structured pre- and post-test questions (Table S2) designed to explore changes in participants’ awareness, perceptions, and engagement with urban memory after interacting with the platform. Although the initial research plan aimed to include a larger group, practical constraints related to time, budget, and site conditions necessitated a smaller sample, which remains methodologically appropriate for a qualitative pilot study.
The comparison conducted after the pilot walks confirmed that digital heritage tools can foster intergenerational dialog and increase the accessibility of urban history. Furthermore, the integration of crowdsourced oral narratives enriched the archival materials, bridging the gap between formal history and lived experiences (Table 2) (also see Table S3).
5. Discussion The discussion of findings highlights the critical role of digitally mediated storytelling in enhancing young users’ engagement with urban and cultural heritage. One of the most prominent outcomes of the study was the heightened appreciation for intergenerational knowledge transfer. Following the interaction with the e[kent-im] interface, 14 out of 15 young participants explicitly acknowledged the importance of oral narratives in transmitting cultural memory across generations. This finding underscores the value of integrating lived experiences and personal memories of senior residents into digital heritage platforms, particularly for audiences who may otherwise remain detached from intangible cultural dimensions.
Feedback from senior participants further reinforces this observation. Their expressed sense of pride in contributing to the preservation of urban memory suggests that the platform functioned not only as a tool for knowledge dissemination but also as a medium for social recognition and inclusion. This reciprocal dynamic—where younger participants gain cultural awareness while older residents actively participate in heritage narration—points to the potential of digital platforms to bridge generational gaps within urban memory practices.
The pre- and post-test evaluations conducted with young participants revealed statistically meaningful developments across four primary categories: (i) knowledge of urban and cultural heritage, (ii) topic-specific knowledge, (iii) need for a city guide, and (iv) touristic walk experience based on verbal data. In terms of general knowledge of urban and cultural heritage, all participants reported an increased understanding of Kütahya’s architectural past and historical structures after engaging with the platform. This indicates that the integration of spatially anchored digital content effectively supports learning processes that go beyond conventional, text-based heritage communication.
Improvements in topic-specific knowledge further demonstrate the impact of multimodal storytelling. Participants emphasized that listening to the oral histories of senior participants significantly contributed to their understanding of Kütahya’s architectural history, traditions, customs, and urban development. The combination of historical photographs, visual materials, and personal narratives enabled users to contextualize urban change over time. As one participant noted, encountering unfamiliar historical states of streets and buildings during the walk, supported by visual and narrative layers, facilitated immediate comprehension and deeper engagement. These findings suggest that visual–verbal juxtaposition strengthens cognitive connections between place, memory, and historical interpretation.
Another notable outcome concerns the perceived need for a city guide. Participants increasingly regarded the e[kent-im] interface as a functional and informative guide during touristic walks. The location-based presentation of data allowed users to progress freely along routes while receiving contextual information at relevant points. This reinforces the idea that digital heritage interfaces can substitute or complement traditional guided tours by offering autonomy without sacrificing informational depth. Suggestions emphasizing greater flexibility within routes and improved location-based triggering further support this interpretation.
The category of touristic walk experience, evaluated through verbal data, revealed a strong preference for oral narratives over written content during in situ exploration. While elderly residents’ spoken stories were reported to have a high impact on learning and engagement, written materials were considered less practical during walking activities. This distinction highlights the importance of designing heritage interfaces that align with embodied and mobile user experiences, favoring auditory and visual content over extensive textual information in outdoor contexts.
Participants’ suggestions for future development further illuminate the platform’s broader potential. Proposed enhancements included transforming walking routes into narrated video experiences for users unable to physically visit the city, as well as strengthening visual comparison through the systematic use of past–present photographic pairs. These recommendations indicate that digital urban memory platforms can extend beyond on-site experiences and reach wider audiences, including tourists, students, and remote users.
From an educational perspective, the findings point to significant applicability within formal learning environments. One participant noted that video-based content already attracts student attention in secondary education and suggested that the e[kent-im] videos could be integrated into school curricula to introduce Kütahya’s urban history. This observation aligns with broader discussions on experiential and media-based learning, suggesting that digital heritage platforms may serve as effective pedagogical tools.
Overall, the discussion demonstrates that digitally supported urban memory platforms such as e[kent-im] possess strong potential across tourism, education, and cultural sectors. By combining spatial exploration, oral histories, and visual storytelling, the platform supports meaningful engagement with heritage while fostering intergenerational dialogue. These findings suggest that future studies should further explore mobile application development, automated location-based content delivery, and expanded audiovisual narratives to enhance accessibility and user experience.
6. Conclusions This study set out to investigate how a map-based crowdsourcing model can support the documentation, transmission, and public accessibility of urban memory across generations. In response to this problem statement, two hypotheses were proposed: first, that integrating tangible heritage elements—such as archival visuals and spatial data—with intangible heritage in the form of oral narratives within a digital, map-based platform would significantly enhance users’ understanding and awareness of urban cultural heritage; and second, that exposure to intergenerational memory transfer, particularly through narratives provided by elderly residents, would generate a measurable positive shift in young participants’ engagement, curiosity, and learning outcomes related to urban heritage.
The findings of the study strongly support both hypotheses. Results from the experience phase and the pre- and post-test evaluations demonstrate that the e[kent-im] platform effectively enhanced young users’ knowledge of Kütahya’s urban and cultural heritage, deepened topic-specific understanding, and transformed their perception of digital tools as functional alternatives to traditional city guides. Most notably, the integration of oral histories significantly increased participants’ awareness of the value of intergenerational knowledge transfer, confirming that intangible heritage—when spatially anchored and digitally mediated—plays a critical role in shaping meaningful urban memory experiences.
When positioned within the existing literature, the contribution of this study becomes clearer. Urban memory research emphasizes the relationship between everyday spatial practices and collective memory, while also highlighting the risk of fragmentation caused by tourism-driven transformations [15]. Parallel studies point to the growing role of digital narratives and participatory platforms in preserving urban memory beyond physical space [16,17]. Map-based crowdsourcing initiatives such as Kbhbilleder.dk demonstrate the potential of spatial interfaces to support the contribution of local historical knowledge [26], and digital storytelling models like MNEMOSCOPE confirm the value of narrative-based approaches in enriching collective memory [22]. Nevertheless, existing studies largely address these themes separately, offering limited insight into integrated, map-based systems that systematically combine tangible and intangible heritage with intergenerational knowledge transfer embedded in everyday spatial experience. This study addresses this gap by proposing a spatially structured, participatory model for sustaining urban memory across generations.
By contrast, this study demonstrates how a spatially organized, map-based digital platform can function simultaneously as an urban memory archive, an experiential learning environment, and a participatory storytelling system. The e[kent-im] model moves beyond treating memory as static content to be collected or displayed; instead, it conceptualizes urban memory as a dynamic, socially sustained process embedded within everyday spatial experience. The inclusion of elderly residents as active contributors further extends the scope of digital heritage research by foregrounding intergenerational dialogue as a core component of cultural sustainability.
Despite these contributions, several limitations should be acknowledged. The study was conducted with a relatively small participant group and focused on a single historic urban context. While this allowed for in-depth qualitative and experiential analysis, future research would benefit from expanding the platform to larger and more diverse user groups, as well as applying the model to different cities with varying cultural and spatial characteristics. Additionally, the development of a fully mobile application with automated location-based content delivery, enriched audiovisual narratives, and remote-access features—such as narrated video routes—could significantly enhance accessibility and user engagement.
In conclusion, this research demonstrates that map-based crowdsourcing platforms integrating tangible and intangible heritage hold substantial potential for sustaining urban memory across generations. By combining spatial exploration, digital storytelling, and participatory knowledge production, e[kent-im] offers a scalable and adaptable framework applicable to tourism, education, and cultural institutions. The study contributes to ongoing discussions in digital heritage and urban memory by proposing an integrated model that not only preserves the past but actively reactivates it through contemporary, socially inclusive digital practices.

Abstract: Introduction: This study employs the Job–Demands-Resources model and Conservation of Resources theory to examine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology adoption on intergenerational knowledge transfer among older employees. It focuses on the psychological motivation underlying this phenomenon and identifies individual factors that affect intergenerational knowledge transfer. The purpose is to gain a deep understanding of the internal mechanisms of employee cognition and behavior change in the context of technological transformation. Methods: We surveyed 635 older employees from various industries in China and analyzed the data using SPSS 27.0, Mplus 8.3, and fsQCA 4.1. The data were analyzed via a moderated sequential mediation model to examine the relationships among AI technology adoption, identity threat, relational crafting, digital self-efficacy and intergenerational knowledge transfer, supplemented by fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The study tested the mediating effects of identity threat and relational crafting between AI technology adoption and intergenerational knowledge transfer, as well as the moderating role of digital self-efficacy. In addition, fsQCA was used to test antecedents of intergenerational knowledge transfer among older employees. Results: The findings indicate that AI technology adoption positively influences intergenerational knowledge transfer. Identity threat and relational crafting play mediating roles between AI technology adoption and intergenerational knowledge transfer and also serve as sequential mediators. Digital self-efficacy negatively moderates the impact of AI technology adoption on identity threat, thereby moderating both the mediating role of identity threat and the sequential mediating effect of identity threat and relational crafting. Additionally, fsQCA identified three antecedent configurations that trigger intergenerational knowledge transfer among older employees. Discussion: Prior research on AI technology adoption has tended to emphasize singular positive or negative impacts on specific variables. This study constructs a model that incorporates both positive and negative effects, elucidating the multifaceted mechanisms through which AI technology adoption influences intergenerational knowledge transfer and enriches research on the consequences of AI technology adoption. While existing literature often highlights negative psychological and behavioral impacts of AI technology adoption on older employees, the present findings show that AI technology adoption can significantly enhance intergenerational knowledge transfer among older employees, thereby complementing current findings. Finally, by adopting a configurational thinking, this study identifies multiple pathways through which various factors affect intergenerational knowledge transfer, providing a useful complement to single-factor analyses of AI technology adoption’s impact. Thereby, the study offers practical insights for organizations seeking to develop inclusive technological-culture strategies.

Abstract: This study addresses the critical need for effective asynchronous continuing education design for Texas land surveyors, a profession facing significant workforce challenges with a median practitioner age of 59 years. Through design-based research methodology incorporating focus groups with practicing surveyors, we identified five essential design principles for online continuing education units: Time-Sensitive Course Structures that accommodate irregular work schedules; Experience-Validated Content Development that builds upon decades of professional expertise; Technology Scaffolding for Varied Proficiency Levels; Multimodal Engagement Strategies that connect to authentic surveying practice; and Professional Identity Reinforcement that facilitates the long-held practice in the surveying community of intergenerational knowledge transfer. These principles extend adult learning theory by demonstrating how professional identity and career stage interact with age-related factors in technical fields. The findings provide guidance for transforming mandatory continuing education from regulatory compliance into meaningful professional development that addresses both individual career sustainability and critical workforce development needs in Texas surveying.

Abstract: To solve the practical challenges faced in bridge structural health monitoring (BSHM), such as data scarcity, label deficiency, large operational environment variations, and high monitoring computational costs, the framework of population-based structural health monitoring (PBSHM) was systematically reviewed and summarized. A brief overview of the fundamental concepts of PBSHM was provided by thoroughly analyzing relevant studies reported in recent years. The definitions of different structural population types, including homogeneous populations and heterogeneous populations, were elaborated on from three perspectives: geometry, material, and topology. Key issues that PBSHM aims to solve were also summarized. Research status in the field of PBSHM was reviewed and analyzed in detail from two aspects: structural similarity measurement, and knowledge transfer methods and applications under different population types. Specific application scenarios and solution approaches under this framework were summarized, and the functions and connections of different technical methods were analyzed. In light of the practical engineering problems faced in the field of BSHM, the challenges and potential solutions for PBSHM of bridges were discussed. Review results indicate that structural populations form the basis of the PBSHM framework. Utilizing indicators of structural mechanical behavior similarity and data distribution similarity can effectively determine the knowledge transferability among bridge population members. Explicit transfer methods show good performance in anomaly monitoring and feature alignment for bridge structural populations, while implicit transfer methods based on deep neural network models exhibit stronger adaptability, which can automatically extract more representative features, meeting the end-to-end requirements in practical BSHM applications. Based on leveraging knowledge transfer technology, the PBSHM framework shows great potential in addressing issues such as differences in complex operational conditions, data imbalance impacts, damage identification, data prediction and generation, feature alignment, and normalization in bridge structural health monitoring tasks.

Abstract: Digital health interventions can support health-related knowledge transfer, for example through websites or mobile applications, and may reduce health inequalities by making health care available, where access is difficult, and by translating content to overcome language barriers. However, digital health intervention can also increase health inequalities due to the digital divide. To reach digitally excluded populations, design and delivery mechanisms need to specifically address this issue. This review was conducted during the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and informed the rapid design, deployment and evaluation of a post-COVID-19 rehabilitation digital health intervention: 'Living with COVID Recovery' (LWCR). LWCR needed to be engaging and usable for patients and to avoid exacerbating health inequalities. LWCR was introduced as a service into 33 NHS clinics, was used by 7679 patients, and evaluation ran from August 2020 to December 2022.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Generation Z (GenZ) into medical education has highlighted the need for a transformative shift in teaching methodologies, particularly in specialized fields like orthopedics. As digital natives, GenZ learners-born between 1995 and 2010-exhibit distinct preferences for interactive, technology-driven, and self-directed learning, rendering traditional lecture-based models increasingly obsolete. This scoping review explores the pedagogical implications of GenZ's learning traits and advocates for a generational shift in orthopedic education to align with their cognitive styles and career aspirations. GenZ students thrive in environments that use digital tools such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and gamified platforms, which provide immersive, risk-free surgical simulations and improve procedural mastery. Microlearning techniques, including bite-sized videos and infographics support their shorter attention spans and improve retention of complex topics like fracture classifications and biomechanics. Collaborative learning strategies, such as team-based problem-solving and peer-teaching models, resonate with their preference for social interaction and teamwork. Additionally, adaptive learning systems powered by artificial intelligence offer personalized study plans, addressing individual strengths and weaknesses. The review demonstrates the importance of early clinical exposure and simulation-based training to bridge theory and practice, encouraging pragmatic, career-ready professionals. Educators, particularly millennials, must embrace digital fluency and mentorship to create learner-centered environments. By integrating these innovations-flipped classrooms, gamification, and on-demand resources-orthopedic education can lead to engagement, knowledge retention, and clinical preparedness. Ultimately, this generational shift is imperative to equip future orthopedic surgeons with the skills demanded by modern healthcare. Embracing technology, interactivity, and personalized learning will redefine training approaches, ensuring optimal educational outcomes and patient care for the next generation of medical professionals.The rapid integration of Generation Z (GenZ) into medical education has highlighted the need for a transformative shift in teaching methodologies, particularly in specialized fields like orthopedics.

Abstract: To address the challenges in multimodal information integration and the inefficiency of knowledge transfer in the construction technology disclosure of deep foundation pit projects, an intelligent generation method based on graph rule reasoning and template mapping was proposed. First, a multi-level domain knowledge structure model was constructed by designing domain concepts and relationship types using the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Second, entity and attribute extraction was performed using regular expressions and the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model, while relationship extraction was conducted based on text structure combined with the BERT-CNN model. For image and video data, cross-modal data chains were built by adding keyword tags and generating URLs, utilizing semantic association rules to form a multimodal knowledge graph of the domain. Finally, based on graph reasoning and template mapping technology, the intelligent generation of construction disclosure schemes was realized. The case verification results showed that the proposed method significantly improved the structural integrity, procedural logical consistency, parameter traceability, knowledge reuse rate, environmental compliance, and parameter compliance of the schemes. This method not only promoted the standardization and efficiency of construction technology disclosure activities for deep foundation pit projects but also enhanced the visualization and intelligence level of the schemes.

Full text: 1. Introduction With the continuous acceleration of urbanization in China, deep foundation pit engineering, as a key component in the development of urban underground space, has had its construction technology disclosure quality and efficiency directly related to the safety and benefits of project construction. According to the latest data from the China Statistical Yearbook 2024, China’s urbanization rate increased from 36.2% in 2000 to 67.0% in 2024, with an annual growth rate of 2.6% [1]. This rapid urbanization process has led to the emergence of a large number of high-rise buildings, rail transportation, and underground integrated pipe gallery infrastructure projects. These projects often required crossing complex geological units, such as soft soils, gravel and sand, and high-pressure water layers, and their construction safety was directly related to the stability of the urban lifeline system. This complexity introduces uncertainties in geotechnical conditions (e.g., variability in soil stratigraphy, groundwater levels, and unexpected geological anomalies), organizational factors (e.g., coordination efficiency among design, supervision, and construction teams), and technological implementation (e.g., equipment performance stability and adaptability of construction methods), all of which may hinder effective risk control and the timely, accurate delivery of construction technology disclosure. Against this background, the traditional construction technology disclosure model, which relied on paper documents and manual explanations, has become insufficient to meet the high demands for knowledge transfer efficiency and accuracy in modern deep foundation pit engineering [2].
Currently, the construction technology disclosure of deep foundation pit projects is faced with multiple challenges. Field surveys on six deep foundation pit projects (2021–2023) revealed that preparing a complete disclosure package took over 18 working days on average, with about 12 manual revisions per project due to inconsistencies in multi-source data. Over 40% of documents contained outdated parameters, extending safety review cycles by 5–7 days. Additionally, 55% of technical managers cited the lack of an integrated, intelligent system as a key cause of inefficiency, while 62% attributed frequent on-site misinterpretations to the absence of multimodal information linkage. These findings underscore the need for a knowledge-driven, intelligent disclosure model. First, the disclosure knowledge exhibited typical multimodal characteristics, including text specifications, design drawings, construction videos, monitoring data, and other forms, and these heterogeneous data lacked effective integration mechanisms. Research indicated that over 65% of construction accidents originated from information transmission distortion or misunderstanding of multi-source information. Second, the traditional disclosure process heavily relied on personal experience. Industry surveys showed that about 78% of construction companies still relied on manual preparation of disclosure documents, resulting in a knowledge reuse rate of less than 30% [3]. Even more critically, with the expansion of project scale and the complexity of geological conditions, the disclosure content grew exponentially. For example, in a large-scale subway construction project in a major city, the disclosure document for a single deep foundation pit station exceeded 500 pages, highlighting the growing contradiction between manual processing efficiency and engineering demands [4].
Multimodal knowledge graph technology was provided as a new approach to solving the above problems. This technology integrated text, images, videos, and other diverse data through a structured semantic network, enabling the systematic organization and intelligent reasoning of knowledge. In fields such as healthcare and finance, multimodal knowledge graphs have demonstrated strong capabilities in knowledge integration. For instance, the medical knowledge graph in Google Health connected clinical guidelines, imaging data, and case records, improving diagnostic accuracy by more than 40% [5]. The medical multimodal relational graph learning method developed by Hu et al. (2024), though targeting the healthcare domain, offers valuable insights for cross-modal relationship modeling in construction scenarios through its interdisciplinary approach [6]. Meanwhile, Huan et al. (2025) systematically evaluated the application of BIM in elderly care facility management, emphasizing the foundational role of information standardization in multi-source data fusion—a critical consideration equally applicable to data governance in construction knowledge graphs [7]. However, in the field of construction engineering, particularly in the specialized area of deep foundation pit engineering, the application research of multimodal knowledge graphs was still in its early stages. Existing literature indicated that the intelligence of construction technology disclosure in deep foundation pit engineering still needed improvement, and the construction technology disclosure knowledge for various types of deep foundation pit projects remained in an independent and scattered state. The tasks of knowledge integration and standardization of disclosure knowledge still required faster implementation.
To address the above issues, this study aims to solve several key problems in the field of deep foundation pit construction technology disclosure. Specifically, the objectives are: (1) to automate the generation of disclosure schemes by integrating multimodal domain knowledge, thereby reducing reliance on manual preparation and improving efficiency; (2) to achieve semantic modeling of the sequence of construction operations using a multimodal knowledge graph, enabling the capture of interdependencies among tasks, resources, and constraints; and (3) to enhance the reproducibility and standardization of technological solutions by linking historical cases, standard specifications, and real-time project data within an intelligent generation framework.
2. Literature Review This paper provides a systematic review of the research status of construction technology disclosure in deep foundation pit engineering, the application progress of knowledge graphs in the construction field, and the key technologies for constructing multimodal knowledge graphs. The aim was to provide a theoretical foundation and technical reference for the intelligent generation of deep foundation pit engineering construction technology disclosure schemes based on multimodal knowledge graphs.
2.1. Research Status of Construction Technology Disclosure in Deep Foundation Pit Engineering Construction technology disclosure in deep foundation pit engineering was a key process to ensure project quality, safety, and progress. Its core objective was to accurately and clearly convey design intentions, construction plans, safety standards, and risk control measures to construction personnel. Traditional disclosure methods mainly relied on text, drawings, verbal explanations, and on-site demonstration, but this model faced numerous challenges [8]. First, the issue of information silos was particularly prominent. Design information, geological survey data, construction process data, and monitoring data were scattered across different systems and documents, making it difficult to form a unified and coherent knowledge system. This led to difficulties in information retrieval and low knowledge reuse [9]. Second, the efficiency of knowledge transfer in traditional methods was low. As information was often transmitted in a one-way direction and lacked effective feedback mechanisms and interactivity, construction personnel’s understanding of the information could not be assessed in real-time, which may have led to misunderstandings or construction errors. Third, there was a lack of personalization and adaptability. The needs for construction technology disclosure varied depending on different personnel, processes, and site conditions. However, traditional methods often provided a “one-size-fits-all” approach, resulting in redundant information and missing critical details. Finally, poor information transmission or misunderstanding could lead to operational errors by construction personnel, triggering safety accidents or quality issues, causing irreversible damage to the project [10].
To address the shortcomings of traditional disclosure methods, researchers began exploring the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology into deep foundation pit engineering management. BIM provided three-dimensional visualization capabilities, which could intuitively display the pit structure and construction process, thus improving the efficiency of technology disclosure to some extent [11]. However, BIM models mainly focused on geometric and attribute information, and there were still shortcomings in integrating deep semantic knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and multimodal heterogeneous data. As a result, achieving truly knowledge-driven intelligent disclosure remained difficult. Yue Pan et al. (2025) developed a spatiotemporal deep learning model for multi-attribute prediction of excavation-induced risks, providing an intelligent tool for risk pre-control in technical briefings [12]. Meanwhile, Zhang et al. (2022) achieved automatic hazard identification on construction sites by integrating building scene graphs with domain-specific BERT knowledge, which can be directly applied to safety warnings in briefing content [13]. Collectively, these studies lay the foundation for transforming technical briefings from static documents into dynamic interactions and from experience-based judgments to data-driven decision-making. Therefore, constructing a technology disclosure system that could integrate multimodal information and support intelligent reasoning became an important research direction in the field of deep foundation pit engineering.
2.2. Application Progress of Knowledge Graphs in the Construction Field As a structured knowledge representation method, knowledge graphs were able to describe concepts, entities, and their relationships in the objective world through graphs, providing strong support for intelligent information processing and knowledge reasoning. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the application of knowledge graphs in the construction field, primarily in the following aspects: (1) . Construction Knowledge Management and Retrieval: Knowledge graphs were used to structurally integrate construction knowledge scattered across various forms of text and non-text data, such as design drawings, specifications, construction logs, and accident reports, forming a vast knowledge network. By modeling entities and relationships, efficient retrieval and management of complex construction knowledge could be achieved [14]. For example, users were able to query the materials required for a specific construction process, related regulatory clauses, potential risks, and historical successful cases through the knowledge graph, significantly improving knowledge reuse and information retrieval efficiency. Hou et al. (2024) developed the DDE KG Editor system, which supports dynamic updates and quality control of large-scale geotechnical construction knowledge through collaborative editing and intelligent assistance functions [15]. Meanwhile, Lee and Lee (2024) constructed a construction risk assessment knowledge base by integrating BERT with graph models, enabling semantic organization of risk knowledge and thereby enhancing the relevance of briefing content [16].
(2) . Intelligent Question Answering and Decision Support: Knowledge graph-based intelligent question answering systems were developed to understand users’ natural language queries and provide precise answers and decision support through the reasoning capabilities of the knowledge graph. On construction sites, managers or workers could ask the system questions such as, “What type of deep foundation pit support should be used under these soil conditions?” or “How should groundwater seepage be handled in a foundation pit?”. The system would retrieve and infer the most relevant solutions from the knowledge graph [17]. Zhou et al. (2025) enhanced the accuracy of construction project management question-answering systems by augmenting general-purpose large language models with domain-specific multimodal knowledge graphs—an approach that can be effectively applied to intelligent Q&A during technical briefings [18]. Complementing this, Wang et al. (2025) developed a hybrid retrieval-augmented generation framework that improves knowledge management in construction engineering, providing technical support for the automated generation of briefing documents [19].
(3) . In construction safety management, Wu et al. (2023) developed a multimodal knowledge graph-based intelligent fault diagnosis model for industrial equipment, demonstrating the effectiveness of knowledge graphs in complex system state recognition—an approach transferable to deep excavation equipment management [20]. Jiang et al. (2021) established a construction safety standard knowledge graph system enabling associative querying and intelligent push of safety regulations, providing an efficient tool for safety standard referencing in technical briefings [21]. The scene graph-BERT integration method proposed by Zhang et al. (2022) essentially constructs a visual knowledge graph of construction sites, which can be directly applied to visual presentation of briefing content [13].

2.3. Key Technologies for Constructing Multimodal Knowledge Graphs As an extension of traditional knowledge graphs, multimodal knowledge graphs were able to integrate various forms of information, such as text, images, videos, and sensor data, providing more comprehensive knowledge support for deep foundation pit construction technology disclosure. Multimodal knowledge acquisition and integration were key technological steps in the construction process.
Regarding knowledge acquisition and fusion, Saha et al. (2019) investigated complex procedure induction methods capable of querying and constructing procedures from knowledge bases without gold standards, making it applicable for extracting briefing workflows from historical construction cases [22]. Kommineni et al. (2024) proposed an LLM-supported methodology for ontology and knowledge graph construction from human experts, leveraging large language models to reduce the manual burden of knowledge acquisition [9]. Complementing these approaches, Hou et al. (2024) developed the geoscience knowledge graph editing system DDE KG Editor, which provides a solution for multi-source geological data fusion adaptable to stratigraphic data integration in deep excavation projects [15].
In terms of construction methods, the core challenge in constructing multimodal knowledge graphs was how to achieve semantic alignment and unified representation of different modal data. Lee (2024) established a construction risk assessment knowledge base by integrating BERT with graph models, which reduces reliance on manual experience in traditional approaches through automatic extraction of entity relationships from unstructured data [16]. This technique is particularly suitable for complex risk scenarios in deep excavation projects, enabling real-time correlation analysis of key indicators such as supporting structure deformation and groundwater level fluctuations. Complementing this, Song et al. (2023) proposed a scenario-driven approach that combines knowledge engineering with large language models to achieve multimodal knowledge injection for indoor robot functionality [23]. Their solution for improving data collection efficiency can be directly transferred to technical briefing scenarios in deep excavation engineering.
Knowledge representation and reasoning were the core elements that enabled multimodal knowledge graphs to deliver value. Chen et al. (2024) proposed an ontology-based approach for constructing risk knowledge bases, achieving standardized representation of risk knowledge through a six-step methodology [24]. Their rule-based reasoning mechanism enables automatic generation of prevention measures, providing a structured paradigm for intelligent briefing content generation. Similarly, Pan et al. (2025) [25] developed a digital twin foundation pit model (DTFPM) employing parametric modeling and inverse analysis algorithms, which facilitates dynamic optimization of briefing solutions. The model’s prediction error within 10% validates the accuracy advantage of intelligent systems in solution development. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that integrating knowledge graphs with real-time analysis technologies represents a core pathway for enhancing briefing quality.
Particularly noteworthy is the emerging application of multimodal knowledge graphs in the construction domain. X. Zhu et al. (2022) systematically reviewed the construction and application of multimodal knowledge graphs, highlighting that integrating multi-source data (text, images, videos, etc.) is crucial for enhancing knowledge representation completeness [11]. Song et al. (2024) proposed a scenario-driven approach for constructing multimodal knowledge graphs for embodied AI, whose scene understanding capability can be directly applied to construction environment modeling [23]. Similarly, Chen et al. (2023) surveyed recent advances in multimodal knowledge graphs, emphasizing the importance of multimodal fusion for comprehensive construction knowledge representation [26]. These studies provide theoretical support for multimodal representation in deep excavation technical briefings.
The application of knowledge graphs in construction has evolved from simple knowledge representation to complex reasoning, multimodal fusion, and dynamic updating [27]. Tam et al. (2022) developed a multi-order convolutional network-based entity alignment method that addresses the integration of construction knowledge graphs from diverse sources, facilitating more comprehensive briefing knowledge bases [28]. Roll et al. (2025) implemented graph-based retrieval-augmented generation using Neo4j, enhancing domain knowledge acquisition in multimodal large language models—an architecture adaptable for personalized briefing generation [29]. These technological advances establish the foundation for building a knowledge service system for deep excavation technical briefings.
A review of the current state revealed that traditional disclosure models had significant limitations in terms of information completeness, transmission efficiency, and personalization. The progress of knowledge graph applications in the construction field demonstrated its enormous potential in areas such as knowledge management, intelligent question answering, process monitoring, and safety management. Therefore, constructing multimodal knowledge graphs and fully utilizing the complex multimodal data on construction sites had become an important direction for the further development of knowledge graphs in the construction field.
3. Research Methods In response to the multi-source heterogeneity of the technology disclosure data and the richness of domain knowledge, a knowledge structure model was designed. Considering the complexity, diversity of formats, and dispersion of construction documents in the deep foundation pit engineering domain, entity, relationship, and attribute knowledge extraction methods with domain adaptability were developed, and a textual knowledge graph was constructed. Through multimodal linking technology, entities from images, videos, and BIM models were connected to the textual knowledge graph, thus forming a multimodal knowledge graph. The specific process was shown in Figure 1. The methodology integrates a domain-specific hierarchical knowledge system structured around the Work Breakdown Sructure (WBS) and national technical standards. Named entities and relations are extracted from multimodal engineering texts using deep learning models such as BERT-BiLSTM-CRF and BERT-CNN. Candidate disclosure cases are retrieved using a hybrid similarity computation based on Jaccard and Word2Vec embeddings. Knowledge inference is performed through multi-hop traversal of a Neo4j-based knowledge graph, enabling the system to extract procedural steps, safety constraints, and material attributes. The inferred content is finally mapped into structured disclosure documents via a rule-driven template mechanism. This end-to-end architecture ensures that raw project information can be automatically transformed into standardized, context-aware CTD plans.
3.1. Construction of Multimodal Knowledge Graph This study systematically reviewed technical disclosure cases and standard specification knowledge to construct a classification system for the deep foundation pit construction technology disclosure knowledge domain. This resulted in the formation of a multimodal knowledge structure model tailored for the Technical Disclosure for Deep Foundation Pit Construction (TDFPC) domain. Based on the hierarchical progression of domain knowledge and the analysis of entity concept types, a hierarchical TDFPC multimodal knowledge structure model with an “entity-relationship-attribute” framework was established (Figure 2). In this model, organizations were assigned a guiding role in engineering project construction, while the project itself included basic attributes such as the project name and location, and was further detailed with entity information like geological hydrology and surrounding environment. As a critical component of guiding construction activities, technical disclosure covered multiple aspects, including construction preparation, construction processes, quality control, safety management, civilized construction, and environmental protection. Notably, technical disclosure content included not only textual information but also supported video information, such as using videos to explain construction processes in detail. Specifically, for video data, keyframes were manually extracted and annotated with construction activity labels, which were then aligned with textual process descriptions through temporal segmentation. For BIM elements, IFC component attributes (e.g., element type, location, material) were mapped to corresponding engineering entities based on ID matching and spatial context. These annotations were embedded into the knowledge graph as instances with cross-modal references. The entire knowledge structure model strictly followed the terminological rules and constraint requirements of the standard specifications.
3.2. Knowledge Extraction 3.2.1. Knowledge Extraction Strategy Based on the feature analysis of textual data in the deep foundation pit engineering construction technology disclosure domain, the textual corpus was classified into two categories based on the degree of information organization: highly structured text and weakly structured text. Highly structured text (e.g., standard specification documents and domain-specific books) had clear chapter divisions and terminology definitions, with information presented in a highly standardized format. Weakly structured text (e.g., construction technology disclosure records and special construction plans) had freer language expressions and required natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract key information. To meet the extraction needs of professional concepts in this domain, this paper followed the knowledge structure model constructed in Figure 2, and systematically outlined the knowledge content characteristics, level of structuring, and corresponding extraction strategies of technical disclosure documents and standard specification documents through Table 1.
3.2.2. Entity Extraction Based on the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF Model Entity extraction, as a key step in knowledge graph construction, aimed to extract structured knowledge units from data sources and build a knowledge network. This paper adopted a hybrid deep learning-based model architecture to achieve automated entity extraction, specifically choosing the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF combined model. This choice was based on three theoretical foundations: First, the pre-trained language model BERT generated context-aware word vector representations through large-scale corpus learning. These representations allowed for a deep understanding of the semantic and syntactic features of natural language. Second, while BiLSTM effectively modeled bidirectional temporal features, it struggled to integrate transition rules between labels during sequence labeling. To address this issue, a Conditional Random Field (CRF) was connected at the end of the neural network to establish a globally optimal decoding mechanism. By using BERT’s context embeddings as input features for the CRF, the model was able to inherit the semantic representation advantages of the pre-trained model while benefiting from the label transition constraints of CRF, forming an end-to-end joint learning framework. This multi-layered architecture not only reduced the complexity of feature engineering but also achieved collaborative optimization of parameters across components via gradient backpropagation [30]. The specific process of text training based on the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model was shown in Figure 3.
In the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF architecture model, the layers collaborated to complete the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. The specific functions and processing flow were as follows: (1) . Data Input Layer: This layer was responsible for receiving the raw input data and converting it into a format that could be processed by the model. The process included preprocessing steps such as tokenization, adding special markers, and segmentation, ensuring that the subsequent embedding layer could efficiently and accurately process the input data.
(2) . Feature Representation Embedding Layer (BERT Layer): The character sequence { x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , …, x i , …} processed by the data input layer was fed into the BERT pre-trained model. The BERT model mapped each character x i to a numerical vector v i , realizing the conversion from characters to vectors.
(3) . Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network Layer (BiLSTM Layer): This layer contained two LSTM networks, which processed the feature representation embeddings vᵢ from both forward and backward directions. The results from both directions were concatenated to generate a new sequence representation. This new sequence was the output of this layer and contained scores rᵢ for each category label. The bidirectional LSTM design allowed the model to capture contextual information at each position, thus enabling a more comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the text information.
(4) . Conditional Random Field Layer (CRF Layer): The CRF layer utilized the constraints learned by the model to complete the label prediction task. By combining the category label scores r ᵢ from the BiLSTM layer, the final probability values of the entity labels were computed.
(5) . Result Output Layer: The model integrated the probability values output by the CRF layer to determine the entity label for each character o i and provided the final entity label results.

3.2.3. Entity Extraction Based on Regular Expression Template Matching Regular expression template matching was a data extraction technique that began with the formulation of extraction rules. Before extraction, dedicated extraction rules needed to be designed based on the characteristics of the target data. The database was then scanned comprehensively according to these rules to filter out the information that met the criteria. This method was particularly suitable for text types with clear structures and highly consistent expression methods and language styles. For such texts, manual reading and analysis were required to distill the text patterns and construct the corresponding extraction rules. For structured data, the regular expression template matching method was used for entity extraction, which, compared to other methods, demonstrated significant advantages in both accuracy and efficiency. The process of rule-based data extraction was shown in Figure 4.
3.3. Knowledge Fusion This paper established the correlation between image data, video data, and construction process entities in the knowledge graph through technical disclosure of construction process standard terminology. In the knowledge structure model constructed in Figure 2, image (cPicture) entities and video entities (cVideo) were added to represent image data and video data in deep foundation pit engineering construction technology disclosure, with attributes such as name and relative path (URL). At the same time, relationships were established between the image (cPicture) entity, video entity (cVideo), and entities like construction processes, such as cTechnology-cPicture and cTechnology-cVideo. The resulting TDFPC contained multimodal knowledge topological structures, including process flow diagrams, structural construction drawings (2D), BIM model diagrams (3D), and operation videos, as shown in Figure 5. In the case of BIM model diagrams, we performed semantic extraction rather than using them solely as visual inputs. Specifically, component metadata and spatial relationships were parsed from IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) files, including entity types (e.g., retaining walls, foundation slabs), geometric attributes, and construction logic. These semantics were then mapped to corresponding entities and relationships in the knowledge graph, enabling reasoning over spatial dependencies and procedural interconnections in deep foundation pit engineering.
In the construction of the intelligent disclosure system for deep foundation pit engineering, the semantic fusion of multi-source heterogeneous data relied on two core technologies: semantic entity mapping and feature association. Feature similarity measurement served as the foundation for this process. Traditional methods, such as the Jaccard coefficient, although having high accuracy, suffered from insufficient semantic representation capabilities and limited recall performance. Currently, mainstream semantic similarity evaluation methods could be categorized into three types: matching strategies based on semantic knowledge bases; distributed semantic representation models [31]; and deep semantic reasoning models. This study adopted the Jaccard-Word2Vec hybrid model optimized in the word vector space. This model retained the accuracy advantage of the Jaccard coefficient while integrating distributed semantic features, effectively improving the semantic sensitivity and engineering adaptability of deep foundation pit construction attribute similarity calculations [31]. For example, in the deep foundation pit domain, although “support piles” and “retaining walls” were different entities, their vectors were semantically close in the vector space due to their co-occurrence in contexts such as “support structures.”
3.4. Knowledge Storage Currently, there were three main types of storage methods for knowledge graphs: relational databases, RDF triple databases, and native graph databases [32]. Given the application requirements of multimodal knowledge graphs in the deep foundation pit engineering technology disclosure domain, and considering the high demands for complex relationship expression in tasks such as information query efficiency, construction process modeling, and technology disclosure scheme generation, as well as the dynamic updating characteristics of the knowledge graph schema, this study selected a native graph database as the storage solution. Native graph database systems included several typical representatives, such as the open-source product Neo4j, the distributed architecture JanusGraph, OrientDB, and Cayley. Among them, Neo4j, as a widely applied open-source graph database solution in the industry, offered significant advantages, including independent operation, no reliance on external databases, and high graph traversal efficiency. Therefore, this study chose Neo4j as the storage engine for the TDFPC multimodal knowledge graph to manage core data such as entities, relationships, and attributes. To provide a clearer understanding of how domain-specific knowledge is structured within the TDFPC knowledge graph, several representative triplets are presented below (Table 2).
Neo4j provided three typical data import methods: First, manually creating nodes, edges, and attributes through Cypher Query Language (CQL) statements, which was suitable for local fine-tuning of the graph but had lower efficiency. Second, using the CQL LOAD command to load CSV files, enabling efficient batch import of entity nodes and relationships, which was suitable for large-scale data loading during the initial phase of graph construction. Third, importing data based on the Python py2neo package, which was slower but more convenient for integration with downstream applications, making it suitable for updating and merging inference results and small batches of data. This study adopted the second batch import method to handle primary data such as technical documents and standard specifications, supplemented by the first method for fine-tuning the graph, and the third method was used to connect subsequent graph inference and application stages.
3.5. Knowledge Inference Graph retrieval technology was a relational query method based on a graph data structure model. Its core lay in parsing the multi-dimensional relationships between nodes, edges, and attributes in the knowledge graph to enable in-depth exploration of complex knowledge networks. In the deep foundation pit construction technology disclosure domain, this technology supported semantic-level associative retrieval of multi-source heterogeneous knowledge by constructing a knowledge graph containing entities such as construction plans, geological parameters, safety regulations, and their associations. Specifically, for technical requirements in deep foundation pit construction, such as support structure selection or deformation monitoring and early warning, the retrieval process could be divided into three stages: First, using natural language processing to convert the user query into a structured query vector, which matched the relevant entity nodes in the knowledge graph, and second, utilizing graph traversal algorithms (such as breadth-first search or random walk) to explore entity relationship paths connected to the initial node. For instance, starting from the “support structure” node, the system may traverse paths such as “applicable geological conditions → soil parameter thresholds → construction process flow.” A sample rule used to infer the next construction activity in the process chain can be expressed using Cypher as follows: MATCH (a:Activity)-[:isFollowedBy]->(b:Activity) WHERE a.name = ‘Drilling’ RETURN b.name. Executing this query on the graph returns “Reinforcement Cage Placement” as the immediate subsequent activity. These rule-based reasoning paths enable the dynamic construction of multi-step procedural chains from initial inputs. Finally, the retrieved knowledge entries are ranked based on semantic similarity and filtered to support accurate construction decision-making. This technology overcame the limitations of traditional keyword matching, supported multi-hop reasoning and pattern matching, and could accurately retrieve complex construction decision knowledge, such as “deep foundation pit support schemes in soft soil areas.” Its advantages were: (1) It explicitly expressed domain knowledge associations through the graph structure, improving retrieval accuracy. (2) It supported cross-validation of construction plans and safety regulations, enhancing decision reliability. (3) The path-based retrieval process was interpretable, making it easier for technical personnel to understand the logic of knowledge associations. This method provided theoretical support and practical verification for intelligent construction technology assistance.
Deep foundation pit engineering involved multi-dimensional factors such as geological conditions, support structures, construction processes, and monitoring requirements, with complex non-linear associations between these elements. For example, geological conditions (such as soft soil foundation) not only affected support structure selection (such as double-row piles) but may also have triggered the need for dewatering. The dewatering plan had to further be linked to the surrounding environment (such as a nearby subway tunnel), leading to risk assessment requirements. These associations could not be covered by a single rule and needed to be gradually revealed through multi-hop reasoning. If only single-hop reasoning (e.g., soft soil foundation → double-row piles) had been relied upon, key decision points (such as the impact of dewatering on the subway tunnel) may have been overlooked, resulting in an incomplete plan. Therefore, this study adopted multi-hop reasoning rules for knowledge inference. In particular, the system included domain-specific reasoning rules to capture implicit dependencies related to safety management and environmental protection. For example, excavation near sensitive structures triggered multi-hop inference to retrieve relevant monitoring protocols and environmental safeguards, such as noise reduction measures or real-time deformation tracking requirements. This allowed the framework to retrieve not only structural sequences but also regulatory and compliance-related actions dynamically.
4. Case Study This study constructed an intelligent generation framework for construction technology disclosure schemes driven by multimodal knowledge, as illustrated in Figure 6. Before presenting the case implementation, we offer a detailed textual description of the algorithmic workflow underlying the proposed framework. The system operates through five key stages: (1) entity recognition, where construction-related terms and attributes are extracted from multimodal inputs; (2) case matching via similarity computation, which aligns current project data with historical disclosure cases based on weighted attribute similarity; (3) graph-based multi-hop inference, enabling retrieval of relevant procedural knowledge, specifications, and safety measures through semantic traversal of the knowledge graph; (4) template mapping, where extracted and inferred information is dynamically bound to structured disclosure templates; and (5) final document generation, which produces a standardized, regulation-compliant construction technology disclosure plan. This procedural breakdown clarifies the logical flow from unstructured input data to structured output, highlighting how the proposed framework integrates information retrieval, knowledge reasoning, and automated document synthesis in a unified architecture. Building upon this workflow, we first designed a modular technology disclosure scheme template based on domain requirements. Subsequently, entity and attribute recognition was conducted using a BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model, which identified key construction activity information such as project names, disclosure locations, construction methods, and section headings. To link these entities to relevant historical cases, keyword-based matching was initially performed within the knowledge graph. In cases where multiple candidates were retrieved, a refined similarity computation using a hybrid Cosine and Word2Vec-Jaccard algorithm was applied to rank historical cases. The top five most similar cases were retained, and the highest-scoring one was selected by default as the reference basis for graph inference and knowledge retrieval. Finally, the retrieved entities and associated attributes were integrated into the structured disclosure template to produce the final intelligent construction technology disclosure scheme.
4.1. Data Collection This study collected textual data through official channels, such as the China Standard Resource Network ( http://www.csres.com/ ) and the Jianbiao Database ( www.jianbiaoku.com ), obtaining standard specification documents related to deep foundation pit engineering. In addition, deep foundation pit construction technology disclosure documents were collected through site surveys, and relevant domain books were obtained from library research. Image data included process flow diagrams, detailed drawings of construction process nodes, construction machinery and material images, and BIM model diagrams. Video data included technology disclosure videos and safety education videos.
After acquiring the initial data, text data cleaning was performed as a core preprocessing step. The goal was to accurately identify and effectively correct errors, redundant information, and missing fields in the dataset, ensuring the integrity, consistency, and usability of the data. For image data, invalid data with resolutions lower than 64 × 64 pixels or higher than 2048 × 2048 pixels were removed, focusing on the preferred resolution range of 224 × 224 pixels to 512 × 512 pixels. For video data, an initial manual screening was conducted to remove videos unrelated to technology disclosure or outdated videos. Additionally, each video was named according to its content and labeled with key features and an incremental number for unique identification. Notably, BIM models were generated as image data and served as a supplement to the textual knowledge graph. Based on the above rules and combined with manual judgment, 230 valid, clean technology disclosure data entries were selected, as shown in Table 3. It is important to note that the 872 annotated documents used for training and evaluating the NER and RE modules constitute a superset that includes and extends beyond the 230 valid cases. The 230 selected cases represent a high-quality subset filtered from the broader annotated corpus based on completeness, multimodal richness, and domain applicability, and were specifically reserved for downstream intelligent generation and evaluation tasks.
The training corpus was annotated by three domain experts with at least five years of experience in construction engineering. To ensure annotation consistency, each sample was independently labeled by two annotators, with disagreements resolved by a third senior expert. Inter-annotator agreement was measured using Cohen’s Kappa coefficient, which reached 0.82, indicating strong consistency and reliability of the labeled data.
4.2. Experimental Environment The BERT-BiLSTM-CRF Named Entity Recognition model developed in this study was implemented using the PyTorch 1.10 framework and Python language, running on the Windows 11 operating system. The system was equipped with an Intel ® Core™ i7-9700F CPU @ 3.00 GHz, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 graphics card, and 16 GB of memory. The main software environment included Python 3.10.11 and PyTorch for model training and evaluation. TensorFlow 1.12 was additionally used to support a rule-based module involved in visual attribute extraction. The two frameworks were used independently and results were integrated through post-processing. The model used the Adam optimization algorithm and was configured with the following key parameters: an initial learning rate of 0.001, a batch size of 20, a CRF layer learning rate of 3 × 10 −3 , a BERT layer learning rate of 5 × 10 −5 , and 100 iterations for data processing. Other parameter settings were shown in Table 4. The choice of BERT-BiLSTM-CRF and BERT-CNN was guided by the specific characteristics of construction terminology and the limited availability of labeled data. While alternatives such as RoBERTa, T5, and SciBERT are powerful, they typically require larger annotated corpora for fine-tuning, which is difficult to obtain in this domain. By contrast, BERT-BiLSTM-CRF captures sequential dependencies and label constraints effectively, and BERT-CNN enhances the extraction of local semantic features from short technical expressions. Preliminary experiments indicated that these two models provided a more favorable balance of accuracy and efficiency under our dataset conditions, making them suitable choices for this study. The dataset consists of 872 annotated construction disclosure documents collected from real-world deep excavation projects. Among these, representative samples were drawn from projects in Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Nanjing, encompassing a variety of geological conditions such as soft clay, silty sand, and gravel layers. This geographic and geotechnical diversity allowed the evaluation to reflect practical variability across regions and strengthened the robustness of the findings. Further multi-city case validations are planned as part of ongoing research. These were split into training (698), validation (87), and test (87) sets. The annotation covered 17 entity types and 7 relation types, following a domain-specific guideline reviewed by experts. We used a fixed random seed of 42 to ensure reproducibility. Model training was conducted on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU with a batch size of 32, learning rate of 3 × 10 −5 , and early stopping after 6 epochs. Each training session lasted approximately 2.5 h.
4.3. Construction Activity Information Recognition The special construction plan for deep foundation pit engineering was the basis for the construction technology disclosure of deep foundation pit projects. The content of the technology disclosure had to strictly follow the construction plan and could not deviate from or simplify key parameters, such as the design bearing capacity of the support structure. Technology disclosure was essential for the implementation of the construction plan. Therefore, before the intelligent generation of the technology disclosure scheme, the construction activity information in the special construction plan had to first be recognized.
In this section, the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF recognition model was used for identifying construction activity information, primarily identifying eight types of entities: project, project characteristics, construction process, construction materials, construction equipment, geological hydrology, surrounding environment, and construction activities. The attribute values of the deep foundation pit engineering special construction plan were divided into two levels: the first level included general project attributes applicable to the entire deep foundation pit engineering, such as foundation pit depth, soil layer type, and groundwater level; the second level included specialized engineering attributes related to the construction activities of the sub-projects to be disclosed. Different attributes were categorized into numeric and character types based on their values. Table 5 shows the selection of entities and attributes for the bored pile sub-project, where the general entities and attributes applied to case similarity calculations for all sub-projects, while the specialized attributes were used for calculating the similarity of the bored pile construction technology disclosure cases.
4.4. Calculation of Entity and Attribute Similarity for Technology Disclosure Cases Taking the attributes of bored piles in Table 5 as an example, certain entities and attributes, such as project name and project location, did not participate in entity alignment and attribute matching. The recognition results were only used as the content output for the basic project information and project overview sections in the technology disclosure. In the case similarity measurement process, to improve the applicability and accuracy of the retrieval results, a differentiated feature weight allocation mechanism had to be constructed. By introducing a hierarchical priority strategy, different types of attributes were processed separately, achieving precise case matching. The method for determining feature weights could be divided into two categories: one was the direct weighting strategy based on domain expertise (e.g., expert experience method), which was efficient but subject to subjective bias; the other was a data-driven intelligent optimization method (e.g., genetic algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm), which required large-scale labeled datasets for parameter training. Given the current limitations of labeled data, this study adopted a direct weighting strategy based on engineering specifications and expert consensus. The priority sequence of feature attributes was determined through a structured decision-making process. For deep foundation pit engineering, general attributes controlled global engineering, so their weight was set to 0.6, with equal weight distribution within the general attributes. Specialized attributes reflected technical differences in various construction activities, so their weight was set to 0.4, with equal weight distribution within the specialized attributes. In the general attributes, the top five attributes with the most significant impact on construction technology disclosure were selected as the basis for attribute similarity calculation. These attributes were: foundation pit depth, safety level, soil layer type, surrounding environment distance, and groundwater level, which directly influenced deep foundation pit construction activities. Using bored piles as an example, the specific weights and selection criteria were shown in Table 6. The weight ratio of 0.6 (text) and 0.4 (visual) was determined through validation experiments to balance the dominant role of structured textual content with supportive visual information. Alternative ratios (e.g., 0.5/0.5 and 0.7/0.3) resulted in decreased matching accuracy. Attribute priority was based on frequency in annotated cases and regulatory importance. Future work will explore data-driven optimization strategies such as Bayesian tuning or evolutionary algorithms.
4.5. Technology Disclosure Scheme Template Mapping This study adopted an intelligent generation method based on scheme template mapping, which dynamically associated the knowledge graph in the deep foundation pit technology disclosure domain with structured templates, realizing an intelligent process from knowledge extraction to scheme generation. The scheme template mapping technology was a technical framework that dynamically matched the entities, relationships, and attributes in the knowledge graph with predefined scheme templates. The methodology explicitly incorporated Environmental Protection and Safety Management requirements as separate modules in the disclosure template. These modules were parameterized based on national standards (e.g., GB/T 50430–2017 [33] for environmental measures; GB 50116–2013 for safety protocols) and linked in the knowledge graph through dedicated nodes and relations (e.g., cTechnology–cSafety, cTechnology–cEnvironment). Process flow templates were constructed in two steps: (1) recurrent construction tasks and sequencing rules were extracted from disclosure records and standard specifications, and then formalized into parameterized templates; (2) these templates were validated with historical cases to ensure consistency. Visual information was linked to text through entity-level associations in the knowledge graph, where each construction step was bound to related images or videos using unique identifiers and semantic tags (e.g., cTechnology–cPicture, cTechnology–cVideo). In particular, video resources were linked to construction steps through time-stamped semantic tags (e.g., cTechnology–cVideo), enabling direct playback of specific operations associated with each task. BIM elements were connected via unique component identifiers in the knowledge graph, so that each construction activity could be cross-referenced with corresponding 3D objects (e.g., excavation volumes, support structures) in the BIM model. This multimodal alignment ensures that textual descriptions, visual evidence, and digital models are consistently integrated in the disclosure process. The reasoning process was implemented using Neo4j v4.4 with the official Python driver. Cypher queries were used to model and infer task dependencies such as prerequisite steps and conditional operations. Schema constraints were applied, and indices were created on key entity attributes (e.g., name, type) to optimize retrieval performance. To generate valid execution sequences, topological sorting was applied over the inferred task graph, ensuring logical coherence and regulatory consistency.
4.5.1. Scheme Template Design The construction technology disclosure scheme for deep foundation pit engineering must meet the requirements of standardization, operability, and knowledge reusability in engineering practice. Therefore, in designing the technology disclosure scheme template, the semantic association characteristics of the knowledge graph were first utilized to layer the scheme modules, with each module corresponding to specific entity types and relational networks within the knowledge graph. Template fields are dynamically bound to knowledge graph node attributes via placeholders (e.g., {ConstructionProcess.Name}), enabling incremental updates in response to new regulations.
Based on an analysis of deep foundation pit construction technology disclosure records and the reference book “ Detailed Analysis and Typical Cases of Construction Technology Disclosure Records—Foundation Engineering ” [34], the TDFPC scheme is divided into nine sections: Project Overview, Compilation Basis, Construction Preparation, Construction Process, Quality Control, Safety Management, Civilized Construction, Environmental Protection, and Others. The “Others” section includes process flow diagrams, various schematic diagrams, detailed node drawings, and videos. The specific template structure for the technology disclosure scheme is shown in Figure 7.
4.5.2. Mapping Relationship Between Scheme Template and Knowledge Graph Based on the multimodal knowledge graph constructed in Chapter 4 and the technology disclosure scheme template designed in Section 3.1, a mapping relationship existed between the two. This mapping relationship was the core of the intelligent generation of the technology disclosure scheme. Table 3 provides a detailed display of the structure of the technology disclosure scheme template and its mapping relationship with the knowledge graph. The content specifications for each module are shown in Table 7.
4.5.3. Scheme Template Mapping Process After the technology disclosure scheme template was defined, entity and attribute recognition could be performed based on user requirements. The information obtained through entity and attribute category similarity matching was then embedded into the corresponding Cypher query statement, connected to the Neo4j database, and the knowledge retrieval task was executed. Subsequently, based on the predefined technology disclosure scheme template, the retrieval results were embedded into the template. A schematic diagram of this implementation process was shown in Figure 8. The generation of process flow charts was implemented through rule-based traversal of the multimodal knowledge graph. Each construction task is represented as a node, while edges encode the precedence constraints among tasks. The generation process follows three logical steps: (1) identifying the starting tasks without predecessors, (2) iteratively expanding successor tasks according to topological order while ensuring all constraints are satisfied, and (3) outputting the ordered task sequence together with the linked multimodal resources. This procedure ensures that the generated process flow strictly respects task dependencies encoded in the knowledge graph, thereby improving the reproducibility of the results. For illustration, consider a query regarding the excavation stage of a deep foundation pit. The inference mechanism begins by identifying the starting task (Diaphragm Wall Construction). Based on the precedence relations encoded in the knowledge graph, it then infers the next tasks (Excavation to −3.0 m, followed by Steel Strut Installation). The reasoning path continues by expanding successor nodes until the full sequence of excavation and support operations is produced. This example demonstrates how the rule-based traversal ensures that the generated process strictly follows technological and safety constraints. Moreover, the framework supports dynamic updating through incremental knowledge graph modification. When new information is introduced (e.g., revised excavation depth or unexpected soil conditions), corresponding nodes and relations are added or updated in the graph. The process flow generation module then re-infers the task sequence based on the revised graph structure, ensuring that the Construction Technology Disclosure plan remains consistent with current conditions. In practice, this allows rapid adjustment of disclosure content in response to design changes or unforeseen site events, with engineers validating and confirming updates through the system interface.
5. Results 5.1. Knowledge Extraction Result Analysis (1) Entity Extraction Result Analysis. In this study, 230 technology disclosure cases and four domain books were used as data sources, from which 17 types of entities were extracted, including project, organization, geological hydrology, surrounding environment, and others. The specific results are shown in Table 8. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the knowledge extraction components, we computed precision, recall, and F1-scores for each of the 17 entity types in the NER module and for 7 core relation types in the relation extraction module. As shown in Table 7 and Table 8, the average F1 score for entities was 84.6%, with ‘Project Features’ and ‘Construction Preparation’ achieving scores above 87%. Relationship extraction reached an average F1 score of 81.7%, with high precision in identifying sequential and dependency relations between construction tasks.
In terms of overall evaluation metrics, the “Construction Preparation” module performed the best (88.16%), while “Environmental Protection” performed the worst (73.25%). The high accuracy and recall group (P > 80%, R > 80%) includes “Project Features” (P = 87.85%, R = 87.64%) and “Construction Preparation” (P = 88.91%, R = 87.43%); the low accuracy and recall group (P < 75% or R < 75%) includes “Geological Hydrology” (P = 73.32%, R = 84.37%), “Surrounding Environment” (P = 74.62%, R = 85.69%), and “Environmental Protection” (P = 73.48%, R = 73.02%). The recall deficiency for “Construction Materials” is due to the diverse ways material specifications are expressed and inconsistent annotation granularity. The low precision and recall for “Environmental Protection” is due to vague descriptions of environmental protection measures or semantic overlap with “Civilized Construction” categories. Further error analysis revealed two recurring patterns. First, many sentences used non-specific phrases (e.g., “appropriate action should be taken”) that lacked domain-grounded technical terms, making it difficult for the model to identify concrete entities. Second, multi-clause sentences often embedded several protection instructions (e.g., dust suppression, noise reduction, waste management) within a single expression, increasing complexity for both boundary detection and relation extraction. These patterns contributed to entity fragmentation and reduced overall extraction accuracy. The feature capture ability for “Safety Management” is weak because safety event descriptions often use negation sentences (e.g., “No over-excavation allowed”), which have complex syntactic patterns. To improve coverage in these two categories, we enhanced the annotation schema with domain-specific examples, such as regulatory phrases and typical safety warnings. For Safety Management, additional training samples containing negation structures were introduced to help the model capture implicit constraints. For Environmental Protection, synonym normalization and rule-based filters were applied to handle semantic ambiguity and overlap with Civilized Construction. These adjustments led to slight improvements in F1-scores in both categories during validation experiments.
(2) Relation Extraction Results. In the 10 types of entity relationships defined in this study, for “Preparation Relationship” and “Approval Relationship,” since both the head and tail entities strictly follow established standards and are directly determined, and the number of involved entities is relatively small, they were processed through direct determination. Similarly, the “Explanation Relationship” between “Disclosure Video” and “Disclosure Document” was also handled by direct determination. For the remaining 7 types of relationships, considering their complexity and diversity, a BERT-CNN model-based relation extraction method was used.
The experimental results of the model are shown in Table 9. Data analysis indicates that the BERT-CNN integrated model proposed in this study demonstrated excellent performance in the entity relationship classification task. Particularly, it performed well in “Task Relationship” and “Production Relationship,” with an average F1 score exceeding 83%. The performance for “Equipment Relationship,” “Containment Relationship,” and “Reference Relationship” was stable, with F1 scores ranging from 77% to 82%. The “Guidance Relationship” needs further optimization, and it is suggested that domain rule constraints be introduced to improve precision. The overall F1 score standard deviation was 3.3%, indicating balanced performance across different relationship types, but with about 15–25% room for improvement. Future work should focus on enhancing feature engineering and negative sample mining for relationships with lower scores. To evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed model to incomplete or contradictory data sources, a robustness test was performed. The test simulated conditions of missing or outdated documentation by randomly removing 10–30% of the disclosure text and introducing inconsistent parameter values. The results showed that the performance of knowledge extraction (measured by F1-score) decreased moderately by 3.5–7.2%, while the accuracy of process flow generation decreased by less than 5%. Importantly, the overall logical structure of the disclosure maps remained stable, and most missing elements could be recovered through knowledge graph inference. These findings suggest that the system demonstrates good resilience to imperfect data, which is a common challenge in engineering practice. In addition to robustness testing, we conducted a structural evaluation by comparing the system-generated knowledge graph against ground-truth graphs manually constructed by three domain experts. The results showed a node match rate of 91.6%, an edge alignment rate of 88.4%, and an overall F1-score of 0.90. These quantitative indicators demonstrate a high degree of structural consistency between the automated and expert-generated graphs, thereby validating the semantic accuracy and domain fidelity of the proposed knowledge modeling framework.
Additional error analysis was performed for categories with relatively low performance, such as Environmental Protection. Most errors arose from two sources: (1) vague or generic expressions (e.g., “measures should be taken to reduce dust” without specifying technology or material), which hindered precise entity recognition; and (2) long and complex sentences that combined multiple measures in one clause, which increased difficulty for relation extraction. These findings indicate that the extraction model is more challenged by abstract, loosely standardized language compared to technical descriptions of structural or procedural tasks.
5.2. Knowledge Graph Result Display By using the LOAD CSV method to import entities, relationships, and attributes, and exporting the Neo4j graph as a PNG file, the knowledge graph shown in Figure 9 was obtained. In the graph, the unique red node is named “Deep Foundation Pit Engineering Construction Technology Disclosure,” and the six surrounding blue nodes represent entity categories, which are: Project Basic Information, Construction Preparation, Construction Technology, Construction Organization Management, Standard Specifications, and Multimodal. The entire graph contains 803 entity nodes, 1509 entity relationships, and 46 attribute categories.
5.3. Entity Similarity Algorithm Result Analysis This study adopted the Jaccard entity similarity measurement algorithm integrated with the Word2Vec model and used a similarity evaluation test set containing 210 construction information entities and attributes. The test results were shown in Table 10.
The experimental analysis results indicated that the integrated algorithm outperformed the standalone Word2Vec model and the traditional Jaccard algorithm, demonstrating a high accuracy rate of 89.27%, which highlighted its excellent capability in correct matching for construction information alignment tasks. However, its recall rate was 74.38%, reflecting that approximately a quarter of the positive samples were not successfully identified. Analysis revealed that the main reason for this phenomenon was the ambiguity in the description of construction information attributes, as well as the high similarity between the construction entities and attributes returned by the knowledge graph and the input information entities and attributes, which led to a lower recall rate.
5.4. Analysis of Technology Disclosure Scheme Intelligent Generation Results After inputting the construction information for bored piles into the intelligent generation framework for technology disclosure schemes, the construction element analysis was first completed by the pre-trained BERT-BiLSTM-CRF deep learning model. The BERT layer captured contextual semantic representations, and the bidirectional LSTM network captured the temporal features of the construction information. Finally, the CRF layer was used to identify construction activity entities (e.g., water-stop curtain construction) and construction process entities (e.g., bored pile construction). Next, the Word2Vec-Jaccard hybrid model was used for entity alignment, locating the bored pile entity in the knowledge graph. This entity contained multiple bored pile technology disclosure examples, and then, through the attribute similarity algorithm, entity attributes were matched, and the top five bored pile technology disclosure case entities with the highest scores were calculated. These entities included five general attributes: entity name, foundation pit depth, safety level, soil layer type, surrounding building distance, and groundwater level, as well as eight specific attributes unique to bored piles: cement type, pile diameter, pile spacing, sinking speed, lifting speed, stirring axle speed, spraying method, and cement incorporation amount.
By default, the bored pile construction process entity with the highest score was selected. This entity contained the process flow entity and technical requirements entity. The process flow entity was connected to the bored pile process flow diagram entity, and the technical requirements entity was connected to the bored pile construction process diagram entity and bored pile construction sequence diagram entity through inclusion relationships. Image data was retrieved via cloud storage and could be directly called after retrieving the URL link.
By using the relationship rules and multi-hop graph inference rules defined during the construction of the knowledge graph, knowledge related to technology disclosure, including standard specifications, quality control, safety management, civilized construction, and environmental protection knowledge, could be retrieved. Additionally, technology disclosure videos could also be retrieved via the knowledge graph, and the videos were accessed through cloud storage by obtaining the URL link, which could be directly called after retrieval. If there was a change in the construction information, the intelligent generation framework dynamically adapted through a three-tier response mechanism (“parameter change-template matching-parameter reconstruction”). When an engineering change order (such as a construction parameter adjustment) was received, the intelligent generation framework first extracted the feature vectors of the changed entities and attributes. Then, a multi-dimensional match was performed in the multimodal knowledge graph, and the best-matching technology disclosure knowledge was inferred and retrieved. This knowledge was mapped to the technology disclosure scheme template for parameter reconstruction, thereby generating an updated technology disclosure scheme, ensuring the framework could dynamically respond to construction changes. In practical scenarios, such changes may originate from revised design drawings, on-site deviations, or risk warnings. The system monitors for these updates and extracts relevant entities or parameter changes from new inputs. It then re-evaluates case similarity and inference paths in the knowledge graph, adjusts matched templates accordingly, and regenerates a compliant CTD document. This enables real-time adaptation without restarting the entire pipeline, ensuring that generated disclosures reflect the current construction context accurately.
Through the above process, the intelligent generation of the technology disclosure scheme could be achieved, and the dynamic response to changes in the technology disclosure scheme could also be realized. Finally, the inferred and retrieved knowledge was mapped and output according to the designed technology disclosure scheme template, resulting in the generation of the technology disclosure scheme for the target construction activity. To assess the quality of the generated disclosure plans, we adopted both objective metrics and expert evaluation. The average field completion accuracy reached 96.4%, with a knowledge reuse rate of 72.5% and an average generation time of 18.7 s per plan. Semantic consistency with expert-authored templates was measured using cosine similarity, yielding a score of 0.87. Furthermore, three senior engineers independently evaluated the generated plans in terms of completeness, logical coherence, and regulatory compliance, resulting in an average score of 4.42 out of 5. The inter-rater agreement, calculated using Cohen’s Kappa, was 0.79, indicating substantial expert consensus. The results of the intelligent generation based on the multimodal knowledge graph were shown in Figure 10 (image display effect shows two pages combined).
By comparing the original technology disclosure scheme with the intelligently generated one, it was found that the original scheme lacked the three parts related to construction personnel, construction materials, and construction equipment in the construction preparation section and only covered on-site civilized construction, lacking environmental protection content. In contrast, the intelligently generated technology disclosure scheme, based on the technology disclosure scheme template and knowledge graph inference and retrieval, could intelligently generate a structurally complete technology disclosure scheme, reducing the omissions typically found in manual writing. While the current case study demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of the proposed framework, the validation remains limited to a single project. To strengthen generalizability, future work will extend the analysis to multiple cases under different geological conditions, contractors, and project locations. In addition, benchmarking against baseline approaches such as manual drafting and BIM-only workflows will provide a clearer comparative understanding of the benefits and limitations of the intelligent generation framework. In particular, the intelligent system ensured explicit inclusion of Environmental Protection and Safety Management content, which were either missing or incomplete in the manually prepared Construction Technology Disclosure Plan. This demonstrates the advantage of the proposed approach in systematically covering essential regulatory dimensions. To further validate the system’s practical effectiveness, we conducted a pilot user survey among construction technical personnel. Key performance indicators were compared against expected benchmarks, as shown in Table 11.
The relevant parameters for the intelligent generation of the technology disclosure scheme came partly from standard specification knowledge in the knowledge graph, which included constraints on quality, construction processes, safety, construction materials, construction equipment, civilized construction, and green construction. Another part came from construction design document information, and the last part came from historical case knowledge. These three sources not only facilitated the intelligent generation of technology disclosure knowledge but also enabled cross-validation, resulting in high attribute accuracy for the intelligent generation of technology disclosure schemes and strong operability. The multimodal knowledge graph based on technology disclosure knowledge could not only intelligently generate traditional document-based disclosure knowledge but also push construction process-related images and technology disclosure videos through graph inference and retrieval, promoting the standardization, acceleration, visualization, and intelligence of deep foundation pit engineering technology disclosure activities.
To further validate the effectiveness of each component, we conducted additional comparison and ablation experiments. The BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model outperformed classical CRF and LSTM-CRF baselines in NER, with over 8% higher F1-scores. A preliminary RAG-based method using construction codes generated fluent outputs but showed lower structural consistency compared to our approach. We also tested a graph embedding-based generation strategy, which lacked accuracy in capturing multi-step task dependencies.
In ablation studies, removing image and video inputs reduced completeness and field consistency by 6.8% and 4.3%, respectively. Excluding rule-based reasoning led to disordered task sequences and lower expert scores (from 4.42 to 3.7). Changing the fusion weights from 0.6/0.4 to other ratios also degraded performance. These results support the rationality of the system design.
6. Conclusions This study proposed the application of multimodal knowledge graph technology to the field of deep foundation pit engineering technology disclosure. Focusing on domain knowledge modeling, knowledge extraction, and knowledge application, it enhanced the systematization of intelligent knowledge generation for deep foundation pit engineering based on multimodal knowledge graphs. The main conclusions were as follows: Domain Knowledge Modeling and Relationship Categorization. Through the analysis of construction technology disclosure records, professional literature, and standard specification text knowledge characteristics in the deep foundation pit engineering domain, this study planned the conceptual system and relationship categories for the domain of deep foundation pit engineering technology disclosure. Specifically, the study classified entity categories into six aspects: basic project information, construction preparation, construction technology, construction management, multimodal, and standard specifications. Ten core relationship types were extracted, and a multi-level knowledge structure model was constructed, providing clear guidance for the extraction and filling of the knowledge graph data layer.
Knowledge Extraction Strategy and Method Construction. This study developed targeted knowledge extraction strategies based on the characteristic attributes of various texts and built a systematic domain knowledge extraction method. In the field of deep foundation pit engineering construction, for texts such as standard specification documents, professional books, and technology disclosure records, rule-based knowledge extraction techniques and BERT-BiLSTM-CRF deep learning models were comprehensively applied to achieve accurate extraction of entities and their attributes. Meanwhile, in the relationship extraction process, text structure analysis techniques combined with the BERT-CNN deep learning model ensured the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the relationship extraction. Additionally, multimodal entities, such as images and videos, were linked across modalities using semantic association rules by adding keyword tags and generating resource identifiers.
Neo4j-based Knowledge Storage Solution. This study designed a knowledge storage solution based on the Neo4j graph database. Knowledge triples extracted from multimodal data sources were imported into the Neo4j database to construct the multimodal TDFPC knowledge graph. As a core tool for knowledge management, the knowledge graph not only provided a storage carrier for the integration and accumulation of TDFPC domain knowledge but also offered an effective path for the intuitive presentation of knowledge and laid the data foundation for subsequent intelligent knowledge generation.
Intelligent Generation of Technology Disclosure Schemes. Based on the needs of technical managers, this study conducted research on the intelligent generation of technology disclosure schemes based on multimodal knowledge graphs. A technology disclosure scheme template, containing nine modules, was designed for technology disclosure records and domain-specific books. Using the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF deep learning model, entities and attributes of target construction information were recognized. For numeric and character-type attributes, historical case entity and attribute matching was carried out using cosine similarity and Word2Vec-Jaccard methods. Based on the construction activity entity with the highest matching score, graph inference and retrieval were performed according to knowledge graph relationship rules and multi-hop inference rules. The final results of inference and retrieval were returned and mapped to the technology disclosure scheme template, achieving the intelligent generation of deep foundation pit engineering construction technology disclosure schemes, meeting the business needs on construction sites, and promoting the standardization, acceleration, visualization, and intelligence of deep foundation pit engineering construction technology disclosure activities.
In terms of scalability, the framework has the potential to be generalized beyond deep foundation pit projects. Since the core mechanism is based on a multimodal knowledge graph and rule-based inference, it can in principle be adapted to other construction domains such as bridges and tunnels by expanding the ontology and disclosure templates with domain-specific entities, relations, and standards. In particular, the framework’s modular architecture enables adaptation without reengineering the entire pipeline. For example, in bridge or tunnel projects, the system can incorporate new ontological concepts such as span type, bearing capacity, or tunnel lining methods by updating the entity schema and retraining on relevant annotated corpora. Moreover, the template-based document generation module supports reconfiguration of output formats according to regulatory requirements in diverse construction subdomains. This flexibility demonstrates the generalizability of the proposed system to a broader range of civil infrastructure scenarios. Future work will focus on extending the knowledge base and verifying the framework across different types of construction projects to demonstrate broader applicability.
The ontology-based design allows the system to be extended beyond deep excavation to other construction types, as well as adapted to different regulatory standards. Scalability evaluations showed stable performance with large graphs, with reasoning time under 2 s and storage under 2.5 GB, demonstrating feasibility for real-world engineering scenarios.

Despite the promising results, this study has several limitations. First, the application scope is currently limited to deep excavation projects, which may restrict generalizability to other construction domains. Second, the preparation of training data relied on manual annotation, which is time-consuming and may introduce subjectivity. Third, the available dataset size was limited, which constrained the performance of deep models. Fourth, validation was conducted on a single case project, and comparative benchmarking against alternative approaches such as manual drafting and BIM-only workflows was not included. These limitations partly explain the residual errors observed. Future work will therefore focus on expanding the domain coverage, reducing annotation costs through semi-automatic methods, leveraging larger domain-specific corpora, and conducting multi-case evaluations with systematic baseline comparisons to better demonstrate robustness and practical value.

Abstract: The growing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially Generative AI (GenAI), is revolutionising the way knowledge is handled and opening up enormous potential for corporate knowledge management (KM). The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLM) and complementary technologies such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) or knowledge graphs opens up new opportunities for corporate KM, but also presents companies with complex challenges and barriers. This study examines the integration of genAI into corporate KM, taking into account a holistic sociotechnical approach. A AI4KM survey was designed to capture the current state of AI use by asking companies about their use of AI technologies. The survey aims to gain insights into the practical implementation of AI solutions, particularly in relation to KM challenges. Based on the results of the AI4KM survey, a socio-technical TOP approach (Technology - Organisation - People) for the introduction of AI-based KM will be developed, which takes into account not only technical, but also organisational and people-related aspects. By addressing these three factors, the study aims to provide a comprehensive framework that ensures the successful adoption of AI technologies in diverse business environments. Specific recommendations for the development of an effective, holistic AI strategy in KM are developed for the various barriers. Among other things, the importance of human-machine interaction will be emphasised in order to create a seamless link between human expertise and machine intelligence. The results of these studies should help companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), to effectively use genAI technologies for their KM, to counteract the loss of knowledge due to demographic change and to increase their competitiveness. The combination of theoretical findings and practical recommendations will build a bridge between research and business practice, contributing to the successful integration of AI into corporate KM and equipping companies for the challenges of the future.

1. Introduction
In the context of increasing digitalisation, demographic change, and mounting competitive pressure, the ability of organisations to manage knowledge effectively has become more critical than ever. Knowledge is widely acknowledged as a key strategic resource and a core enabler of organisational performance, innovation, and resilience (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Spender & Grant, 1996). However, many companies still struggle to operationalise knowledge management (KM) in a way that ensures long-term availability, accessibility, and productive use of organisational knowledge.
At the same time, the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), driven by rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and knowledge graphs, is profoundly transforming how knowledge is created, structured, and shared. Technology has long been a core enabler of KM. Traditional KM technologies such as knowledge repositories, collaborative platforms, and document management systems have shaped the way knowledge is stored and accessed. More recently, GenAI tools like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot have added powerful new capabilities such as contextual search, summarisation, and automation of routine knowledge tasks (Liu et al., 2023; Nazeer et al., 2023). These technologies offer new possibilities for solving long-standing KM challenges - such as knowledge silos, fragmented documentation, or the loss of critical expertise - but also introduce new risks and uncertainties (Davenport & Mittal, 2022). Understanding how these technologies affect KM effectiveness is crucial to leveraging their full potential.
Despite the increasing popularity of GenAI tools, their integration into enterprise knowledge processes remains largely experimental. Many organisations, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), lack clear strategies for embedding GenAI in their operational and knowledge ecosystems. In addition to technological issues such as data quality and system interoperability, organisational and human factors often hinder adoption. These include unclear roles, resource limitations, lack of AI competencies, and low user acceptance (Märkel & Lundborg, 2020; BMWi, 2021; Bughin et al., 2018).
The existing literature on KM and AI integration tends to focus either on theoretical models or on specific technologies. Holistic, practice-oriented SME-applicable frameworks that address the socio-technical interplay between technical aspects (technology) and social aspects (organisation & people) remain scarce (Grüneke et al., 2024). To bridge this gap, the present study explores how companies approach the integration of GenAI in their knowledge environments. The study is based on the AI4KM survey, which captures both current practices and perceived barriers from a socio-technical perspective.
The aim of this paper is twofold: First, it presents key findings from the AI4KM survey on the current use and challenges of GenAI in corporate KM. Second, it introduces a practical framework - the TOP approach (Technology - Organisation - People) - designed to support the effective and responsible implementation of GenAI tools in knowledge-intensive settings. By offering both empirical insights and actionable recommendations, the study seeks to support organisations - particularly SMEs - in leveraging the potential of GenAI while addressing critical implementation challenges. In doing so, it contributes to building a conceptual and practical bridge between AI innovation and KM strategy.
2. Knowledge Management and its Challenges
In today's dynamic and knowledge-intensive environments, the ability to manage knowledge effectively has become a key factor for organisational success (North & Gueldenberg, 2011). KM encompasses the structured processes of developing, preserving, sharing, applying and continuously improving asset knowledge so that it contributes to the achievement of the organisation's objectives, value creation and long-term competitiveness (ISO 30401:2018). Especially in times of demographic shifts, increased complexity, and accelerating digitalisation, KM plays a vital role in preserving know-how, facilitating collaboration, and ensuring continuity.
While KM is a strategic issue across all sectors, its relevance is particularly pronounced in SME. These companies often depend heavily on the expertise of individual employees, yet they frequently lack the formal structures, dedicated resources, or technological support to implement comprehensive KM systems. As a result, knowledge remains undocumented, is difficult to access, or is lost when people leave the organisation. Studies show that SMEs are especially vulnerable to such losses, as informal communication channels and role overlaps dominate daily operations (Orth et al., 2011; Durst & Edvardsson, 2012; Voigt et al., 2016).
In addition to structural limitations, organisations also face a number of persistent challenges in managing knowledge effectively. Fraunhofer IPK conducted a survey of companies and knowledge-intensive organisations on typical KM challenges (e.g. Orth et al., 2011; Orth et al., 2023). The results show that the five biggest challenges are 1) the (re-)use of existing knowledge for new projects and services, 2) the fast integration of new employees into the organization (e.g. systematic onboarding process), 3) the use of knowledge to optimize processes and products as well as 4) the capturing and communicating the knowledge in people's heads and 5) a lack of transparency regarding the internally available competences.
Recent meta-analytical research confirms that knowledge management technologies (KMT) are not merely supportive tools but strategic enablers of organisational performance, particularly in knowledge-intensive environments (Liu et al., 2023). In this context, GenAI technologies offer new possibilities for overcoming persistent KM challenges. Based on large language models, these tools can synthesise content, support classification and retrieval tasks, and generate knowledge artefacts like summaries or documentation. They can, for instance, support onboarding, reduce information silos, or help capture and reuse tacit knowledge (Davenport & Mittal, 2022). As Sumbal et al. (2024) argue, such AI-driven capabilities are reshaping KM from static repositories into dynamic, interactive ecosystems.
However, the integration of GenAI into organisational KM is not without its challenges. Besides technical questions around data quality and system compatibility, issues such as user acceptance, trust, and responsible use are central to successful adoption. The use of AI tools for knowledge work must therefore be embedded not only in IT infrastructures but also in organisational routines and human workflows (Märkel & Lundborg, 2020; Grüneke et al., 2024) - highlighting the need for socio-technical integration.
Although KM and AI have been widely discussed in the literature, research has predominantly concentrated only on statistical surveys, technological architectures, or abstract management models. What is lacking are empirically grounded, practice-oriented frameworks with concrete recommendations for action that acknowledge the complex socio-technical dynamics of GenAI implementation. In this context, the present paper aims to provide both empirical insights and a structured approach to guide the adoption of GenAI in KM settings. The following section presents the design and key findings of the AI4KM survey, which provide the empirical foundation for the recommendations developed in this study.
3. AI4KM-Study: Survey Design and Findings
In light of the growing relevance of GenAI for corporate KM, the AI4KM survey was developed to investigate current application practices, perceived potential, and implementation barriers. The study particularly focuses on capturing how organizations approach GenAI within knowledge processes, what challenges they encounter, and which expectations they associate with its use. Adopting an exploratory, practice-oriented perspective, the study aims to provide empirical insights into the integration of AI technologies in KM. The standardized online questionnaire was implemented using LimeSurvey and made available in both German and English to ensure accessibility across different organisational contexts. Designed to be concise and user-friendly, the survey takes approximately ten minutes to complete. Participation is anonymous and voluntary. The questionnaire comprises four thematic sections: (1) the current state of AI adoption within the company, (2) the anticipated value of GenAI for organization's most pressing KM challenges, (3) perceived barriers to GenAI implementation, and (4) Application Areas for GenAI Solutions. A detailed analysis of the content and findings of these sections is presented in the following sections.
Data collection began in June 2024, with the survey disseminated via professional and academic networks, conferences, and relevant newsletters. Due to its open distribution, the study follows a non-probabilistic, selfselection sampling approach, which is common in exploratory research on emerging technologies where early empirical orientation is prioritized over statistical representativeness. As the survey remains open at the time of writing, data collection is still ongoing, and no definitive response rate can be reported. Rather than targeting a fixed population, the study seeks to gather diverse perspectives from various sectors and organisational types. This methodological setup enables the identification of both common patterns and contextual differences in how companies engage with GenAI in their knowledge environments. It should be noted that the AI4KM survey exhibited a relatively high dropout rate across the questionnaire. As a result, the number of valid responses varies between individual questions. For each question analysed, the corresponding number of respondents (n) is indicated in parentheses. Due to these variations in the base sample, percentages may not always be directly comparable across all questions. Nevertheless, the results provide valuable exploratory insights into the current use, perceived potential, and barriers related to AI and GenAI adoption in corporate KM. They serve as a foundation for the development of actionable recommendations and a socio-technical framework that addresses the interplay between technological, organisational, and human dimensions of GenAI adoption in KM.
3.1 Status quo
The AI4KM survey shows a heterogeneous landscape regarding the current use of AI and GenAI technologies in companies (n = 64). Overall, 39% of participants reported having multiple AI solutions operational, while 17% stated that they had implemented a single solution. Another 17% have conducted pilot tests without operational deployment, and 14% are in the planning stage. Only a small share has decided against AI adoption or has yet to engage with the topic. Focusing on GenAI specifically (n= 63), 36.5% of respondents indicated that GenAI applications are already in operational use. Among those planning adoptions, around 33% expect implementation within the next 12 months, while 20% consider GenAI currently irrelevant to their organisation. These findings suggest that, although early operational use of AI is relatively widespread, GenAI adoption is still emerging, with companies either actively moving towards integration or remaining cautious due to strategic uncertainties.
3.2 GenAI for KM Challenges
Participants were asked to assess the extent to which they expect GenAI tools to support various KM activities (n = 45). The highest expectations were recorded for fast search and identification of knowledge, reuse of existing knowledge for projects and services, and optimisation of processes and products. Also highly rated were structuring and networking of data repositories and knowledge transfer within and between projects. Expectations were slightly lower - but still clearly positive - for capturing tacit knowledge, knowledge transfer between generations, and supporting onboarding. All average ratings remained above rather agree (4) on the six-point scale - ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (6), indicating that companies broadly expect GenAI to contribute meaningfully across a wide range of KM tasks (see Figure 1).
Independently of GenAI use, participants ranked their three most pressing KM challenges (n = 42). The most frequently selected issues were structuring and networking of data repositories, reuse of existing knowledge for new projects and services, and fast search and identification of knowledge. Challenges related to capturing and communicating tacit knowledge, as well as knowledge use for process and product optimisation, also ranked highly. These results underline a strong operational need for better knowledge organisation, retrieval, and reuse mechanisms across organisations.
A comparison of expected GenAI support and current KM challenges reveals a remarkable degree of alignment. Organisations primarily expect GenAI to address exactly those areas where they perceive the most urgent KM challenges. Minor differences are observable: knowledge transfer between projects, while highly expected as a GenAI-supported activity, was not prioritised among the top current challenges. Overall, the findings suggest a realistic understanding among organisations regarding both the capabilities and the limitations of GenAI in KM, particularly in socially complex tasks like tacit knowledge capture.
3.3 Barriers to the Implementation of GenAI Solutions
The AI4KM survey also examined the barriers companies face when implementing GenAI solutions for KM (n = 35). Participants rated their level of agreement with several potential barriers on a six-point scale, ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (6). The results show that concerns about data quality and quantity were rated highest across all categories, achieving the strongest agreement (see Figure 2). This highlights the critical dependency of GenAI applications on clean, comprehensive, and reliable datasets. Organisational challenges such as the development of a company-specific AI strategy, legal and regulatory issues, and the provision of resources were also identified as major barriers. Respondents indicated significant concern regarding the lack of strategic alignment, compliance risks, and insufficient investment in AI initiatives. Among people-related factors, competence and skill development emerged as a substantial hurdle. Many organisations reported gaps in employee capabilities to work effectively with GenAI systems, particularly in areas such as prompt engineering and critical evaluation of AI outputs. Technical barriers, notably the integration of GenAI into existing IT infrastructures, were likewise rated high. Additionally, employee acceptance and ethical considerations - while still relevant - were perceived as slightly less severe barriers compared to other issues. Overall, the findings indicate that companies face a complex mix of technological, organisational, and people-related challenges in embedding GenAI into their KM processes.
3.4 Application Areas for GenAI Solutions
The AI4KM survey also explored how companies assess the potential of GenAI technologies to improve various business processes and functional areas (n = 35). Respondents rated the perceived improvement potential on a scale from no improvement potential (1) to very high improvement potential (6). The results indicate that information technology and research and development are perceived as the areas with the greatest improvement potential (see Figure 3) Companies expect GenAI to enhance IT processes, accelerate research activities, and drive innovation. Other functions, such as logistics, production/service delivery, and marketing and sales, were also rated highly, suggesting that organisations increasingly view GenAI as a tool for operational optimisation and customer engagement. In contrast, functions like human resource management, customer service and after-sales, procurement, and controlling and finance received moderate ratings. These areas may present additional challenges for GenAI adoption due to regulatory, relational, or process-specific complexities. Overall, the findings reveal broad optimism regarding the role of GenAI in business processes, with particularly strong expectations in technology-intensive and innovation-driven domains.
The AI4KM survey highlights strong interest in leveraging GenAI for KM and broader business processes. Organisations primarily seek support in knowledge retrieval, reuse, and data structuring, while facing barriers related to data quality, strategy development, and employee competencies. Overall, the findings suggest a cautiously optimistic view: GenAI is seen as a key enabler, yet its successful integration depends on addressing technical, organisational, and human factors simultaneously.
4. Towards Socio-Technical Integration: The TOP Framework for GenAI in Knowledge Management
The integration of GenAI technologies into KM presents both unprecedented opportunities and complex challenges for organisations. While technical innovations such as LLMs and RAG systems offer powerful tools to enhance knowledge processes, their successful and responsible implementation requires more than technological readiness alone. The findings of the AI4KM survey underline that technological, organisational, and human factors all play critical roles in enabling or hindering the adoption of GenAI solutions for KM. To address these interdependent dimensions systematically, this chapter proposes a socio-technical integration framework based on the principles of the established TOM model (Technologie-Organisation-Mensch) and tailored to the specific challenges of GenAI. The adapted TOP framework (Technology - Organisation - People) serves as a structured orientation for practice and provides actionable guidance for overcoming identified barriers and achieving sustainable GenAI-supported KM.
4.1 Deriving the Socio-Technical TOP Framework for GenAI Integration in Knowledge Management
The theoretical foundation for the integration framework proposed here draws on the socio-technical TOM model, originally developed by Bullinger, Wörner, and Prieto at the Fraunhofer IAO in 1997 (Bullinger et al., 1998). TOM established that successful KM initiatives depend on the simultaneous and balanced consideration of technological infrastructures, organisational structures, and human factors.
Building on this tradition, researchers at Fraunhofer IPK, including Heisig and Orth further advanced the sociotechnical perspective by operationalising TOM principles in practice-oriented frameworks such as GPO-WM® and ProWis (Heisig & Orth, 2005; Orth et al., 2011). These models showed that sustainable KM cannot be achieved through IT solutions alone but requires organisational alignment and human-centred strategies.
In the context of GenAI integration, this socio-technical view gains even greater relevance. While GenAI technologies can automate content generation, support knowledge retrieval, and accelerate knowledge structuring, their full potential can only unfold if embedded in appropriate processes, supported by user competencies, and governed by responsible organisational practices.
The AI4KM survey results confirm the necessity of this integrated approach. Respondents identified major barriers across all three dimensions - technology (e.g., poor data quality, IT integration issues), organisation (e.g., lack of AI strategy, legal uncertainties, lack of resources), and people (e.g., skills gaps, employee resistance).
Against this background, the TOP framework is proposed as an adapted, practice-oriented extension for the specific case of GenAI-supported KM:
* Technology (T) addresses the deployment, integration, and quality management of GenAI solutions. The focus lies on improving data infrastructures, ensuring interoperability, and embedding GenAI systems seamlessly into existing IT landscapes.
* Organisation (O) focuses on strategic alignment, AI governance, regulatory compliance, and resource planning. It ensures that GenAI initiatives are aligned with KM and business objectives and that legal and ethical standards are met.
* People (P) targets the development of user competences (e.g., AI literacy, prompt engineering) and the facilitation of change management processes that foster acceptance, trust, and human-machine collaboration.
This three-dimensional framework forms the conceptual basis for deriving targeted recommendations for action, which are detailed in the following section.
4.2 Addressing the Barriers: Recommendations for Practice
The barriers analysed in the AI4KM survey demonstrate that organisations must adopt a holistic, coordinated approach to realise the benefits of GenAI technologies for KM. Based on the adapted socio-technical TOP framework (Technology - Organisation - People), the following recommendations provide actionable guidance for overcoming the key obstacles identified.
Technology
Ensuring and continuously improving data quality is a foundational requirement. Organisations should establish structured processes for data cleansing and maintenance to guarantee that GenAI systems are trained and operated on clean, representative, and up-to-date datasets (BMWi, 2021; PwC, 2019; Davenport & Ronanki, 2018). In addition, it is crucial to provide sufficient data volumes for GenAI applications. Researchers highlight that the generation and augmentation of synthetic data can significantly enhance training datasets, especially when real data is scarce (BMWi, 2021; Davenport & Ronanki, 2018; Goodfellow et al., 2016; Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019). Building modular and scalable GenAI architectures that ensure seamless integration into existing IT infrastructures is essential. Such architectures should prioritise interoperability, data security, and scalability from the outset (Grüneke et al., 2024).
Organisation
Developing clear legal compliance frameworks is essential to manage risks related to data use and AI-generated content, particularly regarding data protection, liability, and transparency (Ogolla et al., 2020; BMWi, 2021). In parallel, organisations are advised to define ethical guidelines that prioritise fairness, transparency, and nondiscrimination (BMWi, 2021; Ogolla et al., 2020). Strategic planning and early securing of resources - both financial and human - is a key success factor for sustainable GenAI initiatives. (Grüneke et al., 2024; BMWi, 2021). The inclusion of interdisciplinary teams, particularly those with domain-specific knowledge, and a proactive resource strategy significantly enhance implementation feasibility (Ogolla et al., 2020). Finally, a company-specific AI strategy is needed that aligns GenAI efforts with overarching business and knowledge management goals to ensure long-term value creation (Grüneke et al., 2024; Liebowitz, 2001).
People
To address skills gaps among employees, companies should launch targeted training programmes focused on AI fundamentals, media competence, and prompt engineering. Such measures build AI literacy and enable confident tool usage (Grüneke et al., 2024; BMWi, 2021). Structured change management processes should accompany the rollout of GenAI solutions to foster acceptance. Transparent communication, participation formats, and support services are critical to reducing employee fears and building trust (Ogolla et al., 2020; Grüneke et al., 2024; Osterloh & Frey, 2000). Establishing human-machine interaction (HMI) as a guiding principle is essential. Organisations should emphasise augmentation rather than substitution of human capabilities, enabling creative collaboration between employees and GenAI systems (Ogolla et al., 2020; Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014; Daugherty & Wilson, 2018).
In line with the socio-technical TOP framework and based on the AI4KM survey findings, the following table summarises the key barriers to GenAI integration in KM. Each identified barrier is mapped to the corresponding TOP dimension and paired with specific recommended actions and their anticipated impacts (see Table 1). The recommendations are intended to support organisations in systematically addressing technological, organisational, and people-related challenges, thereby creating the conditions for a responsible, sustainable, and human-centred deployment of GenAI in KM contexts.
The overview illustrates that successful GenAI integration into KM requires coordinated interventions across all three TOP dimensions. While technological readiness remains crucial, strategic governance structures, legal and ethical safeguards, competence development, and a culture of human-machine collaboration are equally important for achieving long-term effectiveness and organisational acceptance of GenAI-supported knowledge systems.
5. Conclusion and Outlook
GenAI offers unprecedented opportunities for transforming KM, especially for SMEs with limited resources. By automating content generation, enhancing knowledge structuring, and improving information retrieval, GenAI technologies can help SMEs overcome traditional challenges related to scalability, knowledge retention, and accessibility.
The results of the AI4KM survey show that companies are well aware of the potential of GenAI for enhancing their knowledge processes. High expectations were recorded for tasks such as the reuse of existing knowledge, the structuring of data repositories, and the acceleration of internal knowledge flows. However, the practical implementation of GenAI in KM remains hesitant. Many organisations are still in pilot stages, with limited operational experience, and only a small share has developed strategic, large-scale initiatives for GenAI integration. The analysis of barriers confirms that technology is only part of the equation. In addition to technical obstacles such as data quality and IT integration, organisational challenges (e.g., lack of AI strategies, insufficient resource planning) and human factors (e.g., skills gaps, resistance to change) present significant hurdles. These findings underscore the necessity of adopting a comprehensive, socio-technical perspective when implementing GenAI in KM.
The TOP framework (Technology - Organisation - People) developed in this study provides a structured orientation for addressing these challenges. It highlights that successful and sustainable GenAI integration requires balanced attention to technological infrastructures, organisational strategies, and human competencies alike. By systematically addressing these three dimensions, organisations can better manage the complexity of GenAI adoption and enhance the chances of achieving meaningful improvements in knowledge practices.
This paper contributes to the discourse on AI in KM by proposing an empirically grounded socio-technical framework, that offers practitioners actionable guidance to overcome implementation barriers and align AI with business goals. By combining theoretical insight and managerial relevance, the study strengthens the link between academic research and organisational application.
Future research should focus on systematically operationalising the individual dimensions of the proposed framework across diverse organisational contexts. This entails developing concrete tools, methodologies, and support mechanisms to translate the elements of Technology, Organisation, and People into practical, contextsensitive interventions. A key initiative in this regard could be the development of a GenAI-specific readiness assessment (AI-Readiness-Check). Based on the TOP framework, such an instrument could help organisations assess their current level of preparedness for GenAI-supported KM initiatives, identify gaps in their technological, organisational, and human capabilities, and prioritise actions accordingly. A tailored readiness assessment would offer a valuable starting point for companies aiming to move from experimentation to systematic, large-scale GenAI integration. Overall, GenAI holds immense promise for reshaping KM. However, its full potential can only be realised through holistic, well-coordinated approaches that bridge technology, organisation, and people.

Abstract: This paper presents the first results of a doctoral research project on the management of scientific tacit knowledge of employees with long scientific seniority (LSS), defined as 25+ years post-doctorate, focusing on knowledge transfer in the academic environment related to construction. The primary goal of this doctoral research is to create a model that supports the transfer of LSS tacit knowledge to other employees. The research question is: How should the tacit knowledge of LSSs be managed to preserve and pass their legacy on to younger generations? The SECI knowledge spiral model was adopted as the foundation for the development of the proposed model. However, the classical SECI framework has been extended by incorporating two critical roles: The Custodian, responsible for preserving, structuring, and documenting the tacit knowledge of LSS; and The Successor, an individual actively acquiring and applying tacit knowledge in practice, ensuring its continuity in scientific work. The model was developed based on a triangulated research approach combining an online survey, in-depth interviews, and an extended literature review. Thirteen research organisations participated in the study: six from Poland and seven from Europe. 52 completed surveys were obtained (100%) and 51 interviews were conducted (98%). The results were subjected to both qualitative and quantitative analysis. The proposed model operationalises tacit knowledge transfer through a structured process aligned with the SECI phases: socialisation, externalisation, combination, and internalisation, adapted to the realities of scientific institutions. It introduces mechanisms for actively acquiring and preserving knowledge through a combination of traditional methods such as mentoring and coaching, and modern technological solutions, ensuring that the legacy of experienced researchers remains accessible and functional for future generations. This study contributes by proposing a structured, role-based framework that enhances the practical applicability of tacit knowledge management in construction academia. The paper concludes by discussing the practical applications of the model and its potential for broader adaptation to knowledge-intensive institutions.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Tacit knowledge (TK) has always been an asset for a competitive advantage. In times of advantageous technological solutions, we look at the organisation's resources more carefully than before. In the case of science, the situation is slightly different; there are some commonly known foundations, but there is also tacit knowledge relating strictly to science. This study aims to introduce the concept of scientific tacit knowledge in construction and a model supporting its transfer.
The research topic stems from the author's professional experience related to her work at the Building Research Institute (ITB) since 2016. The ITB is an esteemed Polish institution with a rich 80-year history of pioneering construction research that maintains a diverse team of over 300 employees. Two opposing mechanisms of tacit knowledge management have been observed in the ITB. The first mechanism concerns the challenges of transferring knowledge from senior researchers because their impending retirement may result in a significant loss of expert knowledge. The second illustrates the successful acquisition of tacit knowledge through interactive observation, a process that the author experienced personally during her cooperation with the scientific secretary of ITB, an outstanding scientist in the field of civil engineering.
The main focus of this study is an employee with long scientific seniority (LSS), an individual who obtained a PhD degree at least 25 years ago (for this study, 1999 and earlier), and tacit knowledge relating to the field of construction science. This field is characterised by a conservative and formal approach, resulting from the obligations involved in designing and erecting buildings. This attitude can hinder knowledge diffusion. In addition, tacit knowledge can be an essential resource for further development of construction science.
1.2 Research Focus
1.2.1 Scientific gap
The noticed scientific gap refers to the primary process of sharing scientific tacit knowledge (and, more broadly, other processes) by LSS employees, who, thanks to their unique life, professional, and scientific experience, have unique scientific tacit knowledge, which translates into high scientific and research potential. The determinant here is not the employee's age, but his or her scientific experience counted from the year of obtaining a doctoral degree. Construction is a field characterised by formality and conservativeness because of the obligation to design and erect buildings. In this context, the tacit knowledge of construction scientists, which is a combination of experience, skills, and engineering intuition, is an important resource that can influence the development of scientific knowledge in the field of construction.
1.2.2 Research problem definition
The primary aim of this study was to develop a model that will support the management of scientific tacit knowledge of LSSs in scientific institutions in the field of construction science. This tacit knowledge can be a foundation for future studies, giving younger researchers a plethora of guidelines and ways of conducting research that have been proven through time. The main research question of this study is: "How should the tacit knowledge of LSSs be managed to preserve and pass their legacy on to younger generations?"
2. The Theoretical Foundations
2.1 The SECI Model
Nonaka and Takeuchi's (1995) SECI model was chosen as the best model for managing and transferring tacit knowledge. It conceptualises knowledge creation as a dynamic and continuous process, structured into four modes of knowledge conversion: Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination, and Internalisation. Socialisation involves sharing tacit knowledge through shared experiences, whereas Externalisation transforms tacit knowledge into explicit concepts using dialogue, metaphors, and models. Combination integrates and systematises explicit knowledge to create new knowledge structures, whereas Internalisation enables individuals to absorb explicit knowledge and convert it back into tacit knowledge through practice and experience. The model emphasises the interplay between individual and collective learning processes, highlighting the importance of context, interaction, and organisational support in fostering innovation and knowledge retention.
2.2 Scientific Tacit Knowledge
Several studies on scientific tacit knowledge (STK) exist in different research contexts but not specifically in construction. Collins (2001) indicated that tacit knowledge is essential for replicating complex scientific experiments, particularly in physics. He highlighted personal contact and social interactions, particularly in complex experimental settings. Senker (1995) associates' tacit knowledge with cognitive concepts, such as schemata, paradigms, and mental models. Starikova and Sereda (2023) suggest that tacit knowledge is structured according to specific problems, indicating a systematic role in scientific cognition. Carsten Conner et al. (2018) emphasise the role of mentorship and apprenticeship, primarily associated with being a field scientist. The author defines scientific tacit knowledge as subjective knowledge inextricably linked to the researcher and the scientific context in which they operate. It is acquired in the process of scientific and cognitive studies and research, including experiences, experiments, trials, informal observations, laboratory or field practices, and conclusions, reflections, and value judgments collected on this basis. It manifests itself as a subjective view and assessment of an objectified research process aimed at reaching the essence of scientific truth, influencing the findings of the process. It includes practical skills, research strategies and procedures, and contextual and interpretative understanding, which are crucial for conducting research but are difficult to convey to others. No publications were found referring to scientific tacit knowledge in construction. However, it should be noted that the definition of tacit knowledge in construction has been defined by Pathirage et al. (2008) as "understanding, abilities, skills and experience of the person concerned; often expressed in action as thoughts, viewpoints, evaluations, and advice; produced and acquired by past experiences [...]".
3. Methods
3.1 Research Design
A qualitative approach was adopted in this study. The following methods have been utilised:
* Review and critiquing the literature
* Online questionnaires (pilot and main survey)
* In-depth interviews
* Literature review
The study employs methodological triangulation (Denzin, 1978)-combining an online survey with in-depth interviews-and theoretical triangulation by contrasting the empirical results with insights from a focused literature review on barriers to tacit knowledge management in academic settings
The pilot study was conducted in December 2023. The main online survey was conducted from March 2024 to November 2024. The in-depth interviews were conducted from April 15th, 2024, until March 11th, 2025.
3.2 Sample Selection
The research has been conducted across 13 scientific institutions, six from Poland and seven from European countries. Five research institutes were involved (two from Poland and four from Europe) and eight construction faculties of polytechnics/universities. A purposive non-random sampling strategy was adopted, which included:
* 16 LSS individuals
* nine individuals serving as LSS leaders, L-LSS
* 27 individuals cooperating with LSS, C-LSS
The pilot online survey was conducted in one Polish research institute, and the main survey and the in-depth interviews were conducted in all 13 scientific institutions.
3.3 The Online Survey
Firstly, the anonymous pilot survey was conducted in one Polish institution (Tomiczak, 2024). As a result, some changes were introduced to the actual questionnaire, adding more context and detailed descriptions to ensure a better understanding of the questions. The actual online survey was designed in Polish and English using the startquestion.com website. The survey questionnaire consisted of 94 questions divided into five Areas: I. Statements concerning the awareness of hidden knowledge; II. Statements concerning personal motivation to share (or not) the LSS persons' tacit knowledge; III. Statements concerning traditional vs innovative approach; IV. Statements concerning the organisation's support for knowledge sharing; V. Statements concerning generation diversity management. The respondents were asked to rate the statements on a Likert scale (1-5), where one means "I strongly disagree" and five means "I strongly agree." There were no restrictions on the time needed to complete the survey, and the survey was anonymous. As there were three different groups of respondents, the questions in the first two Areas were differentiated according to the role of the individual. The remaining three Areas were identical for all the groups. At the end, there was a space for comment on the survey, and so-called metrics for each group. The questionnaire was sent as a PDF document a week before the link to the survey was sent so the individuals could have more time to familiarise themselves with the statements. The main goal of this survey was to explore how the LSS persons and their knowledge are perceived in the construction academia environment. Based on the results from this survey, the questionnaire for in-depth interviews was designed.
3.4 The in-depth Interviews
The questionnaire for the in-depth interviews, in Polish and English, consisted of a glossary of terms used in the interview and seventeen open questions. There were two versions of the questionnaire: one for LSS persons and one for leaders and co-workers of LSS persons. The questionnaire was sent to an individual a week before the interview. The online interviews were conducted when only one individual from the institution was involved in the interview, or there were unforeseen problems. The maximum assumed duration of the interview was 2.5 hours. The main goal of the interviews was to deepen the understanding of the LSS's role in the organisation and the ways of involving LSS persons in the daily activities connected to sharing tacit knowledge - from different perspectives, but also to understand the impact of the organisational environment.
3.5 The Literature Review
Two databases were used for this review - Scopus and Web of Science (WoS). The research question was: "What are the key challenges and barriers in the application of knowledge management in research and academic institutions, and how do they vary across different employee groups and knowledge-intensive roles?" The following inclusion criteria were used: only papers in English published between 2013 and 2025; Areas: Business, Management and Accounting, Social Sciences, Decision Sciences, Psychology, keywords: "knowledge management," "knowledge sharing," "knowledge transfer," "knowledge-sharing," open access: green and gold. The exclusion criteria were Areas of Computer Science, Economics, Econometrics and Finance.
The result in Scopus was 991 papers. Then, abstracts of those papers were screened using the keyword "knowledge management" in the title or abstract (using the Zotero tool). The result (updated on March 3rd, 2025) was 457 papers. Twenty-six articles were removed due to unavailability of the full text. In the next stage, 431 papers from the Scopus database were considered. The result of the research in the WoS database was 65 papers. After removing the duplicates (four papers) and one retracted paper, 491 papers from both databases were selected for the deeper review.
4. Results
4.1 The Research Sample Structure
Fifty-two individuals from 13 institutions took part in the study. 37% of participants were from European institutions, and 63% were from Polish institutions. Below (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) is the summary of data characterising the research sample in more detail.
The smallest group of respondents is the leaders of LSS persons due to the specific nature of the university's activities, where the LSS person often serves as a leader. It should also be noted that some European institutions were represented only by one individual - two LSS and one C-LSS person.
4.2 Survey Results
A complete set of 52 completed questionnaires from thirteen institutions was obtained: 33 from Poland and 19 from European institutions. There is a common agreement that the LSS person is an authority and an expert in the field of construction - their tacit knowledge is essential, they have unique skills that are very helpful for the team, and their knowledge and experience are valuable as the foundation for the future development of younger generations. The responses of co-workers of LSS persons in European institutions were slightly different from those of other groups - the responses "I don't know" were more frequent here. The main discrepancies in the responses were Area I. (Awareness of hidden knowledge) and Area II. (Personal motivation to share (or not) LSS's hidden knowledge). These themes were then developed through in-depth interviews. There was a general agreement between Polish and European institutions regarding the statements in Area III. (Traditional vs. innovative approach), Area IV (Organisation's support for knowledge sharing), and Area V. (Generation diversity management).
4.3 IDI Results
Fifty-one interviews were conducted: 46 on-site (90%) and five online (10%) interviews using the MS Teams application. Fifty interviews were recorded, and transcription was performed using the AI tool Turboscribe, adding notes from the interview that was not permitted to be recorded. The interviews revealed key insights into tacit knowledge transfers. Respondents emphasised the fundamental role of effective communication and informal interactions in transferring TK. Mentorship, especially through joint projects, observation, and structured support, was considered central. Institutional support was highlighted, mainly in recognising and rewarding LSS persons and providing networking platforms and interdisciplinary collaboration. The participants emphasised that TK is deeply rooted in intuition and the ability to recognise patterns, which enables experienced researchers to foresee long-term scientific trends. There is also a need to develop new knowledge documentation methods including digital repositories and AI-driven platforms. Additionally, encouraging curiosity-driven questioning and interdisciplinary collaboration serves as a catalyst for innovation.
4.4 Literature Review Results
After screening 491 papers by Elicit, 40 were analysed using the tool. Subsequently, the Excel file generated by Elicit was manually reviewed, and seven publications that best matched the research criteria were selected. Five of them are strictly academic environment, one focus on engineering industries and one is about knowledge hiding. The main findings, with repeated barriers described by various authors, are in the Table 1. Additionally, Riege (2005 as cited in Liu, 2021) indicated low awareness of the value of knowledge and problems resulting from diversity (age, gender, experience) as possible barriers. Mabey and Zhao (2017) explored five paradoxes of knowledge exchange, of which Paradox 1: the more knowledge is formally managed, the less likely effective knowledge exchange will occur is especially worth noticing.
5. Presentation of the Model
5.1 Key Roles in the Model
Based on the survey, interviews, and literature review results, new roles have been defined for the SECI model to transfer the scientific tacit knowledge (STK) of persons with long scientific seniority (LSS), also defining the LSS person criteria in the field of construction science in more depth.
The LSS person is an individual with extensive research experience (over 25 years since obtaining a PhD) and scientific practice who, through long-term scientific activity, has acquired unique tacit knowledge in the field of construction. The tacit knowledge of LSS individuals includes the ability to interpret data and derive conclusions deeply; a profound contextual and interpretative understanding of scientific processes; and unique technical competencies resulting from years of observation, experimentation, and solving scientific problems. Common characteristics of LSS persons are advanced formal education in construction (and related fundamental sciences) in-depth knowledge of scientific literature related to construction; the ability to recognise patterns and structures related to science; the ability to simplify complex statements through the use of analogies and metaphors related to everyday life; extensive experience in expert evaluations, meaning the practical verification of scientific theories and an extensive network of professional and scientific contacts.
The Successor regards the LSS person as a master and mentor, seeking to acquire the LSS's tacit knowledge because they consider it valuable and necessary. The Successor recognises the need to utilise this knowledge for personal and scientific development, including their own fields of research. The Successor intends to and declares a commitment to continuing the LSS approach: thoughts, ideas, and paradigms.
The Custodian values LSS tacit knowledge and strives to collect and preserve as many resources documenting this knowledge as possible. The main duties of the Custodian include managing digital libraries containing recordings of LSS seminars, lectures, webinars, podcasts, and interviews; collecting and organising LSS scientific publications, aiming for their complete digitisation; recording and integrating into the system's informal practices or statements conveyed by the Successor, structuring, sorting, and categorising them; and disseminating the LSS's legacy.
The Leader is the direct supervisor of the team, in which the LSS, Successor, and Custodian work. As the primary representatives of the employing institution, they are responsible for the organisational forms and conditions of collaboration, including technological aspects. The main tasks of the Leader include identifying and recruiting participants of the process; creating a space for knowledge exchange by organising various forms of interaction-both individual and team-based; supporting the knowledge transfer process by selecting technological tools, establishing rules for knowledge documentation, organising meetings in on-site, remote, and hybrid modes, and defining online and offline communication channels; and fostering an organisational culture that promotes knowledge exchange.
5.2 Model Description
Following the classical SECI model, each phase was assigned specific roles, activities, and tools to transfer the hidden knowledge of the LSS person.
SOCIALISATION is a phase in which the scientific tacit knowledge of the LSS person transforms into the scientific tacit knowledge of the Successor. The main goal of the socialisation phase is for the Successor to assimilate LSS tacit knowledge through shared experience. EXTERNALISATION is a phase in which the scientific tacit knowledge of the LSS person transforms into scientific explicit knowledge. The main goal of this phase is to trigger scientific tacit knowledge through conversations and discussions between the LSS person and the Successor. COMBINATION is a phase in which the scientific explicit knowledge of the LSS person transforms into scientific explicit knowledge. Scientific tacit knowledge has been externalised, allowing the Successor to develop new knowledge based on it. A Custodian is responsible for the storage and dissemination of the LSS person's knowledge. INTERNALISATION is a phase in where scientific explicit knowledge gained from the LSS person transforms into scientific tacit knowledge of the Successor. The Successor can convert LSS's scientific tacit knowledge, enriching their own tacit knowledge and laying the foundation for new scientific knowledge in the field of construction science. The roles and main tasks in each phase of the SECI model are presented in the Table 2 below.
Table developed by the author based on the SECI model (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995) adapted to the context of scientific tacit knowledge transfer in construction academia.
5.3 Organizational Environment
In an organisation, several variables can influence the effectiveness of the model. A culture of openness, stable employment, active leadership, flexible structures, and incentive systems support this process. Conversely, siloed thinking, high staff turnover, disengaged leadership, bureaucratic structures, lack of recognition, inadequate infrastructure, and generational or technological resistance can significantly hinder knowledgesharing and succession efforts.
6. Discussion
This study highlights the importance of tacit knowledge transfer within construction academia and the necessity of a structured, role-based approach. Informal mechanisms such as observation, mentoring, and shadowing remain central to successful knowledge transfer. Institutional support, including leadership engagement and technological tools, is crucial for preserving the scientific legacy of employees with long scientific seniority (LSS). The proposed Custodian-Successor model adapts the SECI knowledge creation process to the specific requirements of construction science.
The literature review (Section 4.4) identified several organisational, cultural, and individual barriers to tacit knowledge sharing. These include lack of leadership support (Kanyundo et al., 2023), organisational culture issues (Fullwood et al., 2019), limited awareness of knowledge management importance (Kanyundo et al., 2023), and the critical role of trust and face-to-face contact (Thi Chung & Thi Tram Anh, 2022; Alves & Pinheiro, 2022; Mabey & Zhao, 2017).
The findings of this study largely confirm these observations. Participants indicated that leadership engagement and organisational support play crucial roles in facilitating tacit knowledge transfer. Similar to Kanyundo et al. (2023), a lack of formalised structures and incentives was perceived as a barrier. However, the study context in construction academia highlighted that while leaders' presence is important, it is their integrity and ability to foster an environment of collaboration - rather than traditional hierarchical authority - that enables effective knowledge sharing, aligning with Fullwood et al. (2019).
Trust, extensively discussed by Fullwood et al. (2019) and Thi Chung & Thi Tram Anh (2022) as a key enabler of knowledge sharing, was also relevant in this study. However, the findings suggest that among Long Scientific Seniority (LSS) persons, trust developed naturally through long-term cooperation, shared experience, and professional reputation. In this group, trust was an intrinsic characteristic rather than externally enforced. It should be noted, however, that broader barriers related to trust and willingness to share knowledge may still exist within the wider construction academia environment, beyond the LSS population analysed in this study.
The importance of face-to-face interaction and informal encounters in promoting tacit knowledge sharing, as stressed by Alves & Pinheiro (2022) and Mabey & Zhao (2017), was strongly confirmed. Participants consistently emphasised the role of joint projects, direct mentoring, and daily collaboration as crucial mechanisms for transferring non-codified expertise. These findings also reflect the paradox described by Mabey and Zhao (2017), where increasing formalisation of knowledge management can reduce the effectiveness of knowledge exchange. The Custodian-Successor model addresses this challenge by structuring support roles while preserving the informal, relational nature of tacit knowledge transfer.
Organisational structure was perceived as supportive of knowledge sharing when flexible and integrative, resonating with the findings of Alves & Pinheiro (2022). However, the lack of formally assigned roles or programmes for structured transfer of tacit knowledge was evident. While the existing literature addresses informal mentoring and communities of practice (Mabey & Zhao, 2017; Fullwood et al., 2019), no explicit rolebased framework had been proposed.
Therefore, a significant contribution of this study is the introduction of the Custodian and Successor roles, operationalising tacit knowledge transfer in construction academia. Unlike previous approaches focusing on environmental factors or informal practices, this model offers a structured pathway for managing and sustaining scientific tacit knowledge within institutions.
7. Conclusions
7.1 Main Conclusions
The main conclusions of this study are as follows:
* This study confirmed that LSS employees often do not perceive their scientific tacit knowledge as unique or require structured preservation. This highlights the need for awareness-raising efforts by institutions.
* Informal learning mechanisms, especially observation, shadowing, and everyday cooperation, remain critical for internalising tacit knowledge. Organisations should cultivate environments that enable natural interactions.
* Institutional support, both cultural and infrastructural, is essential for effective tacit knowledge transfer, including providing appropriate tools, time, and incentives.
* Technological tools such as digital repositories and AI-based platforms should complement interpersonal transfers by capturing elements of tacit knowledge that may otherwise be lost.
* A new role-based model for scientific tacit knowledge transfer was developed based on the SECI framework and was adapted to the context of scientific institutions in the construction field. It defines four complementary roles: LSS (knowledge holder), Successor (learners and integrators), Custodian (preservers and disseminators) and Leader (facilitators and organisers). The success of tacit knowledge transfer depends on the synergy between the four roles. Each actor has distinct tasks that must be supported structurally, technologically, and culturally within the organisation.
* Leadership engagement is a fundamental factor. Without clear prioritisation from leaders, the transfer of tacit knowledge may remain incidental rather than strategic, limiting organisational value and sustainability.
7.2 Limitations
This study has some limitations. First, the research was mainly qualitative, and the participants' statements, despite their efforts, could be subjective. Second, the research focused on scientific institutions related to construction in Poland and Europe, which may not translate directly to other geographical and scientific areas. Third, the proposed role-based model has not yet been tested under practical conditions; therefore, its effectiveness remains to be verified under real institutional conditions.
7.3 Implications and Future Research
The results of this study have theoretical and practical implications. The proposed role-based model offers a structured approach to managing scientific tacit knowledge, especially in scientific institutions in the field of construction. Institutions can use this framework to design more purposeful and sustainable knowledge transfer processes, particularly when working with LSS employees. The author plans to test the model in a pilot scientific unit to assess its effectiveness.
Future research directions may include, among others, the role of digital and AI-based tools in supporting the transfer of tacit knowledge, and the role of leadership styles and organisational culture for the transfer of tacit knowledge in the realities of the 4.0 economy and increasingly common remote work.

Socially Interactive Agents for Preserving and Transferring Tacit Knowledge in Organizations

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to tackle the challenges of preserving and transferring tacit knowledge--deep, experience-based insights that are hard to articulate but vital for decision-making, innovation, and problem-solving. Traditional methods rely heavily on human facilitators, which, while effective, are resource-intensive and lack scalability. A promising alternative is the use of Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs) as AI-driven knowledge transfer facilitators. These agents interact autonomously and socially intelligently with users through multimodal behaviors (verbal, paraverbal, nonverbal), simulating expert roles in various organizational contexts. SIAs engage employees in empathic, natural-language dialogues, helping them externalize insights that might otherwise remain unspoken. Their success hinges on building trust, as employees are often hesitant to share tacit knowledge without assurance of confidentiality and appreciation. Key technologies include Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating context-relevant dialogue, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to integrate organizational knowledge, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to guide structured reflection. These enable SIAs to actively elicit knowledge, uncover implicit assumptions, and connect insights to broader organizational contexts. Potential applications span onboarding, where SIAs support personalized guidance and introductions, and knowledge retention, where they conduct structured interviews with retiring experts to capture heuristics behind decisions. Success depends on addressing ethical and operational challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and resistance to AI. Transparency, robust validation, and a culture of trust are essential to mitigate these risks.

Abstract: This paper presents EffortNet, a novel deep learning framework for decoding individual listening effort from electroencephalography (EEG) during speech comprehension. Listening effort represents a significant challenge in speech-hearing research, particularly for aging populations and those with hearing impairment. We collected 64-channel EEG data from 122 participants during speech comprehension under four conditions: clean, noisy, MMSE-enhanced, and Transformer-enhanced speech. Statistical analyses confirmed that alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) exhibited significantly higher power during noisy speech processing compared to clean or enhanced conditions, confirming their validity as objective biomarkers of listening effort. To address the substantial inter-individual variability in EEG signals, EffortNet integrates three complementary learning paradigms: self-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled data, incremental learning for progressive adaptation to individual characteristics, and transfer learning for efficient knowledge transfer to new subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that Effort- Net achieves 80.9% classification accuracy with only 40% training data from new subjects, significantly outperforming conventional CNN (62.3%) and STAnet (61.1%) models. The probability-based metric derived from our model revealed that Transformer-enhanced speech elicited neural responses more similar to clean speech than MMSEenhanced speech. This finding contrasted with subjective intelligibility ratings but aligned with objective metrics. The proposed framework provides a practical solution for personalized assessment of hearing technologies, with implications for designing cognitive-aware speech enhancement systems.

Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR) technologies such as Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR, AR) are well established in medical practice, enhancing diagnostics, treatment, and education. However, there are still some limitations and challenges that may be overcome thanks to the latest generations of equipment, software, and frameworks based on eXtended Reality (XR) by enabling immersive systems that support safer, more controlled environments for training and patient care. Our review highlights recent VR and AR applications in key areas of medicine. In medical education, these technologies provide realistic clinical simulations, improving skills and knowledge retention. In surgery, immersive tools enhance procedural precision with detailed anatomical visualizations. VR-based rehabilitation has shown effectiveness in restoring motor functions and balance, particularly for neurological patients. In mental health, VR has been successful in treating conditions like PTSD and phobias. Although VR and AR solutions are well established, there are still some important limitations, including high costs and limited tactile feedback, which may be overcome with implementing new technologies that may improve the effectiveness of immersive medical applications such as XR, psychophysiological feedback or integration of artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time data analysis and personalized healthcare and training.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a transformative methodology integrating deep learning with scientific computing. This review establishes a three-dimensional analytical framework to systematically decode PINNs’ development through methodological innovation, theoretical breakthroughs, and cross-disciplinary convergence. The contributions include threefold: First, identifying the co-evolutionary path of algorithmic architectures from adaptive optimization (neural tangent kernel-guided weighting achieving 230% convergence acceleration in Navier-Stokes solutions) to hybrid numerical-deep learning integration (5× speedup via domain decomposition) and second, constructing bidirectional theory-application mappings where convergence analysis (operator approximation theory) and generalization guarantees (Bayesian-physical hybrid frameworks) directly inform engineering implementations, as validated by 72 % cost reduction compared to FEM in high-dimensional spaces ( p < 0.01 , n = 15 benchmarks). Third, pioneering cross-domain knowledge transfer through application-specific architectures: TFE-PINN for turbulent flows ( 5.12 ± 0.87 % error in NASA hypersonic tests), ReconPINN for medical imaging ( ▵ SSIM = + 0.18 ± 0.04 on multi-institutional MRI), and SeisPINN for seismic systems ( 0.52 ± 0.18 km localization accuracy). We further present a technological roadmap highlighting three critical directions for PINN 2.0: neuro-symbolic, federated physics learning, and quantum-accelerated optimization.

Full text: 1. Introduction The solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) forms the cornerstone of scientific computing and engineering modeling, with widespread applications across critical fields, including fluid mechanics, quantum physics, biomedical engineering, and climate simulation. Traditional numerical methods, such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) [1], Finite Difference Method (FDM) [2], and Finite Volume Method (FVM) [3], discretize continuous problems into algebraic systems through spatial approximation. While these methods demonstrate robustness in regular geometrical domains and low-dimensional settings, their fundamental shortcomings become increasingly evident as problem complexity escalates. Specifically, the computational cost of high-dimensional problems increases exponentially with dimensionality, a phenomenon known as the curse of dimensionality [4]. Additionally, the generation of grids for complex geometrical boundaries is resource-intensive and susceptible to numerical errors [5]. Furthermore, when addressing multi-physics coupling, sparse observational data, or dynamic boundary conditions, traditional methods are often reliant on empirical assumptions and manual parameter tuning, undermining their robustness. In parallel, purely data-driven deep learning approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [6], have made significant strides in fields like image recognition. However, these methods exhibit a black-box nature, which leads to a loss of physical consistency and a marked decline in generalization performance under conditions of sparse data.
The introduction of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) marks a paradigm shift in the relationship between machine learning and computational physics, transitioning from a loose collaboration to a deep coupling. By embedding conservation laws, such as the residuals of governing equations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions, as soft constraints within the neural network’s loss function, and utilizing automatic differentiation techniques for precise encoding of physical laws [7], PINNs overcome the dimensional limitations of traditional numerical methods and the physical ignorance inherent in data-driven models, thereby achieving physics-guided generalization [8]. The core advantages of PINNs are reflected in three aspects: mesh-free solutions (avoiding discretization errors), multi-modal integration (compatibility with experimental data and physical priors), and high-dimensional scalability (polynomial complexity growth). However, the research landscape of PINNs exhibits characteristics of rapid technological iteration, delayed theoretical validation, and dispersed application exploration, and existing review literature has failed to address the following key questions systematically: Lack of Historical Continuity in Methodological Evolution. Most reviews (e.g., [9,10]) categorize studies based on application domains or algorithmic modules, thereby disconnecting the intrinsic logical progression from foundational framework development (e.g., residual weighting strategies [11]), algorithmic innovations (e.g., adaptive optimization [12]), to theoretical advancements (e.g., convergence proofs [13]). Disconnection Between Theoretical Analysis and Engineering Practice: Some studies emphasize mathematical rigor (e.g., generalization error bounds [14]) but fail to elucidate its practical value in guiding training stability. Other works extensively present engineering cases (e.g., [15]), yet lack theoretical explanations for algorithmic failure modes.
Insufficient Exploration of Interdisciplinary Collaborative Innovation. Emerging directions such as quantum computing to accelerate PINN training [16] and federated learning for distributed physical modeling [17] have yet to develop a systematic framework. Additionally, the influence of biological neuron dynamics on the architecture of PINNs remains largely at the metaphorical level [18].
Insufficient Forward-Looking Technological Roadmap. Existing reviews (e.g., [19]) lack strategic foresight regarding the core features of PINN 2.0 (e.g., neural-symbolic reasoning [20] and uncertainty quantification frameworks), making it challenging to bridge the gap from technological prototypes to industrial-grade tools in the field.

This paper proposes a three-dimensional analytical framework—comprising methodology-theory-application—to systematically deconstruct the evolution of PINNs’ methodology, theoretical deepening, and interdisciplinary integration mechanisms: Methodological Perspective. The co-evolutionary path of adaptive optimization → domain decomposition → hybrid numerical-deep learning is revealed. This progression spans from the foundational residual weighting strategy [11] to neural tangent kernel-guided dynamic optimization [12], ultimately achieving multi-scale coupling with traditional finite element methods (Section 2.2.3).
Theoretical Perspective. A dual-pillar framework is established, combining convergence proofs and generalization guarantees. Operator approximation theory [13] is employed to rigorously analyze approximation error bounds, while a Bayesian-physics hybrid framework [18] is used for uncertainty quantification (Section 3).
Application Perspective. An interdisciplinary knowledge transfer paradigm is constructed, encompassing physical modeling—life sciences—earth systems. This includes the development of the TFE-PINN architecture for turbulence simulations (reducing error by 62 % in NASA benchmark tests), the introduction of ReconPINN for medical image reconstruction (improving SSIM by 0.18 ± 0.04 across multi-center MRI data), and the implementation of a seismic early warning system with 0.5 km localization accuracy (Section 4).

The contributions of this paper can be summarized in three key aspects: Systematic Deconstruction of Methodology. This paper introduces, for the first time, the algorithmic evolution pathway of adaptive optimization → domain decomposition → numerical-deep learning hybrid (Section 2), revealing the common design principles underlying technological breakthroughs.
Bidirectional Mapping Between Theory and Application. We establish quantitative links between convergence analysis (Section 3.1) and generalization guarantees (Section 3.2) with practical performance improvements, addressing the issue of theoretical elegance but limited practicality.
Interdisciplinary Roadmap Design. Common challenges are distilled from computational physics (Section 4.1), biomedical sciences (Section 4.2), and earth sciences (Section 4.3), and integration paradigms are planned for neural-symbolic reasoning (Section 5.1), federated learning (Section 5.2), and quantum enhancement (Section 5.3).

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 analyzes the evolution of the PINNs methodology, with a focus on adaptive optimization strategies (Section 2.2.1), domain decomposition architectures (Section 2.2.2), and the deep coupling mechanism with traditional numerical methods (Section 2.2.3). Section 3 constructs the theoretical framework from the perspectives of convergence (Section 3.1) and generalization (Section 3.2). Section 4 demonstrates the unique advantages of PINNs in solving multi-scale, multi-physics problems through interdisciplinary case studies. Section 5 explores frontier topics such as enhancing interpretability through neural-symbolic systems, enabling privacy-preserving modeling with federated learning, and accelerating high-dimensional optimization via quantum computing. Section 6 summarizes the technical challenges and proposes a research roadmap for the development of PINN 2.0.
2. Methodological Evolution 2.1. Foundational Framework Development Mathematical Formulation and Verification. The foundational architecture of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) establishes a unified framework for integrating physical constraints through composite loss functions. The mathematical formulation can be rigorously expressed as: (1) L = λ data L data + λ PDE L PDE + λ BC / IC L BC / IC
where L data represents the data-driven term, which supervises known measurement points, and λ data is its corresponding weight coefficient; L PDE denotes the PDE residual term, enforcing the physical laws, and λ PDE is its corresponding weight coefficient; L BC / IC is the boundary/initial condition constraint term, and λ BC / IC is its corresponding weight coefficient [7]. Figure 1 complexity scores account for asymptotic scaling: FEM’s O ( n d ) vs. PINNs’ O ( k n log n ) ( k ∼ d ). Though k introduces dimension dependence, PINNs avoid exponential growth.
Figure 1 systematically compares this paradigm with traditional numerical methods and pure data-driven approaches across five critical dimensions: grid dependency, data efficiency, physical consistency, computational complexity, and scalability. Notably, PINNs achieve optimal balance between physical consistency and data efficiency, overcoming limitations of conventional approaches. While PINNs generalize across physics domains, quantitative comparisons in Figure 1 use PDE-specific benchmarks (e.g., Burgers/Navier-Stokes systems) to ensure consistent evaluation.
Experimental Verification. The framework has been rigorously validated through canonical PDE benchmarks: 1D Burgers Equation: Training time: 2.1 h; Adaptive activation functions reduce relative L 2 error to 3.21 × 10 − 4 , demonstrating 40 % faster convergence than baseline models [21].
2D Navier-Stokes Equations: Training time: 8.5 h; Parallel MLP architecture achieves 8.76 × 10 − 3 error in vortex shedding prediction, comparable to finite volume methods with 60 % less computational cost [22].
High-Dimensional Poisson Equation: Training time: 14.3 h; Domain decomposition strategies enable solutions in 10D parameter spaces with 6.78 × 10 − 2 relative error [23].

Collocation points for Burgers ( 10 4 samples) required 12 s (Latin Hypercube Sampling), while LES data for Navier-Stokes consumed 72 h (ANSYS Fluent).
Taxonomy of PINN Architectures. While establishing the foundational framework, diverse PINN variants have emerged with distinct architectural properties, classified in Table 1 across four critical dimensions. Common properties unifying all PINNs include embedded PDE residuals in loss functions (Equation (1)), automatic differentiation for gradient computation, and mesh-free collocation point sampling. Key differences driving specialization manifest through variations in network depth and complexity (typically 4–12 layers), activation function selection (ranging from physics-informed to standard options), and training data generation principles (adaptive versus precomputed approaches). These architectural distinctions directly impact performance metrics shown in Table 2, where XPINN’s domain decomposition enables 5× faster 3D simulations through Swish activations that maintain interface continuity, while HFD-PINN’s hybrid finite-difference modules require ReLU activations to ensure discrete stability in coupled numerical-neural systems.
Core Architectural Components.  Table 2 catalogs critical modules that constitute modern PINN architectures.
Theoretical Guarantees. Recent theoretical advancements provide rigorous foundations: Convergence Analysis: For linear elliptic PDEs, ref. [13] proves error bounds: (2) | u θ − u * | L 2 ( Ω ) ≤ C m − k / d + ϵ opt
where u θ represents the solution or prediction result obtained by the neural network model(parameter θ ), u * represents the exact solution or ideal solution to the problem; m denotes network width, d denotes the dimension of the space Ω , k solution regularity, C is a constant, and ϵ opt optimization error.
Generalization Bounds: Through Rademacher complexity theory [27]: (3) E g ≤ log N ( H , ϵ , n ) n + ϵ
where N represents hypothesis space covering number, E g denotes generalization error, H is the hypothesis space, ϵ is a scale parameter of the cover, and n is the number of training samples.

2.2. Algorithmic Innovation The methodological evolution of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is driven by three foundational design principles: adaptive physical constraint balancing, computational domain decomposition, and symbiosis between numerical methods and deep learning. These principles collectively address challenges in multi-physics coupling, high-dimensional scalability, and physical consistency, marking a paradigm shift from isolated algorithmic improvements to systematic framework innovations.
2.2.1. Adaptive Physical Constraint Balancing Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory has emerged as a cornerstone for harmonizing competing objectives in PINN training. By dynamically adjusting loss term weights based on gradient norms: (4) λ i ( t ) = ∇ θ L i 2 ∑ j ∇ θ L j 2
where λ i ( t ) denotes the adaptive weight for the i -th loss term at training iteration t , ∇ θ L i represents the gradient of loss component L i with respect to model parameters θ , · 2 is the Euclidean norm, and the denominator sums the Euclidean norms of gradients for all loss terms. This strategy inherently prioritizes under-optimized constraints during training [25]. Empirical validations in Navier-Stokes solutions demonstrate a 57% reduction in training oscillations and a 2.3 × convergence acceleration [28]. Extensions of this principle to hybrid optimizers, such as the Adam-LBFGS switching protocol [29], further reduce Burgers’ equation errors from 10 − 3 to 10 − 5 , showcasing its versatility across PDE types.
2.2.2. Computational Domain Decomposition The Extended PINN (XPINN) architecture exemplifies how spatial-temporal partitioning enables scalable solutions for industrial-scale problems. By dividing the domain into overlapping subregions with shallow networks and enforcing interface flux continuity, XPINN achieves superlinear speedup ( 5 × ) in 3D turbine blade flow simulations [26]. Adaptive sampling enhancements, such as residual-based attention mechanisms (RAR) [28], increase point density by 80% in high-gradient regions, reducing shock-capturing errors to below 3% in aerospace applications. This approach directly translates to real-world impact, as demonstrated in NASA’s hypersonic tests where TFE-PINN reduces wall heat flux prediction errors by 62% compared to traditional LES methods [30].
2.2.3. Numerical-Deep Learning Symbiosis Hybrid architectures bridge the gap between numerical rigor and neural flexibility. The Variational Petrov-Galerkin PINN (VPINN) embeds Legendre polynomial test spaces to reduce differential operator order by 50%, explicitly constructing variational residuals: (5) R h = 〈 N ( u θ ) , v h 〉
where R h denotes the variational residual, N is the differential operator, ( u θ signifies the neural network solution parameterized by weights θ , and v h is the test function from the Legendre polynomial basis space. Which accelerates training efficiency by 30% for elliptic PDEs [31]. Conversely, the HFD-PINN framework integrates finite difference modules before neural outputs, collaboratively optimizing discrete and continuous representations. By constraining time steps via CFL conditions: (6) Δ t ≤ Δ x 2 max | u |
where Δ t denotes the time step size used in the numerical method, representing the discretization of time in the computational scheme, Δ x refers to the spatial step size or grid spacing in the spatial domain, which determines the resolution of the spatial discretization. max | u | signifies the maximum absolute value of the solution u across the domain, and it is used to control the time step size based on the stability condition of the numerical scheme. It eliminates non-physical oscillations in complex geometries, achieving 4× faster convergence than pure data-driven models [32].
To quantify the paradigm shift enabled by PINNs, Table 3 benchmarks their performance against conventional numerical methods across computational efficiency, data requirements, and physical consistency. Notably, the VPINN framework reduces the differential operator order by 50% through Legendre polynomial projection, achieving a 30% training acceleration over classical FEM in elliptic PDEs—a feat attributed to its seamless integration of reduced-order modeling and neural optimization. Meanwhile, the HFD-PINN hybrid architecture demonstrates how embedding finite difference modules into neural networks mitigates non-physical oscillations via CFL-conditioned time stepping, outperforming pure data-driven models in complex geometry simulations. Such hybrid strategies not only inherit the interpretability of numerical methods but also leverage the mesh-free advantage of deep learning, positioning PINNs as a bridge between computational physics and modern machine learning.
3. Theoretical Foundations 3.1. Convergence Analysis The theoretical underpinnings of PINNs present a dual landscape of rigorous mathematical analysis and practical implementation challenges. While existing convergence proofs and generalization bounds establish foundational guarantees, their assumptions often constrain applicability to idealized scenarios. For instance, Shin’s L 2 -convergence theorem assumes solution regularity and linear PDE operators, which may fail to hold in turbulent flow modeling where solutions exhibit discontinuous shocks [13]. In contrast, Schwab’s high-dimensional approximation theorem bypasses regularity requirements through tensor decomposition but introduces dimension-dependent constants that grow exponentially with d , undermining its utility for real-world problems beyond 10 dimensions [35]. A critical comparison of these frameworks reveals complementary strengths: Shin’s approach guides network width selection for smooth solutions, whereas Schwab’s method offers dimensionality-robust error decay at the cost of interpretability.
The practical implications of generalization error decomposition (Figure 2) demand deeper scrutiny. While approximation error (40%) dominates in low-data regimes, its reduction requires increasing network capacity, which exacerbates optimization instability—a trade-off unresolved by current theory. Optimization error (30%), often attributed to gradient pathology, could be mitigated through spectral normalization or hybrid optimizers, but theoretical connections between optimizer choice and error components remain elusive. For example, the Adam-LBFGS hybrid empirically reduces Burgers’ equation errors from 10 − 3 to 10 − 5 , yet no analysis rigorously connects its switching criterion ( gradient norm < 10 − 8 ) to the statistical error term derived from convergence theories.
Emerging theoretical gaps persist in three directions: Nonlinear PDE Global Convergence : Pseudo-linearization techniques for nonlinear systems (e.g., L n u n + 1 = L n u n − N ( u n ) ) rely on iterative operator approximations that may diverge for stiff equations [36]. Current analyses assume contractive mappings ( ρ < 1 ), but real-world applications like combustion modeling violate this condition due to exponential nonlinearities.
Uncertainty Quantification : Bayesian-physics hybrid frameworks reduce uncertainty intervals by 68% in clinical cases but lack theoretical grounding for epistemic-aleatoric error disentanglement. The information bottleneck objective remains heuristic, with no proof linking β to physical constraint satisfaction.
Quantum-PINN Complexity : While IBM quantum experiments show an 8× speedup for Poisson equations, the theoretical promise of exponential acceleration (BQP-class) remains unverified. Noise-induced error bounds fail to address decoherence in high-dimensional parameter spaces.

Addressing these limitations requires rethinking theoretical priorities. Instead of pursuing universal error bounds, future work should develop problem-specific theories —for example, turbulence-focused analyses incorporating Kolmogorov’s scaling laws or biophysics-informed generalization bounds for medical imaging. Such tailored frameworks would bridge the gap between mathematical elegance and engineering pragmatism, aligning theoretical advancements with real-world PINN deployments.
3.2. Generalization Guarantees Rademacher complexity analysis. Let the hypothesis space of PINNs be defined as H W =   { u θ :   ∥ θ ∥   ≤   W } . The empirical Rademacher complexity of this hypothesis space satisfies: (7) R n ( H W ) ≤ W n E sup x | ∇ θ L PDE ( x ) |
where R n ( H W ) denotes the empirical risk for the hypothesis class H W evaluated on a sample of size n . The term W represents a bound on the complexity of the model, such as the norm of the parameters in the hypothesis class. n stands for the sample size used to compute the empirical risk. The expression E denotes the expectation over the distribution of the data points, and ∇ θ L PDE ( x ) represents the gradient of the loss function L PDE ( x ) with respect to the model parameters θ at a specific point x in the domain. The sup x indicates the supremum (maximum value) of the gradient over all points x , providing a measure of the maximum sensitivity of the loss function with respect to the parameters.
This leads to the derivation of the generalization error bound: (8) E g ≤ log N ( H W , ϵ , n ) n + ϵ
where N represents hypothesis space covering number, E g denotes generalization error, H is the hypothesis space, ϵ is a scale parameter of the cover, and n is the number of training samples [27].
Extension of information bottleneck theory. The information bottleneck objective function incorporating physical constraints is given by: (9) min θ I ( X ; U θ ) − β I ( U θ ; P )
the objective is to minimize with respect to the parameters θ . Here, I ( X ; U θ ) represents the mutual information between the input data X and the model’s output U θ , where U θ denotes the solution of the neural network parameterized by θ . The term I ( U θ ; P ) represents the mutual information between the model output U θ and the set of physical constraints P , which incorporates domain-specific conditions or laws that the model must satisfy. The parameter β is a balancing factor that controls the trade-off between the mutual information terms. By adjusting β , the model can balance the data fitting term I ( X ; U θ ) with the adherence to the physical constraints I ( U θ ; P ) . Experimental results show that this framework reduces the generalization error of the Burgers equation by 37 % [37].
In Figure 2, the decomposition of the generalization error of the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is presented in a pie chart format. The total error is divided into four distinct components: Approximation Error (40%) arises due to the limitations in the neural network’s representational capacity. Despite its capability, the network may not fully capture the complexity of the underlying physical problem, leading to an inherent error in approximating the target function. This error can be mitigated by improving the network architecture, such as increasing the depth or width of the network.
Optimization Error (30%) originates from the suboptimal convergence during the training process. Even with a sufficient model capacity, the optimization algorithm, including factors such as learning rate and initialization, might not converge to the global optimum, leading to a non-ideal solution. This error can be reduced through better optimization strategies and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
Physical Constraint Mismatch (20%) refers to the error caused by inaccuracies in the representation of the physical constraints (e.g., partial differential equations, boundary conditions) within the model. If the constraints are not accurately modeled or do not fully reflect the actual physical system, a mismatch arises. Addressing this error typically involves refining the physical model or more accurately incorporating the constraints into the network’s loss function.
Data Noise (10%) represents the uncertainty or noise inherent in real-world data. Experimental data often contain noise due to measurement errors, which can lead to discrepancies between the network’s predictions and the observed values. Reducing this error may involve improving data quality or applying noise filtering techniques.

This error decomposition provides valuable insights into the sources of error in PINN-based models and emphasizes the importance of addressing each component to improve the model’s generalization performance. Researchers and practitioners can focus on refining the approximation model, optimization techniques, physical constraints, and data quality to achieve more accurate and reliable predictions.
4. Interdisciplinary Applications The transformative potential of PINNs is most evident in their ability to unify physical modeling, data assimilation, and computational efficiency across diverse scientific domains. By embedding domain-specific knowledge into neural architectures, PINNs transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries, enabling solutions to previously intractable problems. Below, we systematically analyze their impact in computational physics, biomedical systems, and earth sciences, anchored by unified performance metrics and cross-domain insights.
4.1. Computational Physics and Engineering Turbulence Modeling (TFE-PINN Architecture). The Turbulence-Focused Enhanced PINN (TFE-PINN) architecture exemplifies how physics-guided neural networks redefine industrial simulations. By coupling wavelet-based multiscale feature extraction with stochastic eddy-viscosity models, TFE-PINN corrects subgrid stress terms through dynamically predicted viscosity coefficients: (10) τ i j = − 2 ν t S ¯ i j
where the eddy viscosity ν t is forecasted by an LSTM network trained on high-fidelity LES data. In NASA’s hypersonic thermal protection tests, TFE-PINN reduces wall heat flux prediction errors to 5% compared to 12.7% for traditional LES, while improving energy spectrum alignment in the inertial range by 40% [30]. TFE-PINN training data generation required 72 h of high-fidelity LES simulation. This hybrid approach demonstrates how PINNs inherit numerical rigor while leveraging data-driven adaptability.
Multiphysics Coupling ( μ PINN for Crystal Plasticity Analysis). The μ PINN framework addresses multiscale material modeling by jointly optimizing dislocation density fields and stress tensors. Validated against cyclic loading experiments on 304 stainless steel, μ PINN achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.021 in predicting grain boundary slip— 7.5 × lower than FEM—while accelerating microstructure evolution simulations by 1000 × compared to molecular dynamics [38].
4.2. Biomedical Systems Medical Image Reconstruction (ReconPINN). ReconPINN revolutionizes MRI reconstruction by embedding Bloch equation constraints into its loss function: (11) d M d t = γ M × B − M z T 1 + M 0 − M z T 1
where d M d t represents the time derivative of the magnetization vector M , which describes the change in the magnetization over time. The term γ denotes the gyromagnetic ratio, which is a constant that relates the magnetic moment of a particle to its angular momentum. M × B represents the cross product of the magnetization vector M and the magnetic field B , which is responsible for the precessional motion of the magnetization vector in the presence of a magnetic field. M z refers to the component of the magnetization along the z -axis, while T 1 is the spin-lattice relaxation time, which characterizes the time it takes for the magnetization to return to its equilibrium value after being disturbed. M 0 is the equilibrium magnetization, representing the magnetization when the system is in a steady state with no external perturbations.
While suppressing artifacts through rotating coordinate system regularization. Evaluated on multi-center 7T MRI datasets, ReconPINN improves structural similarity (SSIM) to 0.92 ± 0.04, outperforming compressed sensing (SSIM: 0.75) and reducing tumor boundary localization errors to 0.7 mm [15]. Open-source implementations (e.g., DeepXDE [11]) further enhance reproducibility, enabling rapid clinical adoption.
Personalized Medicine (CardioPINN). CardioPINN integrates patient-specific CTA data with reduced-order Navier-Stokes projections, enabling real-time coronary artery stenosis assessment with <8% error. In a multicenter trial, its predictions of fractional flow reserve ( FFR ct ) correlate strongly with catheter measurements ( r = 0.89 , p < 0.001 ), achieving an AUC of 0.93 for atrial fibrillation ablation targeting [17].
4.3. Earth and Environmental Science Climate Modeling (MC-PINN). The Multiscale Climate PINN (MC-PINN) employs adaptive time stepping ( Δ t = 30 days → 1 h) and hierarchical training to resolve ENSO oscillations, mesoscale vortices, and extreme weather events. Compared to CMIP6 models, MC-PINN reduces equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature anomaly errors by 37% while consuming 82% less computational resources [39].
Earthquake Early Warning (SeisPINN). SeisPINN decomposes seismic wavefields and inverts source parameters within 5 s of P-wave arrival, achieving 0.5 km localization accuracy during the 2025 Luding earthquake (M6.8). Traditional methods exhibit 2.1 km errors under similar conditions, highlighting PINNs’ advantage in real-time geophysical inverse problems [20].
The benchmarking results in Table 4 demonstrate PINNs’ unique capability to balance physical accuracy with computational efficiency across diverse domains. In turbulence modeling, TFE-PINN achieves 62% error reduction against LES methods while operating at 19% of the computational cost (14 h vs. 72 h), attributable to its hybrid architecture combining wavelet-based multiscale decomposition with neural eddy-viscosity prediction. This performance gain intensifies in time-critical applications: SeisPINN reduces earthquake localization latency by 83% (5 s vs. 30 s) with 76% higher accuracy, enabled by real-time wavefield separation physics.
Notably, the magnitude of improvement correlates with the intrinsic physical constraints of each domain. MRI reconstruction (ReconPINN) shows moderate SSIM gains (+0.18) due to the fundamental noise limitations of 7T scanners, whereas climate modeling (MC-PINN) achieves 37% error reduction through adaptive time-step integration that traditional CMIP6 models lack. These variations highlight context-dependent optimization strategies—turbulence simulations prioritize spatial resolution, while seismic systems demand temporal precision.
However, two critical patterns emerge: (1) The compute time reductions (5–8×) consistently surpass error improvements (1.5–3×), suggesting PINNs excel more in accelerating simulations than enhancing absolute accuracy; (2) Performance scalability depends on the alignment between neural architectures and domain-specific physics, as seen in TFE-PINN’s explicit turbulence closure modeling versus MC-PINN’s implicit hierarchical learning. Open challenges persist in quantifying uncertainty for mission-critical deployments, particularly where PINN speed-accuracy tradeoffs intersect with safety thresholds (e.g., hypersonic thermal protection).
5. Emerging Paradigms and Future Directions The next frontier of PINN research lies in transcending current limitations through interdisciplinary convergence and hardware-algorithm co-evolution. While existing advancements demonstrate promise in controlled settings, their transition to industrial-grade tools demands strategic foresight and collaborative innovation. This section synthesizes emerging paradigms, evaluates their technological readiness, and proposes actionable roadmaps grounded in computational physics, machine learning, and domain-specific challenges.
5.1. Neuro-Symbolic Integration The fusion of symbolic reasoning with neural architectures offers a pathway to enhance interpretability while preserving data-driven flexibility. The SyCo-PINN framework exemplifies this synergy by generating candidate differential equations via inductive logic programming: (12) H = arg min H ∑ x i N ( u θ ( x i ) ; H ) 2
where H represents the hypothesis or model to be optimized, x i represents individual data points or inputs from the dataset, u θ ( x i ) is the output of the model parameterized by θ at input x i . while refining symbolic rules through physics-constrained backpropagation. In turbulence modeling, SyCo-PINN autonomously rediscovers missing vortex stretching terms with 92.7% accuracy, reducing Reynolds stress prediction errors by 41% compared to black-box models [20]. Despite these successes, challenges persist: the symbolic search space grows exponentially with equation complexity ( O ( 2 n ) ))( n represents the number of candidate mathematical operators in the symbolic regression problem), and reconciling interpretability with numerical stability remains non-trivial.
Integrating genetic algorithms with differential algebraic geometry verification tools could constrain the symbolic hypothesis space to 10 3 candidates, enabling efficient discovery of physically consistent equations. Open-source libraries like SymPINN [11] are pioneering this direction, offering pre-trained modules for turbulence closure and biochemical reaction modeling.
5.2. Federated Physics Learning Privacy-preserving distributed learning frameworks address critical barriers in multi-institutional collaborations. The Federated PINN (Fed-PINN) architecture employs homomorphic encryption and Shamir’s secret sharing to aggregate gradients securely: (13) L enc = HE ∑ i = 1 N L i
where L enc represents the encoded loss, which is the result of the encoding process, HE denotes the encoding operation or a function applied to the sum of the losses, L i represents the individual loss associated with each term in the sum. Ensuring zero patient data leakage in multi-center medical trials. In a cardiac modeling study across five hospitals, Fed-PINN achieved FFR ct prediction errors within 8% of centralized training while maintaining differential privacy budgets ( ϵ < 0.1 ) [17]. However, encryption overheads inflate training times by 5–10×, and hardware heterogeneity complicates gradient synchronization.
Adaptive compression techniques, such as top- k gradient sparsification [39], reduce communication costs by 70% without sacrificing accuracy. Meanwhile, federated meta-learning frameworks could enable cross-domain knowledge transfer—for instance, leveraging aerodynamics data to bootstrap scarce geothermal reservoir models.
5.3. Quantum-Enhanced Architectures Quantum computing holds transformative potential for high-dimensional optimization, yet its integration with PINNs remains nascent. Parameterized quantum circuits encode differential operators as Hamiltonians: (14) H = ∑ i = 1 n σ z i + ∑ i < j J i j σ x i σ x j
enabling parallel evolution in N -dimensional spaces with circuit depths D = O ( log N ) . In Equation (14), H represents the Hamiltonian, which describes the energy of the quantum system, σ z i is the Pauli Z operator acting on the i -th qubit. It is a matrix that represents a rotation about the z -axis in quantum mechanics, J i j represents the coupling strength between qubits i and j , often associated with interaction terms in quantum systems, σ x i is the Pauli X operator acting on the i -th qubit, which represents a rotation about the x -axis in quantum mechanics, σ x i σ x j is the tensor product of Pauli X operators acting on qubits i and j , describing the interaction between these qubits. Early IBM Quantum experiments demonstrate 8 × speedups for 10D Poisson equations, but noise-induced errors limit scalability beyond 20 qubits [40].
Co-designing quantum-native PINN architectures with error-mitigation strategies—such as dynamical decoupling and randomized compiling—could suppress decoherence in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Collaborative initiatives like the Quantum-PINN Alliance are curating benchmark datasets (e.g., 50-qubit plasma simulations) to quantify quantum advantage under realistic noise models.
Figure 3 evaluates the maturity of key directions through a computational physics lens: Neuro-symbolic PINNs (TRL-5): Laboratory validation in turbulence/closures; requires hardware acceleration for real-time deployment.
Federated PINNs (TRL-4): Pilot studies in healthcare; needs standardization of cross-domain encryption protocols.
Quantum-PINNs (TRL-3): Proof-of-concept simulations; dependent on error-corrected qubit architectures.

Bridging these gaps demands coordinated efforts across academia and industry. For instance, the OpenPINN Consortium has established interoperability standards for hybrid numerical-neural models, while NSF-funded initiatives like PhySense are developing IoT-edge frameworks for federated geophysical monitoring.
6. Conclusions The transformative potential of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in bridging machine learning and scientific computing has been systematically demonstrated through this comprehensive analysis. Our three-dimensional methodological-theoretical-applied framework establishes a rigorous foundation for understanding PINN evolution while addressing the critical gaps identified in existing literature.
6.1. Key Contributions First, the methodological co-evolution from adaptive optimization to hybrid architectures has been quantitatively validated: Neural tangent kernel-guided weighting achieves 230% convergence acceleration in Navier-Stokes solutions, while domain decomposition enables 5 × speedup in 3D turbulence modeling. The proposed hybrid numerical-deep learning paradigm reduces computational costs by 72% compared to traditional FEM in high-dimensional spaces ( p < 0.01 , n = 15 benchmarks).
Second, the theory-practice bidirectional mapping resolves longstanding disconnections: Operator approximation theory establishes L 2 error bounds with explicit dependence on network width, while Bayesian-physical hybrid frameworks reduce uncertainty intervals by 68% in clinical applications. The Rademacher complexity analysis provides actionable guidelines for balancing model capacity and generalization.
Third, cross-domain knowledge transfer has been systematically demonstrated: TFE-PINN achieves 5.12 ± 0.87% error in NASA hypersonic tests, ReconPINN improves MRI reconstruction SSIM by 0.18 ± 0.04, and SeisPINN reduces earthquake localization errors to 0.52 ± 0.18 km. These advancements are underpinned by fundamental design principles-physics-adaptive loss weighting overcomes spectral bias in 83% of nonlinear PDE cases, while wavelet-enhanced architectures improve multiscale modeling efficiency by 40%.
6.2. Current Challenges Three critical barriers persist: (1) Optimization instability in high-dimensional parameter spaces ( d > 10 4 ), where gradient pathology causes 58% of training failures. Despite optimization challenges at d > 10 4 , PINNs’ theoretical scalability (≥10D) exceeds FEM’s capabilities (≤3D), justifying higher coefficients in Figure 1; (2) Theoretical-computational gaps , as convergence guarantees for nonlinear PDEs ( ρ < 1 in pseudo-linearization) require unrealistic Lipschitz constants; (3) Hardware-algorithm co-design limitations , with quantum-PINN hybrids showing only 3.2 × speedup despite theoretical exponential potential.
6.3. Strategic Roadmap To realize the PINN 2.0 vision, three synergistic frontiers demand prioritization:
Neuro-symbolic integration . Combining graph neural networks with automated theorem provers to achieve 90% symbolic recall rates while maintaining numerical stability. Initial implementations demonstrate 41% error reduction in turbulence closure modeling.
Federated physics learning . Differential privacy-preserving architectures ( ϵ < 0.1 ) that maintain 95% model accuracy across multi-center collaborations, as validated in cardiac flow prediction ( r = 0.89 , p < 0.001 ).
Quantum-accelerated optimization . Parameterized quantum circuits enabling O ( log N ) complexity for N -dimensional parametric spaces, with IBM Qiskit prototypes demonstrating 8× speedup in elliptic PDE solving.
The convergence of these directions will catalyze PINNs’ transition from academic prototypes to industrial-grade tools. The next-generation framework promises to redefine computational science - achieving real-time multiscale modeling, certifiable physical consistency, and autonomous scientific discovery.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for personalized learning path generation by integrating deep knowledge tracing and cognitive load estimation within a unified framework. We propose a dual-stream neural network architecture that simultaneously models students' knowledge states and cognitive load levels to optimize learning trajectories. The knowledge state tracking module employs a bidirectional Transformer with graph attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between knowledge components, while the cognitive load estimation module utilizes multimodal data analysis to dynamically assess mental effort during learning activities. A dual-objective optimization algorithm balances knowledge acquisition with cognitive load management to generate paths that maintain optimal challenge levels. Experimental evaluations across multiple educational domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy (87.5%), path quality (4.4/5), and learning efficiency (24.6% improvement). The implemented system supports real-time adaptation based on performance and cognitive state, resulting in reduced frustration, higher engagement, and improved knowledge retention. This research contributes to both theoretical understanding of learning processes and practical implementation of next-generation adaptive educational technologies.This paper presents a novel approach for personalized learning path generation by integrating deep knowledge tracing and cognitive load estimation within a unified framework.

Abstract: The Fleet Solid Support (FSS) programme has completed the Critical Design Review (CDR), allowing for the transition from design to manufacturing of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary's next-generation support ships. The CDR assessed the detailed design of the vessels, covering structural integrity, safety standards, environmental sustainability, risk minimisation, and military systems integration. The successful CDR follows the Preliminary Design Review in October 2024 and includes a knowledge transfer programme with Spanish counterparts. The FSS ships will enhance the UK's carrier strike capability and support maritime security operations worldwide. The programme aims to deliver critical operational capability while rebuilding UK shipbuilding capacity through technology transfer and workforce development.

Abstract: The preservation of intangible cultural heritage is essential for maintaining cultural diversity and fostering intercultural dialogue, particularly in the face of globalization. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), traditional crafts such as Al Sadu, Al Khos, Al Talli, and Sea Crafts embody national identity and craftsmanship. However, modernization and shifting lifestyle preferences have led to a decline in the transmission of these skills, putting them at risk of fading from Emirati culture. This research explores strategies for safeguarding traditional Emirati crafts by integrating modern digital tools to engage younger generations effectively. The study highlights the significance of traditional crafts as carriers of historical and cultural narratives, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches to make them more accessible. It proposes the use of mobile applications, interactive learning platforms, and craft kits as contemporary solutions for cultural preservation. By leveraging technology, these crafts can be revitalized, ensuring intergenerational knowledge transfer and sustaining local artisanship. Ultimately, this research seeks to bridge the gap between tradition and modernity by fostering a renewed appreciation for intangible heritage among Emirati youth. Through digital engagement and community-driven initiatives, this study aims to contribute to the sustainable preservation of cultural traditions in an evolving social landscape.

Abstract: Human education transcends mere knowledge transfer, it relies on co-adaptation dynamics -- the mutual adjustment of teaching and learning strategies between agents. Despite its centrality, computational models of co-adaptive teacher-student interactions (T-SI) remain underdeveloped. We argue that this gap impedes Educational Science in testing and scaling contextual insights across diverse settings, and limits the potential of Machine Learning systems, which struggle to emulate and adaptively support human learning processes. To address this, we present a computational T-SI model that integrates contextual insights on human education into a testable framework. We use the model to evaluate diverse T-SI strategies in a realistic synthetic classroom setting, simulating student groups with unequal access to sensory information. Results show that strategies incorporating co-adaptation principles (e.g., bidirectional agency) outperform unilateral approaches (i.e., where only the teacher or the student is active), improving the learning outcomes for all learning types. Beyond the testing and scaling of context-dependent educational insights, our model enables hypothesis generation in controlled yet adaptable environments. This work bridges non-computational theories of human education with scalable, inclusive AI in Education systems, providing a foundation for equitable technologies that dynamically adapt to learner needs.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Urban green infrastructure (UGI) is an interconnected green network of multifunctional ecological systems in or around urban areas, playing a vital role in children's physical and cognitive development. Children's reduced interaction with UGI is partly attributed to their growing reliance on digital technology, yet digital interventions could positively influence this interaction. However, the influence of digital technology on children's perceptions of UGI remains understudied. This study aims to identify facilitators and barriers to children-nature interaction from their perspectives, examine the determinants of children's perception of connection to nature, and explore their perception of the UGI depending on their age, gender, and the presence or absence of a nature-related digital tool. A total of 153 children aged 8–12 and 109 parents participated in this study in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. Children explored a UGI route using either a GPS-based application, or a guide and a map. Children identified playing with peers and families as a facilitator of their interaction with nature and the use of digital tools as a barrier. The results show that children's perception of connection to nature is higher among girls, and positively correlates with their parents' perception of connection to nature and attitudes towards its benefits. Children's perception of connection to nature increases after a nature-related activity across all groups, with boys and older children showing greater improvement. For knowledge transfer and creating an engaging environment, a knowledgeable and enthusiastic tour guide still outperforms a digital tool. Our findings provide insights for urban designers, policy makers, and digital intervention developers to create child-friendly UGIs and digital technologies that enhance interaction with it.

Digital Transformation in Water Utilities: Status, Challenges, and Prospects

Author: Grigg, Neil S

Publication info: Grigg, Neil S. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/digital-transformation-water-utilities-status/docview/3223940241/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: What are the main findings? Digital transformation in water utilities occurs along two pathways, one to serve business operations and the other to operate and maintain their intensive infrastructures with evolving tools like data-centric asset management, decision support systems, SCADA systems, digital twins, and process optimization. Digital advances in water utilities occur more through their support community of their own technology gatekeepers, consultants, and vendors than through academic and government research projects, and technological innovation will evolve slowly among leading edge utilities, as many others are too stressed with basic issues to adopt many of them. What is the implication of the main finding? Support for utility leadership in data-centric management offers a promising avenue to overcome legacy problems of aging infrastructure, water losses, and contamination problems in drinking water networks. Promoting innovation through utility networking and peer-to-peer knowledge transfer offers policy leaders a promising pathway to improve urban water services and requires understanding of the importance of knowledge management in allocating financial resources for utility work. While digital transformation in e-commerce receives the most publicity, applications in energy and water utilities have been ongoing for decades. Using a methodology based on a systematic review, the paper offers a model of how it occurs in water utilities, reviews experiences from the field, and derives lessons learned to create a road map for future research and implementation. Innovation in water utilities occurs more in the field than through organized research, and utilities share their experiences globally through networks such as water associations, focus groups, and media outlets. Their digital transformation journeys are evident in business practices, operations, and asset management, including methods like decision support systems, SCADA systems, digital twins, and process optimization. Meanwhile, they operate traditional regulated services while being challenged by issues like aging infrastructure and workforce capacity. They operate complex and expensive distribution systems that require grafting of new controls onto older systems with vulnerable components. Digital transformation in utilities is driven by return on investment and regulatory and workforce constraints and leads to cautious adoption of innovative methods unless required by external pressures. Utility adoption occurs gradually as digital tools help utilities to leverage system data for maintenance management, system renewal, and water loss control. Digital twins offer the advantages of enterprise data, decision support, and simulation models and can support distribution system optimization by integrating advanced metering infrastructure devices and water loss control through more granular pressure control. Models to anticipate water main breaks can also be included. With such advances, concerns about cyber security will grow. The lessons learned from the review indicate that research and development for new digital tools will continue, but utility adoption will continue to evolve slowly, even as many utilities globally are too stressed with difficult issues to adopt them. Rather than rely on government and academics for research support, utilities will need help from their support community of regulators, consultants, vendors, and all researchers to navigate the pathways that lie ahead.

Full text: 1. Introduction As artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools advance, utilities and other business and service organizations are emphasizing digital transformation (DT) to exploit their possibilities [1]. The most familiar applications of DT are in e-commerce and interaction with chatbots, online services, and other digital interfaces, but in asset-intensive organizations like energy and water utilities, the focus and requirements are different [2]. Like many business organizations, these utilities use digital tools for consumer interactions, but their DT programs reach much deeper into the management of their extensive and asset-heavy infrastructure systems. Given their many challenges, DT offers a path to improved services and effectiveness, but how it is transforming them is not well understood amidst the extensive coverage of new technologies like AI and ML. This paper focuses on water utilities to trace how DT applications have evolved over time and to provide a framework to explain the status and prospects for new DT advances in them. Experiences among water utilities show a lack of awareness among utility managers and researchers about the actual advances and possibilities provided by DT. The paper identifies the specific technologies and methods used for DT in utilities and it probes how these are being implemented, with an emphasis on actual rather than claimed applications. It assesses the research base from the perspective of return on investment and the incentives of vendors and developers and it offers a road map toward the future for advances in research and implementation of DT in water utilities.
One driver for the work is the work of the Smart Water Task Force of the International Water Resources Association (IWRA) [3]. The work of the Task Force and its case studies indicated many diverse and situation-specific topics about smart water and smart cities, but they did not provide much insight into DT applications in water utilities. Another driver of the work reported here is the writer’s own experiences with utilities and water sector research organizations, which has provided insight into how advances are studied and adopted and barriers to innovation in the highly regulated asset-intensive utilities.
2. Methodology The methodology for the review (Figure 1) builds on data from the writer’s survey of drinking water utilities reported in a previous paper [4] and leads to a further study of technologies, methods, and implementation of specific DT strategies. Like other emerging technological developments, DT lacks a standard definition and interpretation for specific industries. This barrier is confronted by defining a concept for DT and then distinguishing its applications among the general case for all businesses and utilities. This is followed by parsing its applications according to the operational and business processes of utilities, which leads to a water utility DT model.
The water utility DT model is based on the archetype of a standard utility organization, which is an important step in the methodology because, without focusing on the most important advances in DT applied to distribution system infrastructure, its use for business operations like financial management is not significantly different from other subscription-type business models. The next step in the methodology is to investigate how DT has evolved as applied to distribution systems.
The literature reviewed stems mainly from utility industry sources, which report more rapidly about fast-moving innovations than the academic literature. Archival research literature can be misleading about the status of implementation of innovations because investigators are incentivized to report novel advances, but proof of application and results may be lacking. For example, the use case cited in the paper of water loss control shows how DT for this important goal stems back more than three decades and does not depend on current research publications about technological developments like AI and ML.
The use cases explained in the review of DT evolution provide a longitudinal view of how it has evolved and is understood within water utilities. Only with specific examples like this can one follow the somewhat fragmented and stepwise progress of introducing and testing new methods, which sometimes endure and in other cases do not.
The “Lessons Learned” section leads to a roadmap for utilities, including recommendations for research as well as organizational development. The concept is to focus on promising but practical applications of DT that fit within the set of incentives and constraints facing utilities, as well as to address the challenges faced by utilities that lack financial and management capacity to innovate.
3. Digital Transformation in Water Utilities The concept of DT is familiar because everyone experiences it in everyday life. From web-based shopping to dialogues with chatbots, people see a shift from interactions with people to encounters with computing devices, especially in e-commerce [1]. Business scholars explain that DT is about rewiring how organizations operate, deploying technology to respond to customers, and lowering costs [5]. Some discussions are about how DT impacts business organizations, such as requiring more educated workers, leading to fewer low-wage jobs and creating anxiety in workforce operations like hiring, supervision, and automation [6,7]. Studies also show that its deployment includes organizational capacity building, digitizing operations, and marketing [8].
These deployments of DT can be mapped from businesses to utilities to include business operations, system operations, and maintenance work. Most utility attention has been on electric power utilities [9], which offer a dynamic and rapidly changing sector for DT and where emerging technologies are disrupting business models with renewable energy, smart grids, and distributed sources like solar and battery storage. Application areas like electric vehicles, smart buildings, and data centers are changing demands, while end users still focus on cost and reliability, transparency, and cleaner energy. Like water utilities, energy utilities prioritize reliability while responding to customer choices about resource sources, environmental impact, and cost. They are monopolies, but they must respond to competition, such as EVs providing power and third parties monitoring electricity use. They are also challenged by legacy infrastructures and an aging workforce that may resist change or lack needed digital skills [10].
Water utilities share some attributes with electric power utilities and face similar challenges. Both are traditional services subject to regulation and operate in stable environments with some outdated technology and legacy systems. Both seek to integrate digital technologies into operations and customer relations while being challenged by the need to equip and prepare field workers with digital tools. They are also challenged by competition, trust issues, and consumer choices. Divergence in their operating environments focuses on the difference between the business worlds of energy and water, the direct connection of water with public health, and the unique attributes of water as a ubiquitous resource that touches people in many ways.
To illustrate levels of interest among water utilities, the American Water Works Association (AWWA) issued a series of “Water 2050” strategy documents and made recommendations about how to leverage technology to address barriers to innovation, regulatory compliance, and unintended consequences [11]. As with many such broad visions, the outcomes reflect general issues rather than specific and immediate needs, and the next step is to explore actual use cases to identify where change is happening.
A reality check shows that only a subset of all drinking water systems is prepared to adopt new digital technologies on a significant scale because much of the global population lacks access to organized utilities. The extent of such access is not known exactly as global statistics record the percentage of people having “piped water on premises,” but this does not indicate utility service, especially in rural areas. Such piped water can be problematic with low service levels [12].
Using available data, the writer estimates that the number of utilities ready for significant DT globally is on the order of 20,000, mostly in well-organized cities. In cities of high-income countries, most people are served by such utilities, although not all can afford the service [13]. For example, in the US, the number of customers served in urban areas with populations of 5000 or greater was about 270 million as of 1 January 2025 [14]. Drawing from statistics of community water systems, this indicates that about 6000 utilities in the US serve populations of 5000 or greater where most people live [15]. The situations in Europe and Japan are similar. Most water supply in England and Wales is provided by 32 privately-owned companies [16]. In Germany, there were approximately 6065 water supply enterprises and utilities in 2010, mainly small municipal utilities [17]. Data from the French National Agency for Water and Aquatic Environments [18] show that in 2009 there were some 14,217 drinking water services in France, but not all were well-organized utilities. Japan maintains a classification system and statistics for water supply services through its Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare [19], and ownership categories for “Water Supply Business” showed 1572 utilities in 2017, mainly managed by municipalities.
The estimate of on the order of 20,000 utilities globally is meant to identify a set of them with adequate organization and finances to undertake DT on a systematic basis. These utilities generally have extensive distribution systems with the possibility of exploiting the benefits of DT [20] for their legacy buried pipe networks and new components for growth, improvement, and control. These distribution systems are complex and expensive, and they must be sustained and managed, despite many challenges. This means that new controls and management systems must be grafted onto older systems, many of which are in impaired condition with leaks and vulnerable components.
4. Model of Digital Transformation in Water Utilities The organizational arrangements within water utilities change slowly and this enables analysts to chart how DT aligns with business practices. To illustrate, Figure 2 displays a typical organizational chart and where the pillars of DT will focus in each operational category. DT can be divided into management capacity, operations, and customer relations categories [8]. Management capacity can be divided further into business practices and management of infrastructure. The business processes are like those of other organizational types, mainly human resources, finance, and marketing. Customer relations stem from business processes, especially the financial part. Maintenance of system infrastructure requires preventive and corrective maintenance as well as overall asset management. The operations category addresses methods like decision support systems, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), digital twins, and related processes.
In a conceptual view, the way that utilities are advancing through DT for operations can be summarized as shown in Table 1, which shows management for physical, hydraulic, and water quality objectives. Evidence shows that utilities began to take more interest in active management of distribution systems about three decades ago, and this enabled breakthroughs like movement from reactive maintenance systems, from calculators to computer models, and from basic monitoring to more advanced systems based on new sensors. The DT era takes the transition further, with data-centric asset management, integrated models, and newer networks of sensors distributed more densely in distribution systems.
5. Innovation in Water Utilities Leaders in water supply utilities recognize the need for innovation to improve management effectiveness [21]. To assess progress, performance management can be used with metrics such as efficiency, compliance, service levels, and affordability [22]. However, performance management and benchmarking programs are not widely used among water utilities. To some extent, this is due to the conservative nature of water utilities, and it means that new paths to innovation and transfer to practice are needed.
Barriers are formed by ownership of most US water utilities by local governments, along with state and federal regulation for health effects, but regulation only by local political boards for rates and overall performance. These boards often lack expertise and may also lack incentives to implement management improvements. Privately owned utilities are indirectly regulated for management effectiveness as they must justify rate increases to regulatory commissions. Another challenge is that while progressive and well-funded water utilities may implement research findings, transferring them to other utilities faces more challenges.
Most research projects offer only modest advances, and results are rarely implemented on a large scale. Researchers tend to focus on the development of tools that can be published in journals, but enduring innovation occurs over time and requires the involvement of proactive managers, in-house experts, and industry vendors. It can occur by the actions of technology leaders working through water industry networks when groups with a common purpose are networked [23].
As an example, the innovation of a new method to audit water losses is an object lesson for innovation. The process started around 1990 when a vision for a comprehensive approach to water loss control emerged among leading water associations. Work was organized via committees and task forces of the International Water Association (IWA), which was formed in 1999 as a merger of the International Water Supply Association (IWSA) and the International Association of Water Pollution Research. AWWA leaders participated in the work and released the first edition of Manual of Practice M36 on Water Audits and Leak Detection in 1991.
Long-term leadership was exercised by Allan Lambert, a British engineer who chaired the first IWA Water Loss Task Force. He had water utility experience and was prepared due to work done beginning in the 1980s, when measuring leakage was important in the privatization of UK water utilities. The work of the IWA Water Loss Task Force, comprising 22 national reports, is summarized in its 2000 report [24], which documents the collaboration beginning in 1991 with the IWSA Report on “Unaccounted for Water and the Economics of Leak Detection.”
Now, thousands of utilities use the method, and some state agencies have begun to require it. The innovation was explained this way: “Today’s budding water loss industry grew out of the efforts of a bunch of brilliant, obsessive, far-thinking engineers in Britain who started something called the National Leakage Initiative in the early 1990s.” “Led by a man named Allan Lambert, they developed a methodology for categorizing and quantifying water leakage, and predicting losses, so they could rigorously determine how to reduce them. This was vital in Britain, which had some of the world’s oldest water systems.” “Their efforts were famously successful” [25].
Regulatory pressure helped drive the innovation and, without it, voluntary adoption of new methods may not have occurred. In the absence of regulatory pressure, other research-based innovations, like pipe break models and distribution system optimization, have not taken off, despite considerable research on them. Another driver is return on investment, which can enable utilities to keep rates low and avoid political pressure.
Ultimately, innovation will require proactive managers, technology entrepreneurs, and industry vendors more than planned transfer from research projects. Despite this experience, dialogue continues about improving the research-to-practice process [26]. These discussions usually focus on research-based tools like models and optimization algorithms and participants in the dialogue tend to be consultants, academics, or technical gate keepers in utilities.
6. Chronology of Use Cases of DT In a general sense, there is much discussion about DT because it applies to organizations across the spectrum of industries and businesses. DT studies seem mostly focused on companies that build products and services for end consumers, but in asset-intensive industries they face different strategic and organizational challenges [2]. Water distribution systems are asset-intensive because sustaining the infrastructure is the dominant management issue [27], along with cyber security.
Progress in DT of drinking water utilities has been occurring for decades. For example, research papers go back at least to 1957 on computer-based distribution system analysis [28]. In the 1960s, Murray McPherson, director of the Urban Water Research Program (UWRRP) of the American Society of Civil Engineers, was working on automatic control of distribution systems, having gained experience as a “water and sewer research engineer” at the Philadelphia Water Department [29]. As part of the UWWRP, he led extensive research on innovation using computers and information systems [30]. The writer worked with McPherson in the 1970s on a study of automatic control of combined sewer systems and it was evident by then that SCADA systems were evolving as operational technologies [31] for use in distribution system network models and system control strategies. Utilities also embraced GIS and advanced databases as they emerged, often with support from innovative vendors [32].
To provide perspective on the evolutionary implementation of DT by water utilities, Table 2 lists the approximate dates when key technologies became operational. These dates are approximate because technologies usually develop incrementally. Each technology has its own history, with many players and events. Technologies like the Internet and software packages for general use are not listed.
Recent visioning among AWWA leaders aims to extend and advance this past work [33,34]. Also, studies sponsored by the WRF confirm the interest and rapid movement of technological applications related to DT [35]. The proof of its success lies in the use cases for applications across the pillars of DT.
6.1. Organizational Capacity Building Management capacity across the organization is a leading concern of utilities seeking to apply DT technologies [36]. Their business services are like those of other public and private sector organizations, although public sector organizations may face more constraints in personnel management and purchasing due to government rules [37]. Otherwise, employee data, hiring, retirements, benefits, and other human resources functions will be similar. On the financial side, utility billing and customer information will be similar in water and energy utilities, but differ from the private sector focus on profitability, sales, and market growth. Many changes in the application of AI to utility billing are apparent, and links with customer interaction goals are increasing to respond to consumer desires [38].
Organizational capacity to manage the condition and performance of system infrastructure is a unique challenge facing asset-intensive distribution systems. To define the problem, generalized data began to appear shortly after passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974, and this fueled interest in the use of data to manage infrastructure inventory, maintenance scheduling, failures, and renewal. To respond to this need, the method of asset management has been growing in use and priority among utilities [39].
The collection and use of utility data for management purposes have evolved rapidly within the water supply industry. AWWA’s surveys to provide infrastructure data began before the emergence of computers. During the 1980s the efforts intensified, and the association is now collecting utility data for benchmarking systems [40] and performance assessment [22]. This coincided with a paradigm shift from passive to more active management of distribution systems that occurred during the 1980s. In parallel, the US Environmental Protection Agency began to survey community water systems, with a focus on infrastructure inventory, condition, and financial needs. Surveys were conducted in 1995, 2000, and 2006 [41].
As data systems emerged, the WRF was pioneering standardized formats for utility data management. A project to identify key asset data for water sector utilities recommended asset hierarchies for use in data identification and management, asset hierarchies, attributes, and performance indicators [42]. However, as with other research products, implementation by water utilities has been slow.
While much work has been done to collect utility data and use it to improve management [43,44], most applications are supported by commercial software packages, which have proved more attractive to utilities than in-house approaches [45]. Some software packages, such as distribution system models, have proved more popular than others. For example, the writer participated in a project to develop software to rate risks of main breaks and it proved useful, but utilities lacked workforce capacity and incentives to use it [46].
As computer systems improved in the 1970s and 1980s, water utilities focused on digitizing legacy data from work orders, maps, and other technical information sources. The writer witnessed this in two large utilities, one in the UK, which was preparing for privatization, and another in the US, where legacy infrastructure data were being captured in databases with numerical and anecdotal data, photographic copies of drawings, and related system data.
With the emergence of GIS for management of distribution systems, a different revolution has occurred. Now, spatial and non-spatial data are combined in one platform and facilitate visualizing and managing the spatial infrastructure in distribution systems [47,48]. In the writer’s survey mentioned earlier, practically every utility reported using a GIS to manage distribution systems.
In a general way, asset management is useful across different fields by offering new ways to perform tasks like keeping records and scheduling work [49]. Utility asset management uses a data intensive approach to decision making for maintenance, rehabilitation, renewal, or replacement of distribution system assets, as well as other infrastructure. The method began to evolve around 2000 and, in 2008, the WRF produced a research road map for it [39]. Despite its potential, progress in the implementation of asset management has been relatively slow, and there is no regulatory requirement to incentivize utilities to adopt it [50].
6.2. Distribution System Operations In parallel with asset management, digitization of operations has become a a major topic of DT in utilities. At a general level, this refers to the activities shown in Figure 3, which illustrates a system to be operated (distribution system), data to be collected from sensors (like pressure, flow rates, water quality), decisions to be made (like needed additional flow or pressure regulation), and commands sent to actuators (such as valve operators or pump controls). As an example, a model can be used for tasks such as computation of water age, which might in turn inform the decision to change a flow rate, for example. The models and decision logic can be considered as a decision support system, and they are commonly associated with SCADA systems that organize data and provide commands to be sent.
SCADA systems began with phone and radio alerts and transitioned to use of computers as they became available [31]. The field of control engineering coalesced to organize the needed devices in the form of sensors, actuators, control panels, and related equipment. Now SCADA systems are ubiquitous and require ongoing support, such as that provided by AWWA by its operational technology committee [51].
Cyber security is a major issue in DT, especially for asset-intensive organizations, and SCADA systems provide a point of vulnerability. The disadvantage of networked information and control systems for critical infrastructure is that they are vulnerable to hacking. This is, of course, a general problem among all critical infrastructures and it worsens as systems become more networked and hackers become more sophisticated [52,53,54].
Digital twins are also emerging rapidly, but they are not uniform because diverse uses are being developed across many application areas [55]. They are related to traditional enterprise information systems and decision support systems, both of which were initiated some four decades ago [56,57]. In the water industry, discussion is occurring among a relatively small group of stakeholders, some who are organizing through AWWA [58] and the Smart Water Networks Forum (SWAN) [59]. Such attention by small groups of advocates is not unusual in the initial stages of technology development. Definitions by such groups can seem vague, like a digital twin is “A digital, dynamic system of real-world entities and their behaviors using models with static and dynamic data that enable insights and interactions to drive actionable and optimized outcomes” [60]. Unless you were in the group that developed that very general definition it would be hard to understand it. Like many general concepts, digital twins can be explained better through examples [61,62]. One such example was by Ostfeld et al. [55], who offered a concept of three layers, a GIS to organize basic data, a system interpretation layer with various models and computational capabilities, and a decision support layer.
The availability of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is enabling much of the DT in utilities. The term means a system to record the consumption of energy or water on an hourly or more frequent basis and to transmit measurements over a communication network to a collection point [63]. In electric power utilities, it is used to manage distribution lines, collect interval data, detect tampering and outages, study loads due to devices and premises, and for other tasks. Water utilities adopted the AMI term from energy utilities and can use the devices for tasks such as automated meter reading, studying water losses, managing peak loads, and planning for growth. Although the water industry has been slower than the electric power industry to embrace AMI, growing demand, shrinking supplies, higher operating costs, and workforce challenges make them appealing. Prospects include remote shut-off, real-time water quality monitoring, and pressure management capabilities [64].
Controlling water losses from distribution systems is a common problem in water utilities, and DT provides tools to help with the task. A promising strategy is time-of-day pressure control that combines pressure sensors with SCADA and algorithms to manage pumps and valves to control pressure ranges. Efforts began prior to 2000 to develop the digital data-based method for water loss auditing discussed earlier [65]. The research process for the method is a good example of DT advances in the water industry. The problem of massive water losses was recognized and, even by the 1950s, AWWA leaders were working on water loss control. The subsequent work was organized via committees and task forces of the International Water Association (IWA). Work of the IWA Water Loss Task Force led to widespread adoption of a standardized water loss audit methodology [60].
Water main failures are another ubiquitous problem affecting utilities, and with DT they can be anticipated, to some extent. Attempts have been made to model the risk of breaks, but analytical tools are not used by most utilities. The problems stem from data quality and complexity of statistical models. Tools based on machine learning may improve prospects for use of available data, and off-the-shelf software may nudge utilities to adopt the models more broadly [66].
Given the multiple demands placed on utility managers, the process of distribution system optimization (DSO) is appealing. It means to monitor and control all processes in an integrated way to meet performance goals. Water quality optimization requires the capability to simulate water age [67], and the concept of optimization has been extended to include the hydraulic and physical performance of distribution systems. DSO was adopted by AWWA’s Partnership for Safe Water (PSW) program, which co-sponsored a WRF project to develop the concept [68]. DSO uses pressure, main breaks, and chlorine residual as indicators of physical, hydraulic, and water quality integrity, and the program depends on numeric criteria and certified self-assessment checklists. Participation in the PSW program for distribution systems is low, likely because it is evolving and not required by regulators. In the writer’s survey, most utilities indicated a lack of understanding of it. Use of the term “optimization” may be problematic as it can mean different things, such as optimization of hydraulic network design, a popular research topic.
The use cases described represent areas of emphasis selected by utility leaders through their participation in the WRF or by publication in industry journals. In addition, papers are emerging that announce new tools in search of specific applications but lack proof-of-concept. Examples include how new machine learning tools may help with treatment plants, water reuse, and related control issues [69,70,71]. General utility issues like drought vulnerability can be studied with machine learning [72]. These papers offer the possibility for further research to investigate the feasibility of their promised applications.
6.3. Enterprise Management in Utilities The use cases illustrate many instances where DT is affecting all enterprise activities, including operations, asset management, and interaction with customers. The resulting enterprise management systems (EMSs) are successors to the older concept of management information systems and can have different names, including enterprise content management, enterprise resources planning, among others.
Logically, the EMS can be used at organizational levels for different purposes, at the executive level for data to support strategic decision making, at the managerial level for planning and controlling organizational functions, and at the operational level for business process management. These uses span business processes like document management, customer relationship management, and human resources.
These business processes must consider both utility and customer perspectives. Revenue is a critical issue for utilities for which devices for metering infrastructure are essential. Customer interaction with the utility and especially with rates and service issues is increasingly important. Water utilities have many new technologies available for functionalities from management of accounts to support for customer self-service. Meter data management systems are emerging for use with data analytics to study customer segmentation, consumption and payment patterns, and location-based studies. Information systems are paired with GIS and maintenance management systems to provide utilities with integrated analysis capabilities. Customers increasingly use social media to manage their accounts online [73].
Such management systems appeal to many types of organizations and software companies seeking new market niches. Most work has been for private sector firms and among information science researchers, and little effort has been directed at the public sector, including utilities [74]. The concept of the EMS is more logical for utilities than for other public sector organizations because they have processes and customers that are like many other types of businesses. An example of such an EMS is at Pennsylvania State University, which uses it for its utilities [75]. Among water utilities, popular names for it, like EMS, are not used much, but attention is focused on DT and on data analytics. The WRF [76] sees it related to shifting careers for data professionals in the water sector.
While terms like EMS seem to come and go, a coalescence is apparent among concepts related to DT in utilities. This involves the merging of concepts for enterprise management, decision support systems, digital twins, simulation models, and centralized data support. Such a merger is conceptualized in different ways, such as in [77], where the authors combine data analytics and management, visualization, DSS, and models to provide user experiences through dashboards and communication links. That conceptualization uses the digital twin as the enterprise management framework, but it focuses on system operations and does not seem to extend to business processes that affect customers.
Figure 4 offers a comprehensive view using the enterprise management space as the boundary for activities related to decision support, models, and data management. The operational models shown in Figure 3 are the heart of it. DT runs through it as the various data and information sharing links operate to use data for management of system operations, system status, and customer relations. The digital twin concept is embedded at three levels in this framework: Digital twin of the physical system;
Digital twin of the physical system and its control mechanism;
Digital twin of the enterprise with data analytics and visualization through dashboards and communication links.

7. Lessons Learned and a DT Road Map for Water Utilities The literature and use cases show how DT in water utilities is evolving incrementally as a gradual transformation driven by return on investment (ROI) and the demands of sustaining regulated water services in different settings. As water utilities innovate, their goals are constrained by the need to sustain reliable services without regulatory violations and the limits imposed by utility workforce challenges. The net result is a demonstrated reluctance to adopt innovative methods unless required by external pressures. Utilities need a road map based on performance improvement, return on investment, and their regulatory environments to serve as a practical guide to considering DT implementation.
An example lesson is that performance management through use of indicators, benchmarking, and the DSO concept is progressing slowly. The AWWA SOTWI report does not include performance improvement among the top ten concerns of utilities [27], although it is implicit in the financial categories. So, in the category of lessons, performance management drops off the list of priorities in favor of conservative approaches to avoid regulatory sanctions, public disfavor, and system failures.
The announcements about DT and related technologies like AI, ML, digital twins, and optimized control suggest a promising future is ahead, but the proof is in actual utility experiences rather than research or vendor announcements about possible applications. Examples of utility experiences can be offered by the categories of DT based on capacity building, operations, system management, and customer engagement.
DT in business support services is proving helpful, as it is in other types of organizations. Utility billing and customer information are used in similar ways in water and energy utilities, and their use responds to the shared need for financial sustainability and improved transparency for customers. Improved capacity for technical management using digital methods is also promising, with the application of data analytics, GIS, and digital twins helping some utilities to cope with workforce challenges.
Data systems and data analytics are important due to their usefulness in managing capital-intensive water utilities infrastructures, especially distribution systems. They are used extensively to assess infrastructure conditions and performance to support asset management and operational needs. While the WRF pioneered standardized formats for utility data management, utilities favor commercial packages due to their lack of workforce capacity for research, development, and experimentation. Meanwhile, researchers are integrating and synthesizing legacy data systems to develop new data analytics methods to interpret system behavior, but the extent to which utilities will adopt new measures is uncertain.
GIS has been a bright spot for digital management of distribution systems. The combination of spatial and system data in one place is proving useful across many utility operations, and utilities are able to locate their GIS systems centrally so as to leverage data and workforce capabilities to take advantage of system capabilities. The future for GIS seems assured across many urban management applications related to distribution systems, such as management of street systems and other utilities that are co-located with water pipes.
Asset management is another promising technology, which will rise in importance as systems continue to age and require more attention. The method is data intensive and aligns well with DT, but this challenges utilities to do better in collecting and managing their system data. To support asset management, utilities can model risk of breaks, but models have not been implemented extensively. Machine learning may offer new possibilities. Reluctance of utilities to implement asset management can be traced to organizational causes and will require team-building approaches to make improvements.
In the operation of distribution systems, SCADA is ubiquitous and requires support to keep systems functional and effective. Cyber security is a major issue with these control systems, as is keeping systems maintained and functional. This is a special problem for smaller utilities with workforce and financial challenges. New sensors, actuators, and even IoT additions to systems will challenge the complexity of SCADA systems and the related digital accessories like display boards, performance checks, alarms, and related operational features.
Among the new technologies and methods, digital twins seem to offer substantial benefits and prospects. While there is some confusion about what they are, system models have advanced to a sophisticated level and continue to improve. Their future seems to offer an organizing platform for assembly of models, data systems, and control features for distribution systems management.
On the management front, DSO is important but has not been implemented extensively. Water quality optimization via simulation for water age has advanced, due to pressure from regulatory requirements and reporting. The other parts of DSO focused on computer-based performance management are promising, but they lack regulatory drivers and other proven ROI demonstrations, at least so far. The associated process of water loss control systems has been mandated in many US states, and they can pass the ROI test well in water-short areas. System management techniques like optimization of time-of-day pressure control offer possibilities for implementation of new sensors and actuators.
AMI offers promising applications, but systems have not been implemented extensively. Once again, the ROI test seems to explain why utilities are slow in implementing them. The key is in the limited funding utilities have for capital investment and infrastructure management. If the choice is about whether to replace risky system elements or to invest in experimental technologies, the risk reduction goal will dominate.
Most of the DT categories reviewed are methods rather than a device or management system. Among the latter, GIS and SCADA seem to have the greatest momentum and perceived value to utilities, while digital twins are still an evolving concept and not yet fully developed as a management system or set of equipment. AMI has received much attention, but rates of implementation suggest a “wait and see” attitude among utilities.
Among methods, business support and customer information systems are evolving rapidly, as they are in other industries. Water loss control offers return on investment and is subject to some regulatory requirements, so it appears to have a good future. Technical management methods offer much promise, but they seem to be most discretionary and lag somewhat in adoption. These include asset management, modeling of break risk, and DSO.
Innovation in DT occurs within a regulated environment where utilities keep a close eye on return on investment. It happens slowly and requires networking within the utility industry. Opportunities for researchers and vendors focused on promising areas not yet exploited fully. Business services and customer information systems have many competitors. The arena of technical management seems ripe for new products and services. Digital twin packages might be a promising market, especially if costs can be controlled. New devices such as AMI and related sensors offer good possibilities when they can pass the ROI test.
The use cases described offer promising pathways to elevate the performance of utilities, but water utilities undergoing DT must confront workforce challenges. Studies indicate that utilities need job descriptions for digital expertise and to attract learners who can develop new skills for use of technologies such as digital twins, drones, and virtual reality [78]. This is in addition to legacy workforce issues that have been created as utility workforces age, and many institutional memories fade away. These must be replaced by newer digital memories and the application of knowledge management programs [79,80] to identify key organizational knowledge, capture it when needed, and disseminate it to workers who need it.
A preface to identifying a road map for research must recognize why utilities resist implementing research findings. Due to their business models, they are naturally risk-averse, and unless required to implement new technologies or methods, they may not be willing to reach out to try them. The writer faced this experience when leading a project to implement new data technologies to minimize pipe breaks and found utility resistance due to workload constraints and lack of regulatory pressures or incentives to cooperate with other utilities.
Research to advance DT in water utilities occurs more among practitioners than in academia. One reason is that academic research tends to focus more on basic science and academics may lack access to real problems that utilities and their consultants and vendors work on. Another reason is the set of incentives for leading consultants and vendors to develop new products and services given that they serve research enterprises like the Water Research Foundation (WRF), which responds to the specific needs of its subscribers. This set of conditions led to two WRF projects to identify road maps for future research in DT arenas. The writer participated in both, one aimed at improving asset management and the other at generating a research agenda for a WRF focus area about “Intelligent Distribution Systems.” [81].
The research process for the intelligent distribution systems project involved experts from utilities, regulators, associations, academia, and innovative companies to identify topics and projects. It included a literature review for promising technologies for operational and customer-related arenas over topics like monitoring equipment, communication systems, data collection and analysis, regulatory changes, and elements in electric, gas, and oil distribution systems. The industry review focused on interviews at the annual AWWA conference as well as a review of industry literature, the Internet, and contact with vendors.
Examples of topics include: AMI, monitoring for water quality and pipe stresses, actuating valves, condition assessment, pipe location, and technologies like smart pipes, drones, pigs, and robots. Projects rated with the highest priority focused on near-term needs of utilities, like meeting power requirements, security and communication methodologies, using AMI to meet customer needs, assessing benefits, data integration and analytics, and use of DT for water loss control.
Future research needs for DT in water utilities can be divided into two lines, one for near-term utility uses like the projects described and the other for more basic examinations of the same topics. The basic topics are likely to focus on data analytics, cybersecurity, optimization methods using AI and ML, and new methods to interact with customers and the public. The literature review for the present study indicates a gap between current research on these topics and applications, but potential breakthroughs offer attractive possibilities for the future.
8. Conclusions The review of water utility progress with DT shows that, despite the current trendiness of AI and ML, progress is apt to continue with gradual change and few breakthroughs. The new technologies are attractive and they offer a promising future, but experiences show that utilities adopt new technologies and methods by considering return on investment and their ongoing need to sustain effective water services in a regulatory climate with a range of socio-economic settings. Utility workforce challenges also show reluctance to adopt innovative methods unless required by external pressures or confronted with overwhelming cost-benefit data. These constraints seem to explain a general reluctance among utilities to adopt higher levels of performance management strategies in their operations.
Business support services in water utilities are undergoing DT at about the same pace as in other industries, especially similar ones like electric power. New information systems are enabling possibilities to serve customers better while at the same time implementing water conservation and other needed management programs.
Technical management methods using digital tools offer advantages for many utilities because they can leverage system data for purposes like maintenance management, system renewal, and water loss control. GIS has proved to be a powerful tool for such digital management because spatial and system data located in one place provide the needed data for multiple utility management processes. Also, utilities can integrate data management by locating their GIS systems centrally to leverage data and workforce capabilities jointly, as in responding to work orders, repairing breaks, and addressing other infrastructure issues. Utilities favor commercial packages to organize their data due to their lack of workforce capacity for research and development of data management systems.
GIS spatial data combined with system data provides the basis for asset management systems. They are promising, but the relatively slow adoption of asset management signals that new ways to implement it are needed. The method is data intensive and aligns well with DT, but this challenges utilities to do better in collecting and managing system data by integrated approaches across organizations. Team-building approaches will be needed to make improvements in many utilities.
In the operational world, SCADA is ubiquitous and can be paired with control strategies based on models, sensors, actuators, and management oversight to keep systems functional and effective. Cyber security will continue and even grow as an issue, especially for utilities with workforce and financial challenges. SCADA systems can be part of digital twins, which seem to offer advantages of enterprise data, decision support, and simulation models. Once capabilities are in place for upgraded versions of SCADA systems, distribution system optimization should be implemented more widely. Digital twins can integrate AMI devices and methods like water loss control through more granular pressure control. Even models to anticipate breaks can be integrated within them.
To underscore their importance and promise, GIS and SCADA are proven DT tools for water utilities, and other management systems and methods are evolving. Digital twin packages also promise to be an effective integrating method to help with workforce challenges while improving management outcomes. These technologies, together with new approaches to leverage data analytics, seem to point to the areas of future emphasis in DT of water utilities.
Researchers continue to integrate and synthesize data systems, but how rapidly and broadly utilities will adopt new measures is uncertain. The WRF has reports to help utilities with DT, but not all utilities have access and, even when they do, the research studies may need further work to be implementable. DT is complex and has many parts that make it difficult for utilities to implement on a comprehensive basis. Utilities will need help from their support community of regulators, consultants, vendors. and researchers to navigate the pathways that lie ahead.

Abstract: This study conducts a bibliometric and content analysis based on publications indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection, aiming to map the evolution and key themes in horticultural research in the context of technological innovation and sustainability. The results reveal a strong orientation toward digitalization and automation, particularly through the integration of artificial intelligence, mechatronic systems, and sensor-based monitoring in crop management. In the field of biotechnology, keywords such as gene expression, genetic diversity, and micropropagation reflect a sustained research interest in improving crop resilience and disease resistance through genetic and in vitro propagation techniques. Furthermore, concepts such as environmental control, soilless culture, energy efficiency, and co-generation highlight the focus on optimizing growing conditions and integrating renewable energy sources into protected horticultural systems. The geographical distribution of studies highlights increased academic output in countries like India and regions of sub-Saharan Africa, reflecting a global interest in transferring advanced technologies to vulnerable areas. Moreover, collaboration networks are dominated by leading institutions such as Wageningen University, which act as hubs for knowledge diffusion. The findings suggest that future research should prioritize the development of durable, energy-efficient horticultural technologies adapted to various agro-climatic zones. It is recommended that policymakers and stakeholders support interdisciplinary research initiatives, promote knowledge transfer mechanisms, and ensure equitable access to innovation for smallholder farmers and emerging economies.

Full text: 1. Introduction Agriculture has seen remarkable technological advances over the past century that have fundamentally transformed the way food is produced. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, from 1961 to 2020, global agricultural output increased nearly fourfold, while the global population grew 2.6 times. This resulted in a 53% increase in agricultural output per capita, indicating substantial improvements in productivity [1].
The development and widespread adoption of mechanization, new chemical inputs, improved varieties, and, more recently, digital technologies have allowed agricultural productivity to increase at an unprecedented pace [2,3]. As a result, global food production has managed to outpace population growth: for example, in the second half of the 20th century, although the world’s population more than doubled, cereal production tripled, while the area under cultivation increased by only ~30% [4]. This continued technological progress has been essential for ensuring food security and reducing hunger worldwide [5,6,7].
The mechanization and industrialization of agriculture were the first major technological transformations, allowing for increased efficiency by replacing manual labor with motorized farm machinery [8,9,10]. In the United States, agricultural production doubled between 1950 and 2000, while the agricultural labor force was significantly reduced [11]. In parallel, industrialization brought the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, intensifying production [5]. The Green Revolution of the 1960s–1970s reinforced these advances through the introduction of high-yielding crop varieties, expanded irrigation and support policies, leading to a tripling of cereal production between 1960 and 2000 [12,13,14]. However, this intensification also generated environmental problems such as soil degradation and water pollution [15].
Advances in biotechnology, in particular genetically modified organisms (GMOs), have brought a new technological leap. The adoption of GMO crops, such as Bt cotton, has led to yield increases and reduced pesticide use [16]. The development of genome-editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, offers promising solutions for climate-resilient varieties. Although advances in biotechnology, particularly through genetically modified organisms (GMOs), have contributed significantly to yield increases, pest resistance, and reduced reliance on chemical pesticides, their adoption is not without challenges. One major limitation lies in the regulatory restrictions and public skepticism surrounding GMO cultivation in many regions, particularly in the European Union. Ethical concerns, potential impacts on biodiversity, and the long-term environmental effects of transgenic crops continue to be debated [17]. Moreover, the costs associated with the development and patenting of genetically modified seeds often restrict access for smallholder farmers, exacerbating inequality in agricultural systems. Therefore, while tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 present promising avenues for developing climate-resilient and high-yielding horticultural varieties, their implementation must be accompanied by transparent risk assessments, inclusive policy frameworks, and equitable access to ensure long-term sustainability and public acceptance [18].
Since the 2000s, precision agriculture and digitization have become priorities, relying on GPS systems, sensors, and Big Data to optimize resource use [19,20]. IoT technologies and artificial intelligence enable real-time monitoring and customized application of agricultural inputs, enhancing both productivity and sustainability (Table 1) [21,22].
Automation and robotics in agriculture represent the most recent technological advances in the field and are included in the concept of Agriculture 4.0, which aims to develop autonomous machines and robots capable of performing complex tasks with minimal human intervention [23,24,25]. Autonomous tractors and drones, equipped with GPS autopilot systems, have demonstrated efficiency in agricultural work through precision and reduced need for human operators [26]. Research in agricultural robotics has also led to the development of prototype robots that can weed, pick fruit, and even milk cows, combining sensors and decision algorithms to improve performance [27,28,29,30]. In addition, current research is focused on creating collaborative systems of small-scale robots that communicate with each other and collaborate to accomplish tasks [31,32]. Although a full automation of agriculture is unlikely in the near future, current technologies considerably reduce the amount of physical and monotonous labor, boosting the attractiveness of the agricultural sector for new generations [33,34,35].
In parallel with the development of robotics, technological progress in agriculture has led to significant increases in productivity [36]. Through the use of advanced technologies, yields of agricultural crops have increased substantially, helping to reduce hunger and improve access to more affordable food [37,38]. Technological progress has also improved resource use efficiency, and the total factor productivity (TFP) indicator shows that much higher yields are now being obtained from the same resources [39]. Precision agriculture, through the use of sensors and other modern technologies, allows farmers to reduce resource use, which contributes to the economic sustainability of farms [40]. Innovative technologies, such as genetically modified crops, have also reduced the need for chemical pesticides, with benefits for biodiversity and farmers’ health [41,42,43,44].
However, technologies have not only had positive effects. The agricultural intensification associated with the Green Revolution has also had environmental costs, including soil degradation and water pollution, and the inappropriate use of technologies has led to long-term declines in productivity [45]. Thus, the current emphasis is on “sustainable intensification”, which aims to increase production in a way that conserves natural resources [46,47]. Precision agriculture, integrated pest management, and plant breeding for nutrient efficiency are just some of the technological solutions that contribute to reducing the ecological footprint of agriculture while maintaining productive performance [48].
Technological progress in agriculture has revolutionized the sector, but significant challenges remain, such as slowing yield growth and the impact of climate change on productivity [49]. Also, differences in access to technology between large and smallholder farms in developing countries can deepen rural inequalities, underscoring the need for support for technology transfer [50]. Agriculture of the future must be both productive and environmentally sustainable, including innovations such as extreme climate-resilient crops and the use of artificial intelligence for organic farming [51,52]. Alternative solutions, such as vertical farms and high-tech urban agriculture, can offer new ways to increase food production while reducing dependence on extensive land. To ensure sustainable technological progress, continued investment in research and development, together with interdisciplinary collaboration and responsible supportive policies, is essential [53].
However, the development of technologies in agriculture has not only had positive effects but has also led to a number of adverse environmental consequences, such as soil degradation, water pollution, and reduced biodiversity. These pose important challenges for the sustainability of modern horticultural systems. Furthermore, environmental conditions, in particular temperature and humidity, play a key role in determining crop productivity, influencing physiological processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, and nutrient uptake [54]. At the same time, these climatic variations affect the composition and properties of plant lignocellulosic polymers—such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin—with a direct impact on plant resistance to stress and their valorization in bio-economic industries [55].
Although technological advances have been discussed in the general context of agriculture, it is essential to mention that horticulture, as a vital sub-domain of agriculture focused on the cultivation of fruits, vegetables, and ornamental and aromatic plants [56], has been directly and significantly influenced by these innovations in the development of the agricultural sector. The close link between agriculture and horticulture means that technological advances observed in agriculture are integrated and adapted in horticultural practices, considering the specificities of this sector, such as labor intensity, precision requirements, seasonality, and biological diversity [57]. Thus, the present study focuses on the impact of new emerging technologies on the horticultural sector, analyzing how they contribute to its transformation into a sustainable and innovative context.
The aim of this paper is to conduct a bibliometric analysis of research in horticultural technologies to assess research trends, key authors, and collaborative networks in the sector. This will provide a clear view of technological advances, main research themes, and the development of the field over time.
Thus, the main research questions are:
RQ1. How has the number of scientific papers dedicated to the application of technologies (artificial intelligence, robotics, and innovative technologies) in horticulture evolved over time?
RQ2. What are the main concepts and research themes related to horticultural technologies identified through keyword map analysis?
RQ3. Who are the most published and cited authors in the field of technology (AI, robotics, innovative technologies) in horticulture, and what role do they play in collaborative networks?
RQ4. How is research distributed among the major institutions, and which academic centers have the greatest impact on the application of advanced technologies in horticulture?
RQ5. Which countries contribute the most to research in digitized and sustainable horticulture, and how are international collaborations in this field structured?
The study focuses on the bibliometric analysis of the term “technology in horticulture”, a topic that has been insufficiently investigated in the specialized literature, although emerging technological advances have a significant impact on this sector. Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics are profoundly transforming the way in which horticultural processes are managed, but there is a considerable gap in research exploring their application. Through this analysis, the study aims to identify emerging trends in the field and to deepen the understanding of the existing gaps in applied research in horticulture. The main justification for this approach lies in the significant impact of innovative technologies on increasing productivity and sustainability of the horticultural sector, an essential aspect for the future of this branch. The distinct contribution of the study lies in providing a detailed picture of the evolution of research in this field and identifying emerging technological directions that can shape the future of horticulture. Finally, through the analysis carried out, the study contributes to the foundation of future research, providing an integrated vision of collaboration networks and topics of major interest.
The study is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the materials and methods used to conduct the bibliometric analysis. Section 3 reports the results obtained from the analysis, including key observations derived from the thematic mapping. Section 4 offers a discussion on the evolution of research in this area and the influence of technological advances on the horticultural sector. Section 5 provides a review of the relevant literature, highlighting the main emerging trends in applied technologies in horticulture, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and other innovative solutions. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the conclusions of the study, outlining the main findings and identifying future research pathways.
2. Materials and Methods Bibliometric analysis was used to identify the main research directions and connections between relevant concepts in horticultural technology. This quantitative method allows us to assess the impact of scientific literature, highlighting the most influential papers, authors, and institutions, as well as the relationships between them [58,59].
Bibliographic data were collected exclusively from the Web of Science database due to the accuracy and high quality of its metadata and the rigorous criteria for the selection of publications. Web of Science is recognized for its extensive coverage of prestigious journals, eliminating the risk of including sources of questionable quality, which ensures the relevance and reliability of the results of the bibliometric analysis [60,61].
Using the specialized software VOSviewer (version 1.6.18), a bibliometric analysis will be performed. VOSviewer is a program designed to create, visualize, and explore maps based on network data. According to the VOSviewer manual, this software allows the construction of maps either directly from the adjacency matrix of a network or by using co-authorship, co-appearance, citation, bibliographic linkage, or co-citation networks. These maps can represent scientific publications, journals, researchers, organizations, countries, or keywords, with data extracted from sources such as Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, or RIS files [62].
This approach allows for the analysis of keywords, authors, institutions, and countries, facilitating the identification of the most used concepts, the most cited authors, and the main research centers. Furthermore, bibliometric analysis provides information about the popularity of a publication among researchers and assesses the reputation of its authors [63]. As emphasized by Zupic and Čater [64], this method supports the realization of systematic literature reviews, guiding researchers to influential studies and allowing an objective mapping of a research field.
For the bibliometric analysis, the data were selected from the Web of Science database due to its rigorous nature, selective indexing, and extensive coverage of high-quality scientific literature. Web of Science is internationally recognized for its high standards of publication selection, which ensures a high degree of relevance and scientific validity of the sources included in the analysis [65,66].
In the first step (Figure 1), a search of the Web of Science Core Collection was conducted using the keywords “technology in horticulture” within the “Topic” field, which yielded a total of 1269 documents relevant to the subject. However, no boolean operators (such as AND, OR, or NOT) or additional related terms were included to broaden or refine the query. An advantage of this approach is that it provides a focused dataset centered on the exact phrase entered, thereby minimizing the inclusion of irrelevant results.
To narrow the analysis to relevant scientific fields, a filter was applied based on the related Web of Science categories. The major fields included in the analysis were agricultural sciences (horticulture, agronomy, plant sciences, agricultural engineering), environmental sciences, biotechnology, agricultural economics, applied engineering, and other related fields. The most representative categories (Figure 2), according to the number of papers identified, are Horticulture (419), Agronomy (203), Plant Sciences (180), Multidisciplinary Agriculture (128), and Environmental Sciences (105). After applying this filter, the dataset was reduced to 949 papers, which were used for bibliometric analysis.
It is important to note that a temporal filter was not applied, meaning that the analysis includes all documents indexed in the Web of Science database from 1979 to the present. This decision was intentional, as the aim of the study is to observe the evolution and progression of technological advancements in the field of horticulture over time. By including the full temporal range, it is possible to capture both the early developments and the more recent innovations, thus offering a comprehensive overview of how technology has been integrated and adapted within the horticultural sector. Excluding older documents through a time restriction might have led to the omission of foundational studies or historical trends that provide essential context for understanding current research directions. At the same time, by examining the entire timeline, one can better identify emerging trends, detect shifts in research focus, and evaluate the long-term trajectory of technological applications in horticulture.
Subsequently, the documents were categorized (Figure 3) according to publication type, the majority being scientific articles (478), followed by conference proceedings (365) and literature reviews (109). Other document types identified include book chapters (27), editorial materials (9), early access articles (4), and abstracts of scientific meetings (4), as well as proofreads, data papers, and scientific letters, each with only one associated document.
This rigorous selection allowed a detailed bibliometric analysis of the existing literature on applied technologies in horticulture, facilitating the identification of the most relevant trends, authors and institutions in this field. The following bibliometric maps are produced: keyword map, author map, most cited authors map, institutional map and country map.

To strengthen network analysis of co-authorship in horticulture, it is essential to explore several future research directions. First, delving deeper into the mechanisms driving the formation of international collaborative clusters may provide a clearer understanding of the factors influencing global scientific integration. Investigating project funding, national research policies, and institutional strategies could therefore shed light on how particular countries become central nodes in the network.
Second, the impact of collaborations on scientific performance and the applicability of results requires further attention. Assessing academic productivity in terms of the intensity of international collaborations could highlight the benefits of an extended network and allow the identification of the most effective partnership models. In this context, a detailed bibliometric analysis of the publications generated by each cluster could contribute to a better understanding of the dominant research areas.
Moreover, extending the analysis to the dynamics of collaborations over time could reveal emerging trends in the global horticultural research network. Benchmarking the evolution of partnerships over the past decades would allow the identification of up-and-coming regions and could help to formulate integration strategies for countries with a weaker presence in the network.
5. Future Research Pathways Based on Literature Analysis This section reviews the existing literature on emerging technologies in the horticulture sector, highlighting how these innovations drive digital transformation and support agricultural sustainability in the face of climate change. The analysis is structured around several key thematic areas, including the use of IoT and sensor networks in horticulture, the application of data analytics and artificial intelligence for decision support, the integration of robotics and automation into horticultural processes, the use of drones and aerial imaging for monitoring, and the role of blockchain in enhancing supply chain traceability. The section concludes with an exploration of the main challenges and future directions, offering a comprehensive perspective on the impact of technological innovation in modern horticulture.
5.1. IoT and Sensor Networks in Horticulture Horticulture has widely adopted the Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time monitoring of crops and the growing environment [77]. Networks of sensors collect data on soil moisture, temperature, air humidity, light, and nutrients, which are transmitted via wireless networks to cloud platforms or local computers for analysis [78]. The system developed by Postolache et al. [79] is an example, utilizing sensors and mobile apps for soil management on vegetable farms. These solutions enable precision irrigation and fertilization, reducing resource consumption and maintaining yields. In Michigan, an IoT system for precision irrigation reduced water consumption by up to 30% [80]. Geng et al. [81] found that the intensive use of digital technologies increased economic benefits by 30.4% through increased efficiency and reduced costs.
IoT-connected moisture sensors enable automatic irrigation only when needed [82]. Dong et al. [80] implemented a sensor network for automatic irrigation that significantly reduced water consumption in blueberry and tomato fields without affecting yield. Integrating weather forecasts and evapotranspiration models enables fine-tuning of irrigation, saving 50–60% water [80,83]. Nutrient management is also optimized. IoT sensors that measure nitrates and potassium allow fertilizers to be applied only where needed [84]. The system created by Postolache et al. [79] generates real-time maps of soil fertility, reducing the risk of pollution and improving crop quality [85,86].
In modern greenhouses, IoT networks monitor the microclimate through temperature, humidity, CO 2 , and light sensors [87]. The data feed automated climate control systems. The smart system proposed by Kim and Son [88] regulates the conditions for each area of the greenhouse, which is difficult to do manually. IoT climate control, combined with smart algorithms, increases yield and energy efficiency. Access to data via smartphone or online dashboards enables rapid interventions [89,90]. However, costs and complexity remain barriers for smallholder farmers [80,83] and current research addresses these challenges through simpler interfaces, accessible sensors, and more reliable connectivity [83]. Thus, IoT networks are becoming the backbone of digital horticulture, supporting analytics and automation [91].
5.2. Data Analytics and AI for Decision Support The growing volume of data from IoT sensors, drones, and other sources has enabled the use of advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to support decisions in horticulture. Cloud-based systems analyze sensor data and weather forecasts to optimize irrigation and fertilization [92]. Algorithms identify patterns, such as declining soil moisture, to automate actions, although data heterogeneity remains a challenge [93,94]. IoT-AI integration facilitates what Wolfert et al. [95] call “smart agriculture”.
AI has remarkable performance in detecting diseases and pests through image analysis and deep learning. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) identify plant problems with over 95% accuracy, often outperforming human experts [96]. These models, integrated into smartphones or IoT cameras, enable early interventions [97]. Some commercial systems use hyperspectral imaging and machine learning (ML) for precise pesticide application [98], reducing chemical use [89].
AI is also used for crop forecasting and crop monitoring. ML models analyze time series (temperature, light, irrigation) to predict yields and harvest timing [92,99]. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms optimize greenhouse climate, increasing energy efficiency [100]. In vertical farming, sensors and AI regulate light, nutrients, and growth cycles for higher productivity [99].
Despite the benefits, challenges persist. Many farmers are unfamiliar with complex analytical tools, which is why technology providers are developing user-friendly interfaces [101]. Data interoperability and information security are other obstacles, addressed by Agriculture 4.0 initiatives and cybersecurity solutions [102,103]. However, successful case studies—such as multi-robot systems used in citrus orchards—have demonstrated increased efficiency in crop monitoring and prediction [104]. With technological advancement, AI could in the future support prediction of taste, nutritional value, or assisted selection of horticultural varieties [105,106].
5.3. Robotics and Automation in Horticulture Perhaps the most visible technological trend in horticulture is the emergence of robotics and automation for labor-intensive tasks [107]. Horticultural operations like planting, pruning, weeding, and harvesting have traditionally relied on manual labor—often seasonal and skilled [108]. Advances in robotics, however, are enabling the development of machines that can partially or fully automate these tasks. Field robots and autonomous vehicles equipped with sensors and manipulators are now being tested or deployed in orchards, greenhouses, and fields [109]. For example, robotic harvesters for high-value fruits (e.g., apples, strawberries, tomatoes) use machine vision to detect ripe fruit and robotic arms or end-effectors to gently pick them. Birrell et al. [110] developed a field-tested robotic system for iceberg lettuce harvesting that could cut and collect lettuce heads at a rate of about 1 head every 5–6 s, with an accuracy comparable to human pickers. Such successes illustrate the rapid improvements in robotic capabilities in the past few years. A review by Botta et al. [111] shows that modern agricultural robots are integrating advanced perception (cameras, LiDAR) and manipulation technologies, enabling tasks like selective harvesting, crop scouting, and precision spraying. For instance, a smart sprayer robot can navigate through orchard rows and selectively spray pesticide only on infected sections of trees, guided by computer vision-based disease recognition [112]. This targeted approach reduces chemical use and worker exposure while ensuring effective pest control [113].
Despite these advances, the adoption of robotics in horticulture has been slower than in other sectors, due in part to the complexity of agricultural environments [114]. Hutsol et al. [115] noted a lag in agricultural robot deployment compared to manufacturing or logistics, with especially large gaps in adoption between different regions (e.g., Asia leading, others lagging). Horticultural tasks often involve variable, unstructured environments (outdoors, varying plant shapes and positions) that are challenging for robots to handle reliably [116]. However, recent innovations are closing the gap. Improvements in machine vision and AI help robots better locate and identify targets like fruits or weeds in variable lighting and foliage conditions [117]. For example, deep learning vision algorithms now enable robots to recognize ripe strawberries even under complex foliage and lighting changes, significantly boosting picking success [118,119]. Additionally, new sensing modalities such as hyperspectral imaging and soft grippers are being integrated to reduce crop damage and improve detection accuracy [120].
Another critical factor is navigation and autonomy. Horticulture robots must safely navigate between plants or along rows without harming crops or themselves. Techniques like GPS navigation (in open fields) and LiDAR or camera-based row guidance (in orchards/greenhouses) are commonly used. Kutyrev et al. [107] developed an autonomous robotic platform for apple orchards that uses inertial and satellite navigation combined with LiDAR-based obstacle avoidance to travel along orchard rows and perform tasks like spraying and mowing. Key performance factors identified for such robots include high positioning accuracy, recognition capability, and autonomy of operation [121,122]. In an expert survey, Kutyrev et al. [107] found that the degree of autonomy, positioning precision, and crop/obstacle recognition accuracy were the top three factors determining the effectiveness of horticultural robots. This highlights that simply having a robot is not enough—it must be intelligent and autonomous enough to handle tasks with minimal human intervention to truly add value [123].
Current automated systems range from semi-autonomous machines (which assist human workers) to fully autonomous robots. Co-robotics, or human–robot collaboration, is one approach being trialed—for example, a human picker might work alongside a vision-guided harvesting robot that positions fruit for easier picking or carries heavy loads [101]. Autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) are already common in large greenhouses for transporting trays of plants or produce without human drivers [124]. Robotic arms in packing houses can grade and pack fruits, aided by computer vision for quality sorting [97]. In nurseries, potting robots and transplanting machines automate what were once highly laborious manual tasks [117].
Notably, unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and drones (UAVs) are often used together for horticultural automation—UAVs can provide aerial scouting and mapping, while UGVs perform on-the-ground actions [125]. A study by Liu et al. [126] presented a multi-UGV routing algorithm to optimize path planning for multiple farm robots working collaboratively, showing improved coverage and efficiency in tasks like weeding or monitoring. Meanwhile, research on coordinating aerial and ground robots in orchards [127] is enabling more holistic automation: drones identify issues from above and dispatch UGVs to address them. For example, a drone might detect water stress in a section of an orchard, then send an autonomous rover to that location to irrigate. This type of heterogeneous robotic teamwork is an active area of development [128,129].
Labor shortages in horticulture (exacerbated by restrictions on migrant labor and pandemics) are a major driver for robotics. The UK’s recent Automation in Horticulture Review found growers “actively seeking to adopt technologies when proven” to alleviate labor dependency and increase productivity [130]. Early commercial successes like robotic lettuce harvesters [131] and strawberry pickers are encouraging investment and research. Still, robotics is not a panacea—many delicate tasks in horticulture (such as selective hand pruning or blossom thinning in fruit trees) are too complex for robots to replicate fully [132]. The diversity of crops and tasks in horticulture means a one-size-fits-all robot is unlikely; instead, a variety of specialized robots are being developed for specific crop types and operations [133]. This diversity also means some lower-value or highly complex tasks may remain impractical to automate economically in the near term [130].
Despite these challenges, the trend is clearly toward greater mechanization. A survey by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) reported rapid growth in the sale of agricultural robots worldwide [124]. Many horticultural firms are now experimenting with robotic solutions, and public–private partnerships are funding trials [134]. As costs come down and technology matures, experts anticipate robotics will transform horticulture’s labor profile over the next decade [89,116]. Importantly, recent studies emphasize responsible development of agri-robotics—involving end-users in design, considering socio-economic impacts, and ensuring safety [101]. With careful implementation, robotics can significantly boost productivity and offset labor shortfalls in horticulture while also taking over dangerous or repetitive tasks to improve worker welfare.
5.4. Drones and Aerial Imaging Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, have become essential tools in precision horticulture, offering detailed spatial insights into crop health, growth, and stress that are difficult to observe from ground level [135,136]. Equipped with high-resolution or multispectral sensors, drones can detect early signs of pests, nutrient deficiencies, or water stress [137]. For example, multispectral imagery allows identification of low-vigor zones via NDVI indices, while thermal cameras reveal water-stressed vines in vineyards [138,139]. UAVs provide on-demand, high-resolution monitoring, with better flexibility than satellites [137].
Abbas et al. [137] highlight how drones, integrated with AI, detect diseases like citrus greening or tomato blight early, enabling targeted interventions that reduce chemical use. Drone imagery can identify infected trees, allowing precise treatment rather than whole-orchard spraying [140]. Beyond monitoring, drones are now used in spraying, pollination, planting, or even mechanical thinning, particularly in hard-to-access terrains. Experimental systems include drones that identify diseased plants and spray them directly or shake trees for harvest [112].
Combining UAV data with ground sensors enhances decision making. For instance, drone imagery can be overlaid with IoT-based soil moisture data for comprehensive analysis [141], while integrating drone and GNSS data improves navigation for orchard robots [142]. In precision viticulture, UAVs help map grape variability to optimize selective harvesting [136,143].
Ease of use has improved, with accessible drone platforms and user-friendly processing software. Regulations have evolved, enabling broader deployment, though limitations such as weather constraints and data processing remain. Despite challenges, UAV adoption is rising. Del Cerro et al. [138] report exponential growth in drone use in agriculture, while Bacco et al. [144] and Abbas et al. [137] emphasize their potential in enhancing precision horticulture through detailed, scalable monitoring.
5.5. Blockchain and Supply Chain Traceability While on-farm applied technologies attract much attention, innovations in the post-harvest supply chain are significantly influencing horticulture. One notable technology is blockchain, used to improve transparency and traceability from farm to consumer [145]. Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that securely and immutably records data. In horticultural chains, it is used to track produce at stages such as harvesting, packing, transportation, and retail, with each step recorded and accessible by scanning a code [146]. This enhances traceability and food safety [147]. In cases of contamination, such as a spinach-related disease outbreak, blockchain allows for quick identification of the farm and lot involved, which reduces response time compared to traditional paper-based systems [147,148].
In addition to security, blockchain adds value by guaranteeing authenticity and origin—for example, a premium brand can certify that fruit comes from a specific region and complies with organic or fair-trade standards, thus preventing fraud [149]. According to a systematic review by Ellahi et al. [147], the main drivers for blockchain adoption in agri-food supply chains are transparency, traceability, and trust among stakeholders. Thus, blockchain can encourage collaboration between farmers, distributors, and retailers—for example, a retailer can more easily collaborate with small producers if the system provides quality guarantees [150].
In horticulture, blockchain is often integrated with IoT sensors and QR codes to automate data collection. For example, temperature and humidity sensors can record conditions in the cold chain and write the data directly to the blockchain [151]. Similarly, CO 2 sensors in warehouses can provide useful information [149]. Some pilots are also using smart contracts—codes that run automatically when pre-set conditions are met. Thus, payment to the farmer can be triggered automatically when the produce reaches its optimal condition, confirmed by sensor data [146,152].
The adoption of blockchain in horticulture is still in its infancy, being present mostly in developed markets and for high-value or export products. Challenges include high costs, the need for digital infrastructure and stakeholder training, and the issue of data quality—blockchain cannot correct wrong data input [153]. Also, scalability and speed of blockchain networks remain obstacles, but new solutions such as permissioned ledgers address these issues. Still, interest is growing—large retailers such as Walmart are testing blockchain for traceability of fresh vegetables, and some governments are supporting the technology for phytosanitary certifications and export documentation [154].
So blockchain complements digital on-farm technologies by extending transparency and trust throughout the supply chain. It ensures that quality products are tracked and verified all the way to the consumer, rewarding responsible producers and enabling rapid responses to problems [155]. In a context where consumers increasingly want to know where their food comes from, blockchain is becoming a valuable tool in horticulture [156], part of a broader digital transformation in agriculture.
5.6. Challenges and Future Directions While digital technologies bring significant benefits to horticulture—from resource savings and increased yields to traceability in the supply chain—several challenges remain that limit widespread adoption. One of the biggest is technology adoption and farmer training. High costs and lack of technical expertise particularly affect smallholder producers [49,89]. Farmers want reliable solutions with a clear ROI; if the technology is complex or the benefits are not obvious, adoption stalls [101,134]. Proposed solutions include simple mobile apps, plug-and-play sensors, and shared services such as drone-as-a-service [157].
Another challenge is the interoperability of systems. Without integration of sensors, software, and equipment, data silos emerge that limit the efficiency of digitization. Integrated Farm Management Integrated Systems (FMIS) and open data standards are being developed to connect IoT, AI, and blockchain [156,158]. High-speed internet access in rural areas is essential for these solutions.
The human factor is important; modern technologies require new skills, and reluctance to change can be high. Training programs and involving farmers in co-creating technology are keys to success [49,90,101]. Data privacy raises ownership and security concerns. Farmers need to be confident that their data is protected and used correctly, while digital solutions need to be equipped with safety protocols and redundancy [95,103,159].
In the future, AI and robotics will become more accessible and versatile, able to manipulate fragile fruits thanks to 3D vision and soft grippers [115,116]. Swarm robotics and predictive models for disease and weather will enable more proactive management. The convergence of blockchain, IoT, and AI will provide full transparency—from a product’s origin to its water or carbon footprint—increasing demand for sustainable products [147]. Digitization will support farmers in achieving organic standards and certifications [97,159].
In conclusion, horticulture is undergoing a profound digital transformation. Connected technologies—IoT, AI, robotics, and blockchain—form a digital ecosystem that can increase productivity and sustainability. For success, it is necessary to support adoption, train human resources, and adapt technologies to farmers’ real needs. While on-farm applied technologies attract much attention, innovations in the post-harvest supply chain are significantly influencing horticulture. One notable technology is blockchain, used to improve transparency and traceability from farm to consumer. Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that securely and immutably records data. In horticultural chains, it is used to track produce at stages such as harvesting, packing, transportation, and retail, with each step recorded and accessible by scanning a code [152]. This enhances traceability and food safety [146]. In cases of contamination, such as a spinach-related disease outbreak, blockchain allows for quick identification of the farm and lot involved, which reduces response time compared to traditional paper-based systems [153,156].
In addition to security, blockchain adds value by guaranteeing authenticity and origin—for example, a premium brand can certify that fruit comes from a specific region and complies with organic or fair-trade standards, thus preventing fraud [146]. According to a systematic review by Ellahi et al. [147], the main drivers for blockchain adoption in agri-food supply chains are transparency, traceability, and trust among stakeholders. Thus, blockchain can encourage collaboration between farmers, distributors, and retailers—for example, a retailer can more easily collaborate with small producers if the system provides quality guarantees [156].
In horticulture, blockchain is often integrated with IoT sensors and QR codes to automate data collection. For example, temperature and humidity sensors can record conditions in the cold chain and write the data directly to the blockchain. Similarly, CO 2 sensors in warehouses can provide information.
6. Conclusions The present study highlights the profound transformation of modern horticulture, which is in a continuous process of adaptation and innovation, driven by the integration of new technologies, the principles of sustainability, and the development of interdisciplinary research. The bibliometric analysis carried out identified the most relevant research trends, the most influential authors and institutions, as well as international collaboration networks, highlighting that emerging technologies—such as artificial intelligence, automation systems, advanced biotechnologies, and big data analytics—are at the heart of the current horticultural research agenda. Thus, a new paradigm of horticultural production is emerging, one that is smart, energy efficient, and oriented towards reducing environmental impact.
A strength of this article is the systematic approach to the data using bibliometric methods, which provided a broad and well-structured perspective on the scientific dynamics in the field. The study contributes to an accurate mapping of the global academic space while providing a solid basis for guiding future research initiatives, international partnerships, and innovative agricultural policies. However, a key limitation of this research is the exclusive use of the Web of Science database. This choice may restrict the visibility of some important papers in complementary databases such as Scopus or national databases, which may influence the geographical, thematic, and institutional representativeness of the results.
Future research directions should focus on broadening the applicability of artificial intelligence in horticulture by developing predictive models capable of optimizing processes such as irrigation, fertilization, or disease management. There is also a need to advance research on the integration of autonomous and mechatronic systems, adaptable to different types of crops and climatic conditions, to reduce human intervention and increase operational efficiency. Although some autonomous and mechatronic technologies are already deployed in horticulture, such as harvesting robots, automated irrigation systems, or drones for crop monitoring, research in this area remains essential to refine and adapt them to a wider variety of conditions and crops. The need for these technologies stems from the growing challenges faced by the horticulture sector, including a shortage of skilled labor, climate change, pressure for resource efficiency, and increasing demand for agri-food products. In this context, autonomous systems help to reduce human intervention in repetitive and tedious processes, increasing operational efficiency and reducing long-term costs.
The integration of these technologies is not only about automation but also about moving towards smart agriculture, capable of making real-time decisions based on data collected from sensors, cameras, and other connected devices. In this way, mechatronic systems allow rapid adaptation to the specific conditions of each crop—from soil type and moisture levels to early detection of diseases or plant stress. It is important that these technologies are further developed towards increased adaptability so that they are effective in high-tech greenhouses as well as in traditional farming environments or resource-limited regions.
In addition, the extension of research on autonomous systems should also aim at integrating these technologies into a complete digital ecosystem, including data management platforms, machine learning algorithms, and automated decision-making systems. The aim is not just to replace manual labor but to optimize the entire production chain from planting to post-harvest, ensuring traceability and quality of horticultural products. It is also essential that these solutions are affordable and economically viable, especially for small producers and farms in vulnerable regions.
More research is also needed on the impact of climate change on horticultural genetic diversity and the use of gene-editing technologies to develop more resilient varieties. Finally, it is essential to strengthen the educational and social dimension of technological horticulture by creating digital training programs and interactive resources to support the adaptation of the workforce to new technological requirements.
In the context of sustainable horticulture, future research should also prioritize the development of low-energy consumption technologies and circular economy models that minimize waste and maximize resource efficiency. Special attention should be given to sustainable water management systems, including rainwater harvesting and closed-loop irrigation, which are crucial in drought-prone or water-scarce regions. Furthermore, studies exploring the use of biodegradable materials and eco-friendly packaging in post-harvest processes could contribute significantly to reducing the environmental footprint of horticultural production. Lastly, integrating sustainability assessment frameworks into digital agricultural platforms could help farmers monitor and improve their environmental performance in real time, aligning productivity goals with ecological responsibility.
Policymakers have a key role to play in supporting the transition of horticulture towards a sustainable, digitized, and innovation-driven model. Through informed public policies, they can facilitate the funding of multidisciplinary projects that integrate emerging technologies and green practices. It is important to establish regional innovation centers to act as hubs for applied research and testing of technological solutions in horticulture. Public–private partnerships should also be encouraged to accelerate the transfer of technologies from research to practical implementation. Another key issue is to adapt education systems to include training in areas such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and precision agriculture. Investing in the digital skills of the horticultural workforce can help make the sector more efficient and competitive. Policymakers also need to promote international collaboration, especially with under-represented regions such as Africa and Latin America, to ensure an equitable distribution of knowledge. There is also a need to develop a clear legislative framework for the use of advanced technologies in agriculture that protects both the environment and food security. Public policies should stimulate inclusion and equal access to innovation, especially in vulnerable areas.
In conclusion, the horticulture of the future will be shaped by the interaction between science, technological innovation, and sustainability-oriented policies. The present study makes a valuable contribution to this by proposing a strategic research agenda that supports the transition towards a more efficient, resilient, and socio-economically and ecologically equitable global horticultural system.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with Extended Reality (XR) technologies to address knowledge transfer challenges in industrial environments. The proposed system embeds domain-specific industrial knowledge into XR environments through a natural language interface, enabling hands-free, context-aware expert guidance for workers. We present the architecture of the proposed system consisting of an LLM Chat Engine with dynamic tool orchestration and an XR application featuring voice-driven interaction. Performance evaluation of various chunking strategies, embedding models, and vector databases reveals that semantic chunking, balanced embedding models, and efficient vector stores deliver optimal performance for industrial knowledge retrieval. The system's potential is demonstrated through early implementation in multiple industrial use cases, including robotic assembly, smart infrastructure maintenance, and aerospace component servicing. Results indicate potential for enhancing training efficiency, remote assistance capabilities, and operational guidance in alignment with Industry 5.0's human-centric and resilient approach to industrial development.

Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) apps provide innovative solutions for improving treatment adherence, facilitating lifestyle modifications, and optimizing blood pressure control in patients with hypertension. Despite their potential benefits, the adoption and recommendation of mHealth apps by physicians in Germany remain limited. This reluctance may be due to a lack of understanding of the factors influencing physicians' willingness to incorporate these digital tools into routine clinical practice. Understanding these factors is crucial for fostering greater integration of mHealth apps in hypertension care. BACKGROUND Mobile health (mHealth) apps provide innovative solutions for improving treatment adherence, facilitating lifestyle modifications, and optimizing blood pressure control in patients with hypertension. Despite their potential benefits, the adoption and recommendation of mHealth apps by physicians in Germany remain limited. This reluctance may be due to a lack of understanding of the factors influencing physicians' willingness to incorporate these digital tools into routine clinical practice. Understanding these factors is crucial for fostering greater integration of mHealth apps in hypertension care.The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between physicians' information needs and acceptance factors, and how these elements can support the effective integration of mHealth apps into daily medical routines. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between physicians' information needs and acceptance factors, and how these elements can support the effective integration of mHealth apps into daily medical routines.We conducted a qualitative study involving 24 semistructured telephone interviews with physicians, including 14 cardiologists and 10 general practitioners, who are involved in the treatment of hypertensive patients. Participants were selected through purposive sampling to ensure a diverse range of perspectives. Thematic analysis was conducted using MAXQDA software (Verbi GmbH) to identify key themes and subthemes related to the acceptance and use of mHealth apps. METHODS We conducted a qualitative study involving 24 semistructured telephone interviews with physicians, including 14 cardiologists and 10 general practitioners, who are involved in the treatment of hypertensive patients. Participants were selected through purposive sampling to ensure a diverse range of perspectives. Thematic analysis was conducted using MAXQDA software (Verbi GmbH) to identify key themes and subthemes related to the acceptance and use of mHealth apps.The analysis revealed significant variability in physicians' information needs regarding mHealth apps, particularly concerning their functionalities, clinical benefits, and potential impact on patient outcomes. These informational gaps play a critical role in determining whether physicians are willing to recommend mHealth apps to their patients. Key determinants influencing acceptance were identified, including the availability of robust knowledge about the apps, high-quality and reliable data, generational shifts within the medical profession, solid evidence supporting the effectiveness of the mHealth apps, and clearly defined areas of application and responsibilities within the physician-patient relationship. The study found that acceptance of mHealth apps could be significantly increased through targeted educational initiatives, enhanced data quality, and better integration of these tools into existing clinical workflows. Furthermore, younger physicians, more familiar with digital technologies, demonstrated greater openness to using mHealth apps, suggesting that generational changes may drive future increases in adoption.

Furthermore, younger physicians, more familiar with digital technologies, demonstrated greater openness to using mHealth apps, suggesting that generational changes may drive future increases in adoption.The successful integration of mHealth apps into hypertension management requires a multifaceted approach that addresses both the informational and practical concerns of physicians. By disseminating comprehensive knowledge about the variety, functionality, and proven efficacy of hypertension-related mHealth apps, health care providers can be better equipped to use these tools effectively. This approach necessitates the implementation of various knowledge transfer strategies, such as targeted training programs, peer learning opportunities, and active engagement with digital health technologies. As physicians become more informed and confident in the use of mHealth apps, their acceptance and recommendation of these tools are likely to increase, leading to more widespread adoption. Overcoming current barriers related to information deficits and data quality is essential for ensuring that mHealth apps are optimally used in routine hypertension care, ultimately improving patient outcomes and enhancing the overall quality of care.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has profiled hundreds of millions of human cells across organs, diseases, development and perturbations to date. However, the high-dimensional sparsity, batch effect noise, category imbalance, and ever-increasing data scale of the original sequencing data pose significant challenges for multi-center knowledge transfer, data fusion, and cross-validation between scRNA-seq datasets. To address these barriers, (1) we first propose a latent codes-based scRNA-seq dataset distillation framework named scDD, which transfers and distills foundation model knowledge and original dataset information into a compact latent space and generates synthetic scRNA-seq dataset by a generator to replace the original dataset. Then, (2) we propose a single-step conditional diffusion generator named SCDG, which perform single-step gradient back-propagation to help scDD optimize distillation quality and avoid gradient decay caused by multi-step back-propagation. Meanwhile, SCDG ensures the scRNA-seq data characteristics and inter-class discriminability of the synthetic dataset through flexible conditional control and generation quality assurance. Finally, we propose a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of scRNA-seq dataset distillation in different data analysis tasks. It is validated that our proposed method can achieve 7.61% absolute and 15.70% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on average task.

Abstract: Purpose This paper aims to address the challenges faced by the cheese industry, particularly concerning the preservation and transfer of traditional cheesemaking knowledge. It emphasises the need for innovative solutions in sustainably managing knowledge and skills amidst changing demographic and technological landscapes. Design/methodology/approach Our approach consists of developing and implementing a digital tool, the cheese eK-Book, which is designed to capture, structure and disseminate cheesemaking knowledge. This tool is based on a semantic network and is accessible via smartphones and tablets and aims to facilitate continuous learning, knowledge transfer and collaboration across diverse stakeholders in the cheese production sector. Findings The study highlights several critical findings. Traditional cheesemaking knowledge is currently at risk due to a number of factors, including the ageing of skilled workers, a lack of succession planning and pressures from globalisation and industrialisation. The European dairy sector is evolving towards more specialised and automated production, requiring a skilled workforce capable of adapting to these changes. There is a significant gap between traditional cheese makers and research institutions, hindering the adoption of new technologies and best practices. The cheese eK-Book offers a promising solution to these challenges by preserving knowledge, supporting continuous learning and enhancing collaboration between industry stakeholders and educational/research institutions. The tool facilitates access to scientific knowledge, promotes work–life balance by offering a range of flexible learning opportunities and supports tailored training programmes based on individual users’ needs. Originality/value This article contributes original insights by proposing a comprehensive digital solution tailored to the specific, current needs of the cheese industry. By integrating modern technology with traditional knowledge, the cheese eK-Book not only preserves expertise but also fosters innovation and sustainability within the sector. It bridges the gap between practical cheesemaking skills and contemporary scientific understanding, addressing critical challenges such as knowledge retention, succession planning and workforce development in a rapidly evolving industry landscape. The strength of the Cheese eK-Book lies in its capacity to communicate knowledge, traditions and teachings across generations. This transfer of knowledge and skills plays a crucial role in preserving heritage and fostering connections across different generations within a community.

The Virtual Reality in Your Head: How Immersion and Mental Imagery Are Connected to Knowledge Retention

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/virtual-reality-your-head-how-immersion-mental/docview/3159580475/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Immersive learning is predominantly constrained to technology-based interventions but has the potential for more diverse applications. This study reports on an experiment investigating the learning affordances of psychological immersion evoked by narrative absorption. A total of 228 participants were randomly assigned to one of three forms of media, an image, a word list, and a narrative, all of which contained identical items to be memorized for immediate and delayed free recall memory tests. Other variables measured were immersion, extraneous cognitive load, and mental imagery. ANOVA and correlation analyses showed that the narrative media was found to be significantly more immersive and that it evoked mental imagery in individuals at higher levels than both the list and image media. Importantly, there was more decay in memory recall between immediate and delayed tests for those exposed to the list and the image than for those who read the narrative. This implies the utility of immersive narratives for spontaneous mental image generation, which leads to improved knowledge retention. Other implications for immersive learning theory are discussed, and practical solutions for incorporating narrative immersion in learning are also suggested.

Abstract: ENG English ENG The study uses the extended Theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to explore farmers' participation in knowledge transfer activities and the potential of information and communication technology (ICT) based agricultural advisory services. Results based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and survey data of 4742 farmers who attended agri-environmental, organic farming or animal welfare training in Slovenia show that perceived behaviour control and attitudes were the most important factors influencing their intention to participate in future training. Satisfaction with the training, which was affected by the training content, design, and quality of the lecturer, had a further positive effect on the intention. We found that farmers who attended online sessions were less satisfied with the training than those participating in-person. Finally, online training was more likely attended by farmers who found it challenging to attend in-person due to lack of transportation options or time, and who had sufficient ICT knowledge, equipment and internet connection. Online sessions were also more often attended by older, female and part-time farmers. Our results emphasise the crucial role of offering advisory services adapted to the farmers' needs and preferences, as their satisfaction influences their attendance in training programs, which are often voluntary. Furthermore, the training design and implementation should take into account the needs of different groups of farmers, as the ICT-based advisory services may still not be evenly accessible to all farmers.

Abstract: In the contemporary context of rapid advancements in information technology and the exponential growth of data volume, language models are confronted with significant challenges in effectively navigating the dynamic and ever-evolving information landscape to update and adapt to novel knowledge in real time. In this work, an online update method is proposed, which is based on the existing Retrieval Enhanced Generation (RAG) model with multiple innovation mechanisms. Firstly, the dynamic memory is used to capture the emerging data samples, and then gradually integrate them into the core model through a tunable knowledge distillation strategy. At the same time, hierarchical indexing and multi-layer gating mechanism are introduced into the retrieval module to ensure that the retrieved content is more targeted and accurate. Finally, a multi-stage network structure is established for different types of inputs in the generation stage, and cross-attention matching and screening are carried out on the intermediate representations of each stage to ensure the effective integration and iterative update of new and old knowledge. Experimental results show that the proposed method is better than the existing mainstream comparison models in terms of knowledge retention and inference accuracy.

Abstract: The growing need for intelligent educational systems calls for architectures supporting adaptive instruction, while enabling more permanent, long-term personalization and cognitive alignment in the long run. While we have seen progress in adaptive learning technologies at the intersection of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL), Continual Learning (CL), and Meta-Learning, these are generally employed in isolation to provide piecemeal solutions. In this paper, we propose CAMEL, a unified architecture for (1) cognitive modelling based on SRL, (2) continual learning functionalities, and (3) meta-learning to provide adaptive, personalized, and cognitively consistent learning environments. CAMEL includes the following components: (1) A Cognitive State Estimator that estimates learner motivation, attention, and persistence from behavioral traces, (2) A Meta-Learning Engine that allows it rapid adaptation through Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), (3) A Continual Learning Memory that preserves knowledge across sessions using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Replay, (4) A Pedagogical Decision Engine that makes real-time efficient adjustments of instructional strategies, and (5) A closed-loop that continuously reconciles misalignments between pedagogical actions and predicted cognitive states. Experiments conducted on the xAPI-Edu-Data dataset evaluate the system’s few-shot adaptation capability, knowledge retention, cognitive-state prediction accuracy, and knowledge, as well as cognitive responsiveness to the impending questions. It offers competitive performance in learner-state prediction and long-term performance compared to the baselines, and the improvements are consistent across the different baselines. This paper lays the groundwork for next-generation adaptive and cognition-driven AI-based learning systems.

Full text: 1. Introduction Educational technology is changing fast, and AI is the new way to create a smart, personalized, and adaptive environment for learning. Despite present advancements in areas like intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), learning analytics, and affective computing, numerous existing educational technologies do not provide iterative adjustments accounting for the shifts in cognitive, motivational, and emotional experience (over time) [1,2]. A growing body of research indicates that Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) is perhaps one of the best predictors of academic performance in these learner-led, digital environments [3,4]. SRL entails higher-order processes such as planning, self-monitoring, and reflection that are mediated by motivational factors and cognitive flexibility [5,6].
In AI-based educational systems, Self-Regulated Learning can be operationalized by mapping observable behavioral traces to latent cognitive states. In this work, SRL is modeled through learner interaction features such as resource access, task completion, participation, and response timing, which are processed by a Cognitive State Estimator to infer motivation, attention, and persistence. These inferred cognitive states are then used as inputs to adaptive learning components, enabling personalized feedback, pacing, and instructional strategy selection. This computational formulation allows SRL to be integrated into an end-to-end AI system rather than remaining a purely conceptual construct.
A computer-system generality that covers a broad spectrum of computational frameworks is complemented with the capability of fast generalization within the task and learner profile from a few samples [7,8], which entails learning to learn meta-learning. Moreover, continuous learning (CL) addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting by allowing systems to learn incrementally and retain knowledge over time, a crucial property for educational settings with continuously changing learner cohorts [9]. At the same time, existing systems have only considered SRL, CL, and meta-learning as isolated boxes, resulting in pieces of architectures that are disjointed and cognitively incoherent, and not necessarily meant to be long-term adaptable. To overcome this limitation, we propose a unified architecture that leverages meta-learning to facilitate rapid personalization, continual learning to support life-long learning, and self-regulated learning modelling to align the cognitive skills with the learning process. We propose a system with roots in cognitive theory [10] that employs reinforcement learning [11], natural language processing [12], and multimodal analytics for support to maintain the dynamic, personalized, and ethical nature of adaptive learning pathways.
Various decision-making models have been explored in intelligent educational systems, including support vector machines (SVM), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and transformer-based architectures. While these models are effective for static or data-intensive prediction tasks, they often require large amounts of labeled data and provide limited interpretability in dynamic educational settings. In contrast, the proposed CAMEL architecture adopts a hybrid decision-making approach that combines cognitively grounded rules with reinforcement learning-based policy optimization. This choice enables interpretable, adaptive, and data-efficient pedagogical decisions that can evolve over time in response to changing learner states. Similar hybrid decision strategies have recently been shown to be effective in adaptive and distributed AI systems [13].
This paper makes several key contributions to the field of intelligent educational systems. First, we propose a unified AI-based architecture that jointly integrates self-regulated learning-based cognitive modeling, meta-learning, and continual learning within a single closed-loop framework. Second, we introduce a Cognitive State Estimator that infers learners’ motivation, attention, and persistence from behavioral traces, enabling cognitively aligned personalization. Third, the use of meta-learning allows rapid few-shot adaptation to new learners and learning contexts under low-data conditions. Fourth, continual learning mechanisms based on Elastic Weight Consolidation and replay are incorporated to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and support long-term adaptation. Finally, the proposed architecture is empirically evaluated using the xAPI-Edu-Data dataset and a complementary EdNet-like dataset, demonstrating improvements in cognitive state prediction, few-shot adaptation, and long-term performance stability.
2. Related Work Incorporating CL, meta-learning, and SRL into intelligent educational systems represents a watershed moment toward personalized, adaptive, and autonomous learning environments. This section provides an overview of the literature across these domains, their intersections, a few recent advancements, and their limitations, and justifies the need for such an approach.
2.1. Self-Regulated Learning and Cognitive Modeling in Intelligent Systems Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) is central to the learner-centered educational paradigms, requiring various forward-looking activities, including goal setting, self-monitoring, and retrospective assessment [3,7]. Timely SRL techniques substantially alleviated cognitive load and improved learning outcomes in learner-centered adaptive digital contexts. In addition, studies by [4] Motivational variables (e.g., academic self-efficacy) are crucial for SRL (2023) as they enable students to go beyond engagement to cognitive presence. Cognitively, flexibility is also highlighted as a significant moderator; [2] stated that students with higher cognitive adaptability would be more successful in self-regulation over the online learning environment.
Self-regulated learning is widely depicted as a cyclical process of forethought, performance, and self-reflection where motivational constructs like academic self-efficacy and goal orientation are instrumental in maintaining learner engagement and metacognitive control [4,5]. These processes are important in digital learning environments, where learners often work with so much more freedom than they do face-to-face and must manage their activities in a much more self-regulated manner.
2.2. Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Adaptive Learning Technologies Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are AI-enabled environments that frequently tailor the learning experience based on the learner themselves. Ref. [1] identified multichannel data types, such as affective and behavioral traces, using a data-driven way wherein the decision in scaffolding SRL took place, and adaptive interventions based on learner needs, such as real-time. Similarly, using generative AI for real-time personalization to generate content, feedback, and guidance that is specific in terms of ongoing interactions with the learners was discussed by [14]. These systems, which account for students’ tentative and often bumbling efforts, make some headway toward the goal of real-time digital tutors [15].
2.3. Meta-Learning for Rapid Personalization Meta-learning, defined as ‘learning to learn’, allows systems to quickly adapt to new tasks or learner profiles with little data [8]. Metacognition and innovative technology integration: nine-layer modelling (meta-learning model) and the pathway to deep personalization (a reflective mechanism) [10]. Optimizing SRL Strategy Selection utilizes reinforcement-based meta-learning to select SRL strategies and provide prescriptive analytics that recompute recommendations now according to learner feedback [16]. To further improve adaptation, a contextual learning trajectory model is proposed by integrating knowledge graphs and learner profiles to capture the intersections of the two betters.
Research among metacognitive learning environments suggests LMS platforms can support SRL processes, especially goal setting, self-monitoring, time management, and reflective analysis based on structuring interaction tools and activity-trace analytics to a cyclical SRL framework of Zimmerman [17]. These findings highlight the necessity of combining cognitive and metacognitive cues within adaptive learning environments.
Learner profiles need to be adapted from only one or a few interaction examples in different educational scenarios where low data exists, and meta-learning approaches like MAML and Reptile have been shown to work well for this [8]. These models are well aligned with our objective of cold-start personalization.
2.4. Continual Learning in Educational AI Systems Continual Learning (CL) is a paradigm to make AI models learn over time while preserving prior information learned. It has been extensively used in robotics and computer vision, but it is still emerging in education. Methods such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) enable the system to protect old knowledge while securing new knowledge, which is necessary for systems designed to adapt over a long period and develop alongside a changing cognitive state of a learner [9]. However, task diversity and long-term cognitive variability are left as open research problems in education.
2.5. AI Modeling of Self-Regulated Learning Strategies In a more recent work, Ref. [11] has highlighted the potential of NLP-based approaches to discern metacognitive markers in text generated by learners, which would allow scalable and individual detection of SRL strategies and personalized feedback.
Modelling of SRL from learner interaction data using various AI techniques in recent studies: Natural Language Processing (NLP) : A data-driven approach employed to identify metacognitive markers from texts produced by learners (e.g., reflections, discussion threads) in order to provide personalized scaffolding [11].
Reinforcement Learning (RL) : Frames SRL as a sequential decision-making process, allowing systems to recommend optimal SRL strategies dynamically [10].
Multimodal Data Analysis : Integrates clickstream, physiological, and affective data to provide a holistic model of learner states and regulation behavior [12,15].

These approaches form the backbone of intelligent, adaptive educational systems capable of supporting metacognitive processes.
2.6. Limitations of Current Approaches Despite the progress, several limitations persist in the literature: Fragmentation of research paradigms: Meta-learning, CL, and SRL are often developed in isolation, missing the potential of unified frameworks.
Temporal rigidity: Few models support long-term learning trajectory adaptation, a critical requirement for lifelong learning support.
Ethical concerns: Algorithmic bias, lack of transparency, and overreliance on automation risk dejection, learner independence, and trust.

Recent review work highlights that meta-learning, continual learning, and SRL modeling are often investigated in isolation, despite their complementary roles in adaptive educational systems, leading to fragmentation across research paradigms [18].
2.7. Comparative Overview of Leading Approaches If we focus on the SRL systems (MetaTutor, RL-based SRL support, and NLP-based SRL diagnostics), we can observe that current solutions implement, at best, one of the meta-learning- and continual-learning-based approaches at a time (Table 1). This fragmentation illustrates the lack of an integrated system that can simultaneously provide personalized and continuous, cognitively aligned, and sustainable adaptation, which is exactly what the CAMEL architecture targets.
The above three paradigms for the statistical modelling representation of an SRL process are rarely performed by intelligent educational systems simultaneously, as summarized in Table 1. On the contrary, CAMEL is specifically built to incorporate all three into one complete closed-loop architecture, which makes it very clear on the novelty and placement of CAMEL in the space.
Overall, the reviewed literature demonstrates that existing intelligent educational systems typically operationalize only one or two of the paradigms required for long-term adaptive learning. SRL-focused systems emphasize cognitive and metacognitive processes but often lack mechanisms for rapid adaptation and long-term retention. Meta-learning approaches support fast personalization under low-data conditions but usually omit explicit SRL modeling. Continual learning methods address catastrophic forgetting but are rarely integrated with pedagogical decision-making or cognitive state estimation. This lack of integration results in fragmented architectures, which motivates the unified design of the proposed CAMEL framework.
2.8. Positioning of the Proposed Approach While previous fragmented implementations have been called for meta-learning, continual learning, or SRL modelling, the proposed system combines meta-learning, continual learning, and SRL modelling into a unified, adaptive architecture. It fills the gaps that already exist by doing the following: Facilitating an ongoing personalized experience over time.
Allowing for quick adjustment to upcoming behavioral and cognitive patterns inferred from learner interaction data.
Embedding cognitive self-regulation as a first-class modelling target.

With this unified approach, our system can maintain a state-of-the-art level of adaptability in AI for smart education, linking innovative cognitive theory with scalable, adaptive AI methods capable of deployment in intelligent educational systems.
To conclude, CAMEL diverges from previous methods not by proposing a new algorithm but rather by tightly coupling three previously orthogonal paradigms: cognitive modelling (SRL), meta-learning for personalization (few-shot), and continual learning for retention (lifelong) within a single operational architecture. By integrating these three aspects into a single system, CAMEL supports (1) continual inference and tracking of learner’s cognitive states, (2) rapid personalization to new learners with limited data, and (3) sustained pedagogical policy effectiveness across long sequences of task and sessions while maintaining cognitive state accuracy, all aspects that current SRL-focused tutors, meta-learning-based personalization methods, and continual-learning systems alone cannot achieve.
3. Research Gap and Contribution In this paper, we argue that the advances being made regarding each of these paradigms providing the input to an adaptive educational system are substantial, but at the same time, research on them has hardly been integrated into one coherent architecture. The learning and modeling of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) has been extensively employed and scaffolded in intelligent tutoring systems like MetaTutor, where multimodal traces are used to provide real-time SRL support [1,12]. Additional work addresses prescriptive analytics of SRL strategies based on reinforcement learning policies [10] or identification of metacognitive and SRL-related patterns from text produced by learners in an NLP-based diagnostic fashion [11]. Though such systems provide comprehensive SRL-focused support, the former do not employ formal continual learning mechanisms, and the latter do not engage meta-learning algorithms for few-shot personalization.
At the same time, meta-learning has been suggested as a fast personalization solution in low-data scenarios by the capability of learning to quickly adapt to novel learner profiles and tasks [8]. While these approaches realize how “learning to learn” can help education, they are usually not guided by a clear generic SRL model and are not designed with longevity in mind (i.e., forgetting of knowledge and policies over time can lead to reduced transfer to novel tasks). Caveats: Likewise, continuous learning techniques such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and replay-based methods have been examined in the hopes of reducing catastrophic forgetting and enabling lifelong adaptation in AI-based learning environments [9], yet are generally used without any learner modelling that is explicit in cognitive or SRL.
As a result, there is fragmentation in the literature, with SRL-focused systems that highlight the cognitive and metacognitive processes at their core, but often without lifelong memory and rapid cross-learner adaptation, meta-learning approaches that achieve few-shot personalization but rarely model explicit SRL constructs or incorporate continual learning (CL), and CL research that efficiently secures long-term retention and representation adequacy, but frequently overlooks the cognitive and motivational dynamics that SRL often aims to capture [18]. Neither of these two streams of research is aimed at taking this operationalized SRL modeling, meta-learning, and continual learning jointly in a single closed-loop architecture to target both short-term and long-term personalization in intelligent educational systems, as far as we know.
To fill this gap, we present CAMEL, the first fully integrated intelligent tutoring system containing (1) a Cognitive State Estimator based on an SRL theory that infers motivation, attention, and persistence from behavior traces, (2) a Meta-Learning Engine based on MAML and related algorithms for few-shot adaptation to new learners and tasks, and (3) a Continual Learning Memory based on a combination of EWC and replay and across sessions and topics. We empirically evaluate CAMEL on the xAPI-Edu-Data dataset, complemented by an EdNet-like sample, showing superior cognitive state prediction, few-shot adaptation, and long-term performance stability compared to baselines. Moreover, an integration case study with an LMS showcases the practicality of deploying CAMEL in real-world learning environments. These contributions combine to make CAMEL a new, cognitively motivated architecture that links prior islands of research in modelling of SRL, meta-learning, and continual learning for IESs.
4. Our Conceptual Architecture 4.1. Learner Cognitive Model The design of the proposed system is viewed through the lens of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) theory, which conceptualizes learning as an engaging, circular process of planning, self-regulation, and reflection. These processes are thought to be mediated by certain motivational factors, e.g., self-efficacy and goal orientation, that serve as direct predictors of learner engagement, persistence, and metacognitive control [4,5]. SRL is especially important in digital learning environments where learners work with a high degree of autonomy and with asynchronous interactions with content and feedback mechanisms [3]. We represent apparatus based on the SRL framework, which allows the ongoing estimation of cognitive states from observable variables such as response delay, accuracy, self-assessment response outcomes, and behavior patterns. As supported by [12], multimodal traces are, accordingly, within the bounds of a reasonable proxy for a range of internal cognitive and emotional states, provided they are modelled correctly. This adaptive learner model creates a foundation for the adaptivity of our system by allowing pedagogical choices to adapt to the changing demands of the learner.
But recent progress in the modeling of SRL has shown that when the multimodal traces that combine behavioral, temporal, affective, and self-reported data are modeled appropriately, they can be used as reliable proxies for internal cognitive and motivational states [1]. This reinforces our use of behavioral interaction logs to estimate latent cognitive variables such as attention, motivation, and persistence.
4.2. Proposed Intelligent Educational System To translate this theoretical foundation into a usable architecture, we proposed a modular intelligent educational system that stacks three distinct paradigms of AI: continual learning (CL), meta-learning, and SRL modelling. There are four main components of the system: Cognitive State Estimator: This module uses sequence-based neural architectures (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers) to extract latent cognitive variables from learner interactions. Existing research has shown that such models can support dynamic learner-state modelling [11,12].
Model Learner: The model incorporates model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) and related algorithms like Reptile to ensure that new learners and instructional tasks can be adjusted efficiently. Under low-data settings, these algorithms show utility in educational personalization [8].
Contrary to this, Continual Learning Memory (CLM) is a module that retains long-term learning ability to avoid catastrophic forgetting with factors such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM). This has applicability mainly in lifelong learning cases, as observed on educational platforms [9].

The decision engine uses outputs from the cognitive state estimator, the meta-learning engine, and the CL memory to decide which pedagogical action to take. Our scalable engine scaffolds are based on a cognitive profile by altering content, feedback, and task difficulty in real time. Reinforcement learning is increasingly being used to operationalize SRL as a sequential decision-making process, enabling systems to recommend optimal regulation strategies dynamically based on learner feedback and behavioral evolution [10].
Such a synergy of the modules affords a system that can be adaptively short-term and resilient over time, two key components that are often found to be lacking in current educational AI systems [1].
4.3. Integration of Paradigms Figure 1 shows the innovation summary of our system. Abstractly, our system integrates the modelling of SRL, continual learning, and meta-learning in one adaptive architecture. Previous systems only tackle one or two of the components in isolation, but our model forms a closed-loop learning cycle where: The Cognitive State Estimator interprets real-time learner behavior.
The Meta-Learning Engine modifies learning strategies to fit new profiles or tasks.
The Continual Learning Module is responsible for maintaining the previously learnt behavior and policies learnt from previous sessions.
The Decision Engine delivers context-appropriate pedagogical actions.

Figure 1 Conceptual architecture of the proposed intelligent educational system.
[Figure omitted. See PDF]
Every learner interaction iteratively hones in on this loop and thus can be used by the system to personalize instruction within and across sessions. This form of temporal personalization directly targets one of the central challenges in adaptive education: maintaining alignment between the pedagogical response and the learner’s cognition as time passes [10]. It dynamically deals with cases like motivation drops, task complexity changes, and learner engagement changes. In contrast to previous systems like [1] that emphasize short-term SRL scaffolding without long-term memory or rapid adaptation to learner differences, our system integrates cognitive responsiveness and strong learning dynamics, enabling it to be implemented at scale in innovative education ecosystems.
The ethical concerns identified in prior work, including algorithmic bias, lack of transparency, and overreliance on automation, are partially addressed in the proposed architecture. CAMEL emphasizes interpretability through explicit cognitive state estimation and rule-informed pedagogical decision-making, allowing human-understandable reasoning rather than opaque automation. Furthermore, the system is designed to support learner agency by adapting instructional strategies without removing learner control or autonomy. While a full ethical evaluation is beyond the scope of this study, the architecture is designed with transparency, accountability, and human-centered adaptation as guiding principles.
5. Methodology 5.1. Implemented Model The proposed intelligent educational system was designed and implemented as a modular architecture consisting of four core components: (1) the Cognitive State Estimator, (2) the Meta-Learning Engine, (3) the Continual Learning Memory, and (4) the Pedagogical Decision Engine. Given that each module has its functionality, they work together seamlessly to provide a personalized and adaptive learning experience as learners develop their cognitive profiles over time.
The proposed CAMEL architecture is composed of four interconnected modules, each fulfilling a distinct role within the adaptive learning loop. The Cognitive State Estimator processes learner interaction data to infer latent cognitive states such as motivation, attention, and persistence. The Meta-Learning Engine enables rapid adaptation to new learners and tasks by optimizing model parameters under few-shot conditions. The Continual Learning Memory preserves previously acquired knowledge across sequential learning tasks, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Finally, the Pedagogical Decision Engine integrates cognitive state estimates and learning outputs to dynamically select instructional actions. Together, these modules form a closed-loop system that supports adaptive, cognitively aligned personalization.
Cognitive State Estimator: The first module employs a transformer-based neural network to predict latent cognitive variables such as attention, motivation, and persistence. Input: time-series features of the learners based on raised hands, visited resources, discussion, and student absence days. First, we created a composite Engagement Index by normalizing (using z-scores) and averaging over behavioral metrics. To simulate session-based learning, the input sequences were segmented based on subject-topic combinations.
Meta-Learning Engine : We implemented the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm using the learn2learn library to enable rapid adaptation to new learners with limited data. Reptile, a first-order approximation of MAML, was also tested as a computationally efficient baseline. The meta-learner optimizes instructional strategies based on few-shot learner behavior, allowing the system to personalize feedback early in the learning process.
Continual Learning Memory : For sequential adaptation, we integrated Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) using the Avalanche library. These approaches allowed the system to retain knowledge across multiple instructional topics (e.g., Math, Biology) while incorporating new learner experiences without catastrophic forgetting.
Pedagogical Decision Engine : This module synthesizes outputs from the cognitive state estimator and learning components to decide on the next pedagogical action. The system dynamically adjusts feedback, content difficulty, and pacing based on the learner’s real-time cognitive state. A hybrid policy network was trained using reinforcement learning to support this decision-making process in conjunction with rule-based heuristics.
The Pedagogical Decision Engine integrates the inferred cognitive states and the outputs of the learning components through a hybrid decision mechanism. Specifically, cognitive indicators such as attention, motivation, and persistence are combined with performance metrics and adaptation signals produced by the meta-learning and continual learning modules. These inputs are jointly evaluated using a rule-informed decision logic, where predefined pedagogical rules guide the selection of instructional actions, optionally supported by reinforcement learning-based policy optimization. This design enables reproducible and interpretable pedagogical decisions while maintaining adaptability to evolving learner states.
5.2. Data Used The experiments were conducted using the publicly available xAPI-Edu-Data dataset from Kaggle, which contains detailed learning records of 480 high school students. The dataset includes both demographic features (e.g., gender, nationality, ParentAnswering) and behavioral indicators relevant to self-regulated learning, including: Engagement metrics: raisedhands, VisitedResources, Discussion
Attendance: StudentAbsenceDays
Academic progression: StageID, GradeID, Topic
Target label: Class (student final performance: Low, Middle, High)

To simulate temporal learning, data were grouped by student_id and Topic, forming task sequences reflecting learning sessions. Cognitive traits were inferred from engineered features such as an Engagement Index, computed as a normalized mean of raisedhands, VisitedResources, and Discussion. The dataset was cleaned, one-hot encoded for categorical variables, and z-score normalized for numerical ones. Synthetic perturbations (e.g., motivation drops, performance plateaus) were introduced in controlled profiles to test the robustness of cognitive-aware adaptation.
We also provided a complementary dataset, EdNet (2020), which consists of one of the largest modern students’ problem interaction corpora, in addition to xAPI-Edu-Data. Additionally, EdNet contains large-scale sequential traces that can be used to evaluate compatibility with contemporary learninganalytics pipelines. We present the detailed analysis of this dataset in the Results Section.
The study uses two publicly available datasets:
xAPI-Edu-Data: a behavioral and performance dataset for SRL research, available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aljarah/xapi-edu-data (accessed on 15 December 2025).
EdNet KT1 Dataset: a large-scale student–problem interaction dataset released by Riiid, available at https://github.com/riiid/ednet (accessed on 14 December 2025).
These datasets were selected because they provide complementary properties for evaluating cognitive-state estimation, meta-learning adaptation, and continual-learning stability.
5.3. Experimental Protocol We designed three experimental scenarios to evaluate each component of the system: Cold-Start Personalization

Method : Train the meta-learner on N − 1 learners, then test on the Nth with five interaction examples.

A baseline deep learning model without adaptation
A rule-based ITS without cognitive awareness

Each model was trained and tested over five simulated sessions per learner.

All code, models, and preprocessed data will be made available on a public GitHub (2025) repository upon publication to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
5.6. Prototype Feasibility and LMS Integration Scenario We created an integration scenario to evaluate the potential for employing CAMEL in real-world educational environments by modelling how the system would function in an LMS such as Moodle. Under such a scenario, the typical interaction traces (e.g., resource visit, attempted quizzes, and discussion participation) generated by an LMS are processed by the Cognitive State Estimator of CAMEL to predict engagement-related indicators. The learner model is updated by the Meta-Learning and Continual Learning modules, and the Pedagogical Decision Engine generates adaptive recommendations that are to be delivered to the learner through the LMS interface.
This example illustrates how CAMEL can seamlessly integrate into an LMS workflow and function in quasi-real time with generic learner interaction data. While this study does not represent a full deployment around live student data, it is indicative of the potential for technical integration for such a deployment. To evaluate the pedagogical impact of the proposed system, we have planned a pilot study with real learners as future work.
6. Results and Evaluation 6.1. Cognitive State Modeling (xAPI-Edu-Data) In intelligent educational systems, the ability to estimate a learner’s cognitive state (e.g., motivation, attention, cognitive load) is critical for enabling personalized and adaptive pedagogical responses. The first module of our architecture, the Cognitive State Estimator , is designed to infer latent cognitive indicators from observable behavioral traces such as class participation, resource engagement, and discussion activity.
We developed a machine learning pipeline that categorizes students into either Low, Middle, or High performance levels. The first evaluation investigates the Cognitive State Estimator, which estimates the state of learner engagement (three levels: Low, Middle, and High) associated with cognitive engagement-related states from learning behavior features. As you can see from the confusion matrix (Figure 2), accuracy is very high on the Middle class, while overlap is moderate between Middle and High, as may be expected due to the mixing of motivational and behavioral patterns evident in many of the more typical indicators of self-regulated learning [1,12].
In the class-level F1-scores, we observe good generalization in all classes (Low ≈ 0.91, Middle ≈ 0.86, High ≈ 0.77). In Figure 3, the horizontal axis represents the learner performance classes Low (L), Middle (M), and High (H), which are used as proxies for inferred cognitive states. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that cognitive engagement and persistence (as found in the posttest) are adequate proxies for xAPI behavioral traces.
For the meta-learning and continual learning modules, the good classification performance lays the basis for the downstream personalization.
6.2. Rapid Adaptation and Continual Learning Performance 6.2.1. Few-Shot Adaptation (Meta-Learning) We tested the MAML-based meta-learning engine on few-shot tasks to reflect a realistic scenario in which only a very limited amount of labeled data-per-learner is available. The confusion matrix (Figure 4) shows that the model generalizes to new learners well despite the small sample size.
Performance per class (Figure 5) is well-balanced between Class 0 and Class 1, with Class 2 showing a slightly lower precision and may benefit from more examples in the support set.
These findings support the application of meta-learning to allow for fast personalization in ITS scenarios where learner profiles change over time rapidly.
6.2.2. Continual Learning Stability (EWC vs. Replay) We then compared EWC and Replay, two different continual learning strategies, on sequential tasks for continual learning to evaluate long-term stability.
A multi-panel combined plot (Figure 6) where all figures are as follows: ➢ . EWC : gradual accuracy improvement and stable loss reduction
➢ . Replay : higher final accuracy and better retention across tasks

Figure 6 Continual Learning Comparison: EWC vs. Replay.
[Figure omitted. See PDF]
At least partly responsible for this was Replay’s episodic-memory mechanism, which trained a small buffer of in-the-wild previously seen states and has previously been shown to be effective at retaining cognitive information as learner states evolved over time in continual learning literature [9].
By combining meta-learning and continual learning, CAMEL affords fast adaptation and long-term stability, desirable properties for realistic deployments in education.
6.2.3. Pedagogical Decision-Making and Cognitive Responsiveness The Pedagogical Decision Engine Converts estimated cognitive states to adaptive instructional actions. Figure 7 represents the shifts of attention, motivation, and forgetting over the sessions, with most periods of positive transfers and some periods of negative transfers.
The instruction adjustments that are activated by these cognitions are depicted in Figure 8. Interactive activities or motivational prompts were triggered by low-attention episodes; by high-performance periods, participants were moved to more advanced tasks.
The results in this paper illustrate that CAMEL can be pedagogically responsive and model interventions that are in alignment with students’ SRL [1,10].
6.2.4. Cross-Dataset Validation Using an EdNet-like Sample To confirm the generalizability of the CAMEL architecture beyond the EdNet KT1 dataset and to a modern, large-scale learning platform, we additionally performed an exploratory analysis using an EdNet-like sample as per the documented structure of the EdNet KT1 dataset. They compare their results with the state-of-the-art in knowledge tracing, sequence modelling, and from both adaptive educational systems and recent contemporary benchmarks, EdNet. Comprising more than 131 million student–problem interactions, it features a rich temporal structure ideal for continual and meta-learning.
The first description analysis is the distribution of correctness, revealing a moderate right skew towards correct responses (≈65%). Real large-scale tutoring systems exhibit this pattern as the tasks should be easy enough, but still provide enough variance for cognitive modeling (Figure 9).
In addition, response-time distributions provide more information about the variability in cognitive load and engagement. The log-transformed histogram not only has a very close semi-Gaussian shape, but also indicates the highly exponential character of raw elapsed-time values. These types of distributions are prevalent in large-scale educational datasets and inform words that meaningfully signal differences in strategy, hesitation, or elements of cognitive difficulty that are a part of CAMEL’s cognitive state estimator (See Figure 10).
We went one step deeper and looked at the number of interactions per learner per day (Figure 11). It is a heavy-tailed distribution in that, whereas most of the learners have around 120–180 interactions, more learners are much more active. This feature makes this property ideal for continual learning techniques (e.g., EWC, Replay) since it provides long shapely sequences for some learners, while also providing short sequences for fast-adapting analysis.
Finally, a sparse learner problem interaction heatmap illustrates the structural sparsity present in large educational datasets, where each learner interacts with only a small fraction of the available item pool. This sparsity strengthens the necessity of the core mechanisms of representation learning, episodic memory, and adaptive meta-learning encoded in CAMEL (Figure 12).
Overall, the complementary analysis based on the EdNet-like sample illustrates that CAMEL architecture can be updated to fit within contemporary large-scale learning analytics datasets. That is, these behavioral patterns emerge as heterogeneous activity levels, heavy-tailed response times, and sparse learner–problem interactions provide shared features to confirm the adequacy of CAMEL’s cognitive modeling, meta-learning, and continual learning components. These results provide support that the proposed system can draw generalization from older benchmark datasets, such as xAPI-Edu-Data, onto the current educational data ecosystem. The following describes the experimental procedure that was used to assess the system.
To further position CAMEL with respect to state-of-the-art approaches, we compare its performance against baseline models that do not incorporate meta-learning or continual learning mechanisms. These baselines include standard supervised classifiers for cognitive state estimation and sequential learning models trained without explicit forgetting mitigation. The results show that CAMEL achieves faster adaptation under few-shot conditions and maintains higher performance stability across sequential tasks, highlighting the benefits of jointly integrating cognitive modeling, meta-learning, and continual learning. Unlike existing approaches that address these dimensions in isolation, CAMEL provides a unified framework that supports both short-term personalization and long-term adaptability.
7. Discussion The observations from the five modules validate the proposed CAMEL framework with continual learning, meta-learning, and cognitive self-regulation as a converged intelligent learning system. Cognitive modeling, fast adaptation, and long-term memory retention for adaptive learning technologies have previously been highlighted as key limitations of the literature [1,12], which this integration directly addresses. Modules provide complementary aspects of personalization, allowing the system to individually support the learner across time.
As examined in Module 1, the Cognitive State Estimator was able to infer internal learner states from behavioral traces, in line with previous evidence suggesting that multimodal interaction data can serve as robust proxies for self-regulated learning and cognitive engagement [11,12]. This has provided inferred states that acted as inputs for downstream adaptation. The quick personalization ability of the Meta-Learning Engine (Module 2), with a tiny number of interaction data, provides evidence that meta-learning is well-suited for realistic educational scenarios based on publicly available datasets, where cognitive data are usually not readily available or labeled [8,10]. While continual learning enables gradual and cumulative personalization, this rapid adaptation is essential for immediate personalization in early stages.
Strategies for continual learning achieved using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) in Modules 3 and 4 and Replay proved successful in preventing catastrophic forgetting. This is particularly applicable in educational settings where learners are faced with changing tasks and content over long timescales [9]. Replay demonstrated modestly superior long-term stability, in accordance with previously known advantages of episodic memory and rehearsal mechanisms for retaining previous knowledge while allowing for the learning of new patterns.
A complementary analysis using an EdNet-like dataset could be conducted to further evaluate the architecture’s temporal relevance and generalizability. The EdNet-like sequences had standard features of contemporary intelligent tutoring systems, such as heavy-tailed distributions of response times, high interaction sparsity, and heterogeneity in the level of activity. These properties match well with modern large-scale interaction datasets and provide strong motivation in favor of CAMEL’s learning components, specifically the continual learning modules that are designed to accommodate non-stationarity and the meta-learning component designed for fast adaptation across learner types. The complementary analysis strengthens the applicability of the system across different data sets by providing rich context in the form of contextual SRL indicators provided by xAPI-Edu-Data [3,4,19].
The outputs of the previous modules use merged information from our data and create what the authors refer to as pedagogically relevant, cognitively informed interventions (these outputs are operationalized in Module 5, the Pedagogical Decision Engine). The fact that it is responsive to varying motivation, attention, and forgetting rate resonates with SRL research, highlighting the need for real-time scaffolding and adaptive supportive instruction [1,5]. This module encapsulates the larger CAMEL vision: we are trying to move beyond static learner modeling towards a dynamic, cognitive-aware pedagogy that can maintain personalized learning over longer time periods.
However, despite encouraging results, there are several limitations. Cognitive states were indirectly inferred, and future work should combine more multimodal signals to form stronger validation of performance. Second, while interpretable, the rule-based component of the decision engine could be improved through reinforcement learning to better capture long-term dependencies [10]. Third, the large-scale deployment of these approaches when placed in naturalistic, authentic learning environments will continue to be required to evaluate practical effectiveness (i.e., ecologically valid educational impact) as other recent literature has also recommended [1,14,19].
In summary, the CAMEL architecture shows that a theoretical model that integrates meta-learning, continual learning, and cognitive self-regulation can be an architecture that is both theoretically sound and feasible to implement. These insights about the evolving implementation of the system through the complementary analyses conducted with xAPI-Edu-Data and an EdNet-like dataset strengthen the robustness and applicability of the system jointly. These solutions could pave the way toward next-generation intelligent tutoring and adaptive learning systems to provide authentic, personalized, adaptive, and cognitively aligned support over time.
8. Conclusions CAMEL is a unified architecture we designed that incorporates meta-learning, continual learning, and cognitive self-regulation collectively to facilitate truly sustained adaptive personalization over time in an intelligent educational system. Simultaneously using several cues to estimate cognitive state, adapting few-shot to retain memory, and directing a pedagogical path result demonstrate CAMEL functioning robustly amidst nontrivial behavioral phenomena and enabling adaptive interventions over multiple learning sessions.
Although the main evaluation was done using simulation-based analyses leveraging xAPI-Edu-Data, the complementary experiment we conducted with an EdNet-like dataset nonetheless highlights the ability of CAMEL to work with modern large-scale interaction traces (using EdNet) and to generalize to various patterns of learner behavior. Second, the system-level case scenario of LMS integration shows that CAMEL can function as a unit of deployment in real-world instructional systems. Together, these validation steps reinforce the relevance of the architecture in practical settings, as opposed to solely in simulation.
However, the full empirical deployment remains a valuable area for future work. In contrast, real-world learning environments are more complex; they involve diverse motivational conditions, variability in instructional support, and contextual constraints that are often outside the bounds of controlled simulations. Therefore, we will be conducting a small pilot study with live students to determine its pedagogical utility as well as usability and cognitive alignment in the classroom. Through these design principles, this work provides a theoretically founded yet practical foundation for future adaptive educational systems. CAMEL combines cognitive modeling, meta-learning, and continual learning to make progress toward tutors that can provide personalized, adaptive, and cognitively responsive support over time in a closed-loop framework.

Table 1 Comparative positioning of representative AI-based educational systems and the proposed CAMEL architecture.
Approach SRL Modelling Meta-Learning Continual Learning Personalization Horizon Main Limitation for Long-Term, Cognitively Aligned Personalization
MetaTutor ITS [ 1 ] ✓ explicit SRL scaffolding – – Short-term session-level SRL support No mechanism for lifelong memory or rapid adaptation to new learners with few examples
RL for SRL strategies [ 10 ] ✓ SRL strategies as actions – (policy not meta-learned) – Episode-level optimization of SRL strategies Focuses on SRL policy optimization; no long-term memory or cross-learner meta-adaptation
NLP-based SRL diagnostics [ 11 ] ✓ detection of SRL patterns in text – – Diagnostic feedback on demand Provides SRL diagnostics but no continual learning or meta-learning for long-term adaptation
Meta-learning for educational personalization [ 8 ] – (no explicit SRL model) ✓ meta-learning of learner/task representations – Fast personalization under low-data conditions Enables rapid adaptation but lacks explicit SRL modeling and lifelong knowledge retention
CL-based adaptive learning systems [ 9 ]; EWC/GEM-like models – (cognition implicit) – ✓ prevention of catastrophic forgetting Long-term stability across evolving tasks Focuses on retention only; omits SRL modeling and fast meta-learning-based personalization
AI-driven adaptive learning frameworks [ 18 ] Partial (high-level learner profiles) – – Platform-level personalization Adaptive scenarios but no integration of continual learning + meta-learning + SRL
Proposed CAMEL architecture ✓ cognitive SRL modelling via behavioral traces (motivation, attention, persistence) ✓ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML/Reptile) for few-shot adaptation ✓ continual learning memory using EWC and Replay Short-term (within-session) and long-term (cross-session) personalization First unified architecture integrating SRL cognitive modelling, meta-learning, and continual learning in a single closed-loop educational system

Abstract: This mixed-methods study aimed to identify factors critical in building a digital support network employing contemplative practices to support activists engaging in racial justice work in the United States. The research question that guided this study was: What factors do racial justice activists regard as critical in building a digital support network employing contemplative practices? The study?s importance lies in addressing the evolving landscape of digital activism while honoring the spiritual and relational foundations that have historically sustained social justice movements, particularly as contemporary activists navigate new technological tools while seeking to maintain authentic connection and contemplative grounding. Key findings revealed that activists prioritize relational elements over technological infrastructure, with clear communication channels ranking as the most critical factor, followed by accessibility and inclusivity, trust, and mutual support. The study identified nine major themes across focus groups, which emphasized that relational trust serves as the engine of sustainable activism, digital tools must serve the work rather than becoming barriers, and contemplative practices cultivate integrity for sustained justice work. Additional findings highlighted the importance of intergenerational knowledge transfer, representation, and safety in digital spaces, as well as the need for digital networks to function as containers of cultivation that pair online accessibility with embodied presence, creating healing spaces that honor both technological innovation and ancestral wisdom.

Abstract: The Productive Failure (PF) technique is an educational strategy that uses collaborative problem-solving to facilitate resident physicians' understanding of new concepts. A novel implementation of this approach is PF simulation, in which they engage in simulation before receiving comprehensive teaching on the involved aspects. PF commences with the generation and consolidation phases, where resident physicians develop and analyze the advantages and constraints of various Representations and Solution Methods. These are followed by the knowledge assembly phases, respectively. Wherein physicians gain essential concepts by organizing their representations and thoughts in alignment with established responses. PF is deliberately designed to induce failure in problem-solving; however, in the following review, this process of failure can help resident physicians better acquire target ideas. The crucial aspect of PF design is that throughout the problem-solving phase, physicians receive no instructional support or scaffolding. Explicit failure-driven scaffolding is an alternative method for enhancing the efficacy of preparatory problem-solving. This narrative review examines the theoretical foundation of PF and its role in collaboration, clinical reasoning development, stress management, and knowledge retention among resident physicians. Using cognitive psychology, clinical reasoning theories, and reflective practice, we examined how PF helps people learn from failure, shift from traditional teaching to retain knowledge long-term, and develop flexible skills in complex clinical settings. Highlighting these components underscores the significance of practical simulations, varied information sources, and systematic feedback in cultivating these competencies. The role of PF in medical education policy suggests ways to integrate it into future training models to address current curriculum gaps. Future directions for PF in medical education include individualized learning, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the integration of future technologies such as virtual reality (VR). PF constitutes a viable educational approach for augmenting the clinical and cognitive competencies of resident physicians, equipping them with the intricacies of contemporary medical practices.The Productive Failure (PF) technique is an educational strategy that uses collaborative problem-solving to facilitate resident physicians' understanding of new concepts.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence as a generic concept is present in all activities of daily life in contemporary society. In the biomedical scenario has had a particular presence, with the development of systems ranging from the generation of knowledge in medical research to applications in different areas of individual and collective health. Such is the case of new tools based AI in different modalities, in public health, diagnostics, image, medical and surgical clinical processes, as well as rehabilitation, inclusion and functional facilitation strategies. Despite being a relevant advance based on technological innovation and knowledge transfer for management and decision making, it is pertinent to consider some reasonable precautionary measures as recommendations, to evaluate the safety, efficacy and risks in a timely manner.Artificial intelligence as a generic concept is present in all activities of daily life in contemporary society.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2025 5th Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON) Conference Start Date: 2025 Aug. 22 Conference End Date: 2025 Aug. 23 Conference Location: PIMPRI, India The fast development of educational technologies drives the spread of immersive and personalized learning spaces. Among them, Virtual Reality (VR) - based learning systems have been one of the most interactive and attractive learning methodologies for students. Yet, most had the limitation of trying to cater for individual learners profiles but struggling to some degree to do that. In here, the authors propose a new framework by fusing Big Data Analytics and VRLS, thus allowing for the dynamical adaption of the course material following the real-time assessment of the student progress and behavior. Our proposed framework integrates these captured data as well as real-time data obtained from student interactions in the VR environment such as duration, errors, eye gaze, body posture and frequency of interaction. This data is analyzed using sophisticated analytics pipelines such as predictive modelling, clustering and deep learning-based behavior interpretation to form individual learner profiles. These profiles drive adaptive delivery of the course content, so that each student gets a customized learning experience that gets updated as they make progress and master skills. The system also incorporates a feedback-based reinforcement module to take into account recalibration of difficulty levels, learning tempos and types of resources (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) according to cognitive load and the participant engagement. Experimental testing on a pilot pool of secondary science students showed increased knowledge retention (24% increase), and satisfaction of learning (31% better) and decreased time completion (18%) when compared to non-adaptive VR platforms. This study shows that big data analysis can be merged into immersive learning to come up with an intelligent student-center teaching framework. The proposed system satisfies not only the drawbacks of one-size-fits-all teaching models, but it also offers insights for teachers/institutions with the help of rich analytic dashboards. Finally, this work is one step towards the advancement of the next generation educational technologies that are based on personalization, adaptability and learnability that can be measured.

Abstract: This study employs the Job-Demands-Resources model and Conservation of Resources theory to examine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology adoption on intergenerational knowledge transfer among older employees. It focuses on the psychological motivation underlying this phenomenon and identifies individual factors that affect intergenerational knowledge transfer. The purpose is to gain a deep understanding of the internal mechanisms of employee cognition and behavior change in the context of technological transformation. Introduction This study employs the Job-Demands-Resources model and Conservation of Resources theory to examine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology adoption on intergenerational knowledge transfer among older employees. It focuses on the psychological motivation underlying this phenomenon and identifies individual factors that affect intergenerational knowledge transfer. The purpose is to gain a deep understanding of the internal mechanisms of employee cognition and behavior change in the context of technological transformation.We surveyed 635 older employees from various industries in China and analyzed the data using SPSS 27.0, Mplus 8.3, and fsQCA 4.1. The data were analyzed via a moderated sequential mediation model to examine the relationships among AI technology adoption, identity threat, relational crafting, digital self-efficacy and intergenerational knowledge transfer, supplemented by fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The study tested the mediating effects of identity threat and relational crafting between AI technology adoption and intergenerational knowledge transfer, as well as the moderating role of digital self-efficacy. In addition, fsQCA was used to test antecedents of intergenerational knowledge transfer among older employees.

The study tested the mediating effects of identity threat and relational crafting between AI technology adoption and intergenerational knowledge transfer, as well as the moderating role of digital self-efficacy. In addition, fsQCA was used to test antecedents of intergenerational knowledge transfer among older employees.The findings indicate that AI technology adoption positively influences intergenerational knowledge transfer. Identity threat and relational crafting play mediating roles between AI technology adoption and intergenerational knowledge transfer and also serve as sequential mediators. Digital self-efficacy negatively moderates the impact of AI technology adoption on identity threat, thereby moderating both the mediating role of identity threat and the sequential mediating effect of identity threat and relational crafting. Additionally, fsQCA identified three antecedent configurations that trigger intergenerational knowledge transfer among older employees. Results The findings indicate that AI technology adoption positively influences intergenerational knowledge transfer. Identity threat and relational crafting play mediating roles between AI technology adoption and intergenerational knowledge transfer and also serve as sequential mediators. Digital self-efficacy negatively moderates the impact of AI technology adoption on identity threat, thereby moderating both the mediating role of identity threat and the sequential mediating effect of identity threat and relational crafting. Additionally, fsQCA identified three antecedent configurations that trigger intergenerational knowledge transfer among older employees.Prior research on AI technology adoption has tended to emphasize singular positive or negative impacts on specific variables. This study constructs a model that incorporates both positive and negative effects, elucidating the multifaceted mechanisms through which AI technology adoption influences intergenerational knowledge transfer and enriches research on the consequences of AI technology adoption. While existing literature often highlights negative psychological and behavioral impacts of AI technology adoption on older employees, the present findings show that AI technology adoption can significantly enhance intergenerational knowledge transfer among older employees, thereby complementing current findings. Finally, by adopting a configurational thinking, this study identifies multiple pathways through which various factors affect intergenerational knowledge transfer, providing a useful complement to single-factor analyses of AI technology adoption's impact. Thereby, the study offers practical insights for organizations seeking to develop inclusive technological-culture strategies.

Abstract: Millennial nurses are quickly becoming the largest generation in the nursing field, next to the baby boomers. As boomers retire, millennials are predicted to become the majority within the next 5 years. There is a lack of attention on the millennials’ experiences, skills transfer, policies to protect them, and training to prevent negative stereotyping from boomers. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of millennial nurses’ experiences as they collaborate with baby boomer nurses in medical treatment settings. A descriptive qualitative case study methodology was used. There are numerous studies on baby boomers’ experiences as they lead or work with millennials. Still, there are very few studies from the millennials’ perspectives, and only a few on the generational workplace in the nursing field. Eight female participants were selected for the study—four Black, two Hispanic, and two White participants from seven states in the United States. Six themes emerged from the data that described the millennial nurses’ experiences of collaborating with baby boomers: boomers’ resistance to change, reverse ageism toward millennials, minimal knowledge transfer, boomers’ lack of technical skills, boomers’ uncollaborative behavior, and millennials' seeking alternative career opportunities. The study data demonstrated that millennials are eager to collaborate and learn from boomer nurses, despite the perception that the older, more experienced nurses are unwilling to teach them, and millennials desire to be respected for the skills they bring to the field, namely, technology. Collaboration and understanding can be accomplished between the two groups through role-playing in group training, generational and reverse mentoring, and new policies to protect millennial nurses, ensure skills transfer, and improve patient care. The findings of the study could help industrial/organization professionals develop training and policies to increase job satisfaction across generations and enhance retention and efficiency in the medical industry.

Abstract: Forests play a key role in achieving the objectives of the European Green Deal due to their multifunctional role. They provide multiple ecosystem services, such as soil formation, nutrient cycling, provisioning of timber, food, and water, climate regulation, and flood control, while also being of central importance for biodiversity conservation (Brockerhoff et al. 2017). However, insect and pathogen pests increasingly threaten forests, alone or after abiotic disturbances such as drought, fire, and storms (Romagnoli et al. 2023). Among pests, invasive alien species are of great concern because they can have a strong impact on forest biodiversity and economy, and many efforts are being made to regulate them in the EU (Ghelardini et al. 2017). In addition, several native pests are expanding their range because of climate change and are called emerging pest species (Jactel et al. 2019 ; Simler-Williamson et al. 2019). Research is therefore essential to support early detection of emerging and invasive pests, monitor their spread, and inform phytosanitary measures that can prevent or mitigate their impacts. In this context, the Horizon 2020 project HOMED (HOlistic Management of Emerging forest pests and Diseases), coordinated by Hervé Jactel from the National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (France), developed a holistic and multi-actor approach to develop tools and methods for the management of emerging native and non-native pests threatening European forests, focusing on all phases of invasion, from prevention to surveillance to eradication and control. The project also broadened the definition of “forest health”, including trees not only in forests, but also in nurseries, urban and rural areas, owing to the key epidemiological role of these components. The major outputs of the project are synthesised in a special issue of the journal NeoBiota, and include a participatory tool for reporting forest damage data ( Silvalert ), improved multi-funnel traps with generic pheromone attractants (Santoiemma et al. 2024), pioneering studies on pest detection using remote sensing (Nardi et al. 2023), and sustained stakeholder engagement through six targeted policy briefs. Importantly, HOMED underscored the need for interdisciplinary collaboration across forest entomology and pathology, economics, and social sciences, and highlighted the priority of developing innovative tools for the early detection and eradication of pests. Building on this foundation, the Horizon Europe project FORSAID (FORest Surveillance with Artificial Intelligence and Digital technologies), coordinated by Andrea Battisti from the University of Padova (Italy), continues and expands HOMED's legacy. FORSAID focuses on designing a comprehensive and technologically advanced framework for the early detection and surveillance of EU-regulated forest pests, integrating a wide range of innovative tools, including satellite- and drone-based remote sensing, smart traps with automatic monitoring capacity, robotic devices for rapid insect identification, environmental DNA methods for early pest detection, and citizen science approaches supported by mobile applications. Stakeholder engagement is central to this process, ensuring that research outputs are aligned with end-user needs and can be effectively implemented in practice. The project aims to integrate these methods into a coherent and operational monitoring and assessment system for regulated pests, thereby supporting the development of a novel pan-European strategy for forest pest management. FORSAID also ensures continuity and knowledge transfer from HOMED. For example, data on pest distribution collected in HOMED through Silvalert now serves as a baseline for FORSAID remote sensing activities. Generic attractants validated globally in HOMED are being incorporated into next-generation smart traps. Lastly, stakeholder surveys from HOMED provide direct input into FORSAID's research agenda. By maintaining and extending these outputs, FORSAID exemplifies how scientific legacies can be consolidated and advanced across projects. Together, HOMED and FORSAID demonstrate the value of sustained research, innovation, and cross-disciplinary collaboration in forest health management, and their combined contributions highlight the importance of open data, participatory science, and stakeholder-driven approaches in building robust strategies against emerging forest pests.

Abstract: Background The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed the emergence of digital solutions in all areas of medicine. Our prior study on the digital health related experiences and opinions of Hungarian physicians highlights the crucial role of age in shaping attitudes towards digital health solutions among medical doctors. Our aim was to examine how under 35-year-old Hungarian physicians relate to digital technologies, the advantages and disadvantages they perceive, and how they would like to incorporate these technologies into their everyday medical practice. Methods As part of the “E-physicians and E-patients in Hungary” study, we conducted an online representative survey among medical practitioners in Hungary between July 2021 and May 2022 ( n  = 1,774). The main target group of our research were physicians under 35 years of age: n  = 399 (25.3%). Besides descriptive statistical analyses, cluster analysis and binary logistic regression were applied to analyse the digital health related attitudes of the young age group. Results Our cluster analysis confirmed that younger doctors perceived more advantages (on average 7.07 items vs. 8.52 items) and disadvantages (on average 4.06 vs. 4.42) of digital health solutions. They also demonstrated greater familiarity with (8.27 vs. 9.79) and use of (1.94 vs. 2.66) a broader spectrum of technologies. Proficiency and active utilization of diverse technologies correlates with a more comprehensive understanding of both pros and cons, as well as a more realistic self-assessment of areas of further improvement. Doctors under 35 years express a notable demand for significantly increased incentives, both in terms of knowledge transfer/training and infrastructure incentives. Multivariate analyses revealed that young doctors, compared to their older counterparts, perceived enhanced patient adherence as one of the greatest benefits of digital health solutions. Additionally, young doctors expect that digital health solutions could reduce burnout. Conclusion Our results underscore the inevitable transformation of the 21st-century physician role: the success of digital health solutions hinges on active patient involvement and management, which requires proper patient education and professional support in navigating the digital space. Digital health solutions can be a bridge between different generations of doctors, where young people can help their older colleagues navigate the digital world.

Full text: 1 Introduction
The digital transformation of healthcare has become a central issue, profoundly influencing both the current state of health care provision and its future trajectory (1). This shift is reshaping health care organization, human resource management, and even issues of equity and access to care. While it offers solutions to longstanding challenges, it also presents new obstacles. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the factors that encourage both doctors and patients to adopt digital health solutions (2,3).
Age plays an essential role in digital adaptability. Survey data from the European Commission highlights a substantial increase in daily internet usage among younger populations: in 2021, 95% of young people used the internet daily across Europe, compared to 82% in 2012. By 2023, this figure reached 97% of individuals aged 16–29, compared to 86% of the total population (4). There is evidently a clear correlation between youth and prolonged internet engagement. A pertinent question arises: does increased digital engagement in younger age groups mean they are more likely to embrace digital health solutions?
The concept of Digital Natives, introduced in 2001, remains under debate. In 2009 Prensky suggested that “Digital Wisdom” would be a more fitting term (5). It indicates that as consecutive generations enter the 21st century, nearly everyone will have some digital experience from an early age. This has blurred the divide between “Digital Native” and “Digital Immigrant”. While younger people may be more familiar with digital devices, they still require guidance to use technologiy effectively. Older generations are also rapidly narrowing the gap by using digital innovations and becoming digitally wise. Interestingly, studies show that younger individuals do not necessarily posess better eHealth literacy than older adults (6).
It is generally assumed that young people, including young medical professionals, navigate the digital world with ease. The literature provides evidence in support of this notion. Park and Kwon's systematic review of health-related internet use of children and adolescents show that a high percentage of youth use the internet for health-related purpose (7). Their primarily aim is to find information on daily health related topics. The review also found that many young individuals engege in online health communities and activities such as messaging, networking, and information seeking.
Although the use of digital solutions in healthcare predates COVID-19, it was the imposed isolation and increased medical work load caused by the pandemic that boosted digitalization into mainstream healthcare.
The 2023 survey study of Siragusa et al. highlighted the positive effects of the SARS-CoV-2 crisis on Italian surgical practice (8). One significant development was the increase in the use of teleconsultations for pre and post operation patient management in all forms of surgery (up from 4.1% to 21.6%). Another was the use of digital solutions for diagnostic evaluations (an increase from 16.4% to 42.2%). Finally, there was a big change in surgical professional development in the form of attending e-congresses and participating in online education. Surgeons' personal education online increased from 12.6% (pre-COVID) to 86.6%). The surgeons in the study expressed the desire to continue with teleconsultations and tele-education in the future.
Despite these advancements, relatively little is known about young doctors' (under 35) attitudes to E-health solutions. Research is scarce in the field. According to the American Medical Association's 2022 study on physicians' motivations and expectations for the adaptation of eHealth solutions, the use and acceptance of digital health tools was growing among US based doctors across all ages (9). Although age once influenced enthusiasm for teleHealth according to the results of the 2016 survey, by 2022 this disparity faded, with all age groups recognizing the advantages of digital health solutions. While the 51+ age group has the lowest number of those who see a definite advantage in using digital tools in patient care, they have experienced the largest increase. By 2022 age played no role in the use of remote monitoring in patient care. Similarly, a study from Poland (10) revealed, that 70.4% of the surveyed physicians were familiar with new technologies and rated their eHealth literacy as high, but digital skills decreased significantly with physicians’ age. A comparative study in Hong Kong and Bahrain (11) showed that doctors accept smart phone use in a clinical setting but noted differences by age: 48% of the junior doctors claimed high reliance on smartphones, whereas only 32.3% of the senior doctors reported the same. Correspondingly, a Nigerian survey concluded that doctors under the age of 40 years, particularly Interns, were significantly more likely to perform smartphone-based activities during their hospital work (12). A national survey of the Italian Young Medical Doctors Association (13) found that only a small proportion of young doctors interviewed claimed to have had any significant experience with digital health solutions, like telemedicine tools (22%), big data, omics technology and predictive models, or AI (each 13%), internet of things (6%).
Studies also underscore the need for practical training to keep pace with the digital revolution as most respondents report insufficient preparedness to use digital technologies due to limited exposure to such technologies in medical school (10,13,14). While medical students generally hold positive attitudes towards the use of digital health tools in education and patient care, many lack formal training in this field (15,16).
In our prior study on the eHealth related experiences and opinions of Hungarian physicians (2), we found age to be a significant factor in attitudes towards digital health solutions among medical doctors. The youngest age group displayed the most enthusiasm, while the age group between 35 and 45 was the most intensive user. Our Hungarian population survey on digital health use and attitudes (17) also suggest that age 60 is a critical threshold for both current and planned digital technology use. Additionally, doctors working in the private sector are more prone to recommending websites, applications, or social media sourcse and use telemedicine more often, however, no significant sector-based differences emerged in the use of advanced digital tools like sensors, portable diagnostic devices, AR, VR, robotics, AI and 3Dprinting.
The present study aims to explore the digital health solutions related attitudes of doctors under 35 years, compared to those of older physicians. We investigate the digital tools they prefer to use and the perceived benefits and disadvantages of digital solutions. This topic is critical for both the future of healthcare providers and the patients they serve.
As digital health is a quite broad concept, we have tried to cover as wide a spectrum as possible in our study. The surveyed areas included different activities, like participating in online conferences and trainings, tracking international literature, trends, and data online, telemedicine, smartphone applications, healthcare-related social media, communication with patients, information sharing, home-usable healthcare sensors, smart devices, portable diagnostic devices (e.g., mobile ultrasound, mobile ECG), augmented reality (e.g., surgical practice), use of Virtual Reality (e.g., pain management, psychotherapy), 3D printing (e.g., dental, surgical solutions), Artificial Intelligence solutions in medical decision-making (radiology, pathology, ophthalmology, diagnostic solutions), robotics (e.g., surgical robots, disinfection robots, delivery robots) or anotechnology (e.g., ingestible diagnostic devices).
2 Methodology 2.1 Recruitment and sample
W e conducted an online survey among medical doctors working in Hungary s part of the “E-physicians and E-patients in Hungary” study (2). The questionnaire was made available online in a self-administered format from July 2021 to May 2022. Our self developed questionnaire is a medical version of the questionnaire used in the population survey (17). The research call with the questionnaire link was emailed to all practising doctors in Hungary (approximately 35.000 people), based on the medical chamber register. All doctors in Hungary had the same chance of being included in the sample, because the Hungarian Medical Chamber (HMC) membership was mandatory for each practising medical doctor.
After the questionnaire was sent out, several reminder emails were sent to increase response rate. 1.
Initial Distribution and Reminders (Summer 2021):The first wave of invitations and reminders was distributed during the summer of 2021. This period saw lower engagement due to the ongoing pandemic pressures.
2.
Newsletter Campaign (Autumn 2021):A follow-up campaign was launched in autumn 2021, involving a newsletter sent to HMC members. This aimed to remind and encourage participation among those who might have missed or overlooked the initial emails.
3.
Targeted Email Survey (Spring 2022):After the COVID-19 epidemic had subsided, a more targeted email survey was conducted in spring 2022. This was done in agreement with the HMC to reach out specifically to physicians who had not yet participated.
A total of 1,774 questionnaires were received, consisting of 1,576 general medical doctors and 198 dentists. Dentist participants were excluded from the present analysis for methodological issues. The target group of our present study are physicians under 35 years of age: n = 399 (25.3%).
2.2 Measuring instruments
Correction weighting was applied to the responses based on the statistics obtained from the National Register of Practising Medical Doctors. The Directorate of Human Resources Development of the Ministry of Health provided the register. The correction weighting considered factors such as gender, age, and the county where the workplace is, based on the data of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (18). This correction was necessary due to slight variations in the sample compared to the main distributions of the Register (19). The weight variable had a mean value of 1, a first quartile value of 0.6255, and a third quartile value of 1.1942.
The questionnaire contained items on knowledge, interest, expectation, and use of digital health technologies. The majority of items were on a 5-point Likert scale.
were Sociodemographic data, frequency of internet use for work, knowledge and use of digital health technologies, needs for digital technologies, and positive and negative attitudes towards the use of digital health solutions were the main blocks of the 25-question, 15-min questionnaire.
The questionnaire can be found in theSupplementary Material.
In this research, we looked at digital solutions that our respondents know and use, or are planning to use (in both cases, the top 2 categories of 5-category Lickert scaling questions were considered to be frequently used or intensively used). The internal consistency of the questions was tested using a cronbach's alpha test. The questions on digital technologies (4.1–4.39) were divided into 3 subscales based on “Knowledge”, “Use” and “Willingness to use”.
The Cronbach alpha results for the subscales are. Knowledge (13 items) 0.830, Use (13 items) 0.743 Willingness to apply (13 items): 0.882. These indicators confirmed the reliability of the scales.
We also asked about the perceived advantages and disadvantages of digital health solutions and assessed what help doctors feel they would need to use digital solutions more effectively. The last question was divided into two parts: training aspects (undergraduate, postgraduate training, available protocols, recommendations) and infrastructure aspects (accessibility, affordability, ease of use).
2.3 Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using IBM Statistics (SPSS 28) (20). The statistical data processing involved examining distributions, conducting cross-tabulation analyses, and performing chi-square tests. Cross-tabulation analyses were conducted using the chi-square test, means were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Logistic regression and K-means analysis were also utilized for deeper context. In our statistical analysis, a significance level of 5% (p < 0.05) was applied. Significant associations ( p < 0.05) are marked in bold in the tables.
The variables used in the analysis were derived from the raw data by aggregating the responses to each question on an individual basis (e.g., assessing the perceived benefits of digital health solutions).
We subsequently ran a K-means cluster analysis, using the variables described above, to test whether two or more groups of digital device users are indeed separated from each other in terms of digital device use.
Finally, we built a multivariate model using logistic regression. The dependent variable was one of the response options of the multiple-choice question asking about the benefits of digital health solutions: it increases patient cooperation and adherence (values: 0 = not selected, 1 = selected). The model was run using a forward conditional variable selection method including a number of variables (age, gender, being a GP or not, the number of advantages and disadvanteges of digital healthcare solutions seen, the number of solutions patients express a need for, the number of digital health solutions the doctor is familiar with, the number of technologies used frequently or on a daily basis, the amount of support that would be necessary (training, protocols, knowledge sharing) to adopt digital healthcare solutions and the amount of support apart from training or knowledge sharing that would be needed to use digital healthcare solutions.
2.4 Ethical consideration
This study adhered to ethical guidelines and received approval from TUKEB (Hungarian Scientific Research and Research Ethics Committee) with the reference number IV-10927-1 TUKEB. The research based on anonymized survey data and did not involve interventions or identifiable personal information. Participants provided informed consent by voluntarily completing and submitting the survey online. Confidentiality and anonymity of participants were strictly maintained throughout data collection, analysis, and reporting.
3 Results 3.1 Demographic profile of the sample
The sample included 399 (25.3%) doctors who were 35 years and under, 845 (53.6%) in the 36–64 age group and 331 (21%) in the 65+ age group. The youngest age group shows a strong female predominance with 62.3% women and 37.8% men. For those aged 65 and over, the gender split is almost even: 47.1% men and 52.9% women. A significant proportion of under-35 s work in inpatient care: 51.6% in hospitals and 29.2% in university clinics. Consequently, the location of their workplace is significantly Budapest (37.5%) and the county seats (41.3%). (SeeTable 1for the details).

3.2.3 Intention of usage of various digital technologies in the next 3 years For this question, we also used the 4–5 often/very often responses—so we focused on regular users rather than those who just tried them once.
In terms of planned use, young respondents are significantly more likely to want to use online conferencing, apps/sensors, smart devices, mobile diagnostics, AR/VR, 3D technology, robotics, AI and nanotechnology (Table 4).

3.2.4 Perceived need to facilitate the use of digital solutions A significantly higher proportion of doctors under 35 indicated that financial incentives, accessible professional materials, availability of technologies, evidence-based studies, clarification of legal-ethical issues, data security, existence of different professional protocols and patient engagement would be a prerequisite for the higher uptake of digital solutions.
It can also be seen that on average, doctors under 35 years cited the need for more incentives, both in terms of knowledge transfer/training and infrastructure incentives (Table 5).

3.2.5 Perceived benefits of different digital solutions by young doctors—a paradigm shift Overall, younger doctors tend to mention more benefits. A significantly higher proportion reported improved efficiency, improved diagnostic skills, reduced burnout, increased patient adherence, better patient involvement in the healing process, increased patient cooperation, more comfort, time saving, improved quality of care and reduced rate of malpractice. Also a higher proportion of young doctors think that using digital tools will bring extra income to their practice (Table 6). Table 6

3.2.6 Cluster analysis In the next step, we ran a K-means cluster analysis on the data to investigate whether the younger age group is indeed distinct from older doctors in their attitudes towards digital health technologies. The final model with two clusters was generated as a result of the run, where the distribution of item numbers is half and half, with 786 people in the first cluster and 788 in the second cluster. The final cluster centres table shows that the two groups differ significantly and spectacularly in age (63.29 vs. 36.35), and there are also differences in the other variables included in the model. Younger doctors perceive more advantages (7.07 vs. 8.52) and disadvantages (4.06 vs. 4.42) of digital health solutions, are more familiar with (8.27 vs. 9.79) and use (1.94 vs. 2.66) more technologies. There is no significant difference in the needs perceived by patients (3.84 vs. 3.90) and in the amount of things they would need training or knowledge transfer for (2.43 vs. 2.63). Other differences (no training or knowledge transfer) are also visible between the two groups (3.18 vs. 4.02) (Table 8). Table 8

3.2.7 Logistic regression model for patient adherence and use of digital solutions As a last step of our analysis, we ran a multivariate model with logistic regression, where the dependent variable was the question of increasing patient adherence (0 = not marked, 1 = marked). The final logistic regression model included 5 explanatory variables (Nagelkerke R-square = 0.261).
The age of the responding physician is a significant explanatory factor in the model, with an odds ratio of 0.991 CI: 0,983–0,998) so the older someone is, the less likely they are to think that digital health solutions increase patient adherence. The gender variable is also significant, with a positive odds ratio, so women are more likely to think that it increases adherence.
Other significant explanatory variables are the number of technologies used often or every day, the number of needed technologies (not knowledge, training or knowledge transfer, but infrastructure), and perceived benefits (other than increasing patient adherence). These variables are all odds ratios above 1, so the correlation is positive, i.e., the more technology used, the more infrastructure items would be needed, and the more benefits perceived from digital health solutions, the more likely they are to think it increases patient adherence (Table 9).

4 Discussion The WHO report “Global strategy on digital health 2020–2025”, showed that digital technologies were essential for sustainable health systems and universal health coverage (21). Digital health, or eHealth, uses information and communication technologies and networks to manage, deliver and optimise patient care and health services. According to WHO data there are currently 5–7 million health workers missing from health systems worldwide (22). One possible alternative of addressing the health workforce shortage is the increasing use of digital technologies in various care settings.
A systematic review of 123 studies, encompassing data from approximately 250,000 healthcare providers globally, revealed that the adoption of mobile technologies, telemedicine, and various digital tools for clinical decision support has positively impacted the performance, mental well-being, skills, and competencies of health workers (23).
In this context, a key question is how young doctors relate to digital technologies, what advantages and disadvantages they see in these possibilities and how they would like to incorporate their use into their everyday medical practice.
Digital transformation in the health sector is not a simple matter of technical change, but requires adaptive changes in human attitudes and skills, too (24). The past 20 years have seen the emergence of e-patients and e-physicians. E-patients are active partners in the care they receive while manifesting the power of the participatory medicine model. The “e” stands for “electronic”, “equipped”, “enabled” “empowered”, “engaged” and “expert” (25). On the other side, e-physicians are “electronic” as they use digital technologies in their practice with ease. They are “equipped” because they have digital health technologies at their disposal. They are “enabled” by regulations and guidelines and “empowered” by technologies that support their job. They are “engaged” in as much as they have empathy to understand the feelings and point of view of patients, give them relevant feedback and involve them throughout the whole healing process. Finally, they are “experts” in using technologies in their practice and knowing the best and most reliable and trustworthy sources and technologies. As we can see from these definitions, being an e-patient or e-physician goes beyond digital proficiency, it is also an attitude and an orientation (24,26).
Digital health solutions make new approaches of care possible by moving diagnosis, treatment, and prevention out of the clinic s into the everyday settings of people's lives (27). From this perspective, the dynamics of the doctor- patient relationship in the 21st century are influenced by the possibilities inherent in digital solutions and the democratization of health care. This phenomenon is best captured by the phrase of Participatory Medicine . Participatory Medicine is a movement in which patients and health professionals actively collaborate and encourage one another as full partners in healthcare. Hood and Auffray defined it in 2013 as “an approach of cooperative health care that actively and continuously involves patients and other stakeholders (i.e., healthcare providers and caregivers), across the continuum of care” (28).
Participatory medicine is an attitude. It is a considerable shift from the parentalistic paternalistic medical model characteristic of the 20th century and before. Patients are accepted as partners and joint decision making is favoured. It started before digitalisation in healthcare with the patients' rights movement and the legal requirement of informed consent. Digitalisation suits this model as in essence it facilitates the information flow towards patients. They are given access to Electronic Health Records, they have tools to monitor their health status at home with wearable devices. They have easier access to their healthcare provider through telemedicine. They can gain health related information from online sources and provide and receive peer support in online patient communities (29).
Our cluster analysis confirmed the hypothesis that younger individuals exhibit a greater familiarity with digital solutions. Specifically, doctors under the age of 35 demonstrated a significantly higher level of familiarity with utilization of and future interest in digital technology. Proficiency in multiple technologies correlated with a more informed understanding of both advantages and disadvantages, fostering a realistic assessment of the need for further improvement. Our results underscore a pronounced demand for both training and infrastructure in the use of digital health-related technologies. It is noteworthy that in comparison to their elder counterparts, young doctors identify enhanced patient adherence, increased patient involvement in the healing process and heightened patient cooperation as the greatest benefits of digital health solutions. In our multivariate analysis, a clear connection emerged between young doctors, active patient involvement in the treatment process—and the pivotal role played by digital technologies in facilitating this engagement Additionally, our results highlight the indispensable nature of a proper patient-provider relationship for the successful participation and adherence process which based on mutual communication, data sharing and shared decison making (30–32).
Digital health solutions can potentially enhance patient adherence (33–35), although relevant studies are small-scale and limited. More work is needed to identify the most effective digital health interventions to further quality health care provision (34,36–40).
Our multivariate analysis also revealed that women are more likely than their male counterparts to believe that digital health solutions have a significant role to play in improving patient adherence. Significant attention has been devoted to researching how gender of both patients and physicians are related to the overall patient experience and specific elements of the patient-physician relationship (41).
The role of digital health solutions in patient empowerment is supported by a large body of research (42–44) but little research has focused at the impact of the gender of the patient empowerment.
Another significant result of our study is that young doctors think that digital technologies may potentially be able to reduce burnout. According to the study of Rotenstein et al. nearly half of all healthcare workers suffered from burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic (45). The 2023 Physician Burnout & Depression Report of Medscape entitled “I Cry but No One Cares,” is a survey of more than 9,100 doctors representing 29 specialties. This study concludes that 53% of physicians experienced burnout the previous year, which is a six percent increase from 2021. Nearly a quarter of the surveyed physicians reported having been depressed, up from 15% in 2018 (46). Our pre-pandemic Hungarian data shows that medium or high level personal accomplishment was present in 75.9% of surveyed doctors and emotional exhaustion in 58% The moderate level depersonalization subscale was 53%. All 3 aspects showed association with being under 35 years old, working in in-patient care, working shifts and multiple workplaces (47).
Evidence is still scarce, but it tends to point to the burnout-reducing potential that digital health may have. Nevertheless, we must say that initially EHR was demonstrated to negatively influence clinician well-being, contributing to clinician burnout (48). Digital health solutions can improve job satisfaction and reduce burnout supporting clinical decision-making and reducing administrative tasks (49). Digital solutions can save time, minimize repetition, improve team-work and reduce unnecessary visits (50). One of the main sources of burnout in healthcare is the overwhelming amount of administrative and repetitive tasks. For example, AI can take over administrative tasks, using natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, and machine learning to streamline workflow. The uncertainty and complexity of clinical decisions may also contribute to burnout. AI can ease this as a decision aid using data analytics and predictive modeling. Chatbots, virtual assistants, and teleHealth platforms enable better interaction with healthcare workers and patients. These AI-driven technologies may improve efficiency and support healthcare professionals, contributing to their well-being and combating burnout (51–53).
5 Conclusions
Our results show the inevitable transformation of the 21st century physician's role: the success of digital health solutions requires the active involvement and management of patients, which demands proper patient education and professional support in navigating the digital space (54). As for physicians, it is important to provide guidance for patients in the DH world, especially in the areas of creditibility and proper use. This raises the need to incorporate digital health skills as an important part of medical and professional training. The 2024 position paper of the European Federation of Internal Medicine (EFIM) supports this notion (55). Having used SWOT analysis and the DELPHI method to reach their conclusion, the panel of experts consulted strongly advocates the development and application of telemedicine and digital technologies in healthcare. For this aim they emphesise the importance of professional development of eHealth competencies in the healthcare and medical workforce. They also stress the need for the development of consensus on care models or standardized protocols among European Internal Medicine specialists regarding telemedicine use.
Another important trend emerged from our findings: young doctors' needs and skills in digital technologies can be an important reference point for older colleagues. Digital health solutions can be a bridge between different generations of doctors, where young people can help their older colleagues navigate the digital world.
5.1 Research implications
The implications of digital health extend across theoretical, practical, and social dimensions, calling for an integrated approach that combines technology, education, and systemic innovation to achieve sustainable progress in healthcare.
The results of our study can be summarised in this theoretical framework as follows:
5.2 Theoretical implications
Digital health introduces a paradigm shift in healthcare emphasizing mutual care and challenging traditional hierarchies. The emergence of “e-patients” and “e-physicians” highlights the need for engagement and expertise, reflecting a systemic integration of technology and human attitudes. Digital tools address global challenges like workforce shortages and burnout by optimizing workflows and decision-making.
5.3 Practical implications
Digital health solutions enhance clinical efficiency and reduce administrative burdens through tools like telemedicine, AI-driven solutions, and mobile apps. Young doctors play a pivotal role in emphasizing the advantages of enhanced patient adherence and collaboration. Successful integration of digital health solutions depends on comprehensive training, adequate infrastructure, and effective patient education to maintain credibility and achieve full potential.
5.4 Social implications
Digital health reshapes doctor-patient relationships by promoting transparency and collaboration, as seen in Participatory Medicine. Young doctors help bridge generational divides, aiding older colleagues in adapting to new technologies.
5.5 Strengths and limitations
The strength of our research is that it analyses the proficiency and attitudes towards digital technologies of Hungarian doctors under 35 years of age in a representative sample. There is very limited published data on the digital health related attitudes of the young generation of physicians in the international literature. An additional strength is that our results are comparable with an equally representative sample of senior doctors. However, a limitation of our research is that we did not define the concept of patient adherence in our survey. It is also a limitation that burnout was measured subjectively, and no instrument was used for this. Another limitation is that a significant proportion of young doctors' work in inpatient care and urban areas which makes it difficult to compare different fields of care. One final limitation is that we have examined several different digital tools. This makes it difficult to compare knowledge, usage patterns and opportunities.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2025 2nd International Conference on Telecommunications and Power Electronics (TELEPE) Conference Start Date: 2025 May 29 Conference End Date: 2025 May 31 Conference Location: Frankfurt, Germany With the increasingly frequent cross-disciplinary cooperation, practical writing faces many challenges, such as knowledge differences, diverse norms and different styles. In this paper, an enhancement algorithm and adaptive generation method of practical writing for cross-domain scenes are proposed, aiming to help writers cross domain barriers and achieve efficient and accurate writing. The overall framework of the algorithm covers four modules: data preprocessing, domain adaptation, text generation and post-processing. Among them, the domain adaptive module uses deep learning technology, pre-trained BERT model and CNN to extract domain features, and realizes knowledge transfer through domain adaptive technology and antagonistic training; Text generation module combines template and generation strategy, and introduces GPT language model to optimize text. The experiment takes legal documents and business mail data sets as examples, and the results show that the algorithm can effectively generate practical texts that meet the specifications and styles of the target domain.

Abstract: Pest recognition is of great significance for achieving sustainable development in agriculture. Nevertheless, due to the wide variety of pest species, subtle interspecies differences, and significant intraspecies variations, existing artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can only recognize a small number of known pests effectively. In this article, we propose a zero-shot learning pest recognition framework based on ensemble hierarchical attribute prompting, termed EHAPZero. EHAPZero can identify pest images collected by IoT devices, and then transmit the recognition results to the IoT platform for terminal display. Specifically, the image recognition function is implemented by an attribute generation module (AGM), a hierarchical prompting module (HPM), and a semantic-visual interaction module (SVIM). AGM utilizes large language models to construct a knowledge graph of pests. It employs both node importance evaluation algorithms and manual methods to perform dual filtering on attribute nodes within the graph. Inspired by human knowledge reasoning, HPM dynamically predicts different hierarchical attributes of input images within the Transformer intermediate blocks. These predicted attributes are subsequently injected into the intermediate layer features of the Transformer as prompts. To achieve semantic disambiguation and knowledge transfer, SVIM employs a visual-guided semantic representation method and a semantic-guided visual representation method to strengthen cross-domain interaction between semantics and vision. Finally, the final prediction score is derived through ensemble of prediction results across different levels. Extensive experiments show that EHAPZero achieves the new state-of-the-art results on the real-word pest recognition benchmark. The codes are available at: https://github.com/jinqiwen/EHAPZero .

INTRODUCTION
Sustainability is a dynamic concept that evolves according to natural and social conditions, including agricultural sustainability. It is anticipated that agricultural sustainability will lead to in dynamic development and sustainable production (Connor et al., 2021). The five dimensions of sustainability are ecological, economic, social, technological, and institutional (Yusuf et al., 2022). According to Roy et al. (2014), agriculture is essential for regional development, especially for the welfare of the community. In Bali, the subak plays a crucial role in ensuring food security and agricultural sustainability by successfully fusing traditional methods with contemporary farming techniques. This demonstrates how indigenous systems can adapt and flourish in the face of contemporary pressures, highlighting the close connection between cultural heritage and economic stability.
Agriculture has a complex connection to the socioeconomic stability and nutritional security of many social groups in Bali. This link is especially important because of the subak system, a traditional irrigation and agricultural management system that UNESCO has designated as part of the world's intangible cultural heritage. The subak not only promotes sustainable agricultural practices, but it also reflects the complex socio-religious dynamics of Balinese society, thereby contributing to the preservation of food security through sustainable water management and rice output (Pradana, 2023; Jayendra et al., 2021; Ardana et al., 2024).
The notion of Tri Hita Karana (THK), which serves as the cornerstone for subak philosophy, emphasizes the necessity of harmony among the environment, the divinity, and humanity. This philosophy is expressed through the three principles of palemahan, pawongan, and parhyangan. Subak's operations are directed by these principles, which ensure that agricultural techniques are preserved in their natural nature while still meeting contemporary socioeconomic needs. Research has shown that the subak system preserves community resilience by integrating sustainable practices and ceremonial customs that honor agricultural deities, thereby ensuring a balance between ecological preservation and agricultural output (Ardana et al., 2024; Hirakawa et al., 2024).
In the past few years, the government has implemented programs that are specifically intended to diversify production and support rural economies, thereby enhancing food security. This has been accomplished by encouraging sustainable agriculture techniques, primarily through the Ministry of Defense. However, the fundamental work of subak demonstrates how local farmers have historically maintained food reserves and grown commodities in accordance with cultural beliefs, contributing to a resilient food system long before the development of these governmental strategies (Sedana, 2024; Putri, 2020). The ceremonial regard for dewa nini highlights the strong cultural values that are strongly embedded in Balinese farming systems, where food security is linked to spiritual and communal identities rather than just agriculture (Wahyuni et al., 2023).
In addition, the importance of subak is not limited to its influence on agriculture; it is a socioeconomic framework that strikes a balance between environmental responsibility and collective endeavors. The preservation of traditional techniques, such as subak, is becoming increasingly important in order to protect both ecological integrity and food security as Bali addresses current issues such as urbanization and tourism-related land conversion (Sriartha et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2023). By safeguarding these historical practices, Bali can maintain its agricultural heritage, address contemporary environmental challenges, and guarantee food security at all social levels (Lansing et al., 2023).
The primary rice-producing area in Bali Province, Tabanan Regency, possesses substantial agricultural potential due to the fact that rice cultivation is the cornerstone of regional economic stability and food security. Recent production data show a 0.15 percent increase from 169,265 tons in 2022 to 169,512 tons in 2023 (BPS-Statistics Bali Province, 2024). Nevertheless, this slight increase in production is starkly contrasted with a 60% increase in productivity in 2023, which highlights the underlying structural issues that are hampering the long-term sustainability of rice cultivation. Throughout Bali Province, the food security equilibrium is directly influenced by the agricultural policies that regulate rice yield in Tabanan Regency (Paramarta, 2024).
Accelerated agricultural land conversion is the most serious threat to the region, with a worrying fall in harvested area from 29,039 hectares in 2022 to 28,190 hectares in 2023-a net loss of 849 hectares per year, or a 2.92% annual decline rate. Eastern Tabanan, where development pressures exacerbate land-use conflicts, exemplifies this pattern. According to historical studies, Kediri District lost 127 hectares at an average rate of 31.7 hectares between 2015 and 2018, with the most dramatic conversion rates.
Beyond numerical land losses, the area has qualitative issues as a result of inadequate spatial planning coordination. Urban development projects often choke irrigation channels, causing cascade effects throughout the water supply network. These infrastructural disruptions put downstream farmers into water scarcity situations, motivating delayed land conversion as agricultural viability declines (Paramarta & Karyati, 2024). This interrelated pattern of land transformation, infrastructure disturbance, and reduced agricultural viability poses a systematic challenge to the sustainability of rice farming systems in Tabanan Regency.
The agriculture industry has significant challenges due to rice growing issues in Tabanan Regency, particularly in terms of farmer regeneration. A large proportion of Tabanan's rice farmers are now 60 years or older, indicating a lack of younger individuals entering the profession. Scholarly studies by Sulaeman et al. (2020) suggest that newer generations' preference for the service sector-where they see more promising earning potential-contributes to the decline in farmer regeneration.
Tabanan Regency, which covers an area of around 38,535 hectares, has set a rice growing aim in its agricultural plans for 2024. Ten districts cover 38,713 hectares, with the expected yield spread between them. With recent estimates of yields of around 6 tons of dry harvested grain per hectare, compared to historical averages of roughly 5.7 tons per hectare, average rice productivity has increased. Though these come from specific, ideal locations, numerous sites have recorded peak yields of up to 7-8 tons per hectare (Suastika et al., 2023). Appropriate irrigation water availability, proper fertilizer distribution, and pest control strategies (Hirakawa et al., 2024) all contribute to this productivity increase.
Although rice cultivation pays less than other businesses, it allows farmers to seek alternative work, like as commerce and constructing, producing additional revenue during maintenance periods (Hirakawa et al., 2024). As Tabanan is refining its agricultural practices to face the difficulties of the aging farmer demographic will play a vital role in ensuring the region's rice crop sustainability and future viability.
Using a five-dimensional sustainability assessment framework that includes ecological (environmental resource management and conservation), economic (financial viability and market dynamics), social (community engagement and knowledge transfer), technological (innovation adoption and infrastructure efficiency), and institutional (governance structures and policy frameworks) dimensions, the research This comprehensive approach aids in the identification of key sustainability factors and the development of integrated strategies that align traditional Balinese agricultural knowledge with modern sustainability demands, allowing for the preservation and improvement of rice farming systems critical to regional food security and cultural legacy protection.

This study was conducted in Tabanan Regency,Bali Province, Indonesia, selected as the primary research site due to its status as the province's largest rice-producing region,contributing169,512 tonsannuallywithproductivityratesof6.0tonsperhectare(BPS-StatisticsBaliProvince,2024). Within Tabanan Regency, Kediri District was purposively selected as the focal area based on its experience of extensive agricultural land conversion, totaling 127 hectares during the study reference period (Paramarta, 2024).
The research employed a strategic sampling approach focusing on two subaks (traditional irrigation communities) within the Yeh EmpasIrrigation System to examine the cascading effects of land conversion along the water distribution network. Subak Sanggulan was selected as the upstream study site, representing a subakexperiencing significant land conversion pressure with a 30% reduction in agricultural area from 107hectares in 2005 to 75 hectares in 2020, including 35 hectares of recent conversion within Kediri District. Located at the terminus of the Yeh Empas irrigation network, Subak Bengkel was selected as the downstream counterpart, where it serves as the ultimate water recipient from upstream subaks. This subak is a suitable example for investigating the downstream effects of upstream land-use changes because it underwent a 40- hectare land conversion in 2022 (Dananjaya et al., 2024).
The comparative analysis of sustainability challenges across the irrigation gradient is facilitated by this paired sampling design, which offers insights into the propagation of land conversion pressures through traditional water management systems. The study was carried out over three months, from January to March 2025, during the post-harvest season, to allow for in-depth interviews with subak officials and farmer representatives when agricultural activity were less active.
Data Collection
A mixed-method qualitative approach was implemented in this investigation, which combined direct field observations and in-depth interviews to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the sustainability of rice cultivation. Semi-structured questionnaires with open-ended questions were employed to conduct in-depth interviews with stakeholders, enabling a comprehensive examination of their perspectives, experiences, and contextual knowledge with respect to sustainability challenges and conventional management practices (Sanchez-Rodriguez et al.,2023). In particular, this method was advantageous for comprehending intricate sociocultural dynamics within subak systems that were not adequately captured by standardized surveys.
Interview data was supplemented by field observations, which documented the actual farming practices, irrigation infrastructure conditions, and social interactions within their natural contexts (Althubaiti, 2023). By incorporating both expressed opinions and observed behaviors, this dual approach facilitated the triangulation of data sources, thereby improving the reliability and validity of the data (Wittekind et al., 2023).
The study employed purposive sampling to identify 15 key informants pursuant to their institutional positions and areas of expertise. The subak governance institutions were represented by ten informants, which included traditional leaders (pekaseh and vice pekaseh), administrative officers (treasurer and secretary), and water management specialists (juru arah). An additional five informants, including agricultural extension officers and leaders of the agriculture, culture, and public works departments, represented government institutions. Comprehensive coverage of both traditional knowledge systems and formal institutional perspectives was guaranteed by this informant composition, which is crucial for comprehending the sustainability dynamics in rice cultivation systems.
Data Analysis
This study implemented a quantitative analytical framework that implemented Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) methodologies to evaluate the sustainability of rice cultivation in five distinct domains: ecological, economic, social, technological, and institutional. A systematic three-stage process was implemented to conduct the analysis, which included data acquisition, processing, and statistical analysis (Sanchez-Rodriguez et al., 2023).
The Rapid Appraisal for Fisheries (RAPFISH) framework was modified to create the Rapid Appraisal for Farm (RAP-Farm) methodology, which was used in the main analytical procedure (Fekih-Romdhane et al., 2023). By analyzing dissimilarity matrices and generating point configurations in Euclidean space, MDS simplifies multidimensional data, thereby facilitating the visualization of sustainability relationships across dimensions (Lim & Mémoli, 2024). This technique determines important features within each sustainability dimension and informs strategy creation based on THK principles (Piłat-Rożek et al., 2023).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
1. Research Area Description
Tabanan Regency is strategically located in south-central Bali, covering 849.31 km2 with diverse topographical features ranging from coastal plains to mountainous regions, with elevations spanningfromsealevelto2,276metersabovesealevel(BPS-StatisticsBaliProvince,2025).The regency is bounded by Buleleng Regency to the north, Badung Regency to the east, the Indian Oceantothesouth,andJembranaRegencytothewest.Thisgeographicaldiversitycreatesvaried microclimates and agricultural zones that support intensive rice cultivation, earning Tabanan recognition as Bali's primary rice-producing region with the highest concentration of traditional irrigation communities (subaks) in the province.
Subak Bengkel: Downstream Study Site
Subak Bengkel, located in Bengkel Village, Kediri District, is the downstream unit of the Yeh Empas irrigation system. Among the largest subaks in the region, this traditional irrigation cooperative oversees 329 hectares that are distributed across Bengkel Village (210 ha) and Pangkung Tibah Village (119 ha). UNESCO has recognized Subak Bengkel as an Ecohydrology Demonstration Site for its effective amalgamation of traditional water management and contemporary agricultural technologies, achieved through the collaboration of the Tabanan Regency Government and Muhammadiyah University of Malang (Paramarta & Karyati, 2024). This designation emphasizes the subak's role as a sustainable agriculture model that addresses contemporary challenges while preserving cultural heritage. Subak Bengkel, being the terminal water recipient in the Yeh Empas system, provides critical insights into the water management experiences of downstream communities.
Subak Sanggulan: Upstream Study Site
The upstream component of this comparative study is Subak Sanggulan, which spans approximately 55 hectares in Banjar Anyar Village, Kediri District. This subak is situated in a strategic location within the Yeh Empas irrigation network, with Banjar Anyar Village to the east, Banjar Pangkung Prabu to the west, Gatot Subroto Road to the north, and Banjar Demung to the south (Fig. 1).
The Subak Museum is a comprehensive repository of traditional agricultural knowledge and practices, exemplifying the cultural and educational significance of the subak. The museum is home to a vast collection of educational materials, historical documentation, and traditional agricultural implements that document the development of Bali's irrigation systems (Paramarta, 2024). This facility further solidifies Subak Sanggulan's dual function as a center for cultural preservation and intergenerational knowledge transmission, as well as an active agricultural community.
2. Informant Characteristics
The selection of key informants was determined by their institutional knowledge, practical experience, and strategic roles within rice farming systems, thereby facilitating access to diverse perspectives on sustainability challenges and traditional management practices (Demastus & Landrum, 2024). This purposive sampling method improves data validity and reinforces analytical interpretations by integrating diverse stakeholder perspectives (Golob et al., 2023; Walker et al., 2023).
The demographic analysis of subak officials indicates a farming community with significant experience, yet it encounters challenges related to generational transition. The majority of informants (79%) are mature farmers who are approaching retirement age and possess substantial agricultural expertise. They are aged 55 to 59. This demographic pattern is further supported by farming experience data, which indicates that 40% of participants have been involved in rice cultivation for more than two decades. This data demonstrates a profound institutional memory of traditional practices and environmental changes.
The educational profiles of the farmer informants indicate that they have moderate literacy levels, with 45% of them having completed secondary education. It is possible that this educational foundation may restrict engagement with intricate agricultural innovations that necessitate advanced technical knowledge, despite its support for information processing and fundamental technology adoption. Resource constraints may potentially impact the investment capacity for sustainability enhancements, as 40% of farmers manage 0.25-0.5 ha plots, indicating that land ownership patterns are predominantly small-scale.
Agricultural extension officers with field-level implementation experience and department leaders with policy-making authority are some of the government informants who represent complementary institutional perspectives. Comprehensive coverage of both grassroots agricultural realities and institutional policy frameworks is guaranteed by this diverse informant composition.
A farming community that possesses valuable traditional knowledge but requires targeted support to navigate modernization challenges is indicated by the demographic profile. The aging farmer population, coupled with moderate educational attainment and small-scale operations, highlights the necessity for accessible extension services, financial support mechanisms, and intergenerational knowledge transfer programs to promote sustainable agricultural development (Zhou, 2023).
3.3Rice Farming Sustainability Analysis in Tabanan Regency
By utilizing the RAP-Farm approach, the Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) analysis produced exhaustive sustainability assessments across five dimensions, resulting in the production of two critical outputs: leverage values and sustainability indices. Sustainability indices are quantitative measures (0-100 scale) that illustrate the performance level of each dimension, with higher values indicating greater sustainability (Mohamed & Godon, 2020; Riffel et al., 2023). In order to ascertain the factors that have the most significant impact on the overall sustainability performance, leverage values are used to identify the most influential attributes within each dimension. A summary of the multidimensional sustainability performance of rice cultivation operations in Tabanan Regency is provided in Table 2.
The analytical framework visualizes results through coordinate systems where the x-axis represents sustainability performance (0% indicating poor conditions, 100% indicating optimal conditions) and the y-axis displays attribute score variations within each dimension (Shedden- Mora et al., 2023). Additional reference points (anchors) surrounding the primary sustainability indicators provide analytical context for interpretation (Knezek et al., 2023).
Dimensional analysis reveals notable performance variations, with technological (71.42%) and economic (70.42%) dimensions demonstrating the highest sustainability levels, while ecological (63.42%) and social (63.69%) dimensions show the lowest performance, requiring prioritized intervention strategies (Pascual et al., 2023).
Monte Carlo Analysis
Monte Carlo analysis was conducted to address uncertainty aspects by performing 25 repetitions on each dimensional data (Piscicelli,2023).Monte Carlovalues were compared with MDS values in each dimension. Comparison differences between MDS and Monte Carlovalues preferably have values <5% (Table 3).
Table 3 demonstrates strong methodological reliability, with Monte Carlo values ranging from 62.34%to69.56%acrossall dimensions. The deviation between MDS and Monte Carloanalyses ranges from 0.88% to 1.86%, well below the acceptable threshold of 5%, confirming the robustness of the RAP-Farm methodology for sustainability assessment in rice farming systems (Golob et al., 2023).
These minimal deviations validate three critical aspects of data quality: (1) attribute scoring accuracy-errors in individual attribute assessments are negligible; (2) analytical stability- repeated iterations through Monte Carlosimulation demonstrate consistent results despite inherent variability in expert opinions; and(3) data integrity-the low variance indicates minimal data entry errors and reliable information processing. The consistency between MDS and Monte Carlo results establishes confidence in the sustainability indices and supports the validity of subsequent strategic recommendations based on these findings.
Goodness of Fit Assessment
Model validation through goodness of fit assessment is essential to ensure that the MDS analysis accurately represents the original sustainability data, This assessment determines whether the multidimensional scaling transformation maintains the genuine relationships within the data or introduces substantial distortions that could potentially undermine the reliability of the results.
To assess the sustainability of rice cultivation in Tabanan Regency, the goodness of fit evaluation utilizes two critical statistical measures, as illustrated in Table 4. The degree of distortion in the MDS model is evaluated by S-stress values, which must be less than 0.25 in order to achieve satisfactory performance (Walker et al., 2023).
The proportion of the original data variance captured by the model is quantified by determination coefficients (R2), with higher values indicating greater representation.
S-stress analysis indicates that the model performs exceptionally in all dimensions, with values ranging from 0.1453 to 0.1488, which are significantly lower than the 0.25 threshold. This confirms that the sustainability indices accurately preserve the original data relationships, as there is minimal distortion during the MDS transformation process.
All dimensions exhibit exceptional explanatory power, with R2 values ranging from 94.1% to 97.7%. The MDS model effectively captures the vast majority of sustainability information with minimal data loss, as the economic dimension obtains the highest variance explanation (97.7%) and all dimensions exceed 94%. These statistics, when combined, substantiate the reliability of the RAP-Farm methodology and provide assurance that the sustainability assessment accurately represents the actual conditions of the rice cultivation systems in Tabanan Regency (Mikhail et al., 2023).
Kite Diagram
A comprehensive visual representation of multidimensional sustainability performance is provided by the kite diagram, which allows for the immediate identification of strengths and deficits across all five sustainability dimensions. By converting numerical sustainability indices into a geometric pattern, this radar-style visualization enables the identification of strategic priorities and comparative analysis of rice cultivation systems in Tabanan Regency.
Utilizing a coordinate system, the kite diagram displays sustainability index values (0-100%) on five axes that correspond to ecological, economic, social, technological, and institutional dimensions. The sustainability profile is revealed by the resulting polygon shape, with larger areas suggesting improved overall performance and irregular shapes emphasizing dimensional imbalances (Charfeddine & Umlai, 2023). The critical boundary between sustainable (≥50%) and unsustainable (<50%) performance levels is determined by the 50% threshold (Jiang et al., 2023).
MULTIDIMENSIONAL SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT OF RICE FARMING SYSTEMS INBALI: ATRIHITAKARANA-BASED APPROACH FORTRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
The five dimensions of the kite diagram (Figure 2) indicate that the rice cultivation system is moderately sustainable, with all five dimensions exceeding the 50% sustainability threshold. The polygon demonstrates relatively balanced development across dimensions, with performance indices ranging from 63.42% (ecological) to 71.42% (technological), indicating consistent moderate-level sustainability achievement without extreme variations. The diagram clearly illustrates a performance hierarchy with technological dimension (71.42%) forming the most extended vertex, followed by economic dimension (70.42%). These leading dimensions create the diagram's most prominent features, reflecting successful implementation of efficient irrigation systems, particularly the one inlet-one outlet system, and relatively stable economic conditions within the rice farming sector (Dananjaya et al., 2024).
The three remaining dimensions-social (63.69%), institutional (63.53%), and ecological (63.42%)-form the more constrained portions of the kite shape, indicating priority areas for sustainabilityimprovement(seeFigure3).Therelativelycompressedverticesinthesedimensions suggest systematic challenges in community engagement, governance effectiveness, and environmental management that require targeted intervention strategies (Rosalina et al., 2023).
The kite diagram's shape reveals a sustainability profile characterized by technological strength butrequiringcoordinatedenhancementacrosssocial,institutional,andecologicaldimensions.The moderate expansion in all directions indicates that while the rice farming system maintains basic sustainability, significant potential exists for advancement toward high sustainability status (≥75%) through strategic interventions addressing the lower-performing dimensions. This visual analysis confirms that the rice farming systems of Tabanan Regency have a strong sustainability foundation and clear directions for development, particularly in the areas of social, institutional, and ecological performance, by utilizing technological strengths.
Leverage Analysis
In order to identify the most influential attributes within each sustainability dimension that have a substantial impact on the overall system performance, leverage analysis is a critical component of the RAP-Farm methodology. The sensitivity of sustainability indices to changes in specific attributes is quantified by this analytical technique, which allows for the prioritization of strategic interventions based on their potential impact magnitude. Through the identification of the factors that have the most significant impact on sustainability outcomes, leverage analysis facilitates the formulation of evidence-based policies and the allocation of resources to optimize their effectiveness.
The leverage analysis quantifies the extent to which each attribute contributes to the fluctuations in the sustainability index by estimating the root mean square (RMS) ordination changes along the sustainability scale. Attributes that exhibit higher leverage values are more sensitive, which means that changes in these factors will result in more significant changes in the performance of the overall sustainability. The analysis evaluates ten attributes across each dimension, employing selection criteria that prioritize attributes with leverage values surpassing fifty percent of the maximum observed value, thereby identifying the most significant factors (Angelino et al., 2023). The leverage analysis identifies five key determinants of rice farming sustainability in Tabanan Regency, each reflecting the most sensitive attribute within its respective dimension.
(1) Economic Dimension - Price Stability (Leverage: 4.88)
With a leverage value of 4.88, the sustainability of rice and grain price stability is the most influential factor across all dimensions. This discovery suggests that price fluctuations have the most extensive influence on the overall sustainability performance, which underscores the critical significance of market stability for the economic security and long-term viability of farmers (Kubontubuh, 2023).
(2) Technological Dimension: Irrigation Efficiency (Leverage: 4.53).
Sustainable irrigation system efficiency is the second most influential factor (4.53), emphasizing the critical role of water management in the success of rice cultivation. This high leverage value illustrates the fundamental dependency of rice agriculture on reliable, efficient water distribution infrastructure and the significant influence that irrigation improvements can have on overall sustainability (Shedden-Mora et al., 2023).
(3) Social Dimension - Knowledge Transfer (Leverage: 4.50):
The sustainability of intergenerational knowledge transfer is significantly influenced (4.50), underscoring the significance of preserving and transmitting traditional agricultural wisdom while evolving to meet contemporary challenges. This leverage factor highlights the importance of human capital development and cultural continuity in sustaining farming practices.
(4) Ecological Dimension - Spatial Planning (Leverage: 4.49):
The ecological sustainability is significantly influenced by the coherence of land-use policy, as evidenced by the high sensitivity (4.49) of the quality of general plans and spatial planning. This result is indicative of the influence of planning decisions on the preservation of agricultural areas, environmental protection, and land conversion pressures (Riffel et al., 2023).
(5) Institutional Dimension - Traditional Governance Leverage: 4.39
The substantial influence of awig-awig (traditional regulations) on the sustainability of institutional sustainability is evident (4.39), underscoring the ongoing significance of customary governance systems. In the context of contemporary agricultural sustainability, this leverage value emphasizes the importance of community-based management structures and traditional knowledge systems (Golob et al., 2023).
The leverage analysis reveals a balanced distribution of critical factors across all five dimensions, with leverage values clustering between 4.39 and4.88. This narrow range (0.49differencebetween highest and lowest) suggests that sustainable rice farming requires coordinated attention to economic stability, technological efficiency, social continuity, ecological planning, and institutional governance. The identification of these high-leverage factors provides clear targets for policy intervention and resourceal location to achieve maximum sustainability improvements.
Based on leverage magnitudes, the analysis suggests prioritizing economic price stabilization mechanisms, followed by irrigation system modernization, intergenerational knowledge transfer programs, spatial planning reforms, and traditional governance strengthening. However, the similar leverage values across dimensions indicate that integrated approaches addressing multiple factors simultaneously may yield superior results compared to single-dimension interventions.
DISCUSSION
The overall sustainability index of 66.50% (moderately sustainable) represents a novel finding demonstrating that traditional subaksystems, whenintegrated with modern agricultural practices, can maintain balanced sustainability performance despite contemporary challenges (Sanchez- Rodriguezetal.,2023).Thenarrowperformancerangeacrossdimensions(7.99percentagepoints) provides new evidence that traditional agricultural systems can achieve balanced development across multiple sustainability aspects.
The technological dimension's leadership (71.42%) reveals an unexpected finding-traditional irrigationsystemscontributesignificantlytotechnologicalsustainabilitywhileenvironmentaland social vulnerabilities require targeted interventions. This challenges conventional assumptions about traditional agricultural systems' technological capacity. The identification of price stability as the most influential factor across all dimensions (leverage: 4.88) represents a novel finding demonstrating economic security's centrality in multidimensional sustainability frameworks (Paramarta & Karyati, 2024).
Ecological sustainability faces critical challenges through spatial planning clarity (leverage:4.49), providing new evidence for policy coherence's critical role in maintaining environmental sustainability within traditional systems (Riffel et al.,2023). The vulnerability of the social dimension in intergenerational knowledge transmission (leverage: 4.50) provides a novel perspective on the specific mechanisms that threaten agricultural continuity, illustrating that knowledge degradation poses both technical and socio-cultural risks (Walker et al., 2023).
Scientific sustainability assessment is systematically integrated with THK philosophy to establish a novel methodology for agricultural development that is culturally appropriate. This methodology presents the most innovative perspectives on the empirical validation and improvement of indigenous knowledge systems. A new approach that connects traditional water management with contemporary governance systems is represented by the ecological strategy, which combines formal spatial planning with subak institutional strengthening. The integration of cross-sectoral policies offers innovative methods for the preservation of cultural heritage values and the prevention of conflicts. The integration of digital-based cooperatives with minimal price policies promotes economic sustainability and is consistent with THK's pawongan principles. This approach offers new perspectives on the enhancement of traditional cooperative values through contemporary platforms while preserving social solidarity (Pratama et al., 2021). The social strategy, which prioritizes youth engagement while maintaining traditional practices, provides innovative solutions to the issues of generational transitions in agriculture. New methods of modernizing conventional water management systems while maintaining cultural values are represented by technological advancements that enhance irrigation efficiency (Asrika et al., 2023). This institutional strategy for the formal legal recognition of awig-awig is an innovative measure of institutional strengthening that serves as a bridge to 2023.
There are four substantial innovations to sustainability science that this study contributes, which challenge existing theoretical frameworks and introduce new methodological approaches. The research initially establishes a balanced sustainability model that contradicts the assumption that traditional agricultural systems inevitably lag in comprehensive sustainability performance. This model demonstrates that traditional agricultural systems can maintain equilibrium across multiple sustainability dimensions despite modernization pressures. Secondly, the results exhibit an economic centrality framework in which price stability is the most critical factor across all sustainability dimensions, thereby challenging traditional multi-dimensional approaches that treat economic factors as separate considerations rather than central organizing principles. Thirdly, the investigation establishes a THK integration methodology that validates traditional wisdom scientifically, thereby establishing replicable frameworks for culturally appropriate development strategies that connect indigenous knowledge with modern sustainability science. Fourthly, the research illustrates traditional-modern synthesis pathways, which illustrate how indigenous agricultural systems can achieve sustainable modernization without cultural compromise. This offers new models for development that respect traditional values while enhancing technological and economic performance. These contributions collectively advance sustainability science by establishing practical models for culturally sensitive agricultural development, producing new theoretical frameworks that acknowledge the centrality of economic stability in multidimensional sustainability, and providing evidence-based approaches for integrating traditional knowledge systems with scientific assessment methodologies. The narrow leverage value range (4.39-4.88) serves as new evidence that sustainable rice farming necessitates coordinated interventions rather than single-dimension interventions. This supports the THK philosophy's emphasis on balanced harmonies and provides empirical validation for traditional wisdom approaches.
These discoveries have substantial implications for the development of policy in regions with traditional agricultural systems, as they illustrate how scientific evaluation can validate and improve indigenous knowledge systems while simultaneously addressing modern sustainability challenges. The incorporation of formal policy frameworks with traditional governance provides replicable models for sustainable agricultural development that respects cultural heritage while achieving modernization objectives.
Tabanan Regency's rice cultivation demonstrates a dedication to environmental preservation, as evidenced by its ecological dimension sustainability index of 63.42 (moderately sustainable). Ecological dimension sustainability of rice farmingin Tabanan Regency includes soil and water conservation, more efficient agricultural input use, and biodiversity maintenance. The attribute with highest sensitivity value is clarity of general plans and spatial planning with leverage score of 4.49. Clarity in spatial planning plays important roles in providing legal certainty and directed, sustainable agricultural development directions, including allocation of permanent agricultural land and intersectoral integration. Conversely, spatial planning unclear can cause land use conflicts, uncontrolled land conversion, and inefficiency in agricultural production management risking productivity decline.
The sustainability index of 70.42 places the economic dimension of rice farming in Tabanan Regency in moderately sustainable category. This status indicates that economic activities supporting rice farming have been running quite well but have not reached optimal conditions (Charfeddine&,2023). Leverage analysisresults show the most sensitive attribute affecting economic sustainability index is sustainability ofrice and grain price stability with leverage score of 4.88. This value illustrates that rice and grain price fluctuations greatly affect economic sustainability levels in rice farming systems in this region. Price stability becomes a key factor because it determines income certainty for farmers,encourages investment feasibility infarming, and maintains balance between production Costs and received results(Paramarta&Karyati,2024).
The social dimension also contributes to quite sustainable status with sustainability index of 63.59, shown by strong social solidarity, active farmer participation in farmer groups, and acceptance of local value sin agricultural systems. The existence of mutual cooperation traditions and agricultural knowledge inheritance from generation to generation becomes strengthening factors in social sustainability. Leverage results show the most sensitive attribute is sustainability of intergenerational knowledge transfer with leverage score of 4.50. This value indicates that knowledge transfer from older to younger generations plays very important roles in maintaining rice farming practice continuity in Tabanan Regency (Walker et al., 2023). When younger generations are less involved or uninterested incontinuing agricultural activities, then knowledge of provenlocal practices in resource management will experience degradation. This phenomenon not only threatens agricultural sector sustainability technically but also socially and culturally considering agricultural activities in Tabanan Regency are inseparable from local values such as mutual cooperation and agrarian rituals deeply rooted in community life.
Meanwhile, technological dimension sustainability index of 71.42 (moderately sustainable category) is the highest sustainability index compared to four other dimensions. Existingly, rice farming in Tabanan Regency has utilized some modern agricultural technologies such as agricultural machinery use and superior varieties. However, technology dissemination is not evenly distributed and therearestillobstaclesinnewinnovationadoption,especiallyamongsmall farmers and those less exposed to training (Pratama et al., 2021; Wicaksana et al., 2020). Sustainable appropriate technology extension and training are greatly needed to improve rice farming efficiency and productivity. Leverageanalys is results show the most sensitive attributeis irrigation system efficiency with value 4.53. This value indicates that efficient irrigation systems have great influences on sustainability in technological dimensions. Irrigation system efficiency not only impacts water use savings and land productivity improvements but also determines successinothertechnologyadoptionssuchasusingsuperiorvarietiesrequiringmoreprecisewater regulation (Anindita et al., 2020).
Institutional dimension sustainability includes subak existence, farmer cooperatives, and local government support that have provided quite strong institutional foundations in supporting sustainability.However,institutionaleffectivenessstillneedsstrengtheningthroughmanagement capacity improvements, transparency, and access to information and more inclusive regulatory support. Institutional dimension ordination value of 65.53 shows institutional dimensions in rice farming in Tabanan Regency are moderately sustainable. Institutional dimensions play strategic rolesinsustainableagriculturaldevelopmentbecausetheyarecloselyrelatedtolocalregulations, farmer organization existence, financing access, inter-institutional coordination, and distinctive traditional institutional roles such as subak and awig-awig in Bali. The most sensitive attribute is awig-awigexistencesustainabilitywithleveragescore4.39(Aninditaetal.,2020).Awig-awigare written rules traditionally implemented by subak member farmers in regulating resource governance such as irrigation water, land use, and social relationships among farmers.
Based on sustainability indices, ecological dimensions (63.42) and social dimensions (63.59) are relatively similar and occupy the two lowest indices. Therefore, in formulating rice farming sustainabilitystrategiesinTabananRegency,thesetwodimensionsneedmoreattentiontoprevent sustainability status decline. However, to maintain or even improve rice farming sustainability status in Tabanan Regency, all dimensions need strengthening.
Rice farming sustainability strategy in Tabanan Regency through strategies in ecological, economic, social, technological, and institutional dimensions based on THK concepts. This concept consists ofthree main harmonies: parahyangan (harmonious relationshipbetween humans and God), pawongan (harmonious relationship among humans), and palemahan (harmonious relationship between humans and nature).
Strategyinecologicaldimensionsconsideringthehighestsensitivityattributeofgeneralplanand spatial planning clarity is subak institutional strengthening strategy through mentoring and subak integration into spatial planning and regional development as well as cross-sectoral approaches. Related to other sensitive attributes, namely land processing and water resource management, more consistent and integrated sustainable agriculture principle applications are needed. This strategy represents systematic approaches in maintaining food security and environmental sustainability, particularly in subak context as world cultural heritage. Cross-sectoral approaches aim to synergize intersectoral policies such as agriculture, environment, spatial planning, and tourism to prevent overlapping or counter-productive policies.
Strategy in economic dimensions considering rice and grain prices as sensitive attributes is minimum price policy intervention (Pratama et al., 2021) and local market and value chain strengthening through digital-based farmer cooperative strengthening. This approach aligns with THK principles, particularlypawonganaspectsbecauseitprioritizeseconomicjusticeandsocial solidarity among agricultural and market actors, encourages farmer economic literacy improvements, and creates equality in accessing opportunities.
Strategy to encourage sustainability in social dimensions with sensitive attribute of intergenerational knowledge transfer sustainability is active young generation involvement in farmer groups, extension services based on local wisdom, social incentives, and preservation of traditional agricultural practices adaptive tochangingtimes. This strategy represents strategic steps in maintaining agricultural system sustainability while answering farmer regeneration challenges.
Irrigation system efficiency becomes the most sensitive attribute in technological dimensions. Therefore, irrigation system efficiency improvement efforts must be prioritized in sustainable agricultural development planning. Applicable strategies are irrigation channel revitalization, modern irrigation technology applications such as drip or sprinkler irrigation modified for rice fields, and farmer group training and empowerment in participatory water management (Asrikaet al., 2023).
The most sensitive attribute in institutional dimensions is awig-awig existence sustainability. Therefore, policy intervention strategies supporting local institutional strengthening through formal legal recognition of awig-awig are needed. By strengthening awig-awig existence sustainability, institutional dimensions in rice farming systems in Tabanan Regency can continue supporting agricultural sector sustainability more robustly and resiliently, bridging traditional values and modernization needs, and strengthening Bali's community and environment-based agricultural identity (Darmawan et al., 2023).
CONCLUSION
Rice farming sustainability in Tabanan Regency achieves an overall index of 66.50%, classified as moderately sustainable across all five dimensions.Theecological(63.42%)andsocial(63.59%) dimensionsshowthelowestperformance,indicatingpriorityareasforimprovement.Fivecritical factors most significantly influence sustainability: spatial planning clarity, price stability, intergenerational knowledge transfer, irrigation efficiency, and traditional governance (awig-awig) continuity.
Based on the THK frame work, five integrate dstrategies are recommended: (i)strengthening subak institutions through spatial planning integration and cross-sectoral coordination; (ii) engaging youth in farmer groups while preserving traditional practices through local wisdombased extension services; (iii) providing formal legal recognition for traditional governance systems (awig-awig); (iv) implementing minimum price policies and developing digital-based farmer cooperatives; and (v) modernizing irrigation systems through technology adaptation and participatory water management. These strategies address identified vulnerabilities while building on existing strengths to enhance overall sustainability performance. Therefore, research recommendations are for stakeholders to revitalizesubak systems based on THK values in realizing sustainable rice farming in Tabanan Regency and Bali Province.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2025 International Conference on Metaverse Computing, Networking and Applications (MetaCom) Conference Start Date: 2025 Aug. 27 Conference End Date: 2025 Aug. 29 Conference Location: Seoul, Korea, Republic of This paper introduces MetaClues, an AI-driven framework that integrates generative AI and Metaverse technology to deliver a constructivist learning experience. This innovative system combines image-to-3D generation, large language models, and text-to-image models to create progressive clues within a virtual campus. Learners engage in thematic zones, interact with AI-powered non-playable characters, and manipulate artifact items—creating, fusing, or exchanging them—to steer their own discovery process.At the heart of MetaClues is the goal of uncovering or recreating a secret artifact, a multidisciplinary item rich with educational significance. Learners follow progressive clues tied to a relevance score for each item they possess. This scoring system evaluates an item’s connection to the secret artifact across multiple dimensions, offering insights into its value. To unlock additional clues, learners must create, fuse, or exchange items, refining their understanding of the artifact based on these scores. This adaptive approach strikes a balance between structured, domain-specific learning and open-ended creativity, fostering active engagement.A pilot study with 19 participants showed notable improvements in participation, knowledge retention, and motivation to explore further. Impressively, 84% of novice learners gained a substantive understanding of multidisciplinary concepts. Evaluations using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) confirmed high usability and educational impact.Using generative AI as a collaborative tool, MetaClues aims to transform learners from passive recipients into creative problem solvers. Our research demonstrated how constructivist principles can be blended with generative AI and immersive technology to enrich multidisciplinary education.

Training Development and Learning Facilitation for Lower-Level Automated Driving Systems Across Age Groups

Author: Zheng, Haolan

Publication info: Zheng, Haolan.

Abstract: The adoption of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and other Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) introduces benefits and challenges for drivers. Drivers who use those driving technologies should develop accurate mental models, appropriately calibrate trust, and effectively apply automation in real-world scenarios. This dissertation examines how different text-based training influence drivers’ learning, engagement, and training transfer when using ACC, with a focus on both younger and older adults. A series of driving simulator studies compared several training conditions with or without different types of driving roles and responsibilities information. The study assessed how these training methods impact drivers’ comprehension, trust, and performance in edge-case driving scenarios. Results suggest that training presentation and structure significantly influences learning and transfer outcomes. Older participants, in particular, exhibited increased attention to system limitations, and scaffolding training content improved knowledge retention and application. These findings highlight the importance of structuring driver education programs to support better mental model development and trust calibration, ultimately enhancing the safe and effective use of ACC.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2025 8th International Conference on Computer Information Science and Application Technology (CISAT) Conference Start Date: 2025 July 11 Conference End Date: 2025 July 13 Conference Location: Kunming, China This paper addresses the challenges of high computational cost and slow inference in deploying large language models. It proposes a distillation strategy guided by multiple teacher models. The method constructs several teacher models and integrates their output probability distributions and intermediate semantic features. This guides the student model to learn from multiple sources of knowledge. As a result, the student model gains stronger language understanding and generation ability while maintaining a small parameter size. To achieve this, the paper introduces a weighted output fusion mechanism, a feature alignment loss function, and an entropy-driven dynamic teacher weighting strategy. These components improve the quality and stability of knowledge transfer during distillation. Under multi-teacher guidance, the student model captures semantic information more effectively and demonstrates strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. In particular, the method shows high consistency in expression, generalization ability, and task adaptability in tasks such as language modeling, text generation, and multi-task learning. The experiments compare the proposed method with several widely adopted distillation approaches. The results further confirm its overall advantages in perplexity, distillation loss, and generation quality. This study provides a feasible technical path for the efficient compression of large-scale language models. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-teacher collaborative mechanisms in complex language modeling tasks.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2025 5th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education (ICAIE) Conference Start Date: 2025 May 14 Conference End Date: 2025 May 16 Conference Location: Suzhou, China The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is fundamentally reshaping educational paradigms. AI-driven gamified learning environments demonstrate unique potential in facilitating interdisciplinary knowledge construction through two key mechanisms: (1) the strategic integration of game mechanics into pedagogical processes, and (2) the systematic application of AI capabilities to transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. This study establishes a theoretical framework synthesizing gamification principles with interdisciplinary education theory, with particular emphasis on the ARCS (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction) motivation model and intelligent educational agents. Our proposed framework employs AI algorithms to generate adaptive learning scenarios and multimodal interaction systems designed to achieve dual objectives: cognitive engagement through attention-capturing mechanics and pedagogical alignment through personalized content delivery. The research further develops a three-phase implementation strategy for interdisciplinary knowledge integration within gamified contexts: (1) contextual bridging across disciplines, (2) schema reconstruction through problem-based challenges, and (3) meta-cognitive reinforcement via intelligent feedback systems. Empirical evidence from our experimental implementation reveals statistically significant improvements in both learner engagement metrics (p<0.01, Cohen's d=1.2) and knowledge transfer scores (p<0.05, η 2 =0.32), demonstrating the framework's efficacy in operationalizing motivation theory while addressing contemporary educational challenges. These findings not only advance theoretical understanding of technology-enhanced learning but also provide actionable insights for designing next-generation educational systems that effectively bridge disciplinary divides.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/virtual-museum-experience-design-user-behavior/docview/3249985283/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: In the evolving landscape of digital cultural heritage, the integration of advanced computational models into immersive virtual environments has become essential for enriching user engagement and fostering more meaningful interpretative experiences. As digital heritage platforms increasingly adopt interactive technologies, there is a growing need to move beyond static presentations and introduce intelligent, responsive systems that adapt to individual users’ interests and behaviors. Traditional virtual museum systems often suffer from rigid content structures, limited adaptability, and a lack of personalized storytelling, all of which constrain user immersion and diminish the potential for impactful learning experiences. To overcome these challenges, our approach integrates semantic-topological modeling with adaptive interaction mechanisms, forming a dynamic and personalized digital museum experience. The proposed framework features a hybrid computational architecture that unites symbolic knowledge representations with algorithmic spatial layout generation. This integration enables the creation of flexible narrative trajectories that are contextually relevant and customized according to each user’s cognitive and behavioral profile. Furthermore, the system incorporates reinforcement-driven semantic planning to interpret and respond to user interactions in real time, ensuring a continuously evolving and coherent interpretative journey. Experimental results reveal substantial improvements in user satisfaction, engagement levels, and knowledge retention when compared to traditional virtual museum platforms. These outcomes highlight the scalability and transformative potential of the model, reinforcing its capacity to enhance accessibility, personalization, and educational value across diverse digital heritage applications.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2025 6th International Conference of the Portuguese Society for Engineering Education (CISPEE) Conference Start Date: 2025 July 16 Conference End Date: 2025 July 18 Conference Location: Setúbal, Portugal A decade ago, Dr. Struth from Bosch said that Industry 4.0 needs an education offensive because companies are not yet able to fully tap into the potential of Industry 4.0. The skills required in the workforce for this industry are changing faster than traditional curricula can keep up due to the new technologies. The reports commissioned by the European Union to Letta and Draghi indicate that EU must invest in the industry and education. The WEF's prediction about jobs until the year 2030 indicates that there is a need for engineers trained for present and future needs, and their training must be in line with these needs. Also, the WEF in the 2023 edition echoed the PISA report for its effects on the economy, and these results have not been satisfactory to anyone. The training of the engineers is the responsibility of the engineering schools. The students who come to engineering schools are Generation Z and have generated the latest PISA, TIMMS, and ICILS reports. There are many reports on universities made by Spanish institutions, however, none of them talk about students, specifically those who enter engineering schools, and the causes of dropout. The dropout in engineering schools in Catalonia is over 40% in the first year, a problem that has not been solved and is persistent in subsequent years. This paper explains internal and external causes that favor the abandonment of engineering studies. Some of the causes are linked to each other even if, a priori, they seem independent. Thus, technological knowledge within TPACK, computational thinking, and the teaching staff's resistance to changing teaching methodologies are related to each other, as are the double penalty in exams, the persistent lack of cross-curricular knowledge transfer, and the gap between what is taught in baccalaureate and what is taught in the first year of the degree. The importance of the analysis of the results of the test carried out on 417 computer engineering students and 139 nautical students on basic knowledge of calculation tools and knowledge of programming languages, is that for the first time, these respondents had the choice to learn a programming language as an optional subject inside the baccalaureate, and the data obtained show the teaching methodology and the learning system. A brief historical review of how engineering schools were taught can help us see the effects of incorporating AI in both sides, professors, and students, and how schools must evolve.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2025 21st International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT) Conference Start Date: 2025 June 9 Conference End Date: 2025 June 11 Conference Location: Lucca, Italy This paper introduces a novel integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with Extended Reality (XR) technologies to address knowledge transfer challenges in industrial environments. The proposed system embeds domain-specific industrial knowledge into XR environments through a natural language interface, enabling hands-free, context-aware expert guidance for workers. We present the architecture of the proposed system consisting of an LLM Chat Engine with dynamic tool orchestration and an XR application featuring voice-driven interaction. Performance evaluation of various chunking strategies, embedding models, and vector databases reveals that semantic chunking, balanced embedding models, and efficient vector stores deliver optimal performance for industrial knowledge retrieval. The system's potential is demonstrated through early implementation in multiple industrial use cases, including robotic assembly, smart infrastructure maintenance, and aerospace component servicing. Results indicate potential for enhancing training efficiency, remote assistance capabilities, and operational guidance in alignment with Industry 5.0's human-centric and resilient approach to industrial development.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping global economies, yet we lack a holistic understanding of how AI innovations evolve across interconnected communities. This dissertation examines how interactions among heterogeneous actors and artifacts across open-source communities, academic fields, and commercial industries influence AI innovation's creation, diffusion, and application. Unlike previous research focusing on isolated breakthroughs, this study provides a comprehensive view of AI's evolutionary trajectory through a dynamic network perspective. The first introduces "network variability" as a novel construct to analyze how open-source collaboration networks adapt to changing environments, revealing that meaningful structural reconfigurations significantly enhance project development outcomes under increasing complexity. The second study examines how open-source AI models function as boundary objects bridging developer and academic communities, demonstrating that model network positioning influences scholarly impact through complex temporal patterns. The third study investigates cross-boundary knowledge transfer to industry contexts, analyzing how AI knowledge integration strategies affect patent generation and firm valuation in autonomous vehicles, revealing that exploration-oriented approaches yield greater market value than exploitation strategies. These findings establish AI innovation as a networked phenomenon with distinctive evolutionary dynamics that differ from traditional technologies, characterized by complex feedback loops across multiple interacting communities rather than a linear progression.

Workforce Management Strategies for a Multigenerational Workforce: Challenges and Difficulties of an Aging Workforce

Author: Bartels, Michael Edward

Publication info: Bartels, Michael Edward. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/workforce-management-strategies-multigenerational/docview/3232358784/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: The problem addressed in the study was that many organizations struggled with workforce generational differences as four generations coexisted in the labor force and Baby Boomers were leaving the workforce at an estimated four million a year leaving an ill-prepared workforce to handle the loss of institutional knowledge thus necessitating the need for multigenerational workforce management strategies. As a result, managers, supervisors, and organizations face challenges in continuing business as usual and merging diverse generational perspectives. The purpose of this qualitative single case study was to examine workforce generational differences, challenges posed by Baby Boomers leaving the workforce, and effective multigenerational workforce management strategies to address institutional knowledge loss. The study followed the Generational Cohort Theory, which helped explain how generational experiences play a role in shaping what happens in the workplace. This qualitative single-case study employed semi-structured interviews and demographic questionnaires with 20 participants aged 18 to 69 years from a traffic management company in northeast Oklahoma. Participants represented Baby Boomers, Generation X, Generation Y, and Generation Z cohorts. The analysis of data followed thematic coding guided by NVivo and Braun and Clarke’s step-by-step approach. Trustworthiness was established through triangulation, member checking, peer debriefing, and reflexive journaling. The results indicated that individuals from different generations communicated differently, used technology differently, and had differing work values and learning approaches. Baby Boomers preferred face-to-face communication, whereas digital communication was preferred by the younger generations. Key challenges included knowledge transfer barriers, differences in communication, and motivational factors. Successful management practices involved open communication structures, strength-based management approaches, mixed-generation teams, adaptive training methods, and formal mentoring programs. The study concludes that organizations must develop comprehensive, intentional management approaches, viewing generational diversity as a strategic advantage rather than a challenge. Among the recommendations included setting up knowledge-sharing programs, nurturing intelligence across ages among top managers, and encouraging environments that allow different age groups to contribute their ideas, leading to improved performance and creativity in organizations.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2025 5th International Conference on Neural Networks, Information and Communication Engineering (NNICE) Conference Start Date: 2025 Jan. 10 Conference End Date: 2025 Jan. 12 Conference Location: Guangzhou, China In the contemporary context of rapid advancements in information technology and the exponential growth of data volume, language models are confronted with significant challenges in effectively navigating the dynamic and ever-evolving information landscape to update and adapt to novel knowledge in real time. In this work, an online update method is proposed, which is based on the existing Retrieval Enhanced Generation (RAG) model with multiple innovation mechanisms. Firstly, the dynamic memory is used to capture the emerging data samples, and then gradually integrate them into the core model through a tunable knowledge distillation strategy. At the same time, hierarchical indexing and multi-layer gating mechanism are introduced into the retrieval module to ensure that the retrieved content is more targeted and accurate. Finally, a multi-stage network structure is established for different types of inputs in the generation stage, and cross-attention matching and screening are carried out on the intermediate representations of each stage to ensure the effective integration and iterative update of new and old knowledge. Experimental results show that the proposed method is better than the existing mainstream comparison models in terms of knowledge retention and inference accuracy.

Abstract: Oil palm cultivation plays a critical role in rural livelihoods in Indonesia, yet previous research has often overlooked systematic institutional differences among smallholders. This study aims to analyze disparities in assets, strategies, and livelihood outcomes among three oil palm smallholder typologies—ex-Perkebunan Inti Rakyat (PIR) transmigrant smallholders who received land through government transmigration programs, independent smallholders who cultivate oil palm without formal partnerships, and plasma smallholders operating under corporate partnership schemes—in Central Mamuju Regency, West Sulawesi. A descriptive quantitative approach based on the sustainable livelihoods framework was employed, using chi-square analysis of data collected from 90 respondents through structured interviews and field observations. The results show that ex-PIR smallholders possess higher physical, financial, and social capital and achieve better income and welfare outcomes compared to independent and plasma smallholders. Independent smallholders exhibit resilience through diversified livelihood strategies, whereas plasma smallholders face asset limitations and structural dependency on partner companies, increasing their economic vulnerability. The study concludes that differentiated policy approaches are necessary to enhance the resilience of each group, including improving capital access, promoting income diversification, and strengthening institutions for plasma smallholders. Future research should expand geographical scope and explore factors such as technology adoption, gender dynamics, and intergenerational knowledge transfer to deepen understanding of sustainable smallholder livelihoods in tropical plantation contexts.

Full text: 1. Introduction Oil palm is a vital plantation commodity that significantly contributes to Indonesia’s economy, particularly for employment and foreign exchange revenue [1,2]. In West Sulawesi, specifically in the Central Mamuju Regency, the expansion of oil palm plantations has transformed the agricultural landscape and community livelihood structure, particularly following the initiation of the PIR transmigration program in the 1980s. This expansion has continued to evolve, increasing in scale and complexity to the present day [3,4]. The PIR program is a partnership framework between major enterprises and smallholders, wherein firms manage and cultivate plantation land, while smallholders administer a designated region and remit rent proportional to the managed expanse. This development has resulted in three distinct typologies of oil palm smallholder: ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders, independent smallholders, and plasma smallholders, each possessing unique characteristics facing specific challenges in improving livelihood resilience.
Previous studies on oil palm smallholders in Indonesia have primarily focused on technical aspects of production [1,5,6,7], environmental impacts [8,9,10], or policy analysis [11,12,13]. However, research examining livelihood differentiation among oil palm smallholders remains limited, with studies treating them as a homogeneous group despite evidence of systematic institutional and socio-economic variations. Studies on coconut smallholders in Gorontalo, Indonesia [14], and maize smallholders in South Sulawesi (Indonesia) [15] revealed that smallholders exhibit diverse characteristics in terms of resource availability and social networks. Furthermore, the role of historical institutional arrangements—such as transmigration programs and corporate partnership schemes—in creating distinct livelihood trajectories among smallholder typologies has received insufficient attention in the literature. Smallholders’ social capital—which includes bonding (relationships with fellow smallholders), bridging (networks with similar groups), and linking (connections with individuals of higher socio-economic status)—plays a crucial role in shaping their livelihood opportunities. Disparities in access to social capital affect smallholders’ ability to secure resources, participate in collective decision making, and reduce transaction costs in their agricultural activities. Yet, empirical evidence demonstrating statistically significant differences in asset portfolios, adaptive strategies, and economic outcomes across institutionally differentiated smallholder groups remains scarce.
Although the expansion of oil palm plantations has significantly transformed rural socio-economic structures in Indonesia, most previous studies tend to treat smallholders as a homogeneous group. This approach overlooks the critical variations in livelihood asset access, adaptive strategies, and economic outcomes across different smallholder typologies. In reality, distinctions among ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders, independent smallholders, and plasma smallholders have profound implications for household economic resilience, social inequality, and long-term livelihood sustainability. Therefore, a more focused analysis is necessary to understand how these typological differences shape livelihood systems.
To address this gap, this study contributes by providing empirical evidence with statistical validation of differences in livelihood assets, adaptive strategies, and livelihood outcomes among three oil palm smallholder typologies in the Central Mamuju Regency, West Sulawesi, using a descriptive quantitative approach grounded in the sustainable livelihoods framework. Through systematic measurement and chi-square analysis across multiple livelihood dimensions, this research demonstrates how historical institutional arrangements (PIR transmigration programs and plasma partnerships) create statistically significant disparities in asset accumulation, strategy implementation, and economic outcomes. It sheds light on how differential access to livelihood capitals and institutional arrangements (PIR programs and plasma partnerships) create distinct pathways of resilience or vulnerability, thereby enriching the academic understanding of livelihood dynamics in tropical plantation contexts with robust quantitative evidence of smallholder heterogeneity.
This study contributes by investigating disparities in livelihood asset attributes—including natural, human, social, physical, and financial capital—as well as livelihood strategies and outcomes among ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders, independent smallholders, and plasma smallholders in the Central Mamuju Regency. Specifically, this research seeks to determine how variations in ownership and access to livelihood capital influence the strategies and outcomes of different smallholder types through empirical measurement and comparative analysis.
This study integrates multiple theoretical perspectives to analyze livelihood dynamics among oil palm smallholders. While the sustainable livelihood framework developed by Chambers and Conway [16] provides the foundational structure, examining the interrelationships between assets, strategies, and outcomes, we enhance this framework through contemporary theoretical lenses. We integrate Scoones’ [17,18] more recent work on sustainable livelihoods, which emphasizes the role of political economies and power relationships in shaping resource access and livelihood trajectories. This integrated theoretical approach enables us to develop specific quantitative metrics and statistical testing procedures to systematically compare: (1) asset portfolios—measured through quantifiable indicators of land ownership patterns, physical capital quality, human capital development, social capital networks, and financial capital accumulation; (2) strategy implementation—assessed through quantified responses to market shocks, adaptation mechanisms, and accumulation approaches; and (3) livelihood outcomes—evaluated through measurable economic returns, sustainability indicators, and household welfare measures. This operationalization of theoretical concepts into measurable variables enables systematic comparison among the three smallholder typologies to reveal how institutional arrangements and historical contexts shape diverse livelihood trajectories within oil palm plantation communities.
2. Materials and Methods This research employs a quantitative descriptive approach to analyze variations in asset ownership, strategies, and livelihood outcomes among three typologies of oil palm smallholders in the Central Mamuju Regency [19]. The research location was selected through purposive sampling in Budong-Budong District, Central Mamuju Regency, West Sulawesi Province, encompassing seven villages: Salugatta, Tinali, and Pontanakayyang (representing ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders); Kire, Lumu, and Barakkang (representing independent smallholders); and Bojo Village (representing plasma smallholders) (Figure 1).
The research involved a total of 90 respondents, with 30 respondents representing each oil palm smallholder typology. Respondent selection was conducted using purposive sampling based on established inclusion criteria [20]. This sample size is consistent with recommendations for research employing comparative descriptive analysis in rural livelihood studies [21,22]. For ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders, the criteria used were farmers who own oil palm land as a result of the PIR transmigration program and have managed such land for a minimum of 10 years. For independent smallholders, the criteria used were farmers who own and manage oil palm land independently without formal partnerships with companies. As for plasma smallholders, the criteria used were farmers affiliated with the partnership scheme of PT. Wahana Karya Sejahtera Mandiri (PT WKSM). To ensure representativeness, respondents were selected considering variations in land ownership size, crop age, and land location in each village.
Primary data collection was conducted through structured interviews using questionnaires that covered livelihood capital variables (natural, physical, human, social, and financial), livelihood strategies, and livelihood outcomes [16,23]. Direct observation was also conducted to observe land conditions, settlements, and farmers’ socio-economic activities [24].
Data were analyzed descriptively by calculating frequency distributions and percentages to illustrate differences in livelihood capital characteristics, livelihood strategies, and livelihood outcomes among the three farmer typologies. To validate the observed descriptive patterns, chi-square tests of independence were conducted to examine whether differences in categorical variable distributions across smallholder typologies were statistically significant [25,26]. Livelihood capital was assessed based on quantity, quality, and accessibility, while livelihood strategies were evaluated from aspects of risk management, adaptation, and accumulation. Livelihood outcomes were evaluated from economic income, sustainability, and household welfare. To maintain data validity, cross-checking between information sources was conducted through simple triangulation techniques [21,27].
3. Results Oil palm is a key plantation crop and a vital source of income for communities in the Central Mamuju Regency, West Sulawesi Province, particularly in Budong-Budong District. Initially, oil palm plantations were integrated into the PIR transmigration program, which established several transmigration settlement units (TSUs) in 1993, including those in Budong-Budong District, such as TSUs Salugatta, Pontanakayyang, and later, Tinali Village. Following the socio-economic benefits derived from oil palm cultivation in these transmigrant villages, nearby communities in Kire, Lumu, and Barakkang, which observed these transformations, began independent oil palm farming in 1998, primarily involving local residents. Subsequently, communities from outside Budong-Budong District and the Central Mamuju Regency engaged in oil palm cultivation through plasma schemes in collaboration with PT Wahana Karya Sejahtera Mandiri (PT WKSM). Under this scheme, local smallholders allocated portions of their land for management by the company. This historical trajectory led to the emergence of three distinct typologies of oil palm smallholders in Budong-Budong District, each characterized by differences in livelihood assets, strategies, and outcomes, as outlined in the following section.
3.1. Livelihood Assets The livelihood assets of smallholders in the Central Mamuju Regency vary significantly across three typologies: ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders, independent smallholders, and plasma smallholders. All smallholders fall within the productive age range of 26 to 60 years, with a male predominance across all categories. Notably, plasma smallholders account for only 16.7% of total smallholder participation, particularly within the Mandar ethnic minority, which adheres to the Siwalli Parri cultural principle—emphasizing equitable responsibilities between spouses in sustaining the household. Educational attainment also varies across groups. Ex-PIR transmigrant and independent smallholders generally have higher education levels, with 20% and 10% university graduates, respectively, and 43.3% and 66.7% high school graduates. In contrast, plasma smallholders exhibit lower educational attainment, with 50% having only completed elementary school. These differences significantly impact farming management skills and access to resources.
Material well-being further reflects these disparities. Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders report higher welfare levels, with 60% owning permanent residences and 73.3% possessing automobiles and motorcycles. These findings highlight income inequality and uneven access to productive resources among the three smallholder groups.
3.1.1. Natural Capital Natural capital plays a crucial role in assessing the quality and quantity of natural resource stocks utilized by communities for their livelihoods. In Budong-Budong District, land ownership patterns among oil palm smallholders differ significantly across the three typologies: Ex-PIR transmigrant, independent, and plasma smallholders. These differences are detailed in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 and elaborated below.
The land ownership patterns of oil palm producers in Budong-Budong District demonstrate distinct characteristics. Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders benefit from land allocations under the government’s transmigration program, receiving 3 hectares per household (Table 1): 2 hectares of primary farmland, 0.75 hectares for secondary agriculture, and 0.25 hectares for residential yards. Among them, 50% own 1–2 hectares of oil palm land, 20% own 2–4 hectares, 10% own 4–6 hectares, 13.3% own 6–8 hectares, and 6.7% own more than 8 hectares. Statistical analysis confirmed that these land ownership distribution patterns differ significantly across the three smallholder typologies (χ 2 = 27.099, df = 12, p = 0.007).
Independent smallholders, mostly indigenous to Budong-Budong District, acquired their land by cultivating public land that was subsequently acknowledged as privately owned. Data indicate that 40% possess 1–2 hectares of oil palm land, 23.3% own 2–4 hectares, 16.7% have 0.5–1 hectares, 10% control 4–6 hectares, 6.7% possess 6–8 hectares, and 3.3% own land over 8 hectares.
Next, plasma smallholders in the Bojo community, which is an expansion community from Tinali Village, demonstrate different land ownership patterns from the other two groups of smallholders: 50% of plasma smallholders own oil palm land measuring 0.5–1 hectares, 40% own 1–2 hectares, and 10% hold 2–4 hectares. No plasma smallholders possess oil palm land over 4 hectares, signifying a reduced business scale relative to ex-PIR transmigrant and independent smallholders.
Unlike other smallholder groups, ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders no longer possess non-oil palm agricultural land (Table 2). This signifies their specialization plan on oil palm agriculture, perceived as more lucrative than crop diversification. This decision seems to stem from their observation of substantial welfare enhancements resulting from oil palm yields, thereby motivating them to maximize the cultivation of this crop on all their owned property.
In contrast to ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders, independent smallholders continue to uphold land diversification by allocating spaces for non-oil palm production. Data indicate that 33.3% possess less than 0.5 hectares of non-oil palm land, 26.7% possess 0.5–1 hectares, 10% possess 1–2 hectares, and 30% possess more than 2 hectares. This area is utilized for cultivating many commodities, including corn, bananas, coconuts, and cocoa, exemplifying a crop diversification strategy to mitigate the risk of reliance on a singular item.
Regarding non-oil palm land ownership, 30% of plasma smallholders possess less than 0.5 hectares, 40% own between 0.5 and 1 hectare, and 10% own between 1 and 2 hectares. This property is utilized for the cultivation of commodities including corn, bananas, and oranges. This crop diversification pattern demonstrates a technique to sustain supplementary revenue sources in conjunction with oil palm production. The observed differences in non-oil palm agricultural land ownership patterns among the three groups were statistically significant (χ 2 = 106.200, df = 8, p < 0.001), confirming the distinct diversification strategies employed by each smallholder typology.
Housing land ownership among ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders also reflects favorable conditions (Table 3), with 56.7% owning 150–200 m 2 , 26.7% owning 100–150 m 2 , and 16.7% possessing more than 200 m 2 . The prevalence of extensive land ownership suggests stronger economic capacity and investment in residential properties. This pattern underscores their adaptation strategy, prioritizing oil palm cultivation over other land uses to maximize economic returns.
Among non-agricultural landowners, namely in dwellings, 50% of independent smallholders possess 100–150 m 2 of land, 20% possess 150–200 m 2 , and 30% possess more than 200 m 2 . Among non-agricultural landowners, namely in dwellings, 50% of independent smallholders possess 100–150 m 2 of land, 20% possess 150–200 m 2 , and 30% possess more than 200 m 2 . Additionally, several farmers maintain fish ponds as supplementary non-agricultural assets. Among the three farmer typologies, only independent smallholders possess fish ponds, with 26.7% owning ponds of 0.5–1 hectare in size and 16.7% owning ponds larger than 1 hectare. Meanwhile, 56.7% of independent smallholders do not own fish ponds. None of the plasma smallholders possess fish ponds, and neither do any of the ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders. This varied land ownership pattern illustrates independent smallholders’ adaptive strategies for sustaining several revenue sources and enhancing household economic resilience.
In terms of non-agricultural land ownership, specifically houses, the majority (66.7%) of plasma smallholders possess land ranging from 100 to 150 m 2 , whereas 16.7% own land extending between 150 and 200 m 2 , and another 16.7% own land beyond 200 m 2 . Data indicates that none of the plasma smallholders has fish ponds, in contrast to independent smallholders who partially own fish ponds as supplementary revenue sources. Chi-Square analysis validated that residential land ownership patterns also differ significantly among the three smallholder groups (χ 2 = 16.254, df = 4, p = 0.003).
The land ownership attributes of plasma smallholders are intrinsically linked to their status as newcomers who cultivated new land and formed partnerships with PT WKSM. This collaboration framework grants them access to oil palm plantation growth but within a more restricted area. Nevertheless, they continue to practice agricultural diversification by employing non-oil palm land, demonstrating an understanding of the significance of alternate revenue streams and family food security.
The choice to sustain this land diversification seems to be shaped by their experience as indigenous inhabitants who recognize the significance of avoiding dependence on a singular commodity. This technique offers them adaptability in responding to oil palm price volatility and evolving market conditions while ensuring family food security through the cultivation of food crops.
3.1.2. Physical Capital Physical capital across the three groups of oil palm growers in Budong-Budong District exhibits notable disparities (Table 4), especially regarding dwelling quality and car ownership. Research indicates that ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders possess superior living circumstances, with 60% residing in permanent structures, 30% in semi-permanent dwellings, and merely 10% in non-permanent or stilt buildings. This advantage signifies their superior economic capacity to invest in enhancing housing quality. In contrast, independent smallholders have a more equitable distribution of housing conditions, comprising 40% permanent buildings, 26.7% semi-permanent houses, and 33.3% non-permanent or stilt houses. Plasma smallholders exhibit the lowest percentage of permanent residences at 36.7%, with 20% classified as semi-permanent, and the highest percentage of non-permanent or stilt dwellings at 43.3%. These disparities signify a divergence in economic capacity and investment objectives among the three agricultural groups.
In terms of vehicle ownership, a comparable trend is evident. Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders exhibit the highest vehicle ownership, with 73.3% possessing both motorcycles and cars, while 26.7% own only motorcycles. Independent smallholders occupy a median position, with 53.3% owning both motorcycles and cars and 46.7% owning solely motorcycles. Plasma smallholders demonstrate the lowest ownership, with only 36.7% owning both motorcycles and cars, while the majority (63.3%) possess only motorcycles.
These disparities in physical capital ownership reflect differences in welfare levels and economic capabilities among the three smallholder groups. This also illustrates how variations in resource access and asset management strategies can influence the standard of living and socio-economic mobility of each smallholders group in Budong-Budong District. Statistical analysis indicated that while differences in living conditions approached significance (χ 2 = 8.783, df = 4, p = 0.067), vehicle ownership patterns showed similar distributional trends across the three smallholders typologies.
3.1.3. Human Capital The human capital of the three groups of oil palm smallholders in Budong-Budong District exhibits notable disparities in educational attainment and training (Table 5, Table 6 and Table 7).
Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders possess the highest educational attainment, with 10% holding university degrees, 40% having completed high school, 20% graduating from junior high school, and 30% finishing elementary school (Table 5). This elevated educational attainment correlates with their income levels, which surpass those of other agricultural groups.
Independent smallholders include a smaller percentage of university graduates (6.7%) but exhibit the highest proportion of high school graduates at 43.3%, followed by 40% of junior high school graduates and merely 10% of elementary school graduates. In Bojo Village, plasma smallholders have diminished educational attainment, with merely 3.3% holding university degrees, 33.3% having completed high school, 40% possessing junior high school diplomas, and 23.3% achieving elementary school education. Lower educational attainment correlates with various characteristics, including age, reluctance to pursue formal education, and geographical barriers to educational institutions. However, statistical analysis revealed that educational differences among household heads were not statistically significant (χ 2 = 6.747, df = 6, p = 0.345), suggesting similar educational foundations across the three groups.
Data indicate major disparities among groups regarding children’s schooling (Table 6). Offspring of ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders exhibit the highest educational attainment, with 26.7% holding university degrees, 40% completing high school, and 33.3% finishing junior high school. Independent smallholders exhibit a same trend, albeit with a reduced proportion of university graduates (10%), alongside 50% high school graduates, 33.3% junior high school graduates, and 6.7% elementary school graduates.
The most distinct situation is observed among the offspring of plasma smallholders, with none attaining higher education; 33.3% are high school graduates, 30% are junior high school graduates, 16.7% are elementary school graduates, and 20% are not enrolled in school. Chi-square analysis confirmed that these differences in children’s educational attainment were statistically significant (χ 2 = 27.434, df = 8, p = 0.001), indicating distinct educational trajectories emerging among the next generation of smallholder families.
The training component reveals notable disparities across the three cohorts of oil palm growers (Table 7). In Bojo Village, plasma smallholders exhibit the highest training attendance rate, with 100% attending maintenance and fertilization training as well as fire handling training, while 56.7% engaged in further training. The elevated participation indicates a more organized mentoring framework provided by their partner company, PT WKSM.
Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders exhibit significant training engagement rates, with 100% attending maintenance and fertilization training, 86.7% engaging in fire management training, and 33.3% partaking in further training. The significant participation is a result of the transmigration program, which was specifically created with an extensive mentorship structure.
Independent smallholders have reduced training participation rates, with merely 56.7% attending maintenance and fertilization training, 6.7% engaging in fire management training, and none partaking in additional training. This limited engagement may stem from their status as independent smallholders, unencumbered by government initiatives or corporate affiliations.
These training programs address multiple technical facets of oil palm farming, encompassing the selection of quality oil palm seedlings, differentiation between ripe and unripe oil palm fruit, appropriate fertilization methods, and the sanitation of plants and planting zones.
Variations in training intensity can eventually influence the quality of plantation management and the productivity of each farming group. These observed differences in training participation patterns reflect the distinct institutional support systems available to each smallholder typology, with plasma smallholders benefiting from corporate-sponsored programs, ex-PIR transmigrants accessing government-facilitated training, and independent smallholders relying primarily on self-directed learning approaches.
3.1.4. Social Capital The social capital among the three groups of oil palm smallholders in Budong-Budong District exhibits varied patterns (Table 8, Table 9 and Table 10).
Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders exhibit the highest levels of social capital, especially in collaborative endeavors and mutual assistance (Table 8). Data indicate complete participation in mutual help among groups, with full involvement in community cooperation activities and smallholder group meetings (100%), highlighting the community’s robust tradition of solidarity. Participation rates in religious activity meetings are notably high at 76.7%, whereas engagement in family savings groups or harmony meetings is comparatively lower at 33.3%.
Subsequently, independent smallholders exhibit moderate patterns of social participation in mutual assistance activities. Only 30% participate in community mutual assistance, while 56.7% attend smallholder group meetings. Participation in religious activities stands at 46.7%, indicating significant engagement in communal spiritual dimensions. Their participation in family gatherings or harmony meetings is minimal at just 6.7%.
Plasma smallholders have distinct traits of social engagement. In formal activities, 63.3% participate in smallholder group meetings, although only 33.3% are affiliated with oil palm smallholder associations. They exhibit considerable involvement in family savings groups (36.7%), suggesting robust informal social networks. Nonetheless, engagement in mutual cooperation (16.7%) and religious activities (6.7%) is comparatively minimal. Statistical analysis confirmed that these participation patterns in mutual assistance activities differ significantly across the three smallholder typologies, with all measured social activities showing statistically significant differences: family gatherings (χ 2 = 8.527, df = 2, p = 0.014), community mutual assistance (χ 2 = 48.113, df = 2, p < 0.001), religious activities (χ 2 = 30.136, df = 2, p < 0.001), and smallholder group meetings (χ 2 = 16.705, df = 2, p < 0.001).
Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders exhibit considerable engagement levels inside formal organizations (Table 9). Approximately 80% are affiliated with oil palm smallholder associations, indicating their recognition of the significance of professional organizations in facilitating their agricultural endeavors. Over fifty percent (53.3%) actively participate as administrators in harmony/religious organizations, underscoring their significant contribution to the community’s social and spiritual fabric. Despite being smaller in number, their engagement in social organization and political party management (16.7%) and village administration (3.3%) indicates participation in local political and governmental matters.
Independent smallholders show strong participation in certain formal organizations, with 86.7% belonging to oil palm smallholder associations, demonstrating their focus on industry-specific networks. However, they have limited engagement in other organizational roles, with only 10% involved in community organizations or political parties, 6.7% serving on boards of harmony/religious organizations, and 6.7% holding village official positions.
Plasma smallholders have more limited organizational participation. Only 33.3% are affiliated with oil palm smallholder associations, significantly lower than the other two groups. Their participation as board members of harmony/religious organizations is also low at 13.3%, and none participate in community organizations or political parties. Their village official participation matches ex-PIR transmigrants at 3.3%. Chi-square analysis revealed significant differences in organizational membership patterns, particularly in oil palm smallholder associations (χ 2 = 22.800, df = 2, p < 0.001) and harmony/religious organizations (χ 2 = 26.110, df = 2, p < 0.001), while differences in community/political organization participation approached significance (χ 2 = 5.213, df = 2, p = 0.074). Village official participation showed no significant differences (χ 2 = 0.523, df = 2, p = 0.770) across groups.
The business network of ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders demonstrates effective diversification (Table 10). A majority (63.3%) participate in independent business groups/micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), indicating their inclination to pursue economic activity beyond oil palm cultivation. Nearly half (46.7%) are members or administrators of cooperatives, demonstrating their recognition of the significance of microfinance institutions in facilitating economic operations. Participation in oil palm transportation services (23.3%), however modest, demonstrates their commitment to engaging in the oil palm industry value chain.
Independent smallholders show a focused business networking strategy. They have significant engagement in oil palm transportation services (70%), reflecting their business specialization within the oil palm value chain. However, they show no participation (0%) in cooperatives or independent business groups/MSMEs, suggesting they prioritize direct service provision in the oil palm sector rather than diversified business activities or formal cooperative structures.
Plasma smallholders demonstrate a strong dependence on cooperative structures, with 86.7% serving as members or administrators of cooperatives, underscoring the crucial importance of formal organizations within their plasma system. However, they show no participation (0%) in independent business groups/MSMEs or palm oil transport services, indicating their reliance on structured partnerships rather than independent business ventures. Statistical analysis confirmed highly significant differences in all business networking activities across the three groups: members/board of cooperative membership (χ 2 = 45.720, df = 2, p < 0.001), independent business groups/MSMEs (χ 2 = 48.169, df = 2, p < 0.001), and palm oil transport services (χ 2 = 34.895, df = 2, p < 0.001).
These disparities indicate distinctions in the social framework and adaptive methods of each group. Ex-PIR smallholders, as transmigrant communities, particularly from the Javanese ethnic group, embody robust traditions of mutual collaboration and solidarity. This is essential for establishing and sustaining social networks that enhance their economic and social well-being in the context of transmigration. Independent smallholders prioritize networks directly associated with oil palm productivity and commercialization, evidenced by their significant participation in oil palm smallholder associations and transportation services. Concurrently, plasma smallholders are increasingly aligned with formal entities like cooperatives that link them to partner enterprises.
These varying involvement patterns demonstrate how each group formulates survival strategies via social networks. Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders typically preserve conventional social capital while establishing contemporary economic networks. Independent smallholders enhance networks that bolster their autonomy, whereas plasma smallholders depend more on official frameworks that facilitate cooperation with corporations. The statistical significance of these differences across multiple dimensions of social capital confirms that each smallholder typology has developed distinct social strategies that align with their historical origins, institutional arrangements, and livelihood objectives.
3.1.5. Financial Capital The financial capital of the three types of oil palm smallholders in Budong-Budong District exhibits diversity (Table 11, Table 12 and Table 13).
Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders exhibit the most robust financial status (Table 11), with 66.7% earning between IDR 4–8 million monthly, 20% earning between IDR 8–12 million, and 10% earning beyond IDR 12 million. Merely 3.3% earn between IDR 1–4 million monthly, indicating a significantly high income distribution within this cohort. Independent smallholders exhibit a diminished income distribution, with 50% earning IDR 1–4 million, 33.3% earning IDR 4–8 million, 10% earning IDR 8–12 million, and 6.7% earning in excess of IDR 12 million. Simultaneously, plasma smallholders have the lowest income levels, with the majority (83.3%) earning between IDR 1–4 million and the remainder (16.7%) earning between IDR 4–8 million, with no individuals exceeding an income of IDR 8 million. Statistical analysis confirmed that these income disparities among the three smallholders groups were highly significant (χ 2 = 40.068, df = 6, p < 0.001), demonstrating substantial differences in earning capacity across the different smallholder typologies.
Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders have the highest loan levels (Table 12), with 83.3% possessing loans exceeding IDR 20 million, 13.3% holding loans between IDR 10–20 million, and 3.3% maintaining loans ranging from IDR 1–10 million. Independent smallholders exhibit more moderate borrowing behaviors, with 53.3% possessing loans ranging from IDR 10–20 million, 26.7% holding loans between IDR 1–10 million, and 13.3% without any loans. Plasma smallholders possess 50% with debts ranging from IDR 10–20 million, 26.7% with loans between IDR 1–10 million, and 20% without any loans. Chi-square analysis revealed highly significant differences in borrowing patterns (χ 2 = 58.465, df = 6, p < 0.001), indicating that each smallholder group has developed distinct debt management strategies aligned with their financial capabilities and institutional access.
Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders exhibit the most robust savings profile (Table 13), with 60% possessing savings over IDR 20 million, 23.3% holding savings between IDR 10–20 million, and 16.7% maintaining savings of IDR 1–10 million. Independent smallholders possess savings as follows: 40% have between IDR 10–20 million, 33.3% have above IDR 20 million, and 26.7% have between IDR 1–10 million. Currently, the predominant proportion of plasma smallholders (53.3%) possess no savings, 40% have savings ranging from IDR 1–10 million, and merely 6.7% have savings between IDR 10–20 million. Statistical testing confirmed highly significant differences in savings accumulation patterns across the three groups (χ 2 = 59.531, df = 6, p < 0.001), reflecting the varying financial security levels and wealth accumulation capabilities among different smallholder typologies.
This financial capital pattern illustrates how disparities in resource access and financial management practices influence the economic well-being of each group. The substantial debts incurred by ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders are offset by significant income and savings, demonstrating their capacity to handle productive debt well. Conversely, the minimal savings of plasma smallholders indicate their constraints in asset accumulation despite their comparatively high loan levels. The statistical significance across all three financial indicators—income, loans, and savings—confirms that these groups operate within fundamentally different financial ecosystems, with ex-PIR transmigrants demonstrating the highest financial capacity, independent smallholders showing moderate financial resilience, and plasma smallholders facing the greatest financial constraints despite institutional support structures.
3.2. Adaptive Strategies and Economic Behavior of Smallholders The livelihood strategies of the three categories of oil palm smallholders in Budong-Budong District exhibit variations, especially with early planting approaches and methods for addressing price volatility. In the villages of Salugatta, Tinali, and Pontanakayyang, ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders first collaborated with the state-owned enterprise Nusantara Plantation Limited Company-19 (NPLC19), concentrating on rubber cultivation in business land 2. In 1994, a partnership transfer occurred between PT Surya Raya Lestari II and PT Bhadra Sukses, both subsidiaries of PT Astra Agro Lestari, due to poor results. This move signified a shift in commodities from rubber to oil palm, with all planting and maintenance expenses incurred by the corporations.
Following the expiration of the plants’ productive lifespan of 20 years, a replanting initiative was executed in 2019 for 200 hectares throughout these three communities, funded by the Oil Palm Plantation Fund Management Agency (OPPFMA) program.
Data indicate (Table 14) that 73.3% of ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders obtained this replanting subsidy. Nevertheless, not all smallholders were able to participate in this program due to several obstacles, including challenges in organizing smallholder groups, frequent instances of land transfers, and intricate bureaucratic procedures involving multiple stakeholders.
Smallholders without access to replanting funding devised other solutions, with 16.7% borrowing capital from intermediaries, 6.7% obtaining People’s Business Credit (PBC), and 3.3% leveraging social capital. In contrast, independent smallholders exhibited varied patterns, with 73.3% opting to collaborate with oil palm firms, while the remaining smallholders were divided among PBC (10%), intermediary loans (10%), and social capital (6.7%). Plasma smallholders exhibited the most consistent pattern, with 100% depending on collaboration with PT WKSM. Statistical analysis confirmed highly significant differences in initial planting strategies across the three smallholder groups (χ 2 = 81.396, df = 8, p < 0.001), demonstrating that each group’s access to and preference for different financing mechanisms reflects their distinct institutional relationships and historical development pathways.
The discrepancies in initial financing strategies illustrate the intricate history of oil palm plantation development in the region and demonstrate the impact of government regulations, market dynamics, and the influence of large corporations on smallholders’ livelihood strategy decisions. The disparities in access to financial sources ultimately lead to variations in the development and viability of oil palm plantation enterprises among different smallholder groups.
In the face of price drops, the three groups exhibit distinct adaptation techniques (Table 15). Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders employ substantial measures for reducing production inputs in oil palm cultivation, with 73.3% opting against fertilization, 66.7% ceasing cleaning and pruning procedures, and 70% allowing oil palm fruits to remain unharvested. Only 26.7% decrease fertilizer use, while 30% persist in harvesting despite incurring losses.
Concurrently, plasma smallholders exhibit distinct patterns owing to their affiliations with partner companies. Despite a 90% reduction in fertilizer application, basic maintenance is necessary. Approximately 53.3% engage in minor cleaning, whereas 50% persist in harvesting despite incurring losses. Regarding labor, 80% depend on corporate workforce.
Independent smallholders exhibit analogous trends, albeit with more intensity in the decrease of production inputs. Approximately 86.7% refrain from fertilization (Table 16), 86.7% cease cleaning, and 93.3% do not harvest oil palm fruit. Only 13.3% decrease fertilizer use, while 6.7% persist in harvesting. Furthermore, 70% utilize their own or family labor, while 26.7% employ hired labor. Chi-square analysis revealed highly significant differences in labor utilization strategies (χ 2 = 45.464, df = 4, p < 0.001), indicating that each smallholder group has developed distinct approaches to managing labor costs during economic downturns, with plasma smallholders uniquely benefiting from corporate labor support while ex-PIR transmigrants and independent smallholders rely predominantly on family-based labor strategies.
Each group demonstrates distinct techniques for financing daily living expenses (Table 17). Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders predominantly depend on savings (66.7%) as their primary source of finance. Other minor sources include farming and livestock (13.3%), assistance from family groups (6.7%), family members (3.3%), neighbors (3.3%), working as farm laborers (3.3%), and borrowing from traders (3.3%).
Independent smallholders frequently engage in business diversification, with 66.7% opting for gardening, livestock farming, aquaculture, or managing micro-enterprises. Simultaneously, plasma smallholders frequently engage as agricultural laborers (26.7%) and perform business diversification (30%) to fulfill their daily requirements. Statistical testing confirmed highly significant differences in livelihood diversification strategies (χ 2 = 60.602, df = 14, p < 0.001), demonstrating that each group has developed fundamentally different approaches to income generation during economic stress, with ex-PIR transmigrants relying on accumulated savings, independent smallholders emphasizing diversification, and plasma smallholders combining wage labor with modest diversification efforts.
The disparities in adaption tactics indicate variances in economic resilience and flexibility among each group when confronted with economic pressures. Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders with substantial funds possess superior financial resilience, whereas independent smallholders depend on their capacity for business diversification, and plasma smallholders are more constrained by partnership models that restrict their adaptability.
As oil palm prices increase, techniques for allocating the supplementary money also differ (Table 18). Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders exhibit a pronounced inclination towards saving, with 53.3% opting to reserve their supplementary income. Furthermore, 20% allocate their income for home renovations, 16.7% for purchasing or servicing automobile loans, 6.7% for acquiring new oil palm land, and 3.3% for debt repayment. This trend demonstrates their long-term focus in financial management.
Independent smallholders exhibit varied priorities, with 40% allocating supplementary income towards home renovations, 30% towards debt repayment, 13.3% towards savings, 10.3% towards vehicle purchases or installment payments, and 3.3% towards acquiring oil palm property. The emphasis on home enhancement and debt settlement indicates their commitment to enhancing quality of life and alleviating financial strain.
Concurrently, plasma smallholders exhibit patterns akin to those of independent smallholders, albeit with varying percentages. Approximately 36.7% allocate supplementary income for home renovations, 26.7% for debt repayment, 26.7% for automobile purchases or installment payments, and 10% for savings. No plasma smallholders invest extra revenue in acquiring new oil palm land, perhaps due to financial constraints and their affiliations with current partnership agreements. Chi-square analysis revealed significant differences in income allocation strategies during price increases (χ 2 = 25.653, df = 8, p = 0.001), confirming that each group’s spending priorities reflect their distinct economic positions and long-term development strategies.
These strategic disparities indicate variances in the economic and social priorities of each group. Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders with enhanced economic capacity typically focus on asset accumulation and investing. Independent and plasma smallholders prioritize meeting fundamental infrastructure requirements and alleviating debt, highlighting disparities in welfare and economic capacity among the three smallholder categories.
The strategic disparities illustrate differences in resource accessibility, institutional affiliations, and risk management inclinations among the groups. Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders with greater capital typically adopt long-term investment strategies, whereas independent smallholders exhibit greater flexibility in business diversification, and plasma smallholders are more constrained by partnership models with corporations. The statistical significance across all measured livelihood strategy dimensions—initial planting financing, cultivation management, labor utilization, daily expense management, and income allocation during price increases—confirms that these three smallholder typologies operate within fundamentally different livelihood systems. Each group has developed adaptive strategies that reflect their institutional embeddedness, with ex-PIR transmigrants demonstrating financial resilience and long-term planning, independent smallholders showing entrepreneurial flexibility and diversification capacity, and plasma smallholders exhibiting institutional dependence balanced with creative survival mechanisms.
3.3. Economic Outcomes and Welfare of Smallholder Households The livelihood outcomes of the three groups of oil palm smallholders in Budong-Budong District exhibit considerable disparities across different income sources. Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders exhibit a rather high and equitable income distribution, averaging IDR 186,200,000/month (Table 19). Fifty percent of the total ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders earn an income ranging from IDR 4 to 8 million per month, indicating a solid middle-income status. Additionally, certain groups achieve elevated incomes, with 16.7% of smallholders earning IDR 8–12 million/month and 3.3% exceeding an income of IDR 12 million per month. A mere 3.3% obtain between IDR 1–4 million/month.
This benefit is bolstered by substantial land ownership, with 50% possessing 1–2 hectares of oil palm land and some exceeding 4 hectares. Furthermore, they possess greater knowledge in administering oil palm estates due to their involvement in the transmigration program. They also implement land management efficiency by converting all land, including yards, into oil palm plantations.
This elevated income distribution is also evident in their capacity to save, as 60% of ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders own savings above IDR 20 million. This indicates that their wage level is adequate not only to satisfy daily necessities but also to facilitate the accumulation of financial assets. This income pattern indicates a superior level of welfare relative to other smallholder groups, as evidenced by their capacity to possess permanent housing (60%) and ownership of motorbikes and automobiles (73.3%).
Independent smallholders exhibit more varied income patterns across oil palm and non-oil palm yields, averaging IDR 141,264,000/month (Table 19). In the oil palm plantation industry, 36.7% of independent smallholders generate a monthly income of IDR 1–4 million, indicating that the majority belong to lower-middle income brackets within this sector. Simultaneously, 6.7% obtain an income of IDR 4–8 million and IDR 8–12 million, signifying that a limited fraction attains upper-middle income levels from oil palm.
This pattern illustrates the distinct traits of independent smallholders that cultivate non-oil palm land for diverse commodities. With an average non-oil palm land ownership of 1–2 hectares, they effectively generate substantial supplementary revenue sources. This technique enhances economic resilience amid fluctuations in oil palm prices and enables the optimization of land for diverse economically valuable crops. The significant income variation among independent smallholders reflects their adaptive capacity to diversify income sources, positioning them in an intermediate economic status between the capital-rich ex-PIR transmigrants and the institutionally constrained plasma smallholders.
Plasma smallholders earn less from the oil palm sector than the other two smallholder types, averaging IDR 11,840,000 month. Approximately 40% of plasma smallholders generate a monthly revenue of IDR 1–4 million from oil palm production, while hardly 3.3% attain an income of IDR 4–8 million. No plasma smallholders receive oil palm income greater than IDR 8 million monthly. The diminished income from oil palm is associated with a restricted land area, which spans only 0.5 to 2 hectares in collaboration with PT. WKSM.
Notably, their income diversification technique via non-oil palm plantations (Table 20) indicates that 23.3% of independent smallholders may produce supplementary income ranging from IDR 1 to 4 million from products including corn, bananas, coconuts, and cocoa. Furthermore, 6.7% of smallholders achieve an additional IDR 4–8 million, while 3.3% attain an additional IDR 8–12 million from the non-oil palm industry. This diversification method seems to be their adaptability as indigenous inhabitants who recognize the significance of not depending just on a single commodity.
To offset the diminished revenue from oil palm, plasma smallholders cultivate alternative income sources from non-oil palm plants. Up to 33.3% of them earn an income of IDR 4–8 million from this industry, while 13.3% attain an income of IDR 8–12 million. Diversifying into non-oil palm crops like corn, bananas, and oranges enhances overall household income. Notably, revenue from the non-oil palm sector surpasses that from oil palm, indicating the effectiveness of their crop diversification policy, as illustrated in Table 10.
Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders exhibit superior diversification in income from alternative sources, including entrepreneurship and micro-businesses. Approximately 6.7% earn IDR 1–4 million, 10% earn IDR 4–8 million, 6.7% earn IDR 8–12 million, and 3.3% earn in excess of IDR 12 million from this industry. Independent smallholders generate only 16.7% of their income from entrepreneurship or micro-businesses, while a mere 3.3% of mainstream smallholders derive revenue from this industry.
Nonetheless, regarding revenue from alternative sources like entrepreneurship or micro-businesses, the involvement of plasma smallholders is markedly restricted, indicating their constraints in accessing or establishing enterprises beyond agriculture. This pattern suggests a substantial reliance on the agriculture industry, encompassing both oil palm and non-oil palm, as the primary source of income for most smallholders’ households.
The comprehensive analysis of livelihood assets, strategies, and outcomes reveals that the three oil palm smallholder typologies in Budong-Budong District operate within fundamentally different socio-economic systems. This confirms that these groups have developed distinct livelihood trajectories shaped by their historical origins, institutional frameworks, and resource access patterns.
These systematic differences extend beyond individual farmer capabilities to reflect the underlying institutional architectures that shape smallholder development pathways. Ex-PIR transmigrants benefit from government-facilitated infrastructure, standardized land allocation, and historical access to technical support, enabling capital accumulation and risk management through savings. Independent smallholders leverage indigenous knowledge systems and flexible land use strategies to maintain economic autonomy while pursuing diversified income streams. Plasma smallholders operate within corporate-mediated frameworks that provide technical support and market access but constrain land ownership and limit autonomous decision-making capacity.
The statistical significance of these differences across assets, strategies, and outcomes confirms that sustainable oil palm smallholder development requires typology-specific interventions rather than universal approaches. Policy frameworks must recognize that each group’s livelihood system reflects distinct adaptive strategies developed in response to different historical, institutional, and environmental contexts. The economic prosperity of smallholder households depends not solely on individual agricultural productivity but fundamentally on the institutional arrangements and resource access patterns that enable or constrain their capacity to build resilient, diversified livelihood systems within their specific socio-economic contexts.
4. Discussion 4.1. Livelihood Capital Differences in ownership and access to livelihood capital among the three groups of oil palm smallholders demonstrate distinct patterns based on historical and structural contexts. Disparities in natural and physical capital ownership among oil palm smallholder typologies are rooted in historical agrarian policies and structural developments. Through the sustainable livelihoods framework developed by Scoones [18,28], we can understand how the PIR transmigration program in the 1980s provided initial advantages to ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders through wider land allocation (averaging 3 hectares per household) and technical support from nucleus companies, creating what is referred to as path dependency in oil palm development [6,29]. Recent studies confirm that historical differences in land acquisition models continue to influence smallholder welfare trajectories to the present day [6,18,28,30]
Scoones [18,28] emphasized that sustainable livelihoods must be able to cope with and recover from stresses and shocks, maintain or enhance capabilities and assets, and provide sustainable livelihood opportunities for the next generation. This is reflected in the different land ownership patterns among the three groups. In line with Scoones, Chambers and Conway [16,18,28] defined livelihood as a combination of capabilities, assets, and activities required for means of living—a concept that helps explain why initial differences in land ownership create long-term effects on livelihood trajectories. This indicates that these initial conditions create path-dependent trajectories that are difficult to change even with progressive policy interventions [11,31,32,33].
Independent smallholders, who are predominantly indigenous residents, experience different processes in acquiring land through claims on public land, implementing what Chambers and Conway [16] identified as diversification strategies by cultivating non-oil palm crops such as corn, bananas, coconut, and cocoa. Scoones [18] categorized this strategy as a form of resilient livelihoods that reduces vulnerability to single commodity market fluctuations. Meanwhile, plasma smallholders, who are newcomers, are compelled to accept restrictive partnership terms with PT WKSM, creating what Chambers and Conway [16] described as structural dependency, which limits their autonomy and adaptive capacity. Contemporary partnership models often generate new structural dependencies that reinforce power inequalities in the oil palm value chain [9,12,30,31,32,33].
These divergent historical pathways have created structural stratification in productive asset ownership that directly impacts the capacity for physical capital accumulation [31,34]. Within Scoones’ [18] framework, the higher vehicle ownership among ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders represents an example of productive bricolage—the ability to combine various productive assets to create broader livelihood opportunities. This confirms that initial differences in productive asset ownership influence households’ ability to accumulate additional capital, creating what is termed as cumulative advantage in social stratification theory [6,35,36].
Housing conditions of better quality reflect what Chambers and Conway [16] referred to as productive assets, namely resources that can help households improve their welfare. Conversely, the prevalence of non-permanent houses among plasma smallholders and limited vehicle ownership indicates serious asset constraints. This situation creates what is known as an asset-based poverty trap, a condition where households lack sufficient basic assets needed to escape poverty and improve their standard of living [18,37]. In other words, due to minimal assets—such as adequate housing, vehicles, or business capital—these households are trapped in stagnant economic conditions and unable to reach the starting point needed to begin upward economic mobility [18,37,38].
The role of institutions, particularly government and partner companies, not only shapes opportunities for access to livelihood capital but also creates structures of long-term dependency for farmers. The PIR transmigration program, although successful in improving the welfare of ex-transmigrants initially, indirectly limited their economic flexibility by encouraging single specialization in oil palm commodities. This has made ex-PIR smallholders more vulnerable to global price fluctuations. Meanwhile, the plasma partnership scheme exhibits a pattern of captive value chain, where partner companies control access to inputs, outputs, and prices, thus reducing plasma smallholders autonomy in determining adaptation strategies. This inequality reinforces dependency traps that hinder livelihood diversification and weaken farmers’ long-term adaptive capacity. Therefore, institutional interventions that are more transformative and strengthen farmer autonomy are needed to improve the sustainability of livelihood systems in this region.
Socio-cultural factors play a crucial role in shaping differences in social and human capital. The strong social capital of ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders, evidenced by their full participation in communal work (gotong royong) and farmer groups, is inseparable from their Javanese cultural background that emphasizes collectivism. In Scoones’ [18] typology, this represents an example of bonding social capital that can facilitate collective action and risk sharing. Previous studies have also demonstrated that ethnicity-based social networks remain important determinants in accessing resources and information in oil palm plantation areas [39,40].
Meanwhile, plasma smallholders with Mandar ethnic backgrounds and their Siwalli Parri tradition demonstrate different patterns of social participation, which according to Chambers and Conway [16] can function as social safety nets in different contexts. Woolcock and Narayan [41] explained that variations in the type and intensity of social capital influence access to information, resources, and negotiating power within formal institutions—an analysis that reinforces Scoones’ [18,28] framework regarding the importance of social capital in shaping collective capabilities. This confirms that social capital remains a key mediating variable that determines the ability of farmer households to access economic opportunities and navigate relationships with institutional actors [15,42,43].
Differences in human capital, such as ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders having university education compared to plasma smallholders, reflect what Chambers and Conway [16] identified as capability inequalities that affect households’ ability to access better livelihood opportunities. However, plasma smallholders demonstrate the highest participation in technical training for maintenance and fire management, indicating what Nonaka and Takeuchi [44] described as structured tacit knowledge transfer. Scoones [18] emphasized that both formal knowledge and tacit knowledge play important roles in shaping adaptive capability—the ability to respond to changes and uncertainties in livelihood contexts [18,44]. This indicates that technical training programs do improve productivity, but without enhancement of managerial capacity and market access, plasma smallholders remain vulnerable to structural dependency on partner companies [6,45,46].
Significant differences in financial capital reflect power relationship dynamics in the oil palm value chain. The higher savings capacity of ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders compared to plasma smallholders without savings reflects what Bowles et al. [47] identified as persistent inequality. Within Scoones’ [18] framework, this phenomenon exemplifies traps and thresholds—dynamics that create different patterns of asset accumulation among different livelihood groups. He emphasized that the ability to save and invest is an important component of livelihood security—the capacity to face shocks and stress without sacrificing long-term livelihoods [18,28]. Disparities in saving ability widen over time, confirming the existence of diverging trajectories in wealth accumulation among different oil palm farmer typologies [38,48].
This inequality is reinforced by unequal access to formal credit and market opportunities, with ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders having more diverse business networks, while plasma smallholders are limited to cooperative membership. This demonstrates that different models of integration into value chains create patterns of asymmetric dependency—ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders have greater autonomy in production and marketing decisions, while plasma smallholders are trapped in captive value chain relationships [11,49]. Recent studies have confirmed the persistence of captive governance structures in relationships between plasma smallholders and nucleus companies, which limit farmers’ ability to accumulate economic surplus and transform their position within the value chain [50,51,52].
Within Scoones’ [18] framework, these differences illustrate how varying combinations of capabilities, assets, and activities create different livelihood pathways—trajectories shaped by complex interactions between historical, institutional, and socio-ecological contexts. Chambers and Conway [16] emphasized that sustainable livelihoods depend not only on asset accumulation but also on capabilities to adapt, transform, and reproduce these assets in continuously changing contexts.
This comparative analysis thus demonstrates how PIR transmigration programs and plasma partnership models have created a structuration of livelihoods—patterns that are simultaneously shaped by and shape the broader socio-economic structures in the oil palm plantation areas of Central Mamuju.
4.2. Livelihood Strategy The different livelihood strategies exhibited by the three groups of oil palm smallholders in Central Mamuju have demonstrated forms of interaction between resource access, capabilities, and institutional contexts. In the initial planting phase, ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders showed advantages in accessing OPPFMA funds, reflecting what Chambers and Conway [16] described as institutional capability—the ability to navigate formal systems and utilize government programs. When facing price declines, the consolidation strategy of ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders through the use of savings and input reduction aligns with Scoones’ [18] thinking that resource consolidation aims to maintain the asset base during crises. However, Bebbington [53] cautioned that prolonged use of liquid assets without adequate diversification can create a vulnerability trap—a condition where short-term resilience is achieved at the expense of long-term sustainability [53,54,55]. Previous studies have documented that farmers with larger savings are indeed more resilient in facing short-term price shocks but remain vulnerable to prolonged crises without adequate diversification strategies [17,56,57,58].
Independent smallholders demonstrate what Scoones [18] categorized as adaptive diversification by shifting to non-oil palm enterprises when prices decline [18,59]. Such diversification can function as a buffer against shocks and create more resilient livelihood pathways [17,34]. However, without productive investment support in non-agricultural activities, this diversification remains defensive in nature [18,55,59,60,61]. Meanwhile, plasma smallholders with high dependency on corporate partnerships and limited coping strategies (working as farm laborers) exhibit what Chambers and Conway [16] identified as dependent security—a livelihood model that sacrifices adaptive autonomy for short-term security. This phenomenon was further explained by McCarthy [9] in his study of oil palm partnership schemes in Indonesia and Li [11] critiquing the power relationship inequalities in plantation expansion.
The responses to increased oil palm prices further clarify differences in long-term strategies. The accumulation strategy of ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders through savings and vehicle investment reflects what Scoones [18] referred to as productive reinvestment—a strategy that strengthens the asset base for future livelihoods. In contrast, the focus of independent smallholders and plasma smallholders on house renovation demonstrates what Chambers and Conway [16] identified as consumptive investment—improving quality of life without significantly strengthening productive capacity. This pattern, especially for plasma smallholders, may reinforce choices that prioritize short-term security at the expense of long-term adaptive flexibility [59,62,63,64].
This livelihood analysis confirms the arguments of Scoones [18] and Chambers and Conway [16] that livelihood sustainability depends not only on asset accumulation but also on the development of adaptive and transformative capabilities. The three farmer groups demonstrate path-dependent adaptations—adaptive strategies constrained by historical decisions and structural positions within the political ecology of oil palm plantations. As emphasized by Chambers and Conway [16], truly sustainable livelihoods require a balance between short-term resilience and long-term transformation—a balance that appears not yet fully achieved by the three farmer groups in Central Mamuju. These adaptation patterns necessitate policy interventions that focus not only on income stabilization but also on developing adaptive capabilities and transformative diversification appropriate to the specific context of each farmer group.
4.3. Livelihood Outcomes Livelihood outcomes of the three oil palm smallholder typologies in Central Mamuju reflect differentiated livelihood outcomes formed through complex interactions between asset access, capabilities, and opportunity structures. Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders with higher incomes illustrate sustainable livelihood—a condition where households are able to maintain or improve living standards without compromising their resource base [16]. This advantage can be termed a virtuous cycle of accumulation where larger land ownership facilitates economies of scale in oil palm cultivation [18,59], while experiential capital—long experience in oil palm cultivation—enhances production efficiency. Investment in children’s education reflects intergenerational sustainability—the capacity to transmit welfare and capabilities across generations. However, dependence on oil palm monoculture creates specialized vulnerability—vulnerability to single commodity shocks that may threaten long-term resilience [59,65,66].
Independent smallholders with more diverse income patterns demonstrate adaptive diversification—an adaptive response to market and ecological uncertainties [18]. Chambers and Conway [16] underscored that such diversification provides buffers against shocks and creates greater resilience to external disturbances. The strategic choice to maintain non-oil palm crops reflects a risk-hedging livelihood portfolio—a strategy that prioritizes security above profit maximization [18]. The use of additional income for house renovation among independent smallholders indicates a dimension of social sustainability—the capacity to maintain and enhance assets that contribute to social status and inclusivity [53].
Plasma smallholders with limited income from oil palm illustrate constrained livelihoods—livelihoods restricted by structural inequalities in access to resources and markets [18]. Chambers and Conway [16] explained that such inequalities create a vulnerability context that limits adaptive capacity. The asymmetrical plasma partnership model creates adverse incorporation—integration into markets on unfavorable terms [9]. However, the ability of 33.3% of plasma smallholders to generate income of IDR 4–8 million from non-oil palm sectors demonstrates capabilities in action—the capacity to develop alternative strategies amid structural constraints. The absence of higher education among plasma smallholders children illustrates what Scoones [18] described as an intergenerational capability trap—systemic barriers in capability development that persist across generations.
Variation in these non-monetary dimensions of well-being affirms the arguments of Scoones [18] and Chambers and Conway [16] that livelihood outcomes must be understood beyond income indicators, encompassing aspects of social justice, ecological sustainability, and capability development. As emphasized by Chambers and Conway [16], truly sustainable livelihoods require a balance between improving the living standards of the current generation and maintaining the capabilities of future generations—a balance not yet fully achieved by the three farmer groups in Central Mamuju. These findings underscore the need for policy approaches that are context-specific and differentiated in order to address structural barriers and strengthen pathways toward more sustainable and equitable livelihood outcomes.
This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the purposive sampling approach limits the statistical generalizability of findings beyond the studied communities in the Central Mamuju Regency. Second, reliance on self-reported data may introduce recall bias, particularly regarding income and asset information. Third, ex-ternal factors such as macro-economic policies, climate change impacts, and global market dynamics were not systematically analyzed, which may influence livelihood outcomes.
5. Conclusions This research reveals significant differences in livelihood assets, strategies, and outcomes among ex-PIR transmigrant, independent, and plasma oil palm smallholders in the Central Mamuju Regency, based on purposive sampling within the research area. Ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders demonstrate stronger physical, financial, and social capital, achieving higher income and welfare indicators. Independent smallholders, though possessing intermediate resources, benefit from diversified income strategies that enhance their resilience. Plasma smallholders face the greatest structural limitations in terms of assets and autonomy, resulting in lower incomes and higher vulnerability. Given the non-probabilistic sampling design, these findings should be interpreted as illustrative of livelihood dynamics in the studied communities, without claims of statistical generalization to broader populations. The results emphasize heterogeneity among smallholder groups and stress the need for more differentiated development approaches.
Policy interventions must recognize the institutionally embedded nature of these livelihood differences and develop typology-specific approaches. For ex-PIR transmigrant smallholders, policies should focus on supporting livelihood diversification beyond oil palm to reduce dependency risks while leveraging their existing financial capital for sustainable investments. Independent smallholders would benefit from improved access to financial services and technical assistance to expand and enhance their diversified agricultural enterprises, building on their demonstrated capacity for crop diversification. Plasma smallholders urgently need empowerment strategies that increase their autonomy, including renegotiation of partnership terms, land tenure security, access to independent markets, and capacity development programs that address their limited land ownership and financial constraints. Concrete actions could include facilitating access to affordable replanting funds across all smallholder groups; developing targeted capacity-building programs focusing on business skills, digital technology use, and cooperative management; promoting inclusive cooperative models that increase bargaining power for plasma smallholders; and strengthening social safety nets and risk management tools for vulnerable groups.
Future research should expand geographical coverage to verify observed patterns across various oil palm landscapes. Furthermore, exploring the role of technology adoption, gender dynamics, and intergenerational knowledge transfer would provide richer insights into factors shaping smallholder resilience. Investigating the implications of climate change on livelihood strategies also remains essential for supporting long-term sustainability in the palm oil sector.
This research contributes by providing empirical evidence with statistical validation of how differences in access to livelihood capital and institutional arrangements shape diverse pathways of resilience or vulnerability among smallholder groups. The demonstrated statistical significance across multiple livelihood dimensions (assets, strategies, and outcomes) establishes a robust empirical foundation for understanding smallholder heterogeneity, providing important lessons for designing more inclusive and sustainable smallholder development policies that recognize the institutionally differentiated nature of smallholder livelihood systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for personalized learning path generation by integrating deep knowledge tracing and cognitive load estimation within a unified framework. We propose a dual-stream neural network architecture that simultaneously models students’ knowledge states and cognitive load levels to optimize learning trajectories. The knowledge state tracking module employs a bidirectional Transformer with graph attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between knowledge components, while the cognitive load estimation module utilizes multimodal data analysis to dynamically assess mental effort during learning activities. A dual-objective optimization algorithm balances knowledge acquisition with cognitive load management to generate paths that maintain optimal challenge levels. Experimental evaluations across multiple educational domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy (87.5%), path quality (4.4/5), and learning efficiency (24.6% improvement). The implemented system supports real-time adaptation based on performance and cognitive state, resulting in reduced frustration, higher engagement, and improved knowledge retention. This research contributes to both theoretical understanding of learning processes and practical implementation of next-generation adaptive educational technologies.

Full text: Introduction
Personalized learning has emerged as a critical paradigm in educational technology, aiming to tailor instructional content and learning paths to individual students’ needs, abilities, and preferences. In traditional classroom settings, educators often struggle to accommodate the diverse learning profiles of multiple students simultaneously, resulting in suboptimal learning outcomes for many learners 1 . The development of adaptive learning systems has shown promising results in addressing this challenge by providing customized educational experiences that can significantly improve learning efficiency and effectiveness 2 .
Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) represents a significant advancement in modeling students’ knowledge states and learning processes over time. Unlike traditional knowledge tracing methods, DKT employs deep neural networks to capture complex patterns and dependencies in students’ interaction data, enabling more accurate prediction of their performance on future tasks 3 . These models can effectively map the dynamic nature of knowledge acquisition and retention, providing a solid foundation for intelligent tutoring systems 4 . However, most existing DKT models primarily focus on performance prediction without sufficient consideration of the cognitive processes underlying learning.
Cognitive Load Estimation (CLE), on the other hand, aims to quantify the mental effort involved in learning tasks. Based on Cognitive Load Theory, which posits that learning is optimized when instructional design aligns with human cognitive architecture, CLE provides valuable insights into students’ cognitive states during learning activities 5 . Recent advances in multimodal sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms have enabled more precise estimation of cognitive load using physiological signals, behavioral patterns, and performance metrics 6 . This information can help identify potential cognitive overload situations that might impede learning progress.
The integration of DKT and CLE represents an innovative approach to personalized learning that addresses both knowledge acquisition and cognitive processing dimensions. While DKT models can track what students know, CLE can reveal how much mental effort they exert when applying that knowledge 7 . This comprehensive view enables the creation of learning paths that are optimally challenging—difficult enough to promote growth but not so demanding as to cause frustration or cognitive overload.
Despite the clear complementarity between these approaches, research on their combined application remains limited. Current adaptive learning systems primarily focus on knowledge state modeling without adequately incorporating cognitive factors, resulting in learning paths that may be knowledge-optimal but cognitively inappropriate 8,9 . This research gap is particularly significant as cognitive overload is a common cause of disengagement and frustration in digital learning environments. Existing DKT models lack mechanisms to detect when content becomes overly demanding, while CLE approaches are rarely integrated with knowledge modeling frameworks. Our work addresses this critical gap by developing a unified computational framework that simultaneously optimizes for both knowledge acquisition and cognitive load management.
This paper presents a novel framework for generating personalized learning paths based on the synergistic integration of DKT and CLE. Our approach employs advanced neural network architectures to simultaneously track knowledge states and estimate cognitive load, using this dual information to dynamically adjust content difficulty, presentation format, and instructional support. The specific objectives of this research include: (1) developing a unified neural network model that can perform both knowledge tracing and cognitive load estimation; (2) designing algorithms for optimal learning path generation that balance knowledge growth and cognitive load management; and (3) implementing and evaluating a prototype system in realistic educational settings 10 .
The main contributions of this work include: a dual-purpose neural architecture that extends traditional DKT models to incorporate cognitive load estimation; a path generation algorithm that optimizes the learning trajectory based on both knowledge state and cognitive capacity; and empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to conventional adaptive learning systems. By bridging the gap between knowledge modeling and cognitive processing, this research offers a more holistic approach to personalized learning that can potentially enhance both learning outcomes and experiences.

Deep knowledge tracing model research
Knowledge tracing, the task of modeling students’ knowledge state based on their learning interactions, has evolved significantly with the advent of deep learning techniques. The earliest influential model, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), proposed by Corbett and Anderson, uses a Hidden Markov Model to represent a student’s knowledge as a binary state (known/unknown) for each skill or concept 11 . The probability of a student’s knowledge state can be updated using the following equation:
Where represents the knowledge state at time t, and represents the observation of the student’s performance.
While BKT provided a principled approach to knowledge modeling, it struggled with capturing complex skill dependencies and required manual skill tagging 12 . The introduction of Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) by Piech et al. marked a paradigm shift by leveraging recurrent neural networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to model the temporal dynamics of student knowledge 3 . DKT represents a student’s knowledge state as a high-dimensional continuous vector , which is updated after each interaction:
Where is the input exercise, represents the predicted performance, and is the sigmoid activation function.
Table 1 presents a comparative analysis of major knowledge tracing models, highlighting their distinctive features and limitations.

Building upon DKT, the Dynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN) introduced by Zhang et al. incorporated an external memory structure to explicitly represent the relationship between exercises and knowledge concepts 13 . DKVMN uses a key-value memory mechanism where the key matrix stores concept representations and the value matrix stores student knowledge states:
Where is the read content from memory, is the query vector derived from the input exercise, and is the key memory matrix.
More recent advancements include Graph-based Knowledge Tracing (GKT), which explicitly models the prerequisite structure between knowledge concepts using graph neural networks 14 , and Attention-based Knowledge Tracing (AKT), which employs transformer architectures to capture long-range dependencies and forgetting mechanisms in student learning trajectories 15 . These models have progressively improved prediction accuracy and provided richer representations of student knowledge.
Despite these advancements, existing knowledge tracing models primarily focus on performance prediction rather than generating optimal learning paths 16 . Most models fail to incorporate cognitive factors that influence learning efficiency, such as cognitive load, attention, and motivational states. Furthermore, the black-box nature of many deep learning models limits their practical application in educational settings where interpretability is crucial for teacher and student acceptance. Future knowledge tracing systems need to integrate cognitive science principles and provide explainable recommendations to effectively support personalized learning path generation.
Cognitive load theory and estimation methods
Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), introduced by Sweller, provides a framework for understanding how cognitive resources are allocated during learning activities 17 . The theory distinguishes between three types of cognitive load: intrinsic load (inherent complexity of the material), extraneous load (imposed by instructional design), and germane load (relevant to schema construction and automation). The total cognitive load experienced by a learner can be represented as:
Accurate estimation of cognitive load is crucial for adaptive learning systems to provide appropriate learning materials that maximize efficiency without overwhelming learners 18 . Traditional methods rely on subjective measures such as self-reporting questionnaires (e.g., NASA-TLX, Paas Scale), which while easy to implement, suffer from limitations including interruption of the learning process and potential reporting biases.
Table 2 presents a comparison of various cognitive load estimation approaches, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations in educational contexts.

Recent advances in physiological signal processing have enabled more objective and continuous estimation of cognitive load 19 . Electroencephalography (EEG) signals, particularly frontal theta and parietal alpha band power, correlate strongly with cognitive load levels and can be modeled as:
Where α and β are calibration parameters determined through regression analysis.
Behavioral metrics provide a less intrusive alternative, with eye tracking emerging as a particularly promising approach 20 . Metrics such as pupil dilation, fixation duration, and saccade patterns can be integrated into multimodal estimation models. Machine learning algorithms can fuse these multimodal data sources using ensemble approaches:
Where represents individual estimation methods and represents their respective weights determined through training data.
Despite significant progress, current cognitive load estimation techniques face several challenges 21 . First, individual differences in cognitive capacity and processing styles necessitate personalized calibration. Second, the relationship between cognitive load indicators and actual mental effort varies across different learning domains and tasks. Third, real-time estimation in authentic educational settings requires balancing accuracy with computational efficiency 22 . Future research opportunities lie in developing adaptive fusion algorithms that can automatically select the most appropriate estimation methods based on contextual factors and available sensors, as well as in exploring the temporal dynamics of cognitive load throughout complex learning activities.
Personalized learning path generation technologies
Personalized learning path generation aims to dynamically sequence instructional content based on individual learner characteristics, creating optimal trajectories through knowledge domains that maximize learning outcomes 23 . The theoretical foundations of this field draw from Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development, adaptive learning theories, and computational approaches to curriculum sequencing. Early implementations relied primarily on rule-based systems that used predefined instructional design principles and expert knowledge to determine appropriate content sequences 24 . While straightforward to implement, these systems lacked flexibility to adapt to diverse learning patterns and complex knowledge structures.
Collaborative filtering approaches, borrowed from recommendation systems, emerged as a data-driven alternative that leverages the collective experience of learners to identify optimal paths 25 .
Recent advancements in learning path generation include multigranularity approaches that decompose knowledge into hierarchical structures for more flexible path creation 26 , and unified frameworks that integrate multiple data sources and personalization techniques to provide context-aware recommendations 27 . These methods extend traditional path generation by considering both domain knowledge structure and individual learner characteristics across multiple granularity levels.
These methods typically calculate similarity between learners using various distance metrics and recommend content based on the experiences of similar peers:
Where represents the similarity between learners u and v, is the rating (or performance) of learner u on item i, and is the set of items both learners have interacted with.
Knowledge graph-based approaches represent a significant advancement by explicitly modeling domain knowledge structure, including concepts, relationships, and dependencies 28 . These approaches typically formulate learning path generation as a graph traversal problem, where nodes represent knowledge units and edges represent prerequisite or relevance relationships. The optimal path can be determined using algorithms that balance learning objectives with constraints:
Where is the set of all possible paths from start node s to target node t, is the weight of the edge between nodes u and v, and is a function that evaluates the appropriateness of transitioning from knowledge state to concept .
More recently, reinforcement learning has been applied to learn optimal sequencing policies directly from interaction data 29 . These approaches frame learning path generation as a Markov Decision Process where states represent learner knowledge profiles, actions correspond to content selection, and rewards are derived from learning outcomes. This formulation enables systems to adapt to individual learning patterns and optimize for long-term knowledge gains rather than immediate performance.
Despite these advancements, most existing approaches focus predominantly on knowledge acquisition without adequately considering cognitive factors that influence learning efficiency 8 . The integration of knowledge tracing with cognitive load estimation represents an emerging research direction with significant potential 9 . Initial studies have demonstrated that incorporating cognitive load measures into content sequencing algorithms can lead to more efficient learning paths by balancing challenge with cognitive capacity. These integrated approaches typically employ multimodal data fusion to simultaneously track knowledge states and cognitive load, using combined metrics to guide content selection and pacing.
Significant challenges remain in developing robust personalized learning path generation systems that effectively balance knowledge acquisition goals with cognitive processing constraints. Future research directions include developing more sophisticated neural architectures that can jointly model knowledge states and cognitive processes, incorporating motivational and emotional factors into path optimization, and designing explainable recommendation mechanisms that provide transparency to both learners and instructors.
Integrated neural network architecture for deep knowledge tracing and cognitive load estimation
To address the integration of knowledge tracing and cognitive load estimation, we propose a dual-stream neural network architecture as illustrated in Fig. 1. This architecture enables simultaneous tracking of knowledge states and cognitive load levels while allowing bidirectional information flow between the two processing streams.
[See PDF for image]
Fig. 1 The Dual-Stream Neural Network Architecture for Deep Knowledge Tracing and Cognitive Load Estimation.


The diagram illustrates the integrated architecture with: (A) Knowledge State Representation Stream processing learning interaction data through embedding, BiLSTM, and graph attention networks; (B) Cognitive Load Estimation Stream processing multimodal inputs (behavioral, performance, physiological) through modality-specific encoders and transformers; (C) Cross-stream information exchange mechanisms with gated attention; and (D) Joint output layer for integrated prediction of knowledge states and cognitive load levels.
Dual-stream neural network framework design
To effectively combine knowledge tracing and cognitive load estimation, we propose a novel dual-stream neural network architecture that processes learning interaction data and cognitive signals in parallel while enabling cross-stream information exchange. The proposed architecture consists of a Knowledge State Representation Stream (KSRS) and a Cognitive Load Estimation Stream (CLES) that operate concurrently but share information at strategic points 30 . This design enables the model to simultaneously track knowledge evolution and estimate cognitive load while allowing each stream to influence the other’s processing.
The KSRS extends traditional DKT architectures by incorporating a bidirectional LSTM network to capture temporal dependencies in both directions, which is particularly important for understanding how current learning interactions relate to both past and future knowledge states 31 . For a sequence of learning interactions , the knowledge state at time step is computed as:
where represents the knowledge state vector and is a context vector from the cognitive load stream that influences the knowledge state update.
In parallel, the CLES processes multimodal cognitive signals including physiological data (e.g., EEG, heart rate), behavioral metrics (e.g., response time, eye tracking), and performance indicators. These heterogeneous inputs are first processed through modality-specific encoders and then fused using a self-attention mechanism 32 . The cognitive load state at time is computed as:
where represents the concatenated and encoded multimodal inputs, and is a context vector from the knowledge stream.
The critical innovation in our architecture lies in the bidirectional information exchange mechanisms between the two streams. At each time step, we compute cross-stream context vectors using gated attention mechanisms that selectively filter information based on relevance 33 . The context vector from the cognitive load stream to the knowledge stream is computed as:
where is a similarity function, and is a gating parameter that controls information flow between streams based on the current learning context.
The final output layer integrates information from both streams to generate joint predictions for both knowledge mastery probabilities and cognitive load levels 34 . This integration enables more informed decision-making for learning path generation by considering both what a student knows and how much cognitive effort they are expending.
During training, we employ a multi-objective loss function that combines knowledge prediction accuracy and cognitive load estimation error:
where , , and are hyperparameters that control the relative importance of each objective.
The proposed dual-stream architecture offers several advantages over single-purpose models: it enables mutual enhancement between knowledge tracing and cognitive load estimation, provides richer representations for downstream learning path generation, and can be trained end-to-end on heterogeneous data sources 31 . Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated approach achieves higher accuracy in both knowledge prediction and cognitive load estimation compared to independent models, particularly in scenarios with limited training data.
Knowledge state tracking module
The knowledge state tracking module serves as the core component for modeling student learning trajectories across multiple concepts and skills. Our implementation extends traditional knowledge tracing approaches by incorporating contextual information from cognitive load estimations and explicitly modeling inter-concept relationships 35 . As shown in Table 3, the module consists of multiple processing layers that progressively transform raw interaction data into comprehensive knowledge state representations.

The input layer processes a sequence of student interactions represented as tuples where denotes the question or knowledge component being assessed at time , and indicates the correctness of the response. These discrete inputs are then transformed by the embedding layer into continuous vector representations:
where and are embedding matrices for questions and responses respectively, and represents concatenation 36 .
To capture temporal dependencies in learning sequences, we implement a bidirectional Transformer encoder that processes the embedded interaction sequence:
where is the sequence of embedded interactions, and is an attention mask that prevents attending to future interactions during training.
A key innovation in our approach is the incorporation of a graph attention network (GAT) that explicitly models relationships between knowledge components based on a predefined knowledge graph structure 37 . The attention weights between knowledge components and are computed as:
where is the hidden state representation for knowledge component , is a learnable weight matrix, is an attention vector, and represents the neighborhood of knowledge component in the knowledge graph.
The updated knowledge state representation for each component is then calculated as:
where represents a non-linear activation function such as ReLU.
For predicting future performance, we employ a multi-head prediction layer that generates separate probabilities for each knowledge component:
where represents the predicted probability of correctly answering a question related to knowledge component at time , and are learnable parameters specific to component 38 .
To integrate cognitive load information, we implement a gating mechanism that modulates the knowledge state update based on estimated cognitive load:
where is the cognitive load context vector, is the gate vector, and is the candidate update for the knowledge state.
Cognitive load dynamic estimation module
The cognitive load dynamic estimation module employs a multimodal approach to continuously monitor and assess students’ mental effort during learning activities. Unlike traditional retrospective measurement techniques, our approach integrates real-time data from multiple sources including interaction patterns, performance metrics, and optionally, physiological signals when available 39 . This multimodal architecture enables robust estimation across diverse learning environments while accommodating individual differences in cognitive load manifestation.
For feature extraction from learning behavior, we implement a hierarchical convolutional network that captures both local and global patterns in temporal interaction data. The network processes windowed sequences of student actions (e.g., mouse movements, keystrokes, page navigation, response times) and extracts behavioral signatures indicative of different cognitive load states. The feature extraction process for behavioral data can be represented as:
where represents the raw behavioral data matrix, are the convolutional network parameters, and is the extracted behavioral feature vector.
Temporal pattern analysis is critical for distinguishing between momentary fluctuations and sustained cognitive load states 40 . We employ a recurrent attention mechanism that focuses on significant temporal patterns while ignoring noise:
where is the hidden state at time , is the attention weight, and is the context vector summarizing the temporal sequence.
For cognitive load level classification, we employ an ordinal regression approach that preserves the inherent ordering of cognitive load states (underload, optimal load, overload) 41 . The probability of the cognitive load exceeding level is modeled as:
where and are learnable parameters for threshold , and is the sigmoid function.
A key innovation in our module is its adaptive calibration mechanism that adjusts estimation parameters based on individual differences and contextual factors 42 . The calibration function dynamically updates based on observed patterns:
where is the adaptation rate, is the calibration loss function, and is the calibration data.
To enhance explainability, we incorporate an attention visualization component that highlights the specific behavioral and temporal features contributing most significantly to the cognitive load estimation. This transparency not only facilitates instructor understanding of student cognitive states but also enables students to develop metacognitive awareness of their own learning processes. The explainable components include feature importance scores, temporal attention patterns, and cognitive load transition analyses that identify critical points where load levels change significantly during learning activities.
Implementation and evaluation of personalized learning path generation system
Learning path optimization algorithm
The generation of optimal learning paths requires balancing two potentially competing objectives: maximizing knowledge acquisition while maintaining appropriate cognitive load levels. We formulate this as a constrained dual-objective optimization problem within a dynamic decision framework 43 . Unlike conventional single-objective approaches that focus solely on knowledge gain, our algorithm explicitly models the trade-off between learning efficiency and cognitive sustainability.
The optimization problem can be formally defined as:
where represents the learning path policy, is a discount factor, and are weights balancing the two objectives, is the knowledge acquisition reward, and is the cognitive load balancing reward. The state encompasses both the current knowledge state vector and cognitive load level, while action corresponds to selecting the next learning activity.
The weights and are critical for balancing knowledge acquisition against cognitive load management. Rather than using static weights, we employ an adaptive weighting scheme that adjusts based on the learner’s current state:
where (set to 0.6 based on validation experiments) ensures minimum knowledge acquisition priority, and is a monotonically decreasing function of current knowledge state that prioritizes knowledge acquisition for novices while increasing focus on cognitive load management as expertise develops. This dynamic weighting was validated through a sensitivity analysis comparing fixed versus adaptive weights across different student profiles, showing 12% improved outcomes with adaptive weighting.
The knowledge acquisition reward function rewards improvements in knowledge state while accounting for the relevance to learning goals:
where represents the knowledge level for concept at time , and denotes the importance weight of concept relative to learning objectives.
The cognitive load balancing reward function is designed to keep cognitive load within the optimal learning zone, penalizing both cognitive underload and overload 44 :
where is the estimated cognitive load at time , is the individually calibrated optimal cognitive load level, and is a scaling parameter.
To ensure pedagogically sound learning paths, we incorporate multiple constraints into the optimization problem:
where denotes the time when concept is introduced, indicates that concept is a prerequisite for concept , and define the acceptable range of cognitive load, and is the minimum acceptable overall mastery level upon completion.
Given the computational complexity of exactly solving this constrained optimization problem, we implement an approximation algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with upper confidence bounds 45 :
where is the estimated value of taking action in state , is the number of times state has been visited, is the number of times action has been taken in state , and is an exploration parameter.
To enhance adaptability, we implement a dynamic path adjustment strategy that reevaluates and potentially revises the learning path after each learning activity 46 . The adaptation function uses observed performance and cognitive load readings to update the learner model:
where is the adaptation rate, is a loss function comparing predicted and actual outcomes, and represents the gradient with respect to policy parameters.
This adaptive approach enables the system to respond to unexpected learning outcomes, fluctuations in cognitive states, and evolving learner preferences. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our dual-objective optimization approach generates learning paths that not only increase knowledge acquisition rates by 18% compared to single-objective approaches but also maintain optimal cognitive engagement, resulting in higher learner satisfaction and reduced dropout rates in extended learning sessions.
System architecture and implementation
The proposed personalized learning system adopts a modular, microservice-based architecture that facilitates flexibility, scalability, and integration with existing educational technology ecosystems 47 . The system consists of five core components organized in a three-tier architecture (presentation, application, and data tiers) with bidirectional data flow and event-driven communication patterns. Table 4 provides detailed specifications of these functional modules, including their main functions and technical implementation. This design enables continuous optimization of learning paths based on real-time student interactions and cognitive state estimations.

The frontend interface implements a responsive design that adapts to various devices while maintaining consistent user experience 48 . The interface incorporates several key features: (1) a dynamic content presentation area that adapts based on the current learning activity and estimated cognitive state; (2) an interactive knowledge map visualization that illustrates progress across the domain and highlights relationships between concepts; (3) embedded formative assessment tools that gather performance data while minimizing learning disruption; and (4) subtle cognitive load indicators that provide metacognitive support without inducing additional extraneous load.
The backend processing logic is divided into synchronous request handling for immediate user interactions and asynchronous processing for computationally intensive operations such as model training and path optimization. The core processing workflow includes: (1) session initialization that establishes initial knowledge states and learning objectives; (2) activity selection based on the current optimization policy; (3) real-time performance and behavior monitoring during activity completion; (4) knowledge and cognitive state updates following activity completion; and (5) path recalculation triggered by significant state changes or scheduled intervals.
The database architecture employs a hybrid approach combining relational databases for structured educational content and student records with NoSQL document stores for behavioral telemetry and flexible schema requirements. Key data entities include: (1) a domain knowledge graph that represents concepts, skills, and their interdependencies; (2) a content repository containing learning activities tagged with metadata about knowledge components and difficulty levels; (3) learner profiles that store both static characteristics and dynamically updated knowledge and cognitive models; and (4) interaction logs that capture fine-grained temporal data about learning behaviors.
To support real-time path adjustment, the system implements an event streaming architecture using message queues and event processors that continuously analyze incoming data and trigger decision points 49 . This approach enables the system to detect and respond to significant events such as: (1) unexpected performance outcomes that suggest knowledge model inaccuracies; (2) cognitive load threshold violations indicating potential disengagement or frustration; (3) emergent learning patterns that suggest more efficient paths than previously calculated; and (4) explicit learner feedback or preference changes that necessitate strategy adjustments.
The integration of knowledge tracing and cognitive load monitoring within this architecture enables more nuanced personalization than conventional adaptive learning systems. By simultaneously optimizing for knowledge acquisition and cognitive engagement, the system can identify ideal learning opportunities that maintain appropriate challenge levels while maximizing long-term learning gains, resulting in more efficient and effective educational experiences.
Experimental design and results analysis
To evaluate the effectiveness of our integrated approach, we conducted comprehensive experiments using both simulated environments and real-world educational settings. The experimental design followed a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative performance metrics with qualitative assessments of learning experiences 50 . The primary research questions addressed were: (1) Does the dual-stream model outperform single-purpose models in knowledge tracing and cognitive load estimation? (2) Do learning paths generated by the proposed system improve learning outcomes compared to traditional and existing adaptive approaches? (3) What is the relationship between cognitive load optimization and learning efficiency?
For dataset construction, we collected data from three sources: (1) a large-scale programming education platform with 2,183 students completing 47,852 coding exercises over a 14-week semester; (2) a mathematics learning application with multimodal data including clickstreams, response times, and optional eye-tracking for 862 participants; and (3) a controlled laboratory experiment with 124 undergraduate students completing a series of learning activities while wearing EEG headsets to provide ground truth cognitive load measurements.
Participants in the laboratory experiment were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (using our DKT-CLE system, n  = 62) or one of the control groups (using baseline methods, n  = 62) using stratified randomization based on pre-test performance to ensure equivalent initial knowledge distributions. All participants interacted with identical learning content covering fundamental programming concepts, delivered through a standardized web interface. The only difference between conditions was the sequencing algorithm determining the order of presentation. Learning paths were delivered through a custom-built platform with path recommendations appearing as suggested “next topics” after each completed activity. To control for extraneous variables, all sessions occurred in the same laboratory environment with standardized hardware configurations, time allocations (120 min per session), and task instructions.
All data collection followed IRB-approved protocols (approval #IRB-2023-0427) with comprehensive informed consent procedures. For physiological data collection, participants received detailed explanations of EEG equipment usage, data collection purposes, and their right to withdraw at any time. Privacy protection measures included: (1) data pseudonymization through participant IDs unlinked to personal identifiers; (2) secure data storage on encrypted servers with access restricted to authorized researchers; (3) aggregated analysis that prevented individual identification; and (4) compliance with educational data privacy regulations (FERPA compliance for US participants). All identifiable information was removed prior to analysis, and participants were informed of all potential data uses including future research applications.
Performance evaluation employed multiple metrics targeting different aspects of the system. For knowledge tracing accuracy, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and root mean squared error (RMSE) between predicted and actual performance:
For cognitive load estimation, we calculated the correlation coefficient between estimated load levels and ground truth measurements from physiological sensors and validated questionnaires. Path quality evaluation employed a composite metric combining prerequisite satisfaction, content diversity, and progression smoothness:
Learning efficiency was quantified using a gain-per-time metric normalized by cognitive effort:
We compared our approach against five baseline methods: (1) a rule-based system following predefined curriculum sequences; (2) a collaborative filtering recommendation approach; (3) a knowledge graph navigation algorithm; (4) a standard DKT model with no cognitive load component; and (5) a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning system trained to maximize knowledge gain. Implementation details and hyperparameter settings for all methods were standardized to ensure fair comparison 51 .

As shown in Table 5; Fig. 2, our integrated approach consistently outperformed all baseline methods across multiple metrics. The performance improvements were particularly pronounced in the programming education dataset, where the complex skill relationships and varying cognitive demands of different programming concepts highlighted the advantages of our dual-objective optimization approach 52 . Statistical significance testing using paired t-tests confirmed that the improvements were significant at p  < 0.01 for all metrics.

(C) Representative learning trajectories showing knowledge state (solid line) and cognitive load (dashed line) over time for a participant using our DKT-CLE system versus baseline approach. (D) Cognitive load heatmap during different learning activities, demonstrating how our system maintains optimal challenge levels.
Qualitative analysis of generated learning paths revealed several distinctive characteristics of our approach: (1) more adaptive sequencing that responded to fluctuations in performance and engagement; (2) strategic insertion of review activities when cognitive overload was detected; (3) appropriate scaffolding through complementary content types; and (4) smoother difficulty progression that maintained optimal challenge levels. Expert evaluation by instructional designers rated our system-generated paths significantly higher in pedagogical soundness compared to baseline methods (4.4/5 vs. 3.5/5 average rating, p  < 0.01).
User experience evaluation through post-study surveys and interviews revealed high satisfaction levels (4.3/5) with our system, with participants specifically highlighting reduced frustration during challenging concepts and improved engagement during longer study sessions. Longitudinal analysis of learning outcomes showed that students using our system achieved mastery-level performance 24.6% faster than those following traditional curriculum sequences while reporting lower average stress levels 53 .
Analysis of log data revealed interesting patterns in the relationship between cognitive load management and learning outcomes. Students who experienced primarily optimal cognitive load states (neither underloaded nor overloaded) showed significantly higher retention in post-tests administered two weeks after the learning period. Furthermore, the system’s ability to detect and respond to early signs of confusion or frustration resulted in 43% fewer abandoned learning sessions compared to non-adaptive approaches.
One particularly valuable finding was the identification of personalized “learning sweet spots” for individual students – optimal ranges of cognitive challenge that maximized both immediate performance and long-term retention. These individual profiles enabled increasingly refined path recommendations as students progressed through the curriculum, demonstrating the system’s capacity for continuous adaptation and personalization.
Conclusion
This study presents a novel approach to personalized learning path generation that integrates deep knowledge tracing with cognitive load estimation through a dual-stream neural network architecture. Our research makes several significant contributions to the field of adaptive educational technology. First, the proposed dual-stream architecture effectively combines knowledge state tracking and cognitive load estimation within a unified computational framework, enabling more comprehensive student modeling than previous approaches. Second, the dual-objective optimization algorithm balances knowledge acquisition with cognitive load management, resulting in learning paths that are both pedagogically sound and cognitively appropriate. Third, the implemented system demonstrates the feasibility of real-time adaptation based on both performance data and cognitive state estimates in authentic educational environments 54 .
Experimental results across multiple educational domains and diverse student populations confirm the effectiveness of our approach. The integrated system consistently outperformed baseline methods in knowledge prediction accuracy (87.5% vs. 83.7% for the best baseline), path quality assessment (4.4/5 vs. 3.9/5), and learning efficiency improvement (24.6% vs. 18.2%). These quantitative improvements were reinforced by qualitative findings indicating higher student engagement, lower frustration levels, and improved retention of learned material. Particularly noteworthy was the system’s ability to identify and adapt to individual “learning sweet spots” – optimal ranges of cognitive challenge that maximized both immediate performance and long-term retention 55 .
Despite these promising results, several limitations warrant acknowledgment. First, the accuracy of cognitive load estimation remains challenging in naturalistic learning environments without specialized sensors. While our approach makes significant strides in inferring cognitive states from behavioral patterns, integration with unobtrusive physiological monitoring could further enhance estimation precision.
Second, the current implementation primarily focuses on cognitive aspects of learning without explicitly modeling other critical individual characteristics such as learning styles, preferences, emotional states, and self-regulation capabilities. These factors significantly influence learning effectiveness and engagement but are not captured in our current framework. The personalization approach we present, while advanced in cognitive modeling, represents only a partial solution to fully adaptive learning environments that would ideally account for these multidimensional learner characteristics.
Third, the computational complexity of the dual-objective optimization presents scalability challenges for very large knowledge domains or real-time applications with stringent latency requirements 56 .
Future research directions should address these limitations while extending the capabilities of the integrated approach. One promising avenue involves developing more sophisticated models of multidimensional cognitive load that distinguish between intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load components, enabling more targeted instructional interventions. Additionally, incorporating emotional state detection and motivational dynamics could provide a more holistic understanding of learning processes. Exploring transfer learning techniques may enhance model generalizability across domains and reduce the data requirements for new applications. Finally, investigating explainable AI approaches could improve transparency and trust in system recommendations, facilitating wider adoption by educators and learners 57 .
The theoretical contributions of this work include advancing our understanding of the relationship between knowledge acquisition processes and cognitive resource allocation during learning. From a practical perspective, the demonstrated system provides a blueprint for next-generation adaptive learning technologies that consider both what students know and how they process information. As educational systems increasingly embrace personalization, approaches that balance cognitive science principles with advanced computational techniques will be essential for creating learning environments that are both effective and sustainable 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63–64 .

Abstract: Technology plays an integral role in the fabric of everyday family life, supporting communication, child development, health, entertainment, and learning. Yet, designing interactive systems that are both meaningful and widely adopted (and genuinely embraced) by families remains a complex and evolving challenge. In fields like Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), there is a growing recognition of the need for more holistic and contextually grounded understandings of family life—ones that reflect the complexity of group interaction and diversity of family dynamics and domestic environments. My research seeks to address this gap through a family-centered lens, exploring how domestic technologies can be more thoughtfully designed to support the everyday social, health-related, and educational goals families encounter. My dissertation examines the context of family-food interactions as a key factor for understanding and designing everyday family technologies. First, I explore family meal practices through interviews and participatory design studies, uncovering the coordination and challenges involved in shared food routines and informing design implications. Second, I examine the lived experience of managing childhood food allergies, highlighting how families balance informational, emotional, and social needs while navigating evolving caregiving roles. Together, these studies shed light on how to design everyday family technologies that are attuned to the transitional, dynamic, and collaborative nature of family life. My dissertation contributes to the HCI and CSCW community by offering a multidimensional understanding of how families engage in food- and health-related practices and how we might better design for the complex realities of everyday family life. These contributions fall into three major areas [1]: (1) Empirical insights into holistic everyday family meal experiences alongside design implications for shared domestic technologies. Chapters 3 and 4 demonstrate that family meal processes are deeply embedded with emotional, symbolic, and relational meaning. They are more than routines—they are rituals, sites of tension, and evolving reflections of family life. My findings reveal how families maintain and adapt meal practices amid negotiation, care labor, and disagreements, highlighting that technology should not simply aim to eliminate conflict or optimize routines. Rather, systems should be designed to scaffold reflection, shared meaning-making, and the emotional work that underpins these everyday rituals. These insights point to a need for design approaches that value the expressive and relational dimensions of family life, not just coordination or efficiency.  (2) Theory-informed analysis of everyday family-food interactions. In Chapters 3, 4, and 5, I developed a theory-informed analysis that incorporates six primary conceptual framings: Family Routines and Rituals, Symbolic Interactionism Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, Family Systems Theory, Ecological Systems Theory, and Family Development Theory. These theoretical lenses provided the scaffolding to examine the subtleties of my empirical data and allowed for a deeper understanding of the developmental, affective, and relational dynamics at play in daily food routines and chronic care contexts. Rather than treating theory as background, I actively used these lenses to interpret how families distribute and negotiate responsibilities, manage change, and express care through food. During this process, I also proposed two sensitizing concepts, generative and systemic discontents (chapter 4), as conceptual framings that help characterize and categorize the social and emotional complexity of everyday family lives, as well as in embracing and designing for the messy reality of family interactions that are not always unanimous and celebratory.  (3) Reflections on the design of future family-centered systems that aim to provide sustainable, meaningful support for the evolving needs of diverse families. Drawing from all three studies, Chapter 6 articulates a forward-looking design agenda grounded in the lived messiness of family life. I argue that personal informatics should be reimagined as relational and ecological, with systems that support co-tracking, co-regulation, and intergenerational knowledge transfer. I advocate for designs that support developmental transitions—such as shifting care from parent to child—and that make visible the “invisible work” (often gendered and emotional) of family caregiving. I also propose technologies that can sustain and adapt with families over time, including AI-supported milestone tracking, collaborative dashboards, and ritual-aware notification systems.  In addition to design insights, I offer methodological contributions for studying and designing with families as a whole, not just for them. I demonstrate how family-based group interviews and remote participatory design sessions can serve as effective strategies for engaging the entire family as a unit of analysis. These methods allowed me to surface intra-family dynamics, multi-vocal perspectives, and co-constructed meanings that are often overlooked in individual interviews. By centering the family as a collective—rather than a sum of individuals—I was able to explore how responsibilities are negotiated, how care is distributed, and how technologies might better reflect the relational realities of everyday family life. Importantly, I also offer a gentle caution against over-reliance on AI and automation: everyday family care is inherently emotional, contextual, and negotiated, and technologies must be designed to enhance—not erase—these human dimensions.  Through these contributions, my dissertation provides both practical and theoretically informed insights and visions for designing interactive systems that are inclusive, developmentally sensitive, and attuned to the everyday complexity of family care.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2025 International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems Engineering (SCSE) Conference Start Date: 2025 April 3 Conference End Date: 2025 April 3 Conference Location: Colombo, Sri Lanka Transitioning between new and legacy codebases in diverse project environments poses significant challenges for developers, especially with traditional Knowledge Transfer (KT) methods, which are often resource intensive and prone to obsolescence. These limitations hinder the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), particularly in fast-paced industrial settings. This research introduces an AI-driven automation solution that leverages large language models (LLMs) and advanced artificial intelligence technologies to address critical gaps in technical knowledge transfer, with a focus on modern software frameworks. The proposed system reduces development costs, improves team performance, and accelerates adaptation to complex codebases. Key features include a documentation generation tool that cuts manual effort by up to 90%, with an average generation time of 6.8 minutes. Additionally, a virtual knowledge transfer assistant enhances onboarding efficiency, potentially reducing senior developer involvement by 50-60%. The system also includes an automated diagram generator that achieves 97% validation accuracy and a code smell detection tool with 71% accuracy, resulting in better code quality assessments. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-driven automation in improving developer productivity, streamlining onboarding processes, and optimizing software development workflows.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2025 IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER) Conference Start Date: 2025 March 4 Conference End Date: 2025 March 7 Conference Location: Montreal, QC, Canada As blockchain technology continues to evolve, the need for accessible solutions for developing smart contracts has grown, especially for non-technical users. This paper addresses practitioners' challenges in generating Solidity smart contracts from natural language requirements within the AstraKode Blockchain no-code platform (AKB). Our goal is to lower the barrier of entry into smart contract development, making it more accessible to users with limited technical expertise. We propose three methods, i.e., Naive Generation, Augmented Generation, and Enhanced Generation, each utilizing large language models to streamline the code generation process. These methods cater to different user needs, from rapid prototyping to handling complex business scenarios, improving accessibility and usability within AKB. We demonstrate their practical relevance, potential, and limitations in addressing real-world challenges in smart contract development through empirical evaluations and practitioner feedback. Thanks to collaboration with academia and effective knowledge transfer, these methods provide innovative solutions to the challenges of smart contract generation. Furthermore, they have been integrated into AKB to enhance user services, ultimately promoting the development and deployment of secure and efficient smart contracts in the industry.

Abstract: Immersive learning is predominantly constrained to technology-based interventions but has the potential for more diverse applications. This study reports on an experiment investigating the learning affordances of psychological immersion evoked by narrative absorption. A total of 228 participants were randomly assigned to one of three forms of media, an image, a word list, and a narrative, all of which contained identical items to be memorized for immediate and delayed free recall memory tests. Other variables measured were immersion, extraneous cognitive load, and mental imagery. ANOVA and correlation analyses showed that the narrative media was found to be significantly more immersive and that it evoked mental imagery in individuals at higher levels than both the list and image media. Importantly, there was more decay in memory recall between immediate and delayed tests for those exposed to the list and the image than for those who read the narrative. This implies the utility of immersive narratives for spontaneous mental image generation, which leads to improved knowledge retention. Other implications for immersive learning theory are discussed, and practical solutions for incorporating narrative immersion in learning are also suggested.

Gamified Learning for Sustainability: An Innovative Approach to Enhance Hydrogen Literacy and Environmental Awareness Through Simulation-Based Education

Author: Kramar, Uroš; Knez, Matjaž

Publication info: Kramar, Uroš; Knez, Matjaž. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/gamified-learning-sustainability-innovative/docview/3181749008/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: The transition to sustainable energy systems presents a critical challenge for the 21st century, necessitating both technological advancements and transformative educational strategies to foster awareness and knowledge. Hydrogen technologies are pivotal for decarbonization, yet public understanding and acceptance remain limited. This study introduces and evaluates a novel gamified educational framework, uniquely integrating simulation-based learning, collaborative problem-solving, and adaptive instructional scaffolding to enhance hydrogen literacy and sustainability awareness. Unlike traditional pedagogical approaches, this method actively engages learners in real-world decision-making scenarios, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications. This study involved adolescents aged 13–15 from two distinct educational and cultural contexts, one in Europe and one in the Middle East. A pre–post study design assessed knowledge acquisition, gamification engagement, and environmental awareness shifts. Findings reveal statistically significant improvements in technical knowledge and strong positive perceptions of gamified learning as an effective sustainability education tool across both cultural groups (Europe and the Middle East). Variations in engagement across cultural contexts suggest the need for adaptive, context-sensitive educational frameworks. While the findings indicate significant short-term knowledge gains, this study does not assess long-term knowledge retention, which remains an important area for future research. This research contributes to sustainability education by demonstrating how strategically designed gamification can foster behavioral engagement, enhance environmental literacy, and support the global energy transition agenda. This study offers a pioneering perspective on integrating interactive learning methodologies to cultivate sustainability competencies among younger generations.

Full text: 1. Introduction Climate change and the transition to more sustainable energy sources represent two of the most critical global challenges. Addressing these challenges requires innovative solutions, including educational approaches to equip younger generations with the knowledge and skills to tackle complex technological and environmental issues. Sustainability education plays a crucial role in fostering environmental literacy, energy awareness, and responsible decision-making, aligning with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 4 (quality education) and SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy).
Hydrogen is a flexible, low-carbon energy source with strong potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially in the transport sector [1,2]. Its role in the energy transition is widely recognized, with green hydrogen offering significant potential for decarbonization and long-term sustainability [3]. However, challenges remain in understanding hydrogen technologies and their supply chains, which hinders broader implementation. Key obstacles include the complexity of the subject, technological limitations, high costs, insufficient infrastructure, and low public acceptance [3,4]. Public awareness and engagement are essential for fostering the acceptance of hydrogen-based solutions, yet traditional educational methods often fail to communicate these complex concepts effectively [5,6,7].
To address these challenges, sustainability-focused education must embrace innovative pedagogical approaches that enhance comprehension. Existing research shows mixed results regarding the impact of simulation games on understanding complex topics, necessitating further empirical investigation. Nevertheless, simulation games have been demonstrated as effective tools that combine gamification and experiential learning, facilitating a deeper understanding of complex systems, such as hydrogen supply chains [8]. Despite the increasing emphasis on sustainability education, existing pedagogical models often fail to translate complex hydrogen-related concepts into engaging learning experiences [9,10,11]. This study addresses this gap by introducing a gamified approach, integrating simulation and collaborative learning to foster deep understanding and long-term engagement.
The H2Student game represents an innovative integration of simulation-based learning, collaborative problem-solving, and scaffolded instructions. The game fosters critical thinking and sustainability-related decision-making by simulating real-world hydrogen supply chain challenges. Players explore hydrogen production, transport, and storage, gaining insights into technical, economic, and environmental trade-offs.
The game bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, offering a novel approach to understand sustainability and hydrogen technologies.
While previous studies have examined gamification in STEM education [12,13], few have investigated its effectiveness in hydrogen education. Traditional educational methods often struggle to engage students in complex technical topics, necessitating more interactive and experiential learning approaches. Moreover, limited research has compared how different cultural groups respond to gamified learning approaches in energy education. This study addresses these gaps by evaluating the impact of the H2Student simulation game on knowledge acquisition, sustainability awareness, and behavioral engagement in two distinct cultural contexts (Slovenia and the UAE). Slovenia represents a European educational system with a well-established STEM curriculum and a strong emphasis on renewable energy education [14]. In contrast, the UAE has been rapidly expanding its sustainability initiatives, including hydrogen development as part of the UAE Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap [15,16]. This comparison allows for an assessment of how different levels of prior exposure to hydrogen-related topics and educational methodologies influence the effectiveness of gamified learning. The findings provide novel insights into the adaptability of gamified education across different educational and cultural settings.
The research questions addressed by this study were as follows: how does the H2Student simulation game contribute to both technical understanding and sustainability awareness of hydrogen technologies, and how does it impact participants’ knowledge, interest, awareness, and perceptions? The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the game’s impact on participants’ knowledge, interest, and awareness; assess its effectiveness as an educational tool for transferring complex technical knowledge; analyze differences in the game’s impact between two culturally distinct groups; and identify opportunities for improving the game in the future.
This research builds upon the foundational concept of H2Student [17], incorporating new game elements and adaptations to assess its effectiveness across different educational contexts. By addressing gaps in hydrogen-related pedagogy, this study contributes to the enhancement of interactive sustainability education. This paper is grounded in previous research that highlighted the lack of effective methods for teaching complex technological topics [18,19] and provides concrete solutions to overcome these limitations through interactive learning. Additionally, it contributes to sustainability education by demonstrating how gamified approaches can enhance cognitive and affective learning outcomes related to clean energy technologies.
Finally, this paper highlights the key contributions of this study, including an analysis of the educational impact of the game, its adaptability to diverse contexts, and the identification of critical elements for improving pedagogical effectiveness. It also explores broader implications for integrating serious games into sustainability education and fostering interdisciplinary learning experiences that bridge STEM and environmental literacy.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: It begins with the theoretical framework supporting the H2Student game, emphasizing how the game addresses challenges inherent in traditional teaching methods. A detailed description of the research methodology, including the game design, analytical methods, and participant groups, follows this. The Results Section presents findings on the game’s effects on participants’ knowledge, interest, and awareness, as well as differences observed between the two test environments, Slovenia and the UAE. The Discussion Section evaluates the findings relative to the research objectives and explores practical implications for future pedagogical practices. This study’s limitations and recommendations for further game development are discussed in the Conclusion Section. It also outlines the key findings and their broader implications for future research, innovative pedagogical methods, and the wider use of simulation games.
2. Literature Review 2.1. Hydrogen and Its Role in the Energy Transition Hydrogen is a pivotal element in the global transition to sustainable energy systems, offering significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across various sectors [20,21]. Its role as an energy carrier, storage medium, and fuel for transportation, industry, and power generation further highlights its contribution to sustainability [22,23]. Particularly noteworthy is green hydrogen, which is produced through the electrolysis of renewable energy sources and generates no greenhouse gas emissions [3,20]. Its versatility enables the integration of various sectors and addresses challenges associated with the intermittent nature of renewable energy production [24].
Despite its potential, hydrogen faces significant barriers to broader adoption, including high production costs, inadequate infrastructure, and limited research [3,21]. The European Union recognizes green hydrogen as a cornerstone for decarbonizing energy systems, contributing to emission reductions and energy supply stability [25]. Its integration into existing energy infrastructures enhances the reliability of renewable sources and facilitates more efficient energy storage [26]. However, hydrogen production still heavily relies on fossil fuels, undermining its sustainability potential [27]. Costs associated with electrolysis and distribution remain key challenges [28].
In addition to production challenges, hydrogen storage and transport issues represent significant hurdles for its wider application. The hydrogen supply chain is a complex system encompassing production, storage, and distribution, playing a crucial role in the transition to a low-carbon economy, particularly in the transportation sector [29]. The transport sector shows increasing potential for hydrogen as a sustainable energy source to enable decarbonization and enhance energy security [30,31,32].
Research suggests that integrating hydrogen into multi-energy systems can optimize operational costs and infrastructure design, thereby increasing overall efficiency [15,33]. Nonetheless, challenges such as energy losses during transport and the need for robust infrastructure to support hydrogen refueling stations persist [34]. Advancing green hydrogen technologies using renewable energy sources is essential for overcoming these barriers and promoting sustainable mobility solutions [35,36].
2.2. The Need for Hydrogen Education In addition to technical and infrastructural challenges, education on hydrogen technologies plays a pivotal role in promoting their broader adoption. Scientific research highlights significant gaps in knowledge about hydrogen technologies and their supply chains, particularly among younger generations. Traditional educational approaches often fail to adequately address complex topics such as energy systems and supply chains, hindering the development of energy literacy and critical thinking skills [37,38]. Current curricula rarely incorporate contemporary issues related to sustainable development, including hydrogen’s role, which is essential for shaping informed future decision-makers [39,40].
The complexity of hydrogen supply chains—encompassing production, storage, transportation, and utilization—necessitates multifaceted educational strategies beyond conventional teaching methods. Practical and interdisciplinary approaches are crucial to enable students to engage with and understand these topics [41]. Without such reforms, there is a risk that young people will remain insufficiently aware of their role in energy transitions and environmental responsibility, perpetuating existing knowledge gaps [37,38].
Research further underscores the importance of education and awareness in promoting the acceptance and use of hydrogen energy [42]. Technical, infrastructural, socioeconomic, and institutional challenges add further complexity to the integration of hydrogen into energy systems [43]. Gaps in evaluating social sustainability and certain phases of the supply chain also persist [44]. Public and community support is critical for the successful development of the hydrogen industry, as differing perceptions of hydrogen technologies influence the levels of support [45].
Establishing comprehensive hydrogen supply chains requires collective efforts from scientists, policymakers, industry leaders, and the public. Such collaborative efforts are essential for overcoming challenges and fostering an effective transition to sustainable energy systems [46].
2.3. Games as an Innovative Educational Tool Gamification is a central approach to enhance the effectiveness of educational processes, as it fosters motivation, engagement, and learning through interactive elements [47,48]. In addition to enhancing motivation and engagement, gamification has been shown to improve cognitive processing and the retention of complex scientific concepts. Systematic reviews indicate that gamification fosters deeper cognitive engagement, which is crucial for mastering challenging STEM topics [12]. Research suggests that gamified learning environments can transform students’ study behaviors and increase their interaction with educational material, subsequently improving learning outcomes [49,50]. Alongside gamification, collaborative learning, activity theory, simulation games, and scaffolded learning are equally vital approaches, promoting social interaction and the gradual construction of knowledge in structured environments [12,51].
Educational games leverage multiple psychological mechanisms to enhance learning, including points-based reinforcement, competition, and scaffolded learning. According to self-determination theory (SDT), motivation is driven by autonomy, competence, and relatedness [52]. In H2Student, the team-based approach fosters relatedness, while the competitive Grand Prix feature enhances a sense of competence. The presence of points, rankings, and incentives provides extrinsic motivation, while the interactive and exploratory nature of the game supports intrinsic motivation.
Furthermore, flow theory [53] suggests that immersive game challenges lead to deeper engagement and learning retention [54,55]. In the H2Student game, scaffolded learning—where tasks gradually increase in complexity—ensures that players remain in an optimal learning zone, balancing challenge and skill. This aligns with research showing that gamified learning improves STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education outcomes by promoting active participation and problem-solving [12,56].
Key mechanics in H2Student that enhance motivation and engagement include the following:
- Points-based reinforcement: participants earn points and rewards for completing tasks, reinforcing positive learning behaviors.

- Collaborative learning: teams work to solve problems, aligning with Vygotsky’s (1978) [57] social learning theory.

- Competitive elements: the Grand Prix finale and bonus seconds drive engagement through friendly competition.

- Scaffolded learning: challenges progressively increase in complexity, allowing participants to build on prior knowledge and skills.



These mechanisms contribute to higher engagement and knowledge retention, making gamified approaches particularly effective in complex subjects like hydrogen technologies.
In educational games, collaborative learning encourages teamwork and shared understanding. Research demonstrates that collaboration in digital games enhances critical thinking and enables more effective problem-solving [58]. Additionally, social interaction in games fosters discussions and reflection, which are crucial for the co-construction of knowledge [59,60]. Collaborative learning environments with structured scaffolding can further improve communication patterns among students.
Activity theory provides a framework for understanding interactions between participants and their environments. This framework is applied in educational games to design meaningful and contextually relevant tasks, increasing learner engagement [13]. Games combining competition and collaboration can stimulate meaningful interactions, though over-structuring these interactions may limit authentic collaboration [61].
Scaffolded learning is a fundamental component of effective educational games. Scaffolding in games can involve prompts, feedback, and structured support to assist learners in tackling complex tasks [62,63]. Research shows that games with embedded scaffolding lead to better learning outcomes than those without support [64]. For instance, scaffolding strategies in game-based learning significantly enhance problem-solving processes [62]. Moreover, teacher scaffolding during orientation and gameplay has positively influenced student learning in primary education [65]. Adaptive scaffolding, which students can tailor to their needs, promotes self-directed learning and increases motivation [66].
Simulation games allow participants to engage in realistic scenarios, such as hydrogen supply chains, enabling safe experimentation with decision-making [67,68]. These games boost motivation and enhance participants’ understanding of complex systems by visualizing and manipulating variables [69,70]. Additionally, games incorporating structured collaboration and supportive mechanisms foster the development of critical thinking, communication skills, and teamwork [56,71].
By integrating these theoretical approaches into the gamification of educational content, educators can effectively address the challenges of teaching complex concepts while enhancing student motivation and collaboration.
The H2Student game exemplifies these principles, enabling participants to explore the intricate elements of hydrogen supply chains, including production, transportation, and storage. Through realistic challenges tied to hydrogen supply chains, participants gain in-depth knowledge of these processes’ technical, economic, and sustainability aspects. The game’s emphasis on practical learning fosters collaboration, sustainability, and strategic decision-making, directly addressing key challenges in modern education. By encouraging teamwork and simulating real-world scenarios, the H2Student game facilitates a deeper understanding of the strategic trade-offs associated with sustainable technologies.
3. Materials and Methods This study evaluates the impact of the H2Student simulation game on participants’ understanding of hydrogen supply chains, their application in transportation, and their awareness and interest in sustainability. The methodology emphasizes the game’s practical implementation and adaptability across cultural and educational contexts, focusing on detailed execution and assessment methods.
3.1. Simulation Game H2Student H2Student is an educational simulation game that engages participants in understanding hydrogen technologies and their applications in transportation. The game connects theoretical knowledge with practical applications through interactive tasks and teamwork, promoting critical thinking and sustainability awareness.
The theoretical foundation of H2Student was initially introduced in the work by Kramar and Knez [17]. The enhanced version presented here reflects iterative testing and refinements based on feedback from educators in Slovenia and the UAE as well as hydrogen supply chain experts. Before its implementation in this study, the game underwent multiple pilot sessions to validate its structure, effectiveness, and engagement. Initial testing was conducted at the Faculty of Logistics with university students to assess the clarity of game mechanics and learning objectives. Additionally, several test sessions were carried out with high school students in Slovenia and younger students of comparable age groups. These sessions provided valuable insights into age-appropriate game difficulty and instructional design. Feedback from subject-matter experts, including professors specializing in hydrogen technologies and sustainability education, was systematically integrated into game revisions to enhance its educational impact and practical applicability. These enhancements ensure the game’s educational relevance and engagement with its target audience.
The game is structured around four key phases, each tailored to connect theoretical concepts with real-world applications. Table 1 outlines these phases, detailing activities, objectives, team roles, and their connections to hydrogen technologies.
Presentation of H2Student Simulation Game Rules
The Goal: The goal of the H2Student game is for teams to assemble a functioning car model from LEGO bricks, which is connected to a mobile application to test its operability. After successfully testing their vehicles, teams design the car’s appearance and prepare a promotional campaign to simulate real-world challenges of introducing hydrogen-based mobility solutions to the public. This step allows participants to apply their knowledge of hydrogen technologies in a broader context, reinforcing their understanding of key concepts such as efficiency, sustainability, and commercialization. The game is designed to ensure that all teams successfully build a vehicle and compete in the final “Grand Prix” challenge.
Bonus Seconds: During the game, teams earn bonus seconds, which improve their starting position in the final competition. Bonus seconds are awarded for completing tasks such as answering quiz questions, creating the best marketing presentation, designing the most esthetically pleasing car, and assembling the car quickly. The marketing presentation task evaluates participants’ ability to communicate key hydrogen-related concepts using predefined rubrics that assess factual accuracy, persuasiveness, and clarity. Similarly, the car esthetics task follows structured criteria that focus on innovation, thematic consistency with sustainability, and functional design choices. To ensure fairness and minimize subjectivity, these tasks were evaluated by expert moderators with a background in hydrogen technologies and sustainable design using a standardized scoring system. These tasks incorporate knowledge of hydrogen properties, its advantages and disadvantages, and key elements of the hydrogen supply chain. Quiz questions are adapted to the participants’ age group and prior knowledge, covering essential topics such as hydrogen properties, production methods, electrolysis, fuel cells, and aspects of transportation, storage, safety, and sustainability. Example questions include the following:
- “How do fuel cells work, and why are they important for hydrogen-powered vehicles?”

- “What types of hydrogen exist, and how do they differ?”

- Questions are based on an introductory lecture, allowing participants to deepen their understanding of fundamental concepts. While quiz questions reinforce knowledge retention, the game also incorporates hands-on application, decision-making, and collaborative problem-solving activities. Participants engage in assembling vehicles, optimizing performance based on real-world constraints, and presenting key hydrogen-related concepts. This structured approach is designed to support the development of conceptual understanding and applied reasoning within the scope of a short-term intervention. However, further research is needed to assess the depth and retention of these learning outcomes over time.



Teams can earn bonus seconds by assisting other teams (e.g., if a team is slow or struggles with assembly tasks). At the end of the car assembly and testing process, all bonus seconds are totaled, and the team with the most points secures the best starting position for the “Grand Prix”, where all teams compete simultaneously.
Team Organization: The game allows multiple teams (at least two), each consisting of four to six members. The number of teams depends on the space and the availability of car assembly kits. Each team selects a company name symbolizing hydrogen vehicle production and sets up a designated workspace representing their “factory”.
Teams are structured as fictional companies comprising multiple departments:
- Production Department: assembles the car model using LEGO bricks and tests its operability with the “LegoControl” app.

- Procurement Department: ensures the acquisition of necessary missing parts.

- Marketing and Sales Department: creates a promotional campaign and presents the car, emphasizing the advantages of hydrogen technologies and their sustainability aspects.

- Development Department: focuses on the car’s esthetic and sustainable design.

- Management: communicates with the game moderator, oversees task completion, and coordinates team activities.



Team members assign roles among themselves, promoting communication, organization, and teamwork. The effectiveness of task organization influences the speed of assembly and overall performance. The moderator highlights market competitiveness (between teams), fostering creativity and innovation.
Equipment: Teams receive essential resources such as LEGO bricks, batteries, and assembly instructions for building an electric car model. The game’s purpose is for teams to independently manage their resources and tasks, offering insights into challenges related to inventory management and process efficiency. The supply of LEGO bricks exceeds what is required, encouraging innovative designs and simulating inventory management challenges. The moderator guides teams in organizing their resources efficiently, emphasizing the importance of speed and effective task execution. This process simulates inventory management and highlights storage challenges in supply chains.
Due to time constraints and technical complexity, the game uses electric vehicles instead of hydrogen-powered ones. The moderator explains that hydrogen cars are essentially electric vehicles powered by electricity generated from fuel cells, ensuring that the simulation remains educationally relevant.
In addition to LEGO bricks and batteries, visual aids such as fuel cell models, hydrogen vehicle prototypes, and LEGO models are provided to deepen participants’ understanding of hydrogen technologies.
Game Process: the game begins when the procurement department correctly answers the first hydrogen-related question and obtains the car assembly instructions.
Tasks during the game include the following:
- Teams answering additional questions posed by the moderator to earn bonus seconds. After collecting all responses, the moderator provides feedback and elaborates on the topic, enhancing the educational impact.

- Simulating supply chain disruptions, such as transport delays for hydrogen or tire shortages, prompts teams to adapt and solve issues effectively.



Grand Prix: At the end of the game, all teams test their cars on the “Grand Prix” track. The bonus seconds earned during the game determine each team’s starting position. The “Grand Prix” serves as the game’s climax, blending technical execution, creativity, and strategies developed throughout the process. The winning team achieves the best results in speed, knowledge, innovation, and teamwork. While the final Grand Prix race determines the winner based on speed, the starting positions are allocated based on accumulated bonus seconds from prior game activities, such as quiz performance, marketing presentations, car design, and teamwork challenges. These activities act as a crucial precondition for success in the final race, mirroring real-world competitive environments where strategic preparation, innovation, and collaboration create a significant market advantage before direct competition begins. This structure ensures that learning elements remain integral to the game while maintaining the motivational excitement of a final speed-based challenge.
3.2. Ethical Considerations The study was conducted anonymously, and no personally identifiable data were collected. Only age and gender were recorded as demographic information. Participants’ legal guardians were informed in advance about the study’s purpose, procedures, and objectives. This information was provided before the study, allowing guardians to decline participation before data collection began. Participation was entirely voluntary, and students were explicitly informed about the questionnaire; their responses were anonymous, and they could withdraw at any time; we also informed them that the data would be used exclusively for research purposes. The study adhered to ethical research principles, including the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments.
3.3. Questionnaires Pre- and post-game questionnaires captured data on participants’ knowledge, interest, awareness, and perceptions. These instruments comprised 20 pre-game and 24 post-game items across four key domains:
- Knowledge of Hydrogen Technologies: Questions assessed their understanding of hydrogen supply chains and sustainability practices. Example: “What do you know about hydrogen production?”

- Interest in Sustainable Technologies: Evaluated motivation to learn about hydrogen and its applications. Example: “How interested are you in technologies like hydrogen-powered vehicles?”

- Awareness: Measured perceptions of hydrogen’s role in addressing environmental challenges. Example: “How important do you think it is to care for the environment?”

- Game Perception: Explored user experience and engagement. Example: “Was the game an effective way to learn about hydrogen technologies?”



The Likert scale (1–5) facilitated nuanced feedback, while age-appropriate language ensured clarity. To ensure consistency across different question types, the scale labels were adapted based on the nature of the question while maintaining a standardized 1–5 structure. For knowledge-based questions, 1 represented “no knowledge” or “learned nothing”, while 5 represented “excellent understanding” or “learned a great deal” For engagement-related items, 1 corresponded to “never” and 5 to “very often.” Similarly, opinion-based responses followed a scale ranging from “very poor” (1) to “excellent” (5) or “not at all” (1) to “extremely” (5), ensuring clarity and interpretability.
3.4. Analytical Approaches To evaluate the game’s impact, the following statistical methods were applied:
- Descriptive Statistics: summarized participant responses, identifying patterns and trends.

- Mann–Whitney U-Test: compared pre- and post-game responses to assess knowledge, interest, and awareness shifts.

- Spearman’s Correlation: explored relationships between domains, such as the link between interest in sustainability and knowledge of hydrogen supply chains.



4. Results The study was conducted across two geographically and culturally distinct contexts: the Middle Eastern context in the UAE and the Central European context in Slovenia. These two regions were selected to explore how prior exposure to sustainability topics and different educational frameworks influence engagement with gamified learning. Slovenia has a long-standing tradition of STEM education with integrated renewable energy topics, while the UAE has recently prioritized hydrogen initiatives as part of its national sustainability strategy. This comparative approach allows for insights into how cultural and educational backgrounds impact the effectiveness of gamified sustainability education. Four testing workshops were organized: two in the UAE, each with 30 participants divided into five teams (60 participants), and two in Slovenia, with 22 and 26 participants in four teams at each workshop (51 participants). In total, 111 participants aged 13 to 15 participated in the study. The gender distribution was relatively balanced, with 54.77% male and 45.23% female overall. In the UAE, the distribution of participants was 55.00% male and 45.00% female, while in Slovenia, the distribution was 54.55% male and 45.45% female.
The study was conducted in school facilities with the presence of teachers, ensuring adequate support and supervision during the activities. The entire simulation game session lasted four hours, with activities tailored to the participant’s age group to ensure their full engagement in the game and related research processes. This structured approach ensured that the game was an engaging educational experience and an opportunity to evaluate its impact on sustainability literacy and awareness.
The research was conducted in November 2023 in the UAE and March 2024 in Slovenia, providing insights into the cultural and geographical diversity in implementing the H2Student simulation game. Participants and their parents were informed about the study’s purpose, procedures, and objectives. All collected data were treated anonymously and confidentially, ensuring compliance with ethical research principles, including the Declaration of Helsinki. No personally identifiable data were collected, and participants were fully informed about the voluntary nature of their participation through explicit statements on the questionnaire. Additionally, their legal guardians were informed before the study, allowing them to decline participation before data collection began. This ensured an ethically sound and comprehensive evaluation of the simulation game’s effects across cultural and geographical contexts.
The data analysis gathered during the H2Student simulation game was performed using the SPSS statistical software (Version 29.0.0.0 (241)), ensuring robust and accurate processing of the collected information. The analytical methods included descriptive statistics, the Mann–Whitney U-Test, and Spearman’s correlation, as detailed in the Section 3. These approaches allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of changes in participants’ knowledge, interest, awareness, and game perception as well as the relationships between these domains.
The results are presented in a structured manner, beginning with descriptive statistics and then a detailed examination of the Mann–Whitney U-Test outcomes, concluding with Spearman’s correlation analysis. This section provides a clear overview of the findings, paving the way for discussing their implications.
4.1. Descriptive Statistics The analysis of average scores for the main question sets—knowledge, awareness, interest, and game perception—revealed clear improvements across several dimensions after the hydrogen game (see Table 2 and Table 3). Scores were evaluated separately for participants from the UAE and Slovenia and the overall sample.
For knowledge (Figure 1 and Table 2), the average score increased from 2.54 pre-game to 3.94 post-game, with participants from the UAE showing a slightly higher improvement (2.61 to 4.05) compared to Slovenia (2.51 to 3.91). The overall standard deviation decreased slightly post-game (0.5142 to 0.4493), indicating more consistent responses after the intervention. For example, participants responded to questions such as “Do you know what fuel cells are and how they work?” (Pre-game: 2.34; Post-game: 3.77, +1.43) and “How well do you think you understand how hydrogen cars work?” (Pre-game: 2.48; Post-game: 3.70, +1.22). These responses follow the standardized 1–5 Likert scale system described earlier, where scale labels were adapted to fit the context of each question.
In the awareness set (Figure 2 and Table 2), the average scores remained relatively stable, increasing only marginally from 3.98 pre-game to 4.00 post-game. UAE participants reported an increase from 3.96 to 4.13, while Slovenian participants showed little to no change (3.96 to 3.95). These results suggest that participants already had high awareness levels before the game. Questions like “How important do you think it is to care for the environment?” (Pre-game: 4.24; Post-game: 4.73, +0.49) illustrate this trend.
The interest set (Figure 3 and Table 2) saw modest improvements, with the average rising from 3.44 to 3.61. UAE participants increased their scores from 3.56 to 3.74, while Slovenian participants improved from 3.39 to 3.56. The standard deviation remained stable across both groups. For instance, responses to “How interested are you in new technologies, such as hydrogen cars?” (Pre-game: 3.63; Post-game: 3.82, +0.19) and “How often will you now think about alternative energy sources?” (Pre-game: 3.35; Post-game: 3.73, +0.38) reflect this moderate growth.
The most notable changes occurred in the game perception set (Figure 4 and Table 2), where the overall average increased from 3.75 to 4.28. UAE participants’ scores rose from 3.97 to 4.39, while Slovenian participants improved from 3.67 to 4.24. This indicates a substantial positive shift in how participants perceived the educational and engaged aspects of the game. For example, responses to “Do you think playing games is a good way of learning?” (Pre-game: 3.42; Post-game: 4.42, +1.00) and “Do you think the hydrogen game was educational?” (Post-game: 4.49; UAE: 4.56; Slovenia: 4.42) highlight this trend.
Participants reported high satisfaction and engagement with the game based on additional post-game questions on game perception (Table 4):
- Satisfaction with content and information: the overall score was 4.42 (UAE: 4.63; Slovenia: 4.21).

- Satisfaction with the learning approach: the overall score was 4.67 (UAE: 4.78; Slovenia: 4.57).

- Effectiveness of games as a learning method: the overall score was 4.65 (UAE: 4.82; Slovenia: 4.48).

- Enjoyment of learning through games compared to other methods: the overall score was 4.66 (UAE: 4.92; Slovenia: 4.39).



These findings reinforce the perception of the hydrogen game as an effective and engaging educational tool.

5. Discussion The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the H2Student simulation game on participants’ knowledge, interest, awareness, and perception of hydrogen technologies and their supply chains. The results reveal key insights into the game’s effectiveness and ability to address challenges in traditional education for complex technical topics. Given the increasing importance of sustainability education in addressing global energy challenges, these findings contribute to the broader discourse on innovative pedagogical methods that promote environmental literacy and responsible decision-making.
5.1. Enhanced Knowledge Through Active Engagement The most significant improvements were observed in the knowledge set, with scores increasing substantially from 2.54 pre-game to 3.94 post-game. UAE participants demonstrated slightly more significant improvements (2.61 to 4.05) than Slovenian participants (2.51 to 3.91). This finding highlights the game’s effectiveness in enhancing technical understanding through interactive tasks, such as building hydrogen car models and addressing real-world supply chain challenges.
For example, the question “Do you know what fuel cells are and how they work?” showed an overall improvement of 1.43 points. Similarly, responses to “How well do you think you understand how hydrogen cars work?” revealed an improvement of 1.22 points. The Mann–Whitney test results further confirmed these findings, with significant differences in mean ranks (U = 297.00, Z = −12.267, and p < 0.001), indicating that the game successfully bridged gaps in technical knowledge. The decreased standard deviation post-game (0.5142 to 0.4493) suggests that the game also helped reduce participant understanding variability, creating a more uniform knowledge base.
These findings align with broader research on sustainability education, which suggests that interactive and competitive elements in educational games contribute to engagement and facilitate conceptual understanding of clean energy technologies [12,13,50]. While the study demonstrates significant short-term knowledge gains, the duration of the intervention limits conclusions about long-term retention, which remains an important area for future research. The positive correlation between game perception and learning effectiveness (r = 0.76 and p < 0.001) further supports the role of gamification in sustainability education. This reinforces its potential as a transformative tool for STEM and environmental literacy while highlighting the need for future studies on sustained knowledge retention and long-term impact [12].
5.2. Limited Changes in Awareness and Interest Awareness and interest scores showed less pronounced changes. Awareness increased slightly from 3.98 to 4.00 overall, with UAE participants showing a post-game average of 4.13 compared to 3.95 for Slovenian participants. The minimal increase suggests that participants entered the study with a relatively high baseline awareness, potentially limiting the scope for improvement. This aligns with previous research indicating that participants with strong environmental consciousness may experience smaller gains in sustainability-related interventions. For instance, “How important do you think it is to care for the environment?” improved by 0.49 points, reflecting incremental changes rather than transformative shifts in environmental attitudes.
Interest scores rose modestly from 3.44 to 3.61, with UAE participants showing slightly higher increases than Slovenian participants. Questions such as “How interested are you in new technologies, such as hydrogen cars?” and “How often will you now think about alternative energy sources?” recorded improvements of 0.19 and 0.38 points, respectively. Although these changes were relatively small, they indicate that exposure to interactive learning experiences can foster curiosity in sustainability-related topics. The Mann–Whitney test results for these sets were not statistically significant (Awareness: U = 5913.00, Z = −0.522, and p = 0.602; Interest: U = 5354.50, Z = −1.689, and p = 0.091). These results suggest that while the game captured participants’ interest, more targeted efforts may be needed to significantly enhance engagement with the topic.
5.3. Positive Perceptions of the Game as a Learning Tool Game perception exhibited the most significant improvements, with overall scores increasing from 3.75 to 4.28, reflecting a significant shift in attitudes toward gamified learning approaches in sustainability education. UAE participants reported higher post-game scores (4.39) than Slovenian participants (4.24). The question “Do you think playing games is a good way of learning?” showed an improvement of 1.00 points, while “Do you think the hydrogen game was educational?” recorded post-game averages of 4.49 (UAE: 4.56; Slovenia: 4.42). The Mann–Whitney test results for game perception confirmed these findings (U = 3030.00, Z = −6.552, and p < 0.001).
Participants also expressed high satisfaction with the game’s content and approach, emphasizing its effectiveness in making complex sustainability concepts more accessible and engaging. For example, responses to “How satisfied were you with the learning approach used in the game?” showed an overall post-game score of 4.67. These findings suggest that the game’s interactive and collaborative elements significantly contributed to participants’ positive perceptions of learning through games. Additional questions related to engagement, such as “How enjoyable is learning through games compared to other methods?” (overall score: 4.66), reinforce the value of gamified learning experiences in sustainability education.
5.4. Cultural and Contextual Differences This study revealed notable differences between UAE and Slovenian participants. These two regions were selected to explore how prior exposure to sustainability topics and different educational frameworks influence engagement with gamified learning. Slovenia has a long-standing tradition of STEM education with integrated renewable energy topics, while the UAE has recently prioritized hydrogen initiatives as part of its national sustainability strategy. This comparative approach allows for insights into how cultural and educational backgrounds impact the effectiveness of gamified sustainability education.
UAE participants consistently reported higher post-game scores across all dimensions. For knowledge, UAE participants averaged 4.05 post-game compared to 3.91 for Slovenian participants. Similar trends were observed for game perception, where UAE participants’ scores averaged 4.39 compared to 4.24 for Slovenian participants.
Notably, UAE participants responded more positively to the competitive aspects of the game, such as the Grand Prix finale and points-based reinforcement. In contrast, Slovenian participants placed greater emphasis on teamwork and collaborative problem-solving. This suggests that cultural differences may influence how gamification elements shape learning experiences, reinforcing the importance of adaptive game design that aligns with regional educational values [67] and sustainability priorities. Interestingly, Slovenian participants who rated collaboration as the most valuable element still demonstrated similar knowledge gains, suggesting that different gamification elements can be equally effective when tailored to learner preferences.
A comparison of pre-game and post-game responses between UAE and Slovenian participants further highlighted these differences. For pre-game responses, UAE participants had higher mean ranks (244.88) compared to Slovenia (196.17), indicating stronger initial responses (U = 19,108.000, Z = −3.991, and p < 0.001). For post-game responses, UAE participants again reported higher mean ranks (500.33) compared to Slovenia (378.82), emphasizing potential cultural or educational factors influencing engagement and learning outcomes (U = 71,123.500, Z = −7.039, and p < 0.001).
These findings suggest that while the game is effective across diverse cultural contexts, tailored modifications, such as region-specific sustainability challenges and localized hydrogen policy discussions, could further enhance its impact on specific learner groups. For example, incorporating localized case studies or examples could make the game more relatable and engaging for participants from different regions.
5.5. Strengthened Relationships Between Dimensions The correlation analysis highlighted strengthened relationships between knowledge, awareness, interest, and game perception post-game. The correlation between knowledge and game perception increased significantly from ρ = 0.563 pre-game to ρ = 0.759 post-game. This suggests that participants who gained technical knowledge were more likely to perceive the game as an effective educational tool, reinforcing the importance of gamification in sustainability education.
Similarly, the correlation between awareness and interest strengthened from ρ = 0.651 pre-game to ρ = 0.752 post-game, indicating that participants who recognized the importance of environmental and hydrogen-related issues also showed greater interest in the topic. These findings highlight the interconnected nature of the dimensions and the game’s role in reinforcing these links, supporting the argument that sustainability education benefits from interactive and engaging learning experiences.
Spearman’s correlation results further confirm the game’s success in creating a cohesive learning experience by linking technical understanding with broader attitudinal shifts. For instance, the stronger correlation between knowledge and awareness (ρ = 0.690 post-game) reflects how the game encouraged participants to connect hydrogen technologies with sustainability challenges, emphasizing their real-world implications. The strengthened correlations between knowledge, awareness, interest, and game perception post-game suggest that gamified learning improves technical literacy and fosters a holistic educational experience where cognitive and attitudinal shifts are interconnected. Although improvements in awareness and interest were relatively modest, their positive correlation with knowledge gains suggests that gamified approaches have the potential to create long-term engagement with sustainability topics. These findings highlight the necessity of refining gamified educational frameworks to improve technical knowledge and foster more profound engagement with sustainability concepts. This raises important questions about how such approaches can be optimized for diverse learning environments, paving the way for further exploration into their adaptability and long-term effectiveness.
5.6. Implications for Hydrogen Education The results underscore the potential of simulation games like H2Student to address the limitations of traditional teaching methods for complex technical subjects. By combining interactive, gamified elements with real-world challenges, the game effectively enhances technical knowledge and fosters positive perceptions of learning in the context of sustainability education. However, the modest changes in awareness and interest suggest the need for future refinements to better engage participants with the broader implications of hydrogen technologies. Future studies should incorporate longitudinal assessments to evaluate the durability of learning outcomes. Research indicates that gamified learning can positively impact long-term knowledge retention, particularly in STEM and environmental education [72,73].
Tailored modifications, such as incorporating localized examples or emphasizing the global environmental and economic relevance of hydrogen technologies, could further enhance the game’s impact. Additionally, the differences observed between UAE and Slovenian participants highlight the importance of cultural adaptability in educational tools, ensuring their relevance across diverse contexts.
These results provide valuable insights into the design of gamified educational interventions, emphasizing the need to balance competition and collaboration depending on the cultural and demographic characteristics of the target audience. While this study demonstrates the effectiveness of gamified learning in hydrogen education, it does not include a control group using traditional educational methods. Future research should incorporate a comparative analysis between gamification-based and conventional instructional approaches to better assess the relative benefits and limitations of the H2Student game. Future iterations of the H2Student game could explore adaptive difficulty settings and varied team-based challenges to enhance engagement across different learner profiles. Additionally, further research should investigate whether the observed cultural differences persist across different age groups and educational backgrounds.
The stronger correlations between knowledge, awareness, interest, and game perception highlight the game’s role in linking technical understanding with broader sustainability attitudes and perceptions. This reinforces the value of interactive learning approaches in fostering long-term engagement with clean energy and environmental responsibility.
The strong correlation between knowledge acquisition and game perception further highlights the pedagogical benefits of gamification in STEM education. Prior research suggests that students who engage with gamified elements tend to develop deeper conceptual understanding and sustained interest in complex scientific topics [74,75]. This supports the notion that interactive and experiential learning approaches can enhance both cognitive processing and motivation, leading to more effective long-term retention of sustainability-related knowledge. Integrating engagement-driven strategies such as scaffolding, competition, and collaborative problem-solving into educational games has been shown to optimize learning outcomes, reinforcing the role of gamified interventions in modern educational frameworks [74,75]. Future adaptations of the H2Student game should continue to leverage these mechanisms to maximize both motivation and knowledge acquisition, particularly in interdisciplinary sustainability education.
6. Conclusions This study assessed the impact of the H2Student simulation game on participants’ knowledge of hydrogen technologies, interest in sustainable solutions, and awareness of hydrogen’s role in energy transitions. The findings confirm that the game significantly enhanced participants’ understanding of hydrogen-related concepts, particularly in hydrogen supply chains and their application in transport. These results validate the game as an effective pedagogical tool for bridging theoretical knowledge with practical decision-making in sustainability education and fostering long-term engagement with clean energy topics.
This study’s key contributions lie in its ability to advance hydrogen education through gamification. The game supported participants in developing a foundational understanding of hydrogen production, storage, transportation, and use in vehicles while introducing key challenges and trade-offs at each stage of the supply chain. However, given the short duration of the intervention, further research is needed to assess the depth and retention of this understanding over time. Participants engaged in decision-making processes related to hydrogen logistics, safety considerations, and disruptions, reinforcing the complexity of real-world hydrogen applications. Players applied theoretical hydrogen concepts to practical scenarios through interactive problem-solving, strengthening the connection between academic learning and industry-relevant challenges. Additionally, the game’s adaptability across different cultural and educational contexts demonstrated its potential as an international learning tool for hydrogen education. Unlike conventional serious games, this approach uniquely integrates real-world hydrogen logistics challenges, interdisciplinary collaboration, and adaptive game mechanics to enhance learning retention and behavioral engagement.
While this study yielded promising results, several limitations must be acknowledged. The sample size, though adequate for initial assessment, limits the generalizability of our findings. Future research should expand the participant pool across various educational levels and professional sectors to assess the game’s broader applicability. Additionally, this study was conducted in controlled classroom environments, which may not fully replicate real-world decision-making in hydrogen supply chains. Further testing in hybrid or real-world settings could provide deeper insights. Another limitation is that knowledge acquisition was assessed immediately after gameplay; long-term retention was not measured. Future studies should incorporate follow-up assessments to evaluate the durability of learning outcomes. Furthermore, this study lacked a control group for direct comparison, making it difficult to isolate the specific effects of the game. The inclusion of a control group in future research would strengthen the validity of the findings.
Future research should explore several avenues to enhance the game’s impact. Extended gameplay and supplementary instructional materials could reinforce the connection between hydrogen applications and daily life. Customizing the game for broader audiences, including university students and professionals in the hydrogen sector, could expand its educational reach. Investigating hybrid learning approaches that integrate digital and in-person game elements may enhance accessibility and engagement. Comparative cross-national studies could assess how different educational systems and cultural contexts influence learning outcomes. Additionally, introducing a control group in future research would enable more precise measurements of the game’s impact. Finally, further content expansion, including additional real-world hydrogen applications and decision-making scenarios, could increase the game’s relevance and effectiveness in fostering awareness and interest in hydrogen technologies and sustainability.
While the H2Student game successfully enhanced knowledge acquisition, future iterations could incorporate adaptive difficulty levels to better cater to diverse learning paces. Additionally, further research should examine the long-term retention effects of gamification in hydrogen education and explore how specific game mechanics contribute to engagement and motivation in different cultural contexts. Implementing a more structured approach for integrating the game into formal education systems, such as aligning it with national curricula or using it as a supplementary tool in STEM courses, could further enhance its impact and scalability.
The broader implications of this study highlight the potential of simulation games as a scalable and adaptable tool for hydrogen education. The H2Student game equips participants with critical thinking and problem-solving skills for addressing contemporary energy challenges by immersing participants in realistic decision-making processes. As hydrogen technologies continue to evolve, integrating such interactive educational tools into curricula can bridge knowledge gaps and inspire the next generation of professionals in the field of sustainable energy.
In conclusion, this study underscores the effectiveness of gamification in hydrogen education. While there are areas for improvement, the results confirm the potential of simulation-based learning in fostering more profound engagement with sustainable energy solutions. Future research and development efforts should focus on refining game mechanics, expanding content, and incorporating diverse learning environments to maximize the game’s educational impact.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2025 International Conference on Computational, Communication and Information Technology (ICCCIT) Conference Start Date: 2025, Feb. 7 Conference End Date: 2025, Feb. 8 Conference Location: Indore, India This study addresses the challenge of generating high-quality paraphrases, a complex task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that encompasses various essential subproblems. While neural networks have driven advancements, this study investigates the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enhance paraphrase quality. Initially, a comparison of state-of-the-art supervised text generation approaches is conducted, revealing their limitations. Subsequently, strategies for knowledge transfer between supervised models and RL models are assessed using two intermediary environments. The impact of RL fine-tuning with different reward functions is then analyzed, highlighting the difficulties in designing effective reward functions for paraphrase generation. Findings suggest that employing an adversarial model as a reward function yields the best results. Additionally, the study proposes a general framework for transferring knowledge from supervised models to RL models, facilitating training efficiency. This work not only advances paraphrase generation but also offers a robust pipeline for applying RL in NLP applications.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2025 2nd International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Technology and Networking (CICTN) Conference Start Date: 2025, Feb. 6 Conference End Date: 2025, Feb. 7 Conference Location: Ghaziabad, India With the rapid growth of online content, there is an increasing demand for efficient tools that facilitate content understanding and knowledge retention. This research focuses on the development of an AI-powered system designed to automate summarization, question answering, and quiz generation from YouTube transcripts and Wikipedia articles. The system employs advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process and distill complex information into clear and concise summaries. The process begins with the extraction of text through the YouTube Transcript API or web scraping. The Pegasus-XSum model is then used for summarizing the content, ensuring that key information is retained while minimizing text length. For question answering, the Llama model is employed to generate contextually relevant answers based on the provided content. Additionally, the system generates quizzes by extracting entities from the text to enhance interactive learning. This technology aims to improve content comprehension, making it especially valuable for educational settings and knowledge management. By integrating summarization, question answering, and quiz generation into a single platform, the system supports efficient learning and better retention of critical information. This research demonstrates the potential of NLP in addressing the challenges of information overload and facilitating effective knowledge acquisition.

Abstract: The increasing use of smart devices has emphasized the critical role of maintenance in production activities. Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs) are vital tools that support the maintenance of smart equipment. However, traditional IETMs face challenges such as transitioning from Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to natural Language User Interfaces (LUIs) and managing complex logical relationships. Additionally, they must meet the current demands for higher intelligence. This paper proposes a Maintenance Scheme Generation Method based on Large Language Models (LLM-R). The proposed method includes several key innovations: We propose the Low Rank Adaptation-Knowledge Retention (LORA-KR) loss technology to proportionally adjust mixed maintenance data for fine-tuning the LLM. This method prevents knowledge conflicts caused by mixed data, improving the model's adaptability and reasoning ability in specific maintenance domains, Besides, Hierarchical Task-Based Agent and Instruction-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies are adopted to optimize the generation steps and mitigate the phenomenon of hallucination caused by the model's Inability to access contextual information. This enhancement improves the model's flexibility and accuracy in handling known or unknown maintenance objects and maintenance scheme scenarios. To validate the proposed method's effectiveness in maintenance tasks, a maintenance scheme dataset was constructed using objects from different fields. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the maintenance schemes generated by the proposed method reached 91.59%, indicating which improvement enhances the intelligence of maintenance schemes and introduces novel technical approaches for equipment maintenance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of gerontechnology, technologies for older adults, needs a collaboration that integrates the efforts of researchers, industry and community partners. Multisector collaboration fosters a holistic view of technologies, merging industry expertise, academic rigour, and the lived experiences of older adults and caregivers. This paper explores the role of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) perspectives in Patient and Public Involvement (PPI). BACKGROUND The rapid advancement of gerontechnology, technologies for older adults, needs a collaboration that integrates the efforts of researchers, industry and community partners. Multisector collaboration fosters a holistic view of technologies, merging industry expertise, academic rigour, and the lived experiences of older adults and caregivers. This paper explores the role of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) perspectives in Patient and Public Involvement (PPI).We present two case studies from Canada and Australia. Study One involves a dementia television project, and Study Two is an innovative rural dementia care project. Data sources included transcripts of the case studies' focus groups, research meeting notes, and associated study publications between 2021 and 2023 and 2016-2024, respectively. Utilizing Rolfe's reflective model, we reflected on lessons learned regarding challenges, strategies, and their implications for future research. Our analysis focused on two questions: (1) What were the common challenges of partnering with industry and PPI in the research process? And (2) How can EDI be applied to help overcome those challenges? METHODS We present two case studies from Canada and Australia.

The challenges are (1) experiential bias, (2) underrepresentation, (3) communication gaps, (4) mistrust and (5) power dynamics. Based on the lessons learned, we identified ten practical strategies using EDI principles: (1) seek diverse representation, (2) establish transparent agreements, (3) adopt inclusive language and cultural sensitivity, (4) apply flexibility to learn and adapt, (5) embed team reflection (6) take time to build trust and relationships, (7) facilitate meaningful engagement, (8) provide equitable recognition and opportunity, (9) foster a respectful environment for knowledge transfer, and (10) cultivate a long-term sustained relationship.

Abstract: The key element of knowledge management is that all knowledge, both explicit and tacit, accumulated by an organization becomes easily accessible to each of its members. This is important for decision-making processes and allows the organization to become more agile. In the literature there is an increasingly common attitude that more attention should be paid not only to the technological but also to the human aspect of knowledge management. The processes of knowledge exchange among employees have been subject to extensive research and studies, yet the recent years have added another thread to the discussion about the matter, i.e. a significant proportion of employees switching to the online work model. The aim of this article is to demonstrate how issues of knowledge exchange and learning influence preferences in choosing the form of work in the future. Based on the findings of the studies conducted on a group of employees representing Generation Z, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique and was applied to organize the factors with the highest relevance for the respondents in online work. Cluster analysis was used for segmentation purposes. PCA demonstrated that the components recognized as most important were those relating to knowledge transfer and their impact on employee efficiency, and on the other hand employee relations as a factor that supports the learning processes. Cluster analysis proved that learning and knowledge exchange opinions have an impact on the form of work preferences.

1. Introduction
The knowledge resources of the organization and its members constitute the heart of the organization's functioning. However, this potential can be used and used up to build a competitive advantage only when it is diagnosed, located, developed and multiplied through permanent exchange. Knowledge is currently treated as a type of enterprise resources and therefore an element that is subject to management rules to the same extent as other organizational resources. The characteristic features of knowledge according to G. Probst, S. Raub, K. Romhardt (2004, p.26) are that it is: ordered, complex, context-dependent, dependent on the person using it and is reflected in behavior models. However, this division does not take into account the remaining basic universal principles of knowledge, namely:
* knowledge is born and located in the minds of people;
* sharing knowledge is based on trust;
* new technologies create new knowledge exchange behaviors;
* knowledge sharing must be supported and rewarded by the organization;
* knowledge exchange initiatives must be implemented in a planned manner, with quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics defined;
* knowledge and innovation are the result of creativity, which should be encouraged and developed in many unusual and unconventional ways.
There are two basic knowledge management strategies: a strategy based on codification and personalization. The first one assumes the use of computer techniques as a basic tool for acquiring, processing and storing knowledge. This approach is characterized by a high level of centralization of knowledge management. The second type of knowledge management strategy is based on the assumption that knowledge is closely related to the person who possesses, processes and shares it. The main goal of this strategy is to create an appropriate organizational climate that favors direct contacts between organization members.
The aim of this article is to demonstrate how issues of knowledge exchange and learning influence preferences in choosing the form of work in the future.
2. Theoretical Foundations of the Issue
According to the concept of I. Nonaka, R. Toyoma (2007), people do not acquire knowledge passively; they interpret it and adapt it to their own situation and perspective. Referring to the personalization strategy in the field of knowledge transfers (which will be the research assumption of this study), we focus on individual employees, their characteristics and mutual relations that favor or limit knowledge flows (social capital, human capital, intellectual capital) and on intra-organizational factors (tangible and intangible) that support these processes (i.e. IT systems, physical work environment, human resources management, project management, etc.).
The basic division of knowledge that can be found in the literature on the subject (Akhmadi & Tsakalerou, 2022; Bloodgood & Chen, 2021; González-Ramos et al., 2023) is the division into explicit and hidden, as well as declarative and procedural knowledge. Declarative knowledge, most often in an explicit form, is knowledge of the "I know what" type, while knowledge of a procedural and tacit nature is knowledge of the "I know how" type. Explicit and declarative knowledge, due to its verbalized nature, has existed in organizations for a long time and is subject to management processes. Tacit and procedural knowledge and methods of its transformation towards explicit and declarative knowledge are currently attracting greater attention of researchers.
Therefore, one of the key elements of knowledge exchange is the transformation of unnamed knowledge (which is "owned" by each employee) into named knowledge. This is a necessary process so that tacit knowledge can be passed on. It is in the process of transforming tacit knowledge into accessible and back into tacit knowledge that organizational knowledge is created. In this approach (identified with the Japanese approach (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995)), we treat the organization as a living organism - knowledge "must be felt", it must be experienced, it cannot be acquired only through education and training. Western companies believe that the organization is a machine serving only for processing information and knowledge and not for generating knowledge. The result of this approach is the assumption that only available knowledge is important, which is communicable, ordered and formalized in the form of hard data, scientific formulas and universal principles. According to the Japanese approach, knowledge should be treated differently. It is believed that knowledge expressed in numbers and words is just the tip of the iceberg. The most important is hidden knowledge, difficult to notice and verbalize. This is individual knowledge, difficult to formalize, based on the subjective participation of intuition and premonitions. It results from individual action and experience and is deeply hidden in individual ideals, values and emotions. Tacit knowledge can be understood in two dimensions (Hau et al., 2013):
* technical - know-how (often people who have it cannot express it based on scientific and technical principles) and
* cognitive - composed of patterns, mental models, beliefs and perceptions that are so deeply rooted that they are taken for granted.
Taking into account the above, knowledge exchange in the context of remote work can be understood in two ways. Adopting a codification approach, this form of work does not pose major obstacles to locating, storing or even creating knowledge, information processes and learning. However, if we analyze the problems of knowledge exchange from the perspective of the personalization approach (and this is the approach shared by the author of the study), remote work creates numerous obstacles to the exchange of knowledge between employees, their development and, consequently, effective work.
These regularities are confirmed in the publications of Kucharczyk (2023) based on "The Economist". Many publications, especially those created during the pandemic and earlier, raised the advantages of remote work, basing their conclusions on the publication by Emanuel & Harrington (2020), which emphasized the increase in productivity and efficiency among employees working remotely compared to stationary employees. These opinions expanded their circles of popularity even in the face of the fact that the same authors, in their subsequent publications based on more accurate and detailed data (Emanuel & Harrington, 2023b, 2023a), revised their views, pointing to opposite conclusions, which was also confirmed by research (Atkin et al., 2023;Gibbs et al., 2022). The cited research results emphasize, among other things, that remote communication is not conducive to solving everyday matters at work, and teleconferences are only an imitation of office meetings (Szombathelyi et al., 2023). In remote work, the coordination of many processes takes longer, becomes more complicated, formalized and therefore less effective. Remote work causes stagnation in development, both professional and social (Yarbrough & Ramos Salazar, 2023). According to Emanuel et al., (2024), people working on-site acquire the skills needed to effectively perform their duties more quickly.
The discussed issues gain additional value if employees representing the youngest generation of employees are taken as a reference point. For representatives of this generation, communication tools used in remote work dominate over the form of direct communication (Zeer et al., 2021). Through them, young employees build relationships, learn, acquire knowledge and share it. It should be noted, however, that for representatives of Generation Z, knowledge is sometimes identified with the category of information (Szymkowiak et al., 2021). Interestingly, for this generation, knowledge is not a competitive good (Albrychiewicz-Stocinska, 2022; Bloodgood & Chen, 2021). However, the research results draw attention to the fact that in relation to Generation Z, there may be problems related to the exchange of knowledge understood as learning and teaching others (Sekala et al., 2023), which may result from different generational characteristics, including the values they profess, attitude towards work and expectations towards it, and adaptability to the work environment (Maloni et al., 2019; Cresnar and Nedelko, 2020; Chillakuri, 2020; Barhate and Dirani, 2021; Snieska et al., 2020). Noteworthy are the lack of competences in naming and expressing knowledge, which is tacit knowledge and often not realized by the employee himself, i.e. deficiencies in social and communication skills (Hegade & Shettar, 2022; Steyn et al., 2020). The above-mentioned competence deficiencies undoubtedly disturb their efforts to acquire professional experience early, engage in various types of activities, including volunteering, and believe in the need to build social capital, i.e. a network of contacts (Sidor-Rzadkowska, 2023, р. 31).
3. Methodology
The research results presented in the study are part of a quantitative survey on "Managerial aspects of remote work management", carried out among young people working remotely, representing Generation Z. The most popular division in the literature assumes that Generation Z includes people born after 1995, although some researchers sometimes include among its representatives those born in 1990, and in others only those who were born in 2000 and later (Dreyer & Stojanová, 2022; Skypalová et al., 2023; Urick et al., 2017).
Due to the fact that there is no statistical data on the number of people representing Generation Z, the size of the population of people working in Poland in the age range of interest to researchers (15-34 years of age) was established at 4,802,000 people (GUS, 2022). For the population estimated in this way, with the following statistical assumptions: fraction size: 0.5; confidence level: 95%; maximum error: 5%, the size of the research sample was set at 384 people.
The study was carried out using quantitative research methods, using the CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interview - 50% of respondents) and CAWI (Computer Assisted Web Interview - 50% of respondents) techniques in December 2022. The study covered young people from Generation Z whose experience of remote work lasted at least year 2022.
The research tool used is a standardized questionnaire consisting of 57 closed statements and 8 questions regarding the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. A Likert scale was used for the responses (Kaczmarek, 2013), which allows determining the relative intensity of different responses (Babbie, 2004, p.192). The research tool (questionnaire) is original and was prepared by members of the research team - employees of the Department of Applied Sociology and Human Resources Management, Faculty of Management, Czestochowa University of Technology.
In the process of developing the research results, the principal component analysis (PCA) method was used, which is one of the most popular statistical techniques used as part of factor analysis, used in the area of analyzing respondents' behavior and attitudes (Pupelis 8: Seinauskiene, 2023). The analytical procedure in the principal components method is described in the literature on the subject, especially in the field of psychological and social research methodology (Capecchi et al., 2023; Lloyd et al., 2023; Okön, 1968). The use of principal components analysis requires variables measured on an interval scale, but it can also be used for measurements carried out on five- and seven-point ordinal scales (Sagan 2004, p. 89).
Cluster analysis was used for segmentation purposes. The cluster analysis method, also called feature and object segmentation, is an example of an analysis consisting in searching for and extracting clusters from data, i.e. groups of similar objects. Correctly performed cluster analysis allows for dividing the data set into groups in order to better understand the information contained therein and to determine the properties of groups of similar objects and their synthetic characteristics. (Korzeniewski, 2012, p. 5). However, the idea of cluster analysis (Zakrzewska, 1994, p. 21) is to divide a set of objects or variables into classes without a pre-existing external criterion. Both statistical methods were implemented using the STATISTICA program.
4. Research Results
According to the principal components analysis algorithm presented earlier, 57 variables were analyzed. The scale used in the responses was as follows: 1 - | completely disagree, and 5 - | completely agree. Four questionnaire validity procedures have been used: content (Rossiter 2008), face (Czakon 2014), construct (Cronbach and Meehl 1955) and nomological (Czakon 2014) ones. The scale reliability was validated using Cronbach's alpha that is a measure of internal consistency (a = .970019). The correlation analysis was preceded by an assessment of the values of the obtained descriptive statistics, in particular the standard deviation. In both conducted measurements, standard deviation values other than zero were obtained for all variables. Based on the correlation analysis, two low-correlated items were eliminated from the set of 57 statements: "remote work leads to a feeling of isolation" and "remote work places emphasis on written communication (e-mails, text messages, etc.)". There were few statistically significant correlations for these variables. The obtained values of the KMO index = 0.968 (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) and the Barlett's Test of Sphericity (result close to zero) for 55 variables allowed a positive decision to be made regarding the possibility of using principal components analysis to explain the structure of the correlation matrix.
After performing the scree test and using the Kaiser's eigenvalue criterion, 7 factors (components) were isolated, which explain a total of 72.23% of the variance (Table 1).
The analysis of the main components allows us to conclude that the opinions on remote work expressed by Generation Z employees, in relation to the conducted study, can be reduced to seven dimensions, the first two of which: (1) "knowledge, information and efficiency" and (2) "relationships and learning" refer to the issue of knowledge exchange in the context of efficiency and the social work environment. The first factor explains as much as 45.54% of the variance and the next factor 11.71% of the variance. The substantive construction of factors in terms of scale test items took into account both variable contributions, based on correlations, and common variable resources, based on correlations.
The remaining isolated factors, which do not provide such important information, are: (3) formal/task communication, (4) work-life in the context of time commitment, (5) work comfort and feedback communication, (6) stress-producing/disruptive elements and (7) professional development and work-life elements.
Chart 1 shows factor loadings, i.e. correlations between primary variables and principal components. The correlation coefficients have values in the range [-1;1] and are distributed within the so-called unit circle, also called correlation circle (Stanisz, 2007, p.192-193). The further a given point is from the center of the circle, the higher the correlation of a given variable with a given principal component. As can be seen from the presented graph, most of the variables are negatively correlated with the first component, in the case of the second component, some of the variables are positively correlated, some negatively. The angles between the vectors representing the studied variables indicate that these variables are correlated, acute angles (vectors located close to each other) indicate a positive correlation, a right angle (perpendicular vectors) indicates a lack of correlation, and obtuse angles (vectors on opposite sides of the center of the correlation circle) indicate a negative correlation. Analysis of the correlation circle reveals high correlation of variables.
In the next step of the statistical analysis, representative variables were selected for individual components based on the highest values of factor loadings, i.e. the variables that had the greatest impact on individual components were selected. In relation to these variables, the cluster analysis method was used to diagnose how the respondents' attitude to individual dimensions of remote work influenced their preferences in choosing the form of work in the future. The cluster analysis carried out using the Ward method using percentage inconsistency as a distance measure led to the identification of three clusters of respondents with the characteristics presented in Table 2.
Group 1 - in this group, as the only one, almost 26% of respondents reveal that the preferred form of work in the future is remote work, although the remaining respondents distributed their declarations in similar proportions in relation to hybrid and stationary work. Interestingly, this group is the only one with such a high percentage expressing positive opinions on the issue of access to knowledge and information, shaping employee relations and learning, similarly to the other components.
Group 2 - in this group, the vast majority of respondents declare their willingness to provide work in the future in a stationary form, and 22% - in a hybrid form. Respondents from this group mostly represent a negative attitude towards the opportunities offered by remote work in terms of the flow of knowledge and information and their impact on efficiency and the possibility of shaping employee relations and learning.
Group 3 - this is a group that, similarly to group 2, declares to undertake full-time and hybrid work in the future, with a slightly greater share of the latter. This group is characterized by an ambivalent attitude towards most of the defined dimensions, including components 1 and 2.
5. Discussion
The survey results reveal that among employees with experience of remote work, this type of work is not the most frequently mentioned form of work in the future. This debunks the myth regarding Generation Z employees, for whom the use of modern technologies at work seems natural and obvious, and that they are much better suited to remote work (Albrychiewicz-Stociñska, 2022). It seems that the dominant preferences of young respondents in terms of stationary and hybrid forms of work should be associated with the importance of organizational learning (i.e. exchange of knowledge, information and learning) and employee relations presented in the study.
An element that brings additional interpretive value to the results of the conducted analyzes is Kendall's tau correlation coefficient (an indicator recommended for examining the relationships between variables expressed on a Likert scale, the value is between -1 and 1 (Btazejczyk-Majka, 2018)), which shows numerous connections between components, however with a raised p (for p<.001) provides insight into strong relationships only between selected components (Table 3). The areas of knowledge, information and efficiency and relationships and learning have the strongest influence on the preferred form of work in the future. However, the minus sign next to all correlation coefficients draws attention to the direction of the correlation, according to which it should be interpreted that the worse the respondents rated individual dimensions of remote work, the more often they moved towards stationary or hybrid work.
These principal components analysis factors explain 57% of the total variance. This is confirmed by research (Dreyer & Stojanová, 2022; Hegade 8: Shettar, 2022) which emphasizes the importance of personal contacts and direct communication along with the related skills (Hans et al., 2023).
The importance of organizational knowledge exchange is also confirmed by the results of cluster analysis. It seems that the respondents from the first group, who were the only ones who indicated potential interest in remote work, based their preferences primarily on positive opinions regarding the exchange of knowledge, information and learning. In the remaining groups where these opinions were neutral or negative, remote work did not appear as a preferred form of work in the future. Therefore, organizations should particularly analyze the processes of organizational learning in relation to Generation Z employees, so that they meet the expectations of these employees.
6. Conclusions
The conclusions drawn by the author of the study from the analysis of the research results are positive. The analyzed group of young people with experience in remote work, not forced due to the pandemic, but chosen consciously and voluntarily, appreciates the importance of knowledge and information in the context of increasing their own effectiveness and learning in connection with building personal relationships. Therefore, even representatives of the youngest generation of employees understand how important direct contact with other people and their knowledge is. Such transfer of knowledge allows for a faster learning process, adaptation of knowledge to the requirements of organizational practice and verification of the acquired information without leading to information overload. The presented attitude of young employees towards the issue of knowledge and learning creates a platform for intergenerational knowledge transfer, which should undoubtedly be of interest to both researchers and practitioners, with particular emphasis on HR department employees.

Abstract: In the current unpredictable and constantly evolving scenario, knowledge is a strategic resource for businesses (Argote L., Ingram P., 2000), particularly in the case of family businesses (Zapata - Cantu L. et al., 2023). In this context knowledge transfer is most important and technology and innovation can concretely support the transfer of information, both inside and outside organizations; but family businesses are not very technology-oriented (Bouncken В. & Schmitt F., 2022). So, the aim of this study is to understand how digitalization could impact on knowledge transfer dynamics in family businesses and in particular on codifying explicit knowledge, on transfer of tacit knowledge and on generational succession in family businesses.

Keywords: Knowledge Transfer Dynamics, Family business, Digitalization
Abstract
1. Introduction
In recent years many authors, such as Drucker, point out that the only significant resource for businesses is knowledge (Nonaka et al., 1996) and how management of this knowledge is essential for organisations and their survival in the existing context (Omotayo, 2015). Furthermore, it is also one of the most important sources for competitors of an organization to gain an advantage. Indeed, the relationship between knowledge and performance can be better comprehended by focusing on the four fundamental components of knowledge management: knowledge creation, knowledge acquisition, knowledge coding and knowledge transfer; the last is the element in which this study focuses on. Specifically, knowledge transfer is an efficient process used to increase the productivity of an organisation (Argote, 2000) and to obtain the best results and achieve an elevated level of innovation (Riege, 2007). According to Argote and Ingram (2000), knowledge transfer affects one unit through the experience of another. In particular, knowledge transfer improves the behaviour and activities of an organisation's members, (Omotayo, 2015) and therefore cannot be considered as simple as the movement of knowledge between people or from one place to another (Riege, 2007). Indeed, although most studies of business organisation address the issue of knowledge transfer dynamics by focusing on the characteristics and attitudes of the parties involved, it has emerged that these dynamics are influenced by the intrinsic nature of knowledge and its complexity (Szulanski, 1996). This complexity depends on the different understandings of knowledge. While the traditional Taylor and Herbert's theory point that is explicit, formal and systematic (Nonaka et al., 1996), others such as Nonaka and Takeuchi, who in agreement with Michael Polanyi, recognize a tacit knowledge that is hard to communicate, to transfer or to share with others.
In this context, digitalization, which can be defined as a socio-technical process of mass adoption of digital technologies (Yonghong et al., 2023), can concretely support the transfer of information, both inside and outside an organization (Bouncken et al, 2022), as it can eradicate the boundaries between an enterprise and external organizations (Yonghong et al., 2023). Indeed, digitalization and technology help organizations to connect, to cooperate, to communicate, to gain knowledge (Yonghong et al., 2023) and to facilitate the relationship with internal and external agents. It also allows for the reduction in information asymmetries (Nieto et al., 2023) rendering the information received more productive, fostering a greater learning from and with a variety of partners (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023). For these reasons digitalization is vitally important to organizations, undeniably becoming a priority for managers and policy-makers (Legner et al., 2017). Not all companies however, are digitally oriented and a clear example of this are family businesses (Nieto et al., 2023). It is in fact family businesses that are the object of this present research. Admittedly, some authors, namely Lubatkin and Schulze, point out that they are less innovative when compared to other types of enterprises (Bouncken et al, 2022). And in order to survive they must constantly learn, create, transfer and apply knowledge in an effort to adapt more easily to changes in the environment in which they operate (Zapata - Cantu L. et al., 2023). They need to manage the diffusion of information inside the organization, allowing the transfer of knowledge to increase the success of the family firm's succession process (Valenza et al., 2021) and beyond the perimeters of the family business, outside, between organizations into its own external environment. It is necessary to deepen the various types of knowledge which can be transferred (Mustake et al., 2017) and to also understand which forms are most important for the growth of the organization (Valenza et al., 2021). In this regard different studies illustrate how the differences between family and non-family firms depend on their own socio-emotional characteristics (Gômez-Mejia et al., 2007), as it particularly influences the tacitness level of family firm's knowledge and when this is very high, it can be very difficult to digitalize knowledge transfer (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023).
Based on the arguments discussed, the aim of this study is to understand how digitalization can impact on knowledge transfer dynamics in family businesses that are complex and influenced by various factors including the nature of the knowledge, the roles of family members, and the impact of digitalization.
2. Methodology
The methodology adopted in this study consists of a systematic review of the literature (Tranfield et al., 2003). This methodological approach, based on predefined criteria, is the reference standard for synthesizing evidence thanks to their methodological rigor.
2.1 Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
Three major academic databases were selected for the purpose of this study: Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. These databases, having extensive archives of scholarly articles, conference proceedings and critical academic publications in the fields of business management and digital technologies allow for a thorough and robust analysis.
As the objective of this research is to understand the dynamics of knowledge transfer in family businesses through digitisation, three specific initial keywords were chosen to capture the relevant literature and the essentials of the study: "digital·", "knowledge transfer dynamic·" and "family business·". Using these keywords, a comprehensive search strategy was developed, employing the Boolean AND operator to refine the search queries and improve the accuracy of the results
The search focused on peer-reviewed articles published up to July 2024 to ensure the inclusion of contemporary and relevant studies on the interaction between digitalization, knowledge transfer dynamics, and family businesses published in English. Attention was also paid to research that includes empirical data, theoretical frameworks, and case studies relevant to the topic. These criteria were applied to ensure the relevance, quality, and focus of the selected studies, resulting in a refined set of articles for detailed analysis.
The initial search founded no results in all databases used. For this reason, the second step was to modify the string replacing the keyword "family business·", step by step, with "family firm·", "family enterprise·", "family organization·" and "family compan·". Also in this case the search founded no results. Due to this, alternating this different synonyms in the string in all databases selected, the keyword "knowledge transfer dynamics" was replace with "knowledge transfer" to include a major number of articles in which the selection was made in function of the knowledge transfer dynamics concept. The results were then rigorously screened based on titles and abstracts to assess their relevance to the research questions.
2.2 Thematic Analysis and Synthesis
The articles selected after initial screening were subjected to in-depth full-text review through careful reading. The purpose was to check the relevance of the article to the research objectives and to include in the final analysis only those studies consistent with the topic under study.
Each article was read thoroughly to confirm its direct relevance to the research questions concerning the interplay between digitalization, knowledge transfer dynamics and family businesses. Detailed information was extracted from each article using a standardized data extraction form. This form included fields for authors' names and affiliations, year of publication to ensure the timeliness of the data, research methodologies, key findings, theoretical frameworks, and the identification of research gaps.
The data collected were systematically organized into specific thematic categories. This process allowed similar findings and theoretical references to be grouped together to promote a coherent synthesis.
Specifically, the mechanisms through which digitization influences the transfer both tacit (implicit, uncoded) and explicit (codified, easily shared) knowledge dynamics within organizations were attended to. It emerged, in this regard, how digital tools and platforms can support communication, collaboration and knowledge sharing especially in family businesses. With the chosen strings, the process of systematically analysing and organizing the extracted data provided a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research of digitization to support knowledge transfer dynamics within family businesses. This process simplified the detection of key trends and existing gaps in the literature, paving the way for future research directions. To increase the reliability and validity of the results obtained, data from the three databases were compared and cross-referenced for consistency and robustness of the identified themes. The comparison of the results obtained from the different sources was intended to reduce bias and strengthen the credibility of the conclusions.
Finally, a synthesis of the data obtained was made to more easily identify any gaps in the literature from which future theoretical studies could be drawn. The purpose was to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research on the topic studied to better clarify the impact of digitization on knowledge transfer dynamics in family businesses.
3. Results
The search strategy yielded varying results across the three academic databases, highlighting the importance of utilizing multiple sources for a comprehensive literature review. The following table shows results obtained.
After the initial retrieval of 520 articles, a meticulous screening process was conducted to assess the relevance of each article. This rigorous screening aimed to filter out articles that did not directly address the research questions or did not meet the quality and focus criteria established for this review. After this careful evaluation, 45 articles were identified as highly relevant and suitable for in-depth analysis.
The result produced by Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar (restricted to 45 after the screening process) offer a nuanced and complete view of the current state of research in this field on basis of the chosen search string. This summary underscores the necessity of utilizing multiple databases to obtain a holistic understanding of the literature landscape and to ensure that no significant studies are overlooked.
It should be noted that the choice of keywords influence the results obtained. So, making variations in the keywords might produce different results by capturing other relevant studies that were not identified using the strings of the present study. This suggests that a more flexible and iterative approach to keyword selection could enhance the comprehensiveness of the literature review.
4. Finding and Discussion
From the reviewed literature, different common denominators emerged. The results of the analysis will be presented below focusing attention on: knowledge and knowledge transfer dynamics in family business and the impacts of digitalization on knowledge transfer dynamics in family business.
4.1 Knowledge and Knowledge Transfer Dynamics in Family Business
In general, knowledge assets, which are challenging to replicate and transfer, have become the primary source enabling organizations to achieve superior results compared to their competitors. Unlike the assets which traditionally formed the basis for competitive advantage, knowledge assets now play a crucial role in driving organizational success (Zapata-Cantu et al., 2022). For these reasons family businesses must stay open to new ideas and continuously update their knowledge to align with emerging market trends and technologies, preventing stagnation and ensuring profitable use of their knowledge base (Andersen, 2015; Filippini et al., 2012; Wang, 2016, Putz et al, 2023). The presence of dynamic changes means that no single solution or routine can be long-term, as such rigidity can hinder business development (Wang, 2016; Putz et al, 2023). In this context, what is important is knowledge renewal that can be sourced from suppliers, customers, employees, and intermediaries and their networks (Boyd et al, 2012; Klewitz et al., 2012; McAdam et al., 2010, Putz et al, 2023). So, intra and inter-organization relationships became essential to exchange information inside and outside (Zahra et al, 2007; Zapata-Cantu, 2021). However, other authors indicate that family firms are less inclined to share knowledge (Mazzola et al., 2008; Botero et al., 2021; Zapata-Cantu et al, 2021) when there is a lack of trust, commitment, predecessor involvement in the training of a successor and organizational culture (Zapata-Cantu et al, 2021). Also, strong social relationships within firms facilitate the adoption of new technologies and resource sharing, enhancing business performance (Meng et al.). Collaboration among family members promotes the dissemination of technological ideas, strengthening continuous innovation and business resilience (Gamba, 2019; Meng et al.). Engaging with stakeholders allows companies to quickly identify and integrate new market trends, crucial for developing new products and services (Chaudhary et al, 2018; Chen et al., 2009; Fredrich et al., 2019). Effective knowledge transfer within companies requires strong communication, facilitating mutual learning and innovation (Szulanski, 1996; Tsai, 2001) especially for tacit knowledge transfer, which is fundamental in creating a strong competitive advantage, as Letonja and Duh (2016) point out.
In this regard, taking into account the importance of relational social capital, i.e. the positive attitudes existing between the parties involved (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998) and cognitive social capital, i.e. the codes, languages and narratives shared between the parties involved (Lane and Lubatkin, 1998) in knowledge transfer dynamics, the role of family members in the knowledge transfer process is crucial; the older generation, often the repository of tacit knowledge, plays a central role in guiding and mentoring the next generation, Zapata-Cantu et al. (2023) emphasise that these older members must be actively involved in the transfer process to ensure that valuable tacit knowledge is not lost. The successors, typically the next generation, are responsible for integrating and applying this knowledge to move the company forward. Valenza et al. (2021) emphasise the importance of successors being properly prepared and involved in this process to facilitate a smooth transition and continued business success. Valenza et al. (2021) point out that ensuring critical knowledge is preserved and passed on to the next generation is vital for maintaining the longevity and success of the business. Maintaining a repository of both tacit and explicit knowledge helps family businesses stay competitive, as underscored by Zapata-Cantu et al. (2023).
Regular evaluation of the knowledge transfer processes is essential for continuous improvement. Feedback mechanisms allow for the assessment of the effectiveness of these processes, enabling businesses to adapt and refine their methods based on changing needs and feedback from participants. This ongoing adaptation ensures that knowledge transfer remains effective and aligned with the evolving goals and challenges of the family business.
4.2 The Impact of Digitalization on Knowledge Transfer Dynamics in Family Business.
One of the main observations that emerges from the analysis of the selected literature is that knowledge transfer dynamics in family businesses are influenced by digitisation despite the fact that this type of business is less oriented towards this process than other types of organisations (Zapata-Cantu et al.). Digitisation helps, in fact, to break down internal organisational and external boundaries, fostering better collaboration and communication also with one's partners (Bouncken et al. 2022).
The sourcing, sharing, and processing of information through digital technologies improves the connectivity and dissemination of information within and outside the company (Radicic and Petković, 2023). Through digital platforms advanced technology tools can increase a company's efficiency and better support customers by streamlining organizational processes (Ardito et al, 2021).
In particular, family businesses, which generally have a wealth of industry-specific skills and knowledge-spanning generations (Sirmon et al, 2003; Iwu et al., 2024), can demonstrate a remarkable ability to adapt to new technologies, using digital tools to improve decision-making and management processes. Additionally, these factors could improve the competitiveness of the family business (Prasanna e al, 2019) benefiting from both external and internal environmental knowledge (Breivik-Meyer et al, 2020; Iwu et al, 2024). These benefits encourage family businesses to cooperate (Chirico et al, 2020, Iwu et al, 2024). Digital technologies also support the creation of collaborative environments that enhance intergenerational communication and promote the sharing of competencies, essential for succession and the professionalization of successors (Del Rio Castro et al., 2021, Nieto et al, 2023).
The transfer of tacit knowledge in the digital age poses a challenge. According to Brynjolfsson et al. (2023) tacit knowledge is interpersonal in nature and requires direct interaction that may be difficult to pursue by digital means alone. Furthermore, there are many benefits of effective knowledge transfer, for example, as Riege (2007) argues, improved innovation capabilities that lead to better performance and competitive advantages.
The ability to leverage digital technologies to improve knowledge management and support innovation is seen as a key element for the long-term success of family businesses (Zapata-Cantu et al., 2022).
4.3 Implications, Limitations and Future Research Directions
The findings emerging from the present study could influence future research on the impact digitization has on knowledge transfer dynamics in family businesses. Due to the great importance of digital technologies in improving knowledge management processes, there is a need to identify digital tools and platforms specifically for family businesses. For example, possible solutions could be the adoption of artificial intelligence tools, data analytics and collaborative platforms that have a relevant impact on knowledge creation, sharing and utilization processes. In addition, it is necessary to understand how the specific characteristics of family businesses (e.g., their dependence on socio-emotional wealth and intergenerational dynamics) may limit or promote digital transformation in this type of organization.
Future research should also be conducted by seeking to understand how the characteristics of family businesses may influence the impact of digital technologies on knowledge transfer dynamics. Thus, the role of family governance structures, the involvement of multiple generations in decision making the impact of family values and culture on digital orientation should be considered.
What emerges from this study is the importance of external networks and collaborations that enable family organizations to enrich their knowledge base. For this reason, it is very important to focus on the mechanisms that these enterprises adopt to create relationships with external stakeholders, such as suppliers, customers, and industry associations, to enrich their digital skills and knowledge.
Understanding how family businesses can leverage resources from the external environment to enhance innovation and competitive advantage requires an understanding of these relationships.
Knowledge transfer is a complex process, especially that of tacit knowledge, so future research should deepen, emphasizes the need for further research into methods and practices that can facilitate this process in the digital age. It would be interesting to understand how digital technologies can be designed and applied in organizational settings to support the transfer of tacit knowledge, which in family businesses is represented by the experiences and knowledge of family members. This would make it easier to understand the impact of digitization in family businesses.
The present study was conducted comprehensively on the chosen keywords but nevertheless has limitations. The first is that using specific keywords may unintentionally exclude relevant literature studies using different terminologies. More keywords or a different string should be considered in the future to include studies other than those found with the present study.
For the future, it would be advisable to conduct the studies without neglecting the geographical and cultural context in which family businesses operate, as these aspects influence the adoption and orientation toward digitization in knowledge transfer and by identifying digital tools and platforms that can best contribute to this process. Finally, future research could be conducted taking into account that the effectiveness of digitization affects the characteristics of family businesses that influence the effectiveness of digitization in knowledge transfer, for example, socio-emotional wealth, governance structures, and intergenerational dynamics.
By overcoming these limitations, future research directions could help to better understand the impact of digitization in knowledge transfer in family business.

Abstract: Objetivo: sistematizar los abordajes metodológicos y los resultados relacionados con la competitividad y la productividad, dentro de la gestión del conocimiento y la medición del capital intelectual. Diseño/metodología/enfoque: se realizó la revisión de la literatura, utilizando las directrices PRISMA y el integrated design en Scopus para analizar cómo se complementan los enfoques cuantitativo, cualitativo y mixto. Resultados: se encontraron cuatro estudios con énfasis en la productividad medida por la vinculación con las tecnologías de la información, y en los procesos de la gestión estratégica y del conocimiento; seis estudios centrados en la competitividad con la observación de variables como valor social, sostenibilidad, tercera misión, transferencia tecnológica, renovación económica; y, otros diez estudios que se aproximan de forma integrada a los conceptos de productividad y competitividad para explicar el impacto que tiene el conocimiento en el entorno y en los grupos de interés a través de variables como imagen, reputación, impacto sectorial, liderazgo, innovación y relacionamiento con la empresa. Por otra parte, se encuentra un consenso sobre el desagregado del capital intelectual en humano, relacional y estructural. Conclusiones: la investigación en gestión del conocimiento y capital intangible se encuentra en una etapa temprana con avances y consensos desde un enfoque mixto, en su mayoría desde un abordaje transversal sobre los tipos de capital y los elementos que favorecen la gestión y la medición. Los modelos de capital intelectual contextualizados para el sector garantizan el uso de la capacidad institucional para el cumplimiento de metas (productividad) y el impacto a los grupos de interés (competitividad), desde la sostenibilidad, la transferencia de conocimiento, la innovación y el compromiso con las comunidades, el relevo generacional y el liderazgo institucional. Originalidad: las revisiones sistemáticas previas estudian los conceptos y modelos de capital intelectual, pero ninguna se enfoca en crear valor a partir de los conceptos de productividad y competitividad en el contexto de la educación. Alternate abstract: Objective: To review studies about knowledge management and intellectual capital measurement in order to categorize their methodological approaches and findings. Design/Methodology: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and integrated design, this literature review was conducted using the Scopus database to analyze how quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods complement each other in this field. Findings: Four studies emphasized productivity, focusing on its relationship with information technologies, knowledge management, and strategic management. Six studies centered on competitiveness, examining variables such as social value, sustainability, third mission activities, technology transfer, and economic renewal. Ten other studies addressed both productivity and competitiveness in an integrated manner to explain the impact of knowledge on the environment and stakeholders through variables like image, reputation, sectoral impact, leadership, innovation, and relationships with the business sector. Moreover, the analysis revealed a consensus in the literature: intellectual capital can be divided into human, relational, and structural capital. Conclusions: Research on knowledge management and intangible capital is in its early stages, but it has made progress and reached consensus primarily using a mixed-methods approach. Most of this research has been cross-sectional and examined different types of capital and the elements that facilitate their management and measurement. Intellectual capital models tailored to the education sector guarantee that institutional capacities are employed to achieve goals (productivity) and impact stakeholders (competitiveness) through sustainability, knowledge transfer, innovation, social commitment, generational shift, and institutional leadership. Originality: Previous systematic reviews have examined concepts and models of intellectual capital, but none had focused on value creation from the concepts of productivity and competitiveness in education.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Preserving historical architectural structures is crucial for safeguarding cultural heritage. This study explores the application of Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM) to enhance the documentation process of the Ghiqa Historical Market in Saudi Arabia, a monument known for its intricate architecture and cultural significance. Traditional documentation methods often fail to capture detailed features accurately and rely on labour-intensive manual processes. HBIM uses advanced digital technologies to improve precision, efficiency, and preservation efforts. In this study, point cloud data from 3D laser scanning is used to create a detailed digital model of the market, covering structural systems, material attributes, architectural features, and historical context. The research also integrates historical archives and photographs to enrich the model with additional contextual information. This comprehensive approach provides a holistic understanding of the Ghiqa Historical Market, aiding accurate preservation and restoration decisions. HBIM offers several advantages in architectural documentation. The digital model enhances visualization, allowing stakeholders to explore the site from multiple perspectives. It also serves as a tool for analysing structural integrity, identifying potential risks, and planning restoration interventions. Moreover, digital documentation ensures effective knowledge transfer across generations, preserving valuable architectural heritage for future reference and research. Additionally, it promotes interdisciplinary collaboration among architects, historians, conservators, and other stakeholders involved in preservation. Including the Ghiqa Historical Market in the UNESCO World Heritage List would highlight its global significance, attracting international attention and resources for its preservation. This designation would underscore the market’s cultural and historical importance, fostering a sense of pride and responsibility in its maintenance. The implementation of Heritage BIM demonstrates its potential to revolutionize heritage conservation by combining diverse data sources into a single, detailed, and accessible digital resource.

Abstract: In order to solve the problem of sensitive information leakage of power data in machine learning and artificial intelligence processing, this paper proposes a method of civic-text data reinforcement based on time series generation adversarial network, which combines knowledge transfer and Rényi differential privacy protection framework to balance privacy and availability, while improving the accuracy of the model. First, the generative adversarial network generates training data that is similar to the real data but secure through adversarial learning, ensuring that even if the data is stolen, the original information cannot be inferred. Secondly, through the integration of recurrent neural network training and autoencoder, the dynamic and static characteristics of the power load data can be effectively captured, and the high dimension of the learning space can be reduced. In addition, knowledge distillation technology is used to guide the generator of training student models through a powerful teacher network of knowledge transfer, improving the diversity and quality of the generated data. Finally, from the four aspects of privacy, data similarity and diversity, and practicability, the practical application value and potential of the framework for electricity consumption data are comprehensively evaluated.

E-mentoring: A mathematical cohort for the Gen Z higher education learners

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/e-mentoring-mathematical-cohort-gen-z-higher/docview/3087001741/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Mentoring, a mechanism for knowledge and skill transfer is not new to people across the globe. In Indian context, the traditional Gurukula system is the best example of mentoring where the Sishya (mentee / protégé) who is usually a less experienced youth would serve the Guru (mentor), who is a teacher and an elderly person with rich experience for good knowledge transfer. The concept of relation in mathematics could be applied in e-mentoring. Though traditional face to face mentoring has advantages like ability to read the body language signals and facial expressions along with establishing a good rapport between mentor and mentee, E mentoring is proving its effectiveness in terms of solving issues in critical crisis period. From 594 students from AICTE approved institutions in Tamil Nadu, the response was recorded. Findings of the current research study makes it clear that the digital natives or the students belonging to Generation Z are more conversant with the latest technological developments and more curious about using them which makes them to feel convenient with e-mentoring in the place of traditional face-to-face mentoring. It may also open a door of opportunity to different sectors of students like students from different disciplines, students with special needs, destitute students and students from low socio economic background who belong to Generation Z.

Abstract: A decision of the Federal Joint Committee Germany states that negative pressure wound therapy is not accepted as a standard therapy with full reimbursement by the health insurance companies in Germany. This decision is based on the rapid report and the final report of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care, which demonstrated through systematic reviews and meta-analysis of previous studies projects that an insufficient state of evidence regarding the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for treatment of acute and chronic wounds exists. The Institute for Research in Operative Medicine (IFOM) as part of the University of Witten / Herdecke gGmbH is an independent scientific institute that is responsible for the planning, implementation, analysis and publication of trial projects regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapy for acute and chronic wounds in both medical sectors (in- and outpatient care) in Germany. The study projects are designed and conducted with the aim to provide solid evidence regarding the efficacy of NPWT. The trials evaluate the treatment outcome of the application of a technical medical device which is based on the principle of negative pressure wound therapy (Intervention Group) in comparison to standard wound therapy (Control group) in the treatment of chronic foot wounds and acute subcutaneous abdominal wounds after surgery. All used treatment systems bear the CE mark and will be used within normal conditions of clinical routine and according to manufacturer's instructions. The aim of the trial projects is to compare the clinical, safety and economic results of both treatment arms. Study results will be provided until the end of 2014 to contribute to the final decision of the Federal Joint Committee Germany regarding the general admission of negative pressure wound therapy as a standard of performance within both medical sectors. Introduction: Adequate patient recruitment is a key condition determining the validity, duration and costs of RCTs, yet remains challenging. The expanding interface between therapeutic endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery for the treatment of benign gastrointestinal diseases demands RCTs to compare safety and cost-effectiveness of comparable interventions. We aimed to identify patient motives and barriers for (non)participation in the TREND study. Methods: Patients with large rectal adenomas counseled between January and July 2011 for participation in an RCT comparing endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) with transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) were invited for a semi-structured interview (14 participants, 12 non- participants). Interviewees were asked to discuss their main motive for (non-) participation in an open fashion. Subsequently, potential other barriers and motivations as previously described in the literature were presented by the interviewer. Interviews were coded and analyzed by 2 independent researchers. Results: We interviewed 10 participants and 7 non-participants, aged 54-84. Key motive for trial participation was contribution to medical science and future clinical practice (all participants). Other motives included satisfactory counseling, sufficient time to reflect and the sense that participation was completely voluntary. The vast majority of non-participants had previous in-hospital experience, however more than half had not been introduced to research prior. Although most non-participants felt contributing to research was important, key barriers to participation included a distinct preference for either EMR (n=4) or TEM (n=3) or intervention-specific characteristics like type of sedation (all non-participants). Consultation of family members affected half of all decisions. Study characteristics such as randomization, blinding, insurance and ethical approval hardly influenced the decision making. Conclusion: In RCTs comparing similar endoscopic and surgical strategies, thorough, tailored and timely counseling is crucial to clarify the study purpose and to emphasize the presumed equality of allocation arms. Avoidance of common barriers to participation will improve trial inclusion. The establishment of clinical trial centers creates a demand for both infrastructure and skilled staff. While establishment and operation of clinical trial centers in surgical specialties have in recent years often been conducted by medical staff in addition to clinical practice, the intensification of legal regulations and the increased number of clinical trials in surgery requires rethinking. The ability to fulfill these more specialized demands can only be given by allocating sufficient funds. These funds can be used to employ trained paramedical staff and furthermore to release medical staff from clinical work and thereby enable full-time scientific work. On the other hand, a demand for funding is risen to implement infrastructural requirements such as IT hardware and premises. Once a clinical trial center has been established, further operation has to be ensured by generating additional funds. While the demand for start-up financing of a clinical trial unit is most meaningful arranged by governmental or institutional fundraising, the operation relies on generating sufficient funds through the conduction of industry-initiated trials. Own experience and further possibilities are demonstrated by reporting on different strategies for funding of clinical trial centers and the general demand of funds during establishment and operation of clinical trial centers. Therefore, different governmental, industrial as well as institutional supports are relevant factors. In Europe safety management requirements in clinical trials with medical devices were changed fundamentally by the council directive 2007/47/EC in 2007 and internationally with the ISO 14155:2011 in 2011. Previously adverse incidents had to be reported to the competent authority. Since implementation of the directive in Germany each serious adverse event (SAE) which happened or might have happened to a patient, user, or third party, must be reported immediately. Sponsor and investigators must report SAEs via an electronic form centrally provided by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM). Besides profound knowledge adequate IT equipment at all investigator trial sites are needed. The latter being a challenge for academic trials with their low budgets. To develop operational competence the quality management (QM) working group of the Clinical Trials Centers (CTC)-network developed a harmonized SOP describing thecomplex procedures of safety management for sponsor and investigator trial sites. It includes appendices providing among others definitions, a template for an SAE-manual, and instructions for completing the electronic form. This document particularly suggests solutions regarding more general regulatory requirements,e.g. follow-up information for the sponsor or for the competent authority. The implemented safety management procedures consider experiences derived from clinical trials with medicinal products and the special characteristics of academic trials. As increased numbers of clinical trials with medical devices are to be expected according to changed regulations CTCs will become more experienced with these complex procedures. Thus they will be competent partners to industry in conducting national and international clinical trials with medical devices. Our report will show the challenges of coping with this novel electronic reporting process, and provide our experiences in fulfilling the updated changed German national regulations. Due to the ever increasing global activity in clinical research, knowledge transfer between researchers and all stakeholders in clinical health care (including patients) worldwide is an indispensable requirement. A prerequisite for knowledge transfer in clinical research is an unbiased and complete view on clinical trial results. How is the arising number of clinical trials registries and results databases being utilized by different user groups including ethics committees, clinicians, patients, researchers, reimbursement and funding institutions? What are the different requirements defined by the parties involved? How can variable needs be met? What seem to be the arising issues concerning database content, language barriers, retrieval problems, implementation of knowledge into daily work, evaluation of existing evidence? What efforts are made to overcome the obstacles? Meanwhile it is daily experience that conduct of a clinical quality assurance audit involves some kind of computer system to be considered and assessed. The following fundamental question comes immediately to mind: how valid are data and information kept and handled by the systems employed? This question will be subdivided in five parts for the purpose of this session: Where does the basic computer system used come from, how has it been implemented and validated and how is it maintained? How has the computer system application used in a specific trial been developed, validated and deployed and how is it operated and maintained? Which regulations, guidelines and state of the art standards are to be expected to be observed for development, validation and operation? How big are the risks on data quality and acceptability of the study outcome in case of malfunction of the computer system application? How high are chances that system weaknesses can be detected in a standard audit setting and how can auditors optimise the preparation and conduct of their review to detect hidden system bugs? The session presents an overview over the current situation, naming specific risks and gives some answers to the questions posed afore, mainly by giving practical examples how to proceed in the most frequent audit situations, namely investigator site audits (eClinical and electronic source documents), CRO system audits and vendor audits. A flexible and simple Bayesian decision- theoretic design for dose finding trials is proposed in this paper. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we adopt a working model which produces analytic posterior distributions. In addition, this working model is sufficiently flexible to fit all monotonic dose-toxicity curves. We also discuss how to use a proper utility function to reflect the interest of the trial. Patients are allocated based on not only the utility function but also the chosen dose selection rule. The most popular dose selection rule is the one-step-look-ahead (OSLA), which selects the best so far dose. More complicated rules such as two-step-look- ahead (TSLA) are surely more efficient than OSLA only when the required distributional assumptions are met which is however often not the case in practice. We carry out extensive simulation studies to evaluate a variety of dose selection rules and have found that OSLA is often more efficient than TSLA under our proposed method. Moreover, our simulation results show that the proposed method performs superior to several popular Bayesian methods and the negative impact of prior mis-specification could be considered in the design stage. Isotonic Design using Normalized Equivalent Toxicity Score (ID-NETS) is a novel Phase I design originally proposed by Chen et al. by integrating the novel toxicity scoring system proposed by Chen et al. and the original Isotonic Design proposed by Leung et al. ID-NETS has substantially improved the accuracy of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation and efficiency of trial by fully utilizing all toxicities of each patient and treating toxicity response as a quasi-continuous variable instead of a binary indicator of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in a Phase I clinical trial. To facilitate designing and conducting a Phase I clinical trial with ID-NETS, we have developed a user-friendly software ID-NETS©TM, which has two functions: 1) Calculating the recommended next dose level from completed data; and 2) Performing simulation to obtain the operating characteristics of a trial. Currently, ID-NETS©TM v1.0 is available for download at http://winshipbbisr.emory.edu/IDNETS.html. Building on the toxicity probability interval (TPI) design in Ji et al. (2007), we present a modified TPI design (mTPI) that is calibration-free for phase I trials. Our goal is to further simplify the design and improve the trial conduct, and provide more effective and safer methods while maintaining the simplicity of the original TPI design. Like the TPI method, mTPI consists of a practical dose-finding scheme guided by the posterior inference using a simple Bayesian model. However, the new method benefits from improved dose-finding decision rules based on a new statistic, the unit probability mass (UPM). The improvement through the use of the UPM for dose finding is significant. We will present extensive simulation results comparing the mTPI design to the 3+3 and CRM methods, and provide convincing evidence why the mTPI is a practically superior method. Among the most recent advances in escalation with overdose control (EWOC) based Bayesian adaptive phase I clinical trial designs, Tighiouart et al (2011) developed EWOC based on the proportional hazards model (EWOC-PH) using time to toxicity to estimate the MTD. The method has been shown to be more efficient to estimate MTD comparing to the original EWOC and a version of time to event EWOC (TITE-EWOC) proposed by Mauguen et al (2010). In this study, we will further extent EWOC-PH to take into account patients' baseline covariates. The extension of EWOC to accommodate baseline covariates has been developed by Babb and Rogatko (2001) and Tighiouart and Rogatko (2010). We expect that the new design will provide better safety protection by assigning a personalized dose to the next available patient based on his/her own baseline characteristics and lead to an estimation for covariate specific phase II dose. We assess the operating characteristics for the design via extensive simulations including three scenarios: (1) design using a covariate; (2) Design ignoring the covariate; (3) Design using separate trials. The efficiency of estimating the conditional MTD and safety of the trial are compared with original EWOC with covariate using DLT as a binary indicator of toxicity. Escalation with overdose control (EWOC) is a successful Phase I design and has been widely used. Chen et al. further extended EWOC to utilize fully all toxicities of patients instead of a binary indicator of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) by incorporating the normalized toxicity scoring system (NETS) proposed by Chen et al. into EWOC with a quasi-Bernoulli likelihood approach. The new design is called EWOC-NETS which has been demonstrated by simulation studies to have good operating characteristics and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation relative to common Phase I designs. In this study, we have developed an interactive software called EWOC-NETS©TM which is very user friendly to facilitate designing and conducting a Phase I clinical trial with EWOC-NETS and available for free download at the website of Emory University http://winshipbbisr.emory.edu/Software.html. We would like to introduce this novel statistical software and translate EWOC-NETS into Phase I cancer clinical trials in the future. Some clinical predictors may or may not have monotonic properties. They may have increasing or decreasing pattern or they may remain steady during a period of observation time. A clinical question is raised on how such increasing or decreasing or constant pattern of variations may have effect on survival or on clinical outcomes independently during a period of time. Generally we ignore such point of transitions and independent pattern of variations while investigating their overall effect. Isotonicity is called the simple or partial ordered monotonicity mathematically. Isotonic regression is performed under ordered monotonic restrictions criteria. Either increasing or decreasing or constant variation of a clinical predicator or of a prognostic variable generates a change-point problem at the transition from increasing order to decreasing order or vice versa or from the steady condition to either increasing or decreasing pattern of clinical predictors. The primary thrust of this paper is to address such clinical questions using a Cox Regression Model with isotonic regressors with such change-point problems. In a case study with multiple myeloma the impact of such change- point patterns of clinically significant predictors such as hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen, white blood corpuscles, platelets on patients median survival time have been explored. Policy makers in Denmark are starting to realize that RCT designs are needed if they want to know the impact of social interventions. Therefore the Ministry of Social Affair granted funding to do three RCTs of family programs (Multidimension Treatment Foster Care-MTFC, Parent Management Training Oregon -PMTO and Multisystemic Therapy-MST). During the last year SFI has been planning the studies including all relevant parts in the process. The process has been long and challenging. Problems faced include: 1: A pronounced resistance to randomization within all levels of social services. 2: An economic crisis in the municipalities causing both unwillingness to participate in the research study and a significant lower caseload in the MST and MTFC teams. 3: Fear of the study going to steal half of the families from the programs. 4: Underfunding of the studies. 5: Resistance against using standardized tests because this is not common in social work, and 6: Difficulties in getting data for power calculations. Recurring issues that we have had to deal with are: "do we really have to randomize? Can't we just do some kind of matching?" and "it would be much better to spend the money on a wider implementation of the program and practice oriented qualitative research." Recently the MST study was cancelled since all five MST teams declined to participate. Funding was transferred to the other two studies making them look more promising. A lot of resources have been used to prepare the studies and expectations are high. Hopefully by May 2012 the MTFC study will be recruiting families and the PMTO study will be ready to start recruiting in September 2012. If all goes well the two studies will be among the first RCTs carried out on social interventions in Denmark. Regulatory goals for a clinical study can be different from research and exploratory goals. For the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Phase 3 Investigational New Drug (IND) studies (i.e., adequate and well- controlled studies) will provide the primary clinical evidence to support a marketing application such as a Biologic License Application (BLA). To support approval and initiation of these studies, the protocol should cover all the statistical issues considered by the reviewers when assessing the study design and its ability to adequately address the study objectives. As an aid to statistical reviewers, as well as to improve efficiency and consistency in our reviews of these protocols, the Division of Biostatistics in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) has developed a checklist outlining the important elements of a Phase 3 protocol. Some elements included in this checklist are consistency between the study objectives and endpoints; number and regions of study sites; statistical hypotheses; planned interim analyses; sample size assumptions and calculations; randomization description; blinding techniques; analysis populations; multiplicity considerations; missing data considerations; study success criterion; and study conduct. Original IND submissions with protocols with such elements may also lead to less correspondence with the sponsor to clarify items in the protocol. We note that the elements identified in this checklist may also be helpful in designing earlier phase studies as well as non-IND studies. This presentation will focus on the motivation, contents, and use of the checklist. In non-inferiority trials, a pre-specified margin of non-inferiority must be defined a priori. However, what happens when an acceptable risk varies according to physician risk tolerance or patient circumstances, so a pre-specified margin of non-inferiority cannot be easily defined? We will discuss a double-blind clinical trial in which SLE patients on long-term MMF therapy with stable disease are randomized to continue therapy or withdraw. It is expected that withdrawal from MMF will result in increased risk of disease reactivation; however, long- term MMF treatment is not without risk of side effects. The goal of the trial is to determine if the increase in risk of disease reactivation outweighs the benefits of withdrawal. One could frame this goal as a test of the non-inferiority hypothesis that the increased risk of disease reactivation is greater than a pre-specified margin, determined by potential benefit. However, how the risks and benefits should be weighed is highly individual, even for experienced rheumatologists. Rather than design the study to test a hypothesis of non- inferiority using an arbitrary risk margin that may or may not be relevant for any particular patient, the results of this trial will be reported as effect estimates for change in risk of disease reactivation in addition to other disease activity, safety, quality of life and medication use endpoints. These effect estimates and confidence intervals will describe the risks and benefits of withdrawal from study therapy and may be used to guide physicians and patients in making decisions based on individualized assessments of acceptable risk. As clinicians are likely to find interpretation of results difficult in the absence of hypothesis testing (and p-values), we will discuss the approach planned for disseminating clinical trial results. Cluster randomised trials (CRTs), compared to individually randomised trials, require specific analysis; statistical models need to take account of between-cluster variability. This abstract focuses on two main approaches to analysis, cluster-level (CL) and individual-level (IL), and examines their efficiency for the Training Caregivers After Stroke trial (TRACS). TRACS is a CRT evaluating a complex intervention in stroke rehabilitation with 928 dyads of patients and caregivers within 36 stoke rehabilitation units. The primary outcome is NEADL score at 6 months. CL analysis is attractive due to its simplicity. We compare performance of three techniques; simple summaries (using appropriate two- sample weighted t-tests), CL analysis adjusted for covariates and nonparametric methods. The CL approach is a two-stage method; in unadjusted analysis, a summary measure for each cluster is calculated and two sets of cluster-specific measures are compared using the weighted t-test. When performing CL analysis adjusted for covariates; we carried out an IL regression with all but intervention effect covariates ignoring the clustering effect. Secondly, we compared the residuals for each cluster between treatment arms using the weighted two-sample t-test. Wilcoxon's rank sum test was used as a nonparametric substitute to the two-sample t- test. IL analysis, using a random effects linear mixed model with stroke rehabilitation units as level 2, was the preferred method, because of its greater computational convenience and it is possible to analyse the intervention effect and other covariates simultaneously. The CL approach is robust, particularly for a smaller number of clusters. However, it may not be statistically the most efficient, especially if clusters are of varying size. Such weighting is incorporated in IL analysis. Analysis of cluster randomised trials can be undertaken in a number of ways. We will present and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each of these analytical methods. Simple randomisation is the easiest method for allocating participants to treatment groups in clinical trials. In the long run it balances all features of participants across the groups but may not be suitable for small to medium sized trials, or for larger trials at the time of interim analysis. If important prognostic factors are identified at the design stage then minimisation can help to balance these features. There is uncertainty as to whether treatment groups need to be balanced at baseline, but many researchers believe this to be advantageous, allowing comparison between groups without the need for sophisticated analysis. Balance between treatment groups can be desirable in a range of scenarios: for small trials, interim analyses, early termination, analysis of subgroups or where the credibility of an unbalanced trial is considered problematic (e.g. in the case of a small treatment effect). Three completed trials of varying size, originally using minimisation as method of treatment allocation, were "re-randomised", in the order that participants joined the study, using simple randomisation. Datasets frozen at the time of either interim or full analysis were used. For all three trials treatment allocation was well balanced across prognostic variables and between treatment arms when using minimisation at all time points, i.e. for any number of participants recruited at that time. With simple randomisation, at each timepoint imbalances were identified that could have made analysis more difficult. In some cases the potential imbalance across treatment groups within a factor reached 100% (where all participants with a given characteristic were in the same treatment allocation group) and no amount of sophisticated analysis could compensate for this. The simulations demonstrated the need for incorporating minimisation into the randomisation algorithm of trials of any size in order to achieve treatment balance which cannot be achieved by using simple randomisation alone. A futility analysis is commonly utilized in clinical trials for early read of trial efficacy data. An investigational drug will be declared futile if the prespecified futility boundary is met, and the trial will be stopped. In a conventional group sequential design, a futility boundary is selected based on power preservation or sufficient conditional power, which protects the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis at the end of a trial. However, the observed treatment effect size is of increasing importance beyond rejecting the null hypothesis and is directly associated with the eventual success of drug development. To ensure a high probability of observing a desired effect size, or in another words a high probability of success, we propose a new futility analysis design approach where the futility boundary is selected based on preserving the probability of success. We define the relative preservation of this probability as "pseudo-power", using which we propose the boundary selection criteria. Via a case study, we evaluate various operational characteristic of this approach in term of the probability of correct and incorrect stopping, with respect to the futility boundary, the underlying true effect size and the timing of the futility analysis. Increasingly, the NIH and Industry sponsors are establishing large multi-center collaborative research efforts that implement multiple studies simultaneously through a network of investigators. This presents a challenge for the sponsors and leadership teams who are responsible for monitoring activities across studies. The business world has addressed this need for complex information monitoring systems with a high- level summarized overview called a dashboard. We created a web-based dashboard for the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC), a large, federally-funded, multi-center research consortium. The consortium has eight active studies that are being conducted across ten clinical centers with total projected enrollment of over 3500 participants. Many research programs provide web-based resources to aid stakeholders with study supervision. Unfortunately, traditional study portals can be hindered by an overabundance of information and tedious top-down navigation. These characteristics make them an inefficient resource for large multi-center programs. Our dashboard avoids the typical information- dense, hierarchical construction of traditional websites in favor of a comprehensive single- webpage display that is easier for stakeholders to access and use. Dashboards summarize and display critical information on a single page, with an emphasis on graphical, rather than text-heavy displays. Our dashboard has a main page for the consortium, which provides comparative enrollment graphs for the active studies, and displays pertinent deadlines and announcements. Each study also has a dedicated page that follows this same "dashboard" approach. We update the dashboard data weekly. Sponsors have responded positively to the ICAC dashboard, voicing appreciation for the system's efficient presentation of data and ease of use. Given the success of the dashboard, we plan to expand the system to other federal and commercial programs. Our experience suggests that multi-center or multi-study programs would benefit from creating a dashboard to provide sponsors and network leadership teams with key study monitoring information in a quick, succinct manner. Due to the lack of infrastructure in resource poor settings and despite the strong need for Clinical Research coordination, Information and Communication Technology has not been systematically and sustainably integrated into health research, hospital administration and practice, thus limiting efficiency and outcomes of the efforts to fight poverty related diseases. Cloud-based technology could now overcome infrastructure scarcity problems of resource poor settings and thus greatly support Clinical Research by integrating mobile, online, offline and Voice over IP technology. The Italian Inter University Consortium Cineca, a non-profit Consortium of Italian Universities for high performance computing and ICT, has an over 20 year experience in providing technological support to health research for activities related to the design and development of IT systems and services in the health care and biomedical area, using advanced technologies and methodologies. In particular, since 2008 Cineca has been involved in projects providing and developing technology to collect and analyze clinical and health related data in Africa. The European funded project Medishare, coordinated by Cineca, successfully managed to collect standardized data for over 15000 patients affected by HIV/AIDS, Malaria and TB in Kenya Tanzania and Uganda in one central database. Medishare was recognized supportive of the Millennium Development Goals by the United Nations. The Europe - Africa Research Network for Evaluation of Second-line Therapy (EARNEST) is a trial supported by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) that is successfully using Cineca integrated technology in Uganda, Malawi, Zimbabwe. Cineca exploits the integration of newer technologies to fill in the infrastructural gaps of Africa and provides a sustainable centralized infrastructure which is fully certified for quality, safety and security procedures. We have developed a LIMS to manage biobank samples for the Scottish Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (SERA) cohort study. Commercial and open-source solutions were evaluated and it was concluded that development of a bespoke LIMS system was needed to provide scalability and flexibility to support future projects with different requirements. The system developed includes a generic workflow which is capable of modelling:* Complex storage configurations with up to 1024 dimensions over multiple geographic sites * Storage rules for sample type, method and time of storage * Multi-event work flow processing from site collection to arrival at labs * Lab technician workflows incorporating working plate practices * Manual and automated validation methods using a combination of 1D and 2D barcode technologies The system is based on a tree structure; all samples are stored in a parentage tree that shows the lineage of the sample allowing for exploration of any number of generations of derived samples. Our tree based approach allows the LIMS to be largely generic. By defining the storage, site configuration and the collection protocols the system can operate with scenarios ranging from a single lab collecting ad-hoc samples, to a multi-lab, multi collection site protocol hosting thousands of samples. We will discuss the functionality provided by the LIMS system, the tree based design and the possibilities it allows, the pros and cons of the development, its integration with two additional large multicentre, multinational, clinical trials and future functionality enhancements. The Glasgow Safe Haven aims to provide the physical location and informatics infrastructure to permit confidential and secure access to routinely collected healthcare data for research purposes. We will discuss the design of this infrastructure illustrating how the availability of routinely collected data can potentially enhance the design and delivery of clinical trials. This will include: * Extraction of prescription and laboratory data during the follow-up phase of a clinical trial * Identification of potentially eligible participants for a multicentre clinical trial in sub-clinical hypothyroidism using centrally held routinely collected laboratory data * Building a clinical data warehouse in specific disease areas to support clinical trial feasibility assessment. We will discuss the proposed governance and access structure. The presentation will be illustrated with examples of trials that will benefit from this infrastructure. The Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow have been involved in the development of electronic solutions to enhance the conduct of clinical research projects for many years. This includes integrated secure electronic solutions for enrolment and randomisation (web and IVRS), electronic data capture and management via e-CRF (on- and off-line), trial management, information delivery and reporting, eg Independent Data Monitoring Committees. Our systems have been implemented for many clinical trials both commercial and academic. To enhance our ability to produce robust and validated systems efficiently we foresaw a requirement for a standardized library of components. In addition, our systems have to be able to provide specific functionality in accordance with our trial requirements. Included in our system:Standard screens and functionality to allow trial co-ordinators to register their own users and assign the appropriate access rights.Inclusion of previously developed screens eg standard questionnairesDemographicsConcomitant medicationsMedical historyStandard measurements eg Height, Weight, Blood PressureAdverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, and regulatory reporting requirementsMetrics required for reporting to funders within the United KingdomImplementation of CDISC SDTM to standardize our databasesNotification and communication to users, either by email or bulletin style within the systemDocument repository to ensure all sites have correct versions of approved documents We will discuss the implementation of these components in our recent clinical trial systems and how this has improved efficiency in delivering validated systems to our clients. In addition, we will discuss and further explore our implementation of CDISC formats Objective. We present a community developed system focussing on clinical sites, operated as a service by the Clinical Trials Center of the University of Cologne, which employs collaborative peer reviewing in order to support timeliness, efficacy, accuracy and safety in site management. Background. Managing clinical sites in a trial can be very resource-intensive for sponsor and for study site, this, largely due to disconnect in systems and processes, impeding different parties from collaboratively capturing organizational data meaningful to all. Methods. Sponsors, Coordinating Centers, Sites, Study Groups, Societies, Networks and other relevant parties participating in clinical trials each are individually best positioned and incentivized to capture and/or monitor certain organizational trial data. On clinicalsite.org role-based access and specific views enhance individual value and incentives. Reusability of data, meaningful to all, provides the strongest incentive. As a case in point, roles and responsibilities in a trial can be syndicated to be displayed on institutional websites. The data can also be aggregated to the trial track record by the investigator as part of his CV. The sponsor, in turn, can review site and investigator qualifications electronically, cutting turnaround considerably. Furthermore, with roles formally captured and confirmed, the system can act as a Physician Master Index and provide authentication and authorization credentials for external systems. A plugin framework enables parties to embed their own apps while saving the data locally. An API for various services and formats can serve data for aggregation within external systems. Both options provide added value and minimize centrally hosted data, ensuring better data privacy compliance. Results. Currently 1282 trials with 1681 investigators and 997 organizational units involved are managed in the system. Conclusion. Our approach provides critical organizational data of quality with less effort. Exposing the data for reuse and aggregation unlocks new possibilities within and outside the system. Within any organization the workflow structure and departments are clearly defined. Through a case study we will examine the lessons learned and outcomes when staff within specific departments are trained round robin to understand the functions of other departments. By specifically reviewing the cross training of Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) to periodically perform data entry within a CRO, we show meaningful subject matter expertise improvements, positive study impact, and a gain in project efficiency. Pros: Learning Experience: The trainer becomes more familiar with details of his or her position when outlining a training program to teach others. The trainee once completing the instructional information has a broader picture of the entire process and often is able to see the bigger picture and the results of where their work is going. Error Identification: CRA's have the skills to notice consistency errors that a site may be making emphasizing the need for additional training or reeducation in a particular area. CRAs have the expertise to identify clinical errors including but not limited to the incorrect use of a specific form and inclusion/exclusion criteria errors. Cons: Time and Funds: CRA's are often paid at a higher rate than data entry staff and their talents may be better utilized in their respective area of expertise. Analysis of Data: CRA's in most cases have a significant understanding of site operations and clinical information which usually equates to a slow data entry process as they are always scouring data for errors and not just entering what is documented. After considering both pros and cons and the review of a case study where CRA's perform data entry tasks for quality purposes this often proves to be beneficial not only to the project, but Corporate Structure and capabilities. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) was a randomized controlled trial, funded by the National Cancer Institute, to determine whether screening with low-dose helical computed tomography reduces lung cancer mortality relative to screening with conventional chest x-ray in persons at elevated risk of lung cancer. It was comprised of two components: the Lung Screening Study (LSS) and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN). The Coordinating Center (CC) for the LSS (n=34,614) provided coordination and data management support for 10 screening sites. One CC challenge was to ensure completeness and accuracy of data collected throughout all stages of the study (e.g., recruitment, screening, follow up, endpoint verification, close-out). As part of monitoring, the CC conducted visits to each site annually for 9 years. Visits included observation of procedures and random chart audits. Chart audits served to confirm source documents for consents; eligibility and randomization verification; screening results; and diagnostic evaluation and followup. On-site monitoring also provided an opportunity to review and reinforce key study elements with project staff. Annual assessments of the CC audit plan resulted in 6 revisions to the audit form and 4 revisions to the chart selection, reflecting evolving focus from recruitment through close- out. Throughout the trial, 2457 randomly selected charts (7%) were reviewed. Source documents verified ~ 50 data elements during Year 1 and >150 data elements in later years. While chart audits confirmed overall data integrity, selected findings included 17 changes in eligibility status, 18 new protocol violations, and >200 requests for data clarification and modification. The CC found that chart audits were an important part of the total monitoring plan, and that it was important to develop a flexible approach. We will present the challenges of chart audits as part of a monitoring plan throughout the lifecycle of this complex long-term multi- center trial. Clinical trial sponsors are required to set up appropriate measures to monitor the conduct of the trial. The aim of monitoring is to ensure the patients' well being, compliance with the approved protocol and regulatory requirements, as well as data accuracy and completeness. Classical monitoring approaches that rely on on-site visits are useful for some of these purposes, but extensive source data verification is extremely time consuming and may have only a limited impact on data quality. It is therefore not surprising that the current practice of performing intensive on-site monitoring is coming into question and that interest focuses on more pragmatic, risk- based approaches that improve the cost- effectiveness ratio without compromising the quality and integrity of clinical trials. A recent draft guidance of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reflects this trend and states unequivocally: "FDA encourages greater reliance on centralized monitoring practices than has been the case historically, with correspondingly less emphasis on on-site monitoring". In this presentation, we first review the potential sources of data errors in clinical trials. We then outline the principles of central statistical monitoring and the challenges of its implementation in actual trials. Results from both terminated and on-going trials are presented to illustrate typical findings that can be expected from the monitoring approach. We conclude by a discussion of the potential role and limitations of central statistical monitoring, and we argue that it can both optimize on-site monitoring and improve the quality of clinical trial data. Reference: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM269919.pdf (accessed 10 November 2011). Due to a dramatic increase in the number and complexity of clinical trials and the costs associated with them, the FDA recently introduced a draft guidance "Oversight of Clinical Investigations - A Risk-based Approach to Monitoring". This new guidance suggests it is acceptable to use alternative approaches to monitoring clinical trials including remote monitoring, centralized monitoring, and risk-based monitoring. The guidance also suggests that source data verification should be focused on critical fields (key efficacy and safety variables) and less than 100% source data verification for less important fields may be acceptable. The guidance gives a clear signal encouraging sponsors to explore cost-effective ways to conduct clinical monitoring instead of relying solely on the on-site monitoring. KAI Research, Inc. has used a variety of alternative approaches to assess data quality and patient safety in its support of NIH clinical trials which often do not have budgets for 100% monitoring. We will describe lessons learned from implementing risk based monitoring approaches that include a central data review to identify potential anomalies. The anomalies help to focus site visits. Focusing on critical data elements has also helped to streamline monitoring visits. We have also implemented centralized monitoring techniques on a sample of data from each of the sites in a study. Through a description of these examples, we will demonstrate alternative methods for ascertaining data quality and subject protection that are both cost effective and efficient. We will also describe how our monitoring plans consider complexity of the study, risk associated with the intervention as well as its safety profile, severity of the illness of the study subjects and experience of the investigators and study sites. We will demonstrate that well thought out alternative approaches to monitoring can meet FDA's expectations for quality assurance and participant safety. Considerable time and expense are incurred to ensure data quality in a long-term clinical trial. The Protocol Monitor assumes much of the scientific responsibility of closely checking the accuracy and completeness of data collected prior to construction of the final data set. Administrative responsibilities involve assuring clinical sites' adherence to the protocol, federal guidelines and regulations. Eighty-two clinical sites participate in the Age- Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) and are following approximately 4,000 participants throughout five years of follow-up. Data pertaining to effects of supplemental doses of xanthophylls and omega-3 fatty acids on the progression of age-related macular degeneration and vision loss, among other clinical outcomes, are collected at annual visits. Four AREDS2 Protocol Monitors serve as the front line of communication between the study leadership and the clinical sites. The Monitors employ multiple strategies to assist the sites in meeting project deliverables. Routine performance includes standardized protocol review calls on a variety of topics and frequent review of multiple types of data anomaly reports. Monitoring responsibilities constantly change in nature and effort with the revolving door of new Clinic Coordinators and amendments or additions to the protocol through the life of the study. When a new Clinic Coordinator is hired by a site, the Monitor must quickly determine the Coordinator's knowledge of the protocol, disease topic, and general skills required for the proper conduct of clinical trials. Some clinical sites have educational sessions in place or access to the previous Clinic Coordinator, and others do not. The monitor also carries much historical knowledge of a site's subject population and may serve as a valuable resource to the new Clinic Coordinator. The many different hats of a Protocol Monitor, as experienced in AREDS2, will be described as both a challenging and rewarding experience. It has been suggested that central statistical monitoring may serve as the foundation for quality assurance and center monitoring in multicenter clinical trials (Knatterud 1998; Buyse 1999; Baiget 2008; Eisenstein 2008). Authors have proposed that central statistical monitoring may identify procedural errors, data errors and data fabrication at centers. Since there are no published evaluations of the different ways of performing central statistical monitoring to detect fraud, we constructed several prognostic models using data from a multi-center trial in which the data from 9 of 196 centers were documented to be fabricated. These data were used to build a series of risk scores to predict fraud at centers. Five different risk scores were identified and each had the ability to discriminate well between centers with and without fabricated data (area under the curve values ranged from 0.90 to 0.95). True and false positive rates are presented for each risk score to arrive at a recommended cut off of 7 or above (high risk score) out of a possible score of 12. We validated these risk scores, using an independent multi-center trial database that contained no data fabrication and found the occurrence of false positive high risk scores to be low and comparable to the model-building data set. With further validation, these risk scores may become part of a series of tools that provide evidence- based central statistical monitoring, which in turn may improve the efficiency of trials, and minimize the need for expensive on-site monitoring. Phase II studies in cancer usually consider short-term outcomes such as response, that are to some degree 'surrogates' of phase III outcomes, most typically overall survival (OS). Understanding the relationships between phase II and phase III outcome measures is essential in designing phase II trials and understanding the degree of reliability with which we can move between phases. We consider the association between alternative phase II outcome measures and OS in advanced colorectal cancer (aCRC), to identify measures which may predict treatment effect on OS in phase III trials. Phase II outcomes of response, disease control, continuous tumour measurements and progression-free survival (PFS) were considered. Using surrogacy methodology originally proposed by Buyse et al (2000), estimates of R-squared(R2) were calculated to assess the relationship with OS for each outcome. Individual patient data on 5435 patients from seven trials of aCRC, recruited between 1999 and 2007, were obtained. Data from three 3- arm trials were split to form two treatment comparisons each, resulting in a total of 10 grouping units. As the reference outcome, response was found to have poor predictive ability of the treatment effect on OS, with R2 (trial)=0.14, 95% CI (-0.28,0.56). A much stronger relationship was observed for continuous tumour measurements (R2(trial) =0.65 (0, 0.86)) and PFS (R2(trial)=0.59 (0.18,1.00)). The relationship between OS and disease control was slightly weaker, but still stronger than for response, with R2(trial) =0.44, 95% CI (-0.05,0.93). Sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate alternative grouping units and the impact of covariates. Issues faced in applying surrogacy methodology to the phase II setting, and using these results to identify an optimal outcome measure for phase II aCRC trials, will be discussed. Specific issues include the use of OS as an appropriate phase III outcome, comparability of R2 values for differing outcome measures, and the number of grouping units incorporated. Since 2004, we have developed five phase II trials in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL), utilising six different statistical methods. Two trials have closed to recruitment and three are currently open. The rationale behind the different designs and methodologies used will be explained. Difficulties and learning experiences with the implementation, wider understanding and interpretation of the trials will be discussed. CLL201 used Gehan's two-stage approach to assess response, and randomised to a control arm which was not included for formal comparison, but to give validity of the study results. The two stage approach was difficult to implement and of limited use as it only considered efficacy and not safety. Challenges were faced regarding the inclusion and interpretation of the control arm, although randomisation proved to be valuable. CLL207 was a single arm trial designed using Bryant and Day's two-stage design, incorporating toxicity considerations as well as efficacy. The two-stage aspect worked well, but the implementation of a toxicity stopping guide proved problematic. ARCTIC and ADMIRE are two large, randomised phase IIb trials, both formally powered to compare responses against a common control arm. One of the trials assesses non-inferiority. The choice of the unusual phase II design, and difficulties in justifying it to reviewers will be discussed. COSMIC is a randomised selection design with two experimental arms, combining two phase II trial designs to firstly assess efficacy, and secondly select the treatment to be taken forward. The A'Hern one-stage design is used to determine which treatments are eligible to be further investigated. In the case where both are acceptable, Sargent & Goldberg's selection criteria will be used. The sample size was inflated to ensure acceptable power for selecting the best treatment. Single-arm Phase II consolidation/maintenance trials in oncology are currently designed to show an improvement in Progression-Free Survival (PFS) when considered against historical controls. PFS includes duration of second line therapy (SLT), treatment free interval (TFI), and time on the investigational therapy (IT). We hypothesize that the duration of SLT, the time on the investigational therapy and patient enrollment plan can affect efficacy measures from maintenance trials and might result in underpowered studies. Efficacy data from four published single-arm consolidation therapies in second remission in ovarian cancer (Sabbatini et al, Gyn Onc 2010, 116(1):66-71) are used for illustration. The studies were designed to show increase in estimated median PFS from 9 to 13.5 months (mos). We partitioned PFS as the sum of the duration of SLT, TFI, and duration of IT. We calculated the statistical power when IT is given concurrently with SLT or following SLT by varying the start of IT. Required sample sizes varied with duration of SLT. If IT starts with initiation of SLT, only 34 patients are needed to provide 80% power to detect a 33% hazard reduction. Alternatively, if one accrues 34 patients at start of SLT with expected 33% hazard reduction and the duration of SLT delays the start of IT to 7.5 months, the power drops to 50%. To maintain 80% power in this scenario, either the protocol therapy would have to reduce the hazard by 50%, or sample size would have to increase to 104. A longer duration of SLT is associated with lower statistical power unless the magnitude of benefit with the new investigational treatment is greater than expected, or the sample size is increased. Designs of consolidation trials should take into account the duration of SLT, by either excluding it from the definition of PFS or restricting it per protocol. Background: RCTs frequently use mortality review committees to assign a cause of death (COD) rather than relying on COD assignments on death certificates (DCs). The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), an RCT of lung cancer screening with low dose radiation computed tomography versus chest x-ray among heavy and/or long-term smokers, used a committee blinded to arm assignment to determine whether COD was due to lung cancer. Methods: NLST's committee reviewed a subset of deaths, chosen by a pre-determined algorithm. The algorithm selected deaths with a DC COD that were most likely to represent a death due to lung cancer (either directly or indirectly) and deaths that might have been erroneously assigned a DC lung cancer COD. Also included were deaths within six months of a screen suspicious for lung cancer and within 60 days of certain lung cancer diagnostic evaluation procedures. Using the committee assignment as the gold standard and a lung cancer COD as the outcome of interest, we calculated positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the death certificate COD assignment (lung cancer vs. non-lung cancer). Results: The committee examined and assigned COD for 1643 deaths (42% of the 3877 NLST deaths). Sensitivity was 90%; specificity, 97%; PPV, 97%; and NPV, 88%. The kappa statistic was 0.87. 40% of the deaths with a DC non-lung cancer COD reclassified to lung cancer had a DC COD of a neoplasm other than lung. Limitations: 2141 deaths with a DC-non lung cancer COD were not reviewed because the DC COD was unlikely to have been in error. Had these deaths been reviewed and assigned a non-lung cancer COD, the specificity would have been 99% and the NPV 97%. Conclusions: When assigning lung cancer COD among heavy/long-term smokers, death certificates provide accurate information nearly all the time. To streamline the implementation of clinical studies, reduce start-up time and accelerate data aggregation across studies, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) together with KAI Research, Inc. (KAI), embarked on common data element (CDE) projects. KAI has developed a systematic approach to the development and implementation of data standards. These standards span the entire study lifecycle, facilitating study start up, data collection and management, and data archiving and sharing. With more and more CDEs developed, establishing standard approaches to manage CDEs becomes critical. This abstract will provide information on the challenges with creating, implementing and managing standards. The challenges as well as our best practices in overcoming these challenges are:- Keeping up with current standards (CDISC, caBIG, etc.) Harmonization efforts ongoing Regular communications with these groups key- Reviewing the Literature Including references for the CDEs adds credibility Publications may lack detailed data management information- Limiting the universe Identification of core CDEs (those most essential for data collection) Build from existing forms to gain buy in from the clinical research community- Creating a team of experts Identifying who should be part of the team Advantages and disadvantages to top down vs. bottom up development- Establishing standard procedures for standard development Development of standard procedures in parallel to standards Internal standard review committee for quality and consistency- Tools to enhance use Dictionary, template forms, suggested edits, data management plan (DMP), etc. Website design/ layout - making it user friendly. The process for creating, implementing and managing standards has been met with many challenges but the benefits outweigh the frustrations. CDEs and standards have demonstrated enhanced data quality, decreases the time and resources needed to develop a study database, and helps customize the DMP. The Practitioners Engaged in Applied Research and Learning (PEARL) Network, a National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research- sponsored network of practice-based dentists have successfully created a data service on the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid's (caBIG's) open source platform (caGrid). PEARL has registered the semantically annotated model and implemented the necessary registration interface steps and posted the de-identified clinical data on the caGrid. PEARL has taken the needed steps to create harmonized, semantic metadata in order to leverage the collaborative nature of caBIG with use of caBIG grid architecture and services. PEARL created the metadata based on the International Organization for Standardization Metadata 11179 Model in the Cancer Data Standards Repository (caDSR) which uses the semantic linkages of the hierarchical ontology contained in the National Cancer Institute's Enterprise Vocabulary Service. New components created by PEARL are:1321 Data Elements999 Data Element Concepts254 Value Domains PEARL used caBIG grid architecture to share Oral Health Inventory Profile and Tooth Sensitivity data from a study of postoperative hypersensitivity (Study PRL0602) following resin-based composite restoration of posterior teeth. The related Unified Modeling Language (UML) model for this data set has been registered in the caDSR where the related CDEs are classified as part of the UML model and visible in the UML Model Browser as a collection. PEARL encountered some challenges during implementation. Firstly, some issues and bugs had to be resolved with the system configuration and web services communication that required additional steps between PEARL and the caGrid team. Additionally, the caGrid data extraction process is not as intuitive as anticipated, and requires detailed instructions to overcome this barrier to data sharing. The projected benefit is that exposing clinically relevant data and the needed descriptive metadata that underpins those data provides informed, meaningful access to researchers, clinicians, and patients. The Clinical Trials Management Systems (CTMS) workspace within the caBIG® program was tasked to deliver integrated software solutions to the clinical research community. These tools are vetted by the community, who require the ability to securely gather, exchange, explore, integrate, and reuse data and information for clinical trials research. As a result the CTMS Workspace developed modular, interoperable and standards-based software tools designed to meet diverse clinical trials data management needs. The tools developed were configurable to work within trial sites with little or no clinical data management systems in place, as well as those sites with extensive existing systems. These tools took into account the diversity of clinical research activities and local practices that existed among trial sites. CTMS software tools enable management of clinical trials tasks such as: patient registration; patient scheduling; integration of laboratory results; adverse events capture/reporting; and the capture, analysis and sharing of clinical data among relevant systems. All tools are also available as a modular enterprise clinical trials management system designed to facilitate clinical workflows and data sharing in single and multi-site settings for use in trial sites. To continue the development/support of these tools with community and industry participation, the caBIG® program is evolving from its role as an active software developer to a facilitator of open source, community-based development. The NCI will provide a range of mechanisms to support open-source development efforts, including:* Processes to report software defects and suggest feature requests, * Forums for information exchange, * Resources for software version control and distribution, * Support of an open source governance framework with an emphasis on standards. We will discuss the implementation plan and the crucial factors for the continued development of these tools through the open-source model, and how this will serve the ultimate mission of furthering cancer research. When a clinical trial subject has a serious adverse event (SAE) or other significant adverse event (AE), such as those leading to the discontinuation of the study, a narrative is written for the clinical study report. These AE narratives summarize the details surrounding the event to enable understanding of the circumstances that may have led to the occurrence and its subsequent management. Such details may include the dose of study drug at the time of the event, the duration of the dose prior to the event, concomitant medications taken at the time of the event and used to treat the event, and other AEs that may have recently occurred. Other details include demography, medical history, laboratory results, the severity of the event and whether the event was related to study medication. Narratives are typically written from the original SAE report faxed from the clinical site in combination with data listings generated as part of the study deliverables. Information contained in the typical narrative requires manual review of these disparate data sources. This is time- consuming and often will require additional review and quality control. Too often, these narratives are written when the full data becomes available, which may become a rate-limiting factor in completing the study report. Since its inception in 1997, the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) has developed standards for data models, study design and supporting clinical trial documents. CDISC standards have made such gains that the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research strongly encourages their use and implementation for the submission of new drug applications. The benefits of CDISC standards for statistics, programming and data management are well established. We will illustrate how these data standards can be used to facilitate composition of adverse event narratives. Background: Unique characteristics of cluster randomized trials (CRTs) complicate the interpretation of standard research ethics guidelines, including from whom, when, and how informed consent ought to be obtained. As part of a larger project to generate ethics guidelines for CRTs, we reviewed a random sample of 300 published CRTs and found that participant consent was reported in only 63% of trials. Whether this reflects an under- reporting of consent, or actual consent practices, is unclear. We therefore conducted a survey of the CRT investigators to (a) gather detailed information about consent practices in the selected CRT, and (b) investigate factors associated with obtaining participant consent in CRTs. Methods: A web-based survey was administered to corresponding authors of the sample of CRTs, in a series of six contacts. Trialists surveyed were based in USA/Canada (47%), UK/Ireland (18%), elsewhere in Europe (21%), Australia/New Zealand (5%), and various low/middle income countries (9%). Results: The survey response rate was 64%. Participant consent had been sought for some aspect of the study in 93% of trials: in 79% of trials consent had been sought from participants at the individual level (56% for the experimental intervention(s), 75% for data collection). Among CRTs with participants at the cluster level, 82% indicated that consent had been sought from cluster level participants (62% for the experimental intervention(s), 75% for data collection). Factors associated with individual level consent for the experimental intervention(s) were a smaller cluster size, and whether experimental and data collection interventions were targeted at the individual level. In addition, setting (healthcare vs. non-healthcare) was associated with seeking individual level consent for data collection. Conclusion: Unique characteristics of the CRT design are associated with participant consent practices, which are under-reported in CRT publications. Further ethical analysis is required to determine whether CRT consent practices meet the highest ethical standards. In some cases it is difficult for study participants to obtain access to a successful study intervention after the conclusion of a clinical trial. A number of international ethical guidelines call for researchers to provide access to products post trial for study participants when they are proven effective and unavailable through local mechanisms. The nature of this ethical obligation is debated, and the moral basis for such an obligation should help determine who bears responsibility for fulfilling it. There is no consensus among bioethicists about whether this is a firm obligation and if so, whether it is based on the idea of reciprocity or gratitude, as a safeguard against exploitation, as compensation for risk or burden, or some other basis. Also, ethical analysis is complicated by the fact that other community members who need the same medical care may have a competing claim for access to the product. Moreover, practical challenges in ensuring post trial access are numerous, and often multiple stakeholders need to be engaged. An interesting consequence of the call for post trial access is that many pharmaceutical companies decline to participate in research studies in countries where they have no plans to register their products. When studies are conducted in developing countries, challenges may arise due to slow or non-existent regulatory structures, lack of funds for product procurement and delivery, and lack of infrastructure. For research sponsors such as NIH, lack of authorization to use funds for non- research purposes may hamper efforts to support post trial access. These ethical and practical challenges will be discussed in detail, with recommendations for future policies to address them. Background: Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) have unique characteristics that complicate the interpretation of standard research ethics guidelines. We conducted an international web-based survey of research ethics chairs in advance of a consensus meeting to generate ethics guidelines for CRTs. Methods: We included all biomedical ethics committees in Canada and the UK, and a random sample from the USA (one per institution). After the initial e-mail invitation, we sent three e-mail reminders and a final postal reminder. The 45-minute questionnaire presented three hypothetical CRTs evaluating: a community-level health promotion intervention, an educational intervention targeted at health professionals, and distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets to villages in a low income country. Using closed- and open-ended items, participants were asked to indicate the type of review required (full board or expedited), whom they would consider research subjects, and objections that might be raised "Use of Lorazepam for the Treatment of Pediatric Status Epilepticus: A Randomized, Double-Blinded Trial of Lorazepam and Diazepam" (Status2), is a protocol conducted under the Best Pharmaceutical for Children Act (BPCA) to evaluate efficacy and safety of lorazepam compared to diazepam in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) in status epilepticus (SE). Because of the potentially life threatening presentation, the narrow therapeutic window, and the lack of proven, effective treatments for SE in the pediatric population, this study was approved under the auspices of 21 CFR 50.24, the Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC) for Emergency Research. Navigating the regulatory requirements required significant sponsor, study management and site resources. The design of the protocol included informed consent, data collection and follow up procedures to assure protection of human subjects under EFIC. All sites (14) conducted community consultation and public disclosure activities that were reviewed and approved by the sponsor and local IRBs. The sponsor created training materials on the EFIC regulations to educate study personnel and local IRB members and to assist with community consultation planning. Opt-out procedures were implemented at each site and nationally prior to study initiation. Due to the emergency nature of SE, protocol deviations were common. These included incorrect weight estimation and therefore inaccurate dosing, and failure to adhere to timely study procedures. Study monitoring included assuring that legally authorized representatives of study subjects were approached in a timely manner and that opt-out and study procedures were followed in accordance with the study protocol. In conclusion, significant resources are required to meet the requirements of the Exception from Informed Consent regulations. Emergency conditions may preclude a carefully controlled study environment, so good training and monitoring are required to ensure that all protocol deviations are accurately recorded and reported to local IRBs. Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) is the most common safety-related reason for withdrawing a drug from the market. Therefore, it is critical to assess potential hepatotoxicity from treatment using an analysis of liver-related laboratory tests. A starting point is to plot peak values of lab measurements with regard to the upper limit of normal reference ranges to identify patients with elevated levels of bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase as potential Hy's Law cases. However, this plot alone does not acknowledge the temporal considerations of Hy's Law and liver injury. Following the FDA Guidance of DILI evaluation, this view can be augmented to flag patients based on the occurrence of elevated liver tests within a clinically- relevant time period. Moreover, by incorporating the temporal dependence of liver test elevations, the frequency and duration of Hy's Law instances across treatment groups can be interrogated and reported. This presentation will highlight a statistically-driven interactive visualization approach implemented in JMP Clinical software to streamline the detection of potential DILI cases through summary views of lab test elevations and Hy's Law occurrence that lead to targeted patient time trend plots and cross-domain profiles for further clinical insight. It can be challenging to perform a concise and easily-interpretable analysis of adverse events (AEs). For therapeutic areas where patients have frequent AEs, understanding the safety profile of a new intervention is critical. In these instances, however, understanding the analysis is made more difficult by the sheer number and variety of AEs that occur. Traditionally, the incidence of adverse events is presented in lengthy tables, with coded AE terms grouped by body system or system organ class and presented in order of descending frequency. Many times, statistical testing is not be performed due to the high likelihood of committing multiple Type I errors. Further tables may highlight AEs that occur for specific periods of time (for example, treatment phase or off-treatment follow-up). Needless to say, it is difficult to summarize this information to gain a clear understanding of the risk (or benefit) a new therapy may present. Incidence analyses of adverse events are straightforward to present graphically using Volcano Plots to highlight treatment differences. Color indicates the treatment with higher incidence, with bubble size representing the total number of events that occur during the trial. Adjustments for multiple comparisons can be presented in a manner to clearly indicate which events exhibit statistically significant treatment differences. Further, the study can be broken into distinct time windows, with multiple plots or animation displaying changes in adverse event risk over time. This presentation can emphasize early differences across treatments that may eventually resolve or highlight events that could approach significance given a longer study duration. The use of Volcano Plots is illustrated with an analysis of data on aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. We describe the challenge of collecting adverse events (AE) data in an unmasked randomized treatment trial. The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study randomized 1,636 participants to either observation or to treatment with eye drops to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) to prevent the development of glaucoma. Masking would have been impossible to maintain. Participants could become unmasked at free IOP screenings or non-study eye examinations. Clinic personnel would become unmasked by measuring IOP to adjust medication to achieve IOP treatment targets. Efficacy outcomes were masked, but AE data were collected by unmasked clinic personnel and participant self-report. At 24 months, 774 AE's had been received, 31% in the observation group and 69% in the medication group. The clinic to clinic rate in AE reporting ranged from 7% to 60% signaling a standardization problem. To improve standardization, we reduced branching logic, consolidated forms, included more check boxes and used a scripted interview. The Data Safety Monitoring Committee recommended that AE data received prior to these protocol changes be excluded from future publications. In the 18 months after these protocol changes, 1,688 AE reports were received, more than double the previous rate, 44% of the AE's were in the observation group and 56% in the medication group. It is striking that the differential between groups decreased from 38% to 12%. This suggests that potential surveillance or detection bias in an unmasked treatment trial can be reduced by a rigorous protocol. Stem cell clinical trials for cardiovascular disease in the last decade have been well tolerated with preliminary evidence suggesting efficacy. Standardization of endpoints is important to facilitate comparisons across studies. We describe our methods of safety and efficacy assessment based on our experience coordinating multiple studies using various cell populations and administration methods. Adverse events (AEs) are collected after enrollment, evaluated by independent medical monitors throughout the trial and coded using the most current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and reviewed every 6-months by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) are defined as death, hospitalization for heart failure or non-fatal recurrent myocardial infarction. Patients are evaluated for complications during study product administration and within 24-48 hours. Cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and Troponin) are collected every 12 hours for the first 48 hours. Echocardiograms are performed following the procedure and within 24-48 hours to assess for pericardial effusions. Incidence of arrhythmias is assessed by ambulatory electrocardiograms. Hospitalizations are adjudicated independently and classified as cardiac related or not. Ectopic tissue formation is assessed using CT scan. Functional benefit is evaluated using New York Heart Association Class, Six Minute Walk Test, Peak VO2, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Quality of life is measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is used for assessing global and regional function. Patients who are device dependent undergo cardiac CT at baseline and 12 months. Clinical trials of cardiovascular cell therapy are expanding due to the excellent safety profile and early signs of efficacy. Safety is paramount and constantly monitored. Centralized cores such as imaging labs are important to maintain consistency and independence. As therapies evolve, consistency in the endpoint assessment should be considered to ensure comparability across studies. Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) require efficient subject recruitment and retention. Often the management of such a trial poses significant challenges. EAGLE (Effectiveness, in Angle closure Glaucoma, of Lens Extraction) is an international multi-centre, pragmatic, publicly funded randomised controlled trial (RCT). EAGLE addresses whether removal of the lens of the eye for newly diagnosed Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma results in better clinical, economic and patient focussed outcomes compared with standard management. The EAGLE management team are UK based; however identification, recruitment and three year participant follow up is executed by staff working in sites across the UK, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, (Peoples Republic Of) China and Australia. The EAGLE study design requires minimal direct contact between the UK management team and the participant. The maintenance of effective working relationships between the UK management team and the international recruiting teams is, therefore, crucial to project success. To conduct EAGLE across different health care, legal, and cultural settings, a robust but pragmatic protocol was designed. A process for individual site assessment in terms of suitability as a recruiting site was developed involving honest discussion of trial budget and realistic timelines at outset. Maintaining momentum and focus on the research question among collaborators was addressed through site visits, regular scheduled video conferences, newsletter bulletins and an ongoing training regime of bespoke design that altered as appropriate when the trial matured and entered new phases. Global teleconferences were negotiated across time zones. Escalating costs of printing and translating trial paperwork into three different languages required re-profiling of a fixed budget without compromising trial delivery. This paper describes the challenges encountered in EAGLE across the first half of its data collection journey and the strategies employed to overcome them. The EAGLE study experience is widely applicable to any centrally managed international multi-centre RCT. Background: Multicenter clinical trials are designed to generate data that may be generalized across diverse populations with the goal of facilitating unbiased answers to important medical questions. The Food and Drug Administration, the Office of Human Research Protections, and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) support the use of a centralized IRB review process, that is, a single IRB of record for a given protocol, to improve multicenter trial efficiency. Most recently, the DHHS proposed to change the Common Rule to include mandated centralized review for multicenter trials; however, there are concerns that the benefits of centralized review have not been sufficiently demonstrated. Methods: We identified published articles relating to centralized review through PubMed and hand searching. We categorized articles by topic and type (commentary or empirical research). Results: Our review includes 78 sources. Of these, 22 articles describe inefficiencies and inconsistencies with multiple review (12 empirical), 4 articles compare multiple to central review (1 empirical), and 5 articles describe barriers to the adoption of central review (1 empirical). The single empirical study directly comparing multiple and central review showed that affiliation with a central IRB was associated with faster reviews and financial savings. Several limitations of the empirical work were noted: 1) Absent a standardized metric for measuring review quality, all studies focus on efficiency, without informing the debate over the ethical quality of central versus local review, 2) Methodological quality is weak, as the majority of articles are case studies using a sample size of less than 20, and 3) The existing empirical work is not generalizable, as it is unclear how descriptions of prior practices would carry over to a still-undefined system of mandated centralized review. Conclusions: The limitations of the existing empirical work constrain meaningful conclusions about centralized review. The storage and tracking of regulatory documents in a large, long-term clinical trial can quickly become unmanageable without a proper tracking system. Gone are the days of manual files, as clinical trials move to the use of electronic regulatory tracking databases. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) is a multi-centered clinical trial designed to assess the effects of oral supplementation of high doses of macular xanthophylls and/or omega -3 fatty acids for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and cataract in just over 4,000 participants. The Administrator and Protocol Monitors at the AREDS2 Coordinating Center have the immense task of tracking regulatory documents for the 82 clinical sites and the 1200 past and present clinical site personnel. A customized electronic regulatory tracking system, Site Management Utility (SMU), was implemented to manage all regulatory documents including those required for study activation at participating sites. SMU enables staff to efficiently track such documents as IRB approvals, medical licenses, Human Subject Protection Training notifications, and protocol specific certifications. The utility also allows the Coordinating Center to maintain a full project contact list and archive of present and former staff. During the study start-up phase, SAS reports linked to regulatory information in SMU were generated to monitor completion of all requirements for study activation. Throughout study follow- up, a SAS program was run to generate automatic email reminders to the clinical sites at 60, 30, and 7 days prior to IRB and/or medical license expirations. SMU and other effective tools utilized at the Coordinating Center will be highlighted during this discussion of efficient methods of regulatory tracking and storage. EHR4CR (Electronic Health Records for Clinical Research) is a research project funded by the European Union Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) within the Innovative Medicines Initiative framework. EHR4CR is a collaborative project involving primarily universities, the pharmaceutical industry with input from organisations and groups representing patients and covering aspects of the law, ethics and technologies associated with the use of electronic data for research purposes. The EHR4CR project aims to improve the efficiency of, and reduce the cost of, conducting clinical trials, by better leveraging routinely collected clinical data through development of both an EHR4CR platform (primarily tools and services) and implementing an innovative and sustainable EHR4CR business model. Introducing innovative technology involves cost, new ways of working and organisational change. The multinational scope of the project means that every effort must be made to ensure that the approaches, methodologies and technologies conform to local and international legal and ethical requirements related to data protection, privacy and confidentiality. The project must also conform to the standards required by national and international drug regulators (MHRA, EMA, FDA, etc.) and satisfy the needs of the pharmaceutical industry. The approaches taken also need to be acceptable to the general public, patients, medical professionals (both study investigators and otherwise), and also to politicians and professional bodies sensitive to the concerns of their constituencies. Proactive management of the complex network of European stakeholders external to the EHR4CR project team is an essential task which will continue throughout the full four year lifecycle of the EHR4CR project. This presentation describes a pilot exercise that has been carried out in Scotland in order to develop a best practice approach for local national stakeholder identification, analysis engagement and management during the development phase of the EHR4CR project. A summary of the key outcomes of the Scottish pilot activity and the planned next steps for roll out of the stakeholder management process across Europe will be presented. Randomized Phase 2 oncology trials are mainly aimed at demonstration of improved efficacy (e.g. improved Progression Free Survival, Overall Survival) and acceptable safety profile of the target therapy versus the control therapy. With the development of the new bio-assay technology, biomarkers may provide an important role in demonstrating mechanism of action and pathway intervention of drugs and provide preliminary evidence of treatment effect of the target therapies. In addition, biomarkers may also be used to select patients who are mostly likely to benefit from the treatments. Based on preliminary biological hypothesis of the biomarkers, data generated from Phase 2 studies can be used to identify biomarkers that have predictive potentials on treatment effect. The potential predictive effect of biomarkers can then be further tested in large Phase 3 trials with adequate planning to provide more definitive evidence of the utility of the biomarker for patient selection. In this presentation, we will discuss the exploratory statistical analysis of biomarker data for randomized Phase 2 oncology trials and the impact of the analysis on Phase 3 study designs. Both continuous and categorical biomarker data will be discussed. Applications of statistical methodology including survival analysis, subgroup analysis, logistic regression analysis and time dependent ROC curves will be presented. Potential confounding factors of the biomarkers will be discussed. Experience on practical considerations in exploratory biomarker data analysis such as data collection and transfer, potential un-blinding, ascertainment rate will be shared. The sponsor owns the responsibility for a clinical study to comply with the protocol, including enrollment of patients who meet eligibility requirements. It is the responsibility of the investigator to give the best care available to patients. Struggles sometimes result when investigators, who have enthusiasm and optimism that a particular investigational drug will benefit their patients, have disappointment when trial eligibility criteria exclude patients that they want to enroll in a study. Patients who are enrolled into studies when they are on the edge of eligibility can chip away at the statistical power of a study to demonstrate treatment benefit. From the statistical perspective, having a homogeneous population with a smaller variance can have more statistical power for analysis than having a larger sample size when the population is more heterogeneous and the variability is greater. The enrichment design (referenced in FDA's Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics, Draft Guidance; CBER, CDER, 10 February 2010) when supported by a conditional sequence of hypothesis tests using methodologies proposed by Bauer (cited in the FDA's draft guidance on adaptive designs) offer an opportunity for a trial to enroll heterogeneous populations while protecting the ability for the study to be positive. Strategic utilization of the enrichment design can improve the likelihood of success of a study by using Bauer closed procedures. The proposed methodology has two major advantages: (1) using the conditional sequence of hypothesis tests to control multiplicity, alpha can be 0.05 for each hypothesis test while preserving the overall study-wise alpha at 0.05; and (2) it allows patient recruitment to permit "all comers" in the study protocol while protecting the primary analysis to be done in a subpopulation enriched with patients in whom the benefit may be easier to measure, hence, demonstrate Biomarkers are laboratory measures of biological processes. Because they are viewed to be objective and quantifiable by providing valuable information in both assessing exposure and disease status, they are increasingly used in biomedical and public health sciences, drug development programs, testing for targeted therapeutics and personalized medicine. This increased use creates a venue for the development of methods to address important, unexplored analytic issues such as properly handling biomarker measurements below the limit of detection (LOD). Researchers working with biomarker data inevitably have to deal with data containing non-detects, and how to combine non-detects with values above the LOD for data analysis. The common statistical analysis approach has been either to exclude measurements with LOD or perform ad-hoc single imputation techniques. Ad-hoc imputation techniques include replacing each measurement below the LOD with a value such as zero, a half of the detection limit, or LOD value itself, and then conducting the analysis under the assumption that the imputed values are the actual observed values. However, there are other parametric and nonparametric statistical methods, such as model based single imputation methods, Reverse Kaplan-Meier method, and multiple imputation methods that are not widely used in the literature but are better alternatives to ad-hoc single imputation techniques. We will facilitate broader use of all of these methods by describing their properties, illustrating their use with population-based data for secondhand smoke exposure research and showing how they can be calculated using standard software. This work was funded in by FAMRI, NIH, NIOSH. Biomarkers are a critical component of targeted therapies as they can be used to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from a particular treatment. Several prospective clinical trial designs for biomarker directed therapy have been previously proposed including the marker-stratified, sequential testing strategy, adaptive, and enrichment designs. These designs differ primarily in study populations (marker-defined or all-comers) and randomization scheme (fixed or adaptive). Recognizing the need for randomization yet acknowledging the possibility of remarkably promising results at interim, we propose a two-stage Phase II marker-positive design that allows for direct assignment in Stage II. In particular, Stage I of our proposed design randomizes marker- positive patients equally to receive targeted therapy or control, while Stage II has the option to adopt "direct assignment" whereby all Stage II patients receive the targeted therapy. Through simulation, we study the effect of varying the alpha decision cutoffs at interim and timing of interim analysis on power and Type I error rate. We compare our design with a balanced randomized two-stage design. Our results suggest relatively minimal loss in power ( 41,000 patients) were included (Figure 1). Based on RCTs, TXA was associated with a reduced risk of death versus aprotinin, while pairwise comparisons were inconclusive for MI, stroke, and renal failure/dysfunction; point estimates and coverage probabilities of these intervals suggested aprotinin was often associated with an elevated probability of increased risk (Table 1). When observational data were incorporated, pairwise comparisons showed increased risks of death with aprotinin relative to TXA and EACA, as well an increased risk of renal failure/dysfunction relative to all comparators. There were also probabilities suggestive of increased risks of MI with aprotinin compared to TXA and EACA (Table 1). Conclusions: Data suggests there remains reason for concern regarding aprotinin safety. While meta-analyses of RCTs can lack sufficient sample size to definitively identify harms imbalances, appropriate incorporation of observational evidence and use of network meta-analysis can help reduce uncertainty in analyses of such data. The success of translational research requires sound judgment in the planning and implementation of trials. Such planning involves synthesis of previous literature. We sought to determine the accessibility of preclinical efficacy studies in a cohort of novel investigational agents entering clinical development between 2000 and 2003. A cohort of initial human trials of new agents reported as full journal publications was identified through systematic searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE. The cohort included 100 investigational agents, spanning 10 different indications. Identified agents were linked to preclinical studies by a search of references, EMBASE and PubMed. Preclinical evidence was considered published if at least one full journal article reported disease response in live, non-human animals. Of the 100 agents, 89 had published preclinical work, 80 of which tested the identical intervention and another 9 of which were based on closely related agents. Thirteen percent of agents published preclinical studies only after the initial human trial publication. Fifty-five percent of initial human trial articles referenced published animal work. Of the 89 agents, 57% had five or more animal studies available, 33% had between 2-4, and 10% had one preclinical study available. Of the 13 investigational agents that received eventual FDA approval, 12 had five or more preclinical studies available in the published record. The probability that preclinical evidence was publicly reported in more than five reports was significantly greater for FDA approved drugs than for drugs that did not receive licensure (85% vs. 38%; Yates' chi-squared test, p=0.002). This work demonstrates that a large proportion of investigational agents had at least some preclinical studies available. This suggests that preclinical knowledge synthesis for many new drugs is feasible--especially for those receiving licensure. However, we are unable to estimate what proportion of preclinical efficacy studies go unpublished. Smoking is directly responsible for 4500 deaths each year in New Zealand (NZ) including 22% of all Maori deaths. Despite the proven efficacy of various cessation approaches, long-term cessation rates are still below 25%. Quitline is a national smoking cessation service that offers telephone delivered behavioral support (3 sessions) and an eight-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) at a subsidized rate for smokers in NZ. The Fit2Quit trial aims to determine the effects of a home and community-based exercise intervention on increasing smoking cessation rates at six months when added to usual care. A two-arm parallel randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in 2010-11. Eligible participants were recruited through Quitline who were interested in quitting, had their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking, aged 18 years and over, and wanted to be physically active. The intervention group received telephone-based exercise counseling programme delivered by existing Green Prescription (GRx) services over six months, in addition to usual smoking cessation support. The control group received usual care alone. Self-reported smoking abstinence, mood and physical symptoms (MPSS), and physical activity level (IPAQ) were assessed at 8 and 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was self-reported point-prevalence at 24 weeks, confirmed by salivary cotinine reading. Treatment evaluations were performed on the principle of intention-to-treat assuming missing as smoking. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted. A total of 906 smokers were randomized (intervention N=455; control N=451). Participants were aged 37 years (18-78yrs), 31% Maori, 46% males, 83% smoked >10 cigarettes per day, 79% made previous quit attempts, and 55% didn't use NRT at baseline. Relative risk and adjusted odds ratio were calculated to assess the smoking abstinence. Repeated measures models were used to evaluate change in MPSS and IPAQ total score between groups. Statistical analyses and full trial results will be presented and discussed. Trajectory-based models are increasingly applied in clinical research to understand the etiology and developmental course of different types of disorder [1, 2, 3]. More recently, the range of applications has been extended to capture heterogeneity in treatment responses to clinical and randomized trials [4, 5]. A double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial in nutrition was carried out on 197 subjects to investigate whether the consumption of an active dairy product can improve different clinical parameters, such as well-being scores. For exploratory purpose Group-based trajectory models (GBTM) [6] were used to map the developmental course of these distinct but related outcomes individually, and then according to a joint approach. The statistical analysis was performed with the Proc Traj [7] with SAS® software release 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). GBTM provided empirical ways of identifying clusters of individuals in response of the product intake, following both typical and atypical courses of development. Overall, results suggested that the active product was associated with trajectories relating clinical improvements. In this application, GBTM also allowed to highlight different responders' patterns in the active product group by identifying developmentally meaningful subgroups in the population for whom product effects vary. In this communication, authors will discuss the results of applying such methods to a clinical trial in nutrition. Strengths and limits associated to this approach as well as the interpretation will be further detailed. The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study is a Phase 3, multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to compare a moderate-intensity physical activity program to a successful aging health education program in 1,600 sedentary older persons, age 70-89 years, across eight field centers. The primary outcome is major mobility disability, defined as the inability to walk 400 meters. Secondary and tertiary outcomes include serious fall injuries, pulmonary events, and cardiovascular events. Given the number of participants and their age range, we expect to collect data on many outcomes throughout the length of the trial. The need for a central tracking and monitoring system initiated the construction of the Outcomes Management Tool (OMT). The OMT allows the Data Management and Quality Control (DMAQC) Center to centrally track status of outcomes, compile cases for assignment to adjudication committee members, and track the adjudications via an online interface system. The web system registers each outcome reported, eliminates duplicate events identified, and enables field centers and the DMAQC to track outcomes as they move through the outcomes process. Making this process accessible on the web is efficient for real-time reporting, gives administrators the ability to manage documents, assign adjudicators, monitor active adjudication status, communicate with adjudicators when needed, and provides a central repository for outcome details. Generating outcome events from participant reports begins with the data entry of a case report form (CRF). Upon submission of the CRF, if specific criteria are met, this triggers the creation of a unique outcome ID for each event reported by the participant and initiates the tracking of outcomes. This utilizes IBM's WebSphere ILOG-JRules business management system for rules validation and event provocation. This presentation will outline the flow of outcomes in the Outcomes Management Tool from the entry of the CRF to the final adjudication. Patient registries may support a variety of functions, ranging from clinical care to quality measurement and reporting, to clinical and translational research. Compared to clinical trials, quality reporting registries typically involve more data collection (all patients and all visits within a set of practices), often with fewer resources (funding, personnel). Data coordinating centers for registries must be aware of these differences, assist practices in embedding data collection into clinical care, and provide time-efficient resources for monitoring and improving data quality. To support ImproveCareNow, a quality reporting registry for pediatric IBD, we worked with an established multicenter network to standardize data definitions and review their processes of data collection and capture. Additionally, we developed a set of data quality metrics to define areas where data quality is critical to desired outcomes or known areas of deficiencies for the registry. Among the measures of interest are:- proportion of patients enrolled in the registry - proportion of visits captured in the registry - proportion of visits with all critical data elements captured - proportion of visits entered in the registry within 30 days of visit date - proportion of visits where data values are suspicious, based on inter or intra-visit inconsistencies We also developed a pair of data quality reports- a set of run charts that allow sites to track data quality metrics over time and a report that allows sites easily identify potential errors to a level of detail that allows for quick updates to be made to the registry. These reports were designed to have a look and feel similar to tools already in use by these sites to increase the probability of their integration into normal clinical practice. Analysis of the effectiveness of these strategies is ongoing. Preliminary results show an increase from 80% to 89% of visits with all critical variables recorded. One major aspect of multi-center clinical trials coordinating centers includes the work, data flow and monitoring of central units which analyze samples and transmit data to the coordinating center. These include laboratories for blood samples and reading centers for electrocardiographs, retinal photos, CT scans, DEXA scans, etc. Data travels from clinical site to collection site (e.g. scan center) to central reading center and finally to the coordinating center. It is critical to ensure the integrity of the data while streamlining the process when data collection and management can be challenging. The first step in the design process is planning the methods of participant flow from clinical site to collection site, including obtaining informed consent, verifying eligibility and participant scheduling. The second step is developing the method of data flow from collection site to reading center using tools such as web-based portals, transmission software or courier services. The third step is for the reading center to securely transfer the data to the coordinating center. Data transmissions should have preapproved formats and sets of components for consistency and accuracy such as dates of analysis and receipt, and unique identifiers for the individuals performing the analysis and the specific image or sample. The fourth step is to develop methods for data validation to ensure the correct attribution of assessment to the corresponding participant. The coordinating center should have a checklist for the incoming central unit data where the data must check and pass each step before moving to the next step. Finally, a process for the reporting of alert values to sites in a timely manner must be developed. Several options for these processes will be described and various methods in which data is collected and transferred from reading centers to coordinating centers will be compared, and future suggestions will be discussed. With the popularity of electronic data capture (EDC) increasing in clinical trials, there is a growing demand for stronger and more efficient data validation tools. Traditionally, online single field range checks and batched offline logic checks performed by statisticians are used to identify data issues related to data transcription errors and protocol compliance discrepancies. Our home-grown, web-based Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) is equipped with a database driven data validation process to perform rule-based data checks at the time of data entry. This process uses a centralized database table to manage all data validation checks for all Case Report Forms (CRFs). Initial data checks against invalid data types, missing required data items and impossible data values are performed prior to saving the record to the database. Records that pass this initial process are saved to the database and further data validation is performed by using database queries involving one or more related data items to ensure sound data collection logic is enforced. Depending on the sources of these data items, such data validation queries can be defined within the current data record, across multiple records within the same data table, or across multiple records from different data tables. Violations of these data checks will be saved in a central rule violation table along with the values of the associated data items. Based on the level of the violation, an alert, warning, or rejection flag will be placed on the data form as an indicator for users to take the next appropriate action. Our data management experiences for more than ten large, multi-center phase III clinical trials demonstrated that this comprehensive, real-time data validation function has significantly reduced data errors occurring during the data entry process and shortened the time required for data cleaning and database lock. Background: Source data verification is the process of comparing information on source records to data recorded in a Case Report Form as part of a research study. Researchers are required to perform source data verification in order to comply with National Regulations and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. There is little guidance for researchers as to the amount and frequency of this process or the effect of source data verification on study outcomes. Recently there has been debate regarding the value of source data verification on data quality. There is little research on the beliefs and attitudes of Investigators and Research Coordinators regarding the amount, frequency, value and effect of source data verification and how it may be optimized. This project is part of a research program to determine the effect of source data verification on study outcomes and the amount of source data verification that should be done. Objectives: The primary objective is to describe the current beliefs and attitudes regarding source data verification of members of the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group. Methods: We developed a self-administered on-line survey using focus groups of Critical Care Investigators and Research Coordinators. The survey has been pilot tested and is undergoing clinical sensibility and reliability testing. The final survey will be sent electronically to the 330 members of the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group between December 2011 and February 2011. Results: We will present descriptive summaries for all items and then separately for Investigator and Research Coordinator groups. We will evaluate associations between variables. Significance: The survey results will provide general guidance to adult and pediatric critical care researchers in determining data quality assurance procedures and will inform the next phase of the research program: assessing methods of source data verification and its effect on study outcomes in Canadian Critical Care research. The concept of reproducible research was introduced in the computational sciences some time ago, but has begun to be considered in biostatistics, bioinformatic, and other areas of medically related data analysis. Reproducible research, in this context, involves performing data analysis and statistical evaluation of data in a manner in which the relevant results (tables, figures, incidental text) can be recovered with minimal effort, analyses can be conveyed to data repositories with minimal effort, and analyses can survive the inevitable changes in personnel at the data management center. This has strong implications for clinical trials, which are usually conducted in a "reproducible research" concept, but which are not always analyzed in this manner. From the perspective of data analysis in SAS (a dominant tool in the clinical trials field), structural approaches to project setup, disciplined and consistent uses of macros, and archival approaches to manuscript construction are the first steps to reproducible research. These will be discussed and illustrated with several examples. The use of technology in clinical trials is increasing where ancillary software is utilized to capture data beyond that typically collected via case report forms in an electronic data capture (EDC) system. In recent studies by the Clinical Trials Network of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, software systems have been used to administer and monitor adherence to trial interventions and perform study assessments. Utilization of ancillary systems requires appropriate advanced planning to address key issues. Ancillary systems vary in complexity and sophistication, ranging from simple and home-grown to complex and well-validated. Upon identifying systems deemed necessary for the trial, a communication plan should be developed outlining expectations for software developer support, as well as the workflow and timeline for identifying and resolving issues. The software and hardware needed for hosting and using the system must be identified and procured. Understanding the structure of the data collected in the system, which is facilitated by obtaining a system diagram and data dictionary, is key. If the system will be used to capture data for analysis, it is important to verify that those data are collected and identifiable in the system. The data dictionary can assist in identifying if protected health information is being collected and if so, to develop appropriate security measures, such as encryption. It is also important to explore whether the system can communicate with the EDC system, or at a minimum that the data captured in the system can be linked to those from the EDC system. Finally, a plan for providing initial and ongoing training in the use of the system must be established. The plan should outline who is responsible for the training, the method of training (e.g., face-to-face, webcast), and the development of a user's guide. Despite best practice guidelines, patients presenting for primary care are often not screened for medical issues other than the presenting problem due to time and personnel constraints. This presentation details an electronic screening protocol and technology platform that: a) allows patients to complete a brief screening form prior to their appointment, and b) provides immediate feedback on health risks and conditions for clinicians to use in the patient visit. Patients presenting at the primary care clinic self report via a Comprehensive Primary Care Screening (CPCS) instrument using Android-based tablets. The CPCS assesses risks related to falls, colon cancer, sexual health, domestic violence, oral health, alcohol, depression, and basic needs. Responses are entered via a touch-screen interface in English or Spanish, or via audio versions of the instrument. It incorporates dynamic branch logic to capture detailed information where needed from patients. Upon completion, data is saved into a EDC database where it is scored and analyzed for recommendations, including referrals and standing orders. Results are immediately accessible for physician use; scores and raw data may also be extracted for incorporation into de-identified research datasets. We use a CDISC ODM-based form definition created using the OpenClinica open source EDC platform. The CDISC ODM protocol and data capture definitions are automatically transformed into to XForm definitions that are rendered via an open source medical data capture "app" on the tablets for patient entry and physician retrieval. The EDC engine provides data storage, validation, scoring, reporting, and analysis capability. The project objectives are to: - increase referrals for health risks and conditions, - increase access to and use of de-identified screening results by researchers, and - promote adoption, dissemination, and adaptation of the screening tool by using reusable, configurable open source platform. The methods for data capture have advanced as technology has evolved. Often studies utilize an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system, but many studies may still only be paper based. The costs and regulatory requirements of deploying an EDC system may not outweigh the benefits of conducting a paper based study through the use of fax forms, scanning optical character recognition software, telephone data entry, bubble forms, or digital pen capture. However, these methods are thought of as "old technology," but with the proper technical approach, a paper based study may actually be more efficient and productive. A model project was conducted in which digital pen data collection technology was examined for benefits and drawbacks. The digital pen was used by study staff members and/or subjects to complete CRFs, the pen is docked in a docking station attached to a computer, and data is uploaded to the data coordinating center. After project evaluation, it was found that the use of digital pen technology to instantly generate electronic copies of paper CRFs benefited the study by:eliminating the need to ship completed CRFs,eliminating the need to scan paper forms for electronic storage and transmission,dramatically reducing data collection training for staff,using a source document as a CRF, andhaving the ability to track CRF completion virtually. While there are multiple ways to implement digital pen technology, each with their own drawbacks, this project found that data still had to be entered into an electronic database manually, printing CRFs required using print vendors with previous experience with the software, and a method to transfer and track files and store back-up copies was needed. These lessons learned will only benefit future studies using digital pen technology corporately, and help reduce Sponsor costs for paper based studies. The technology of personal computing has undergone great changes the last few years. Naturally, those conducting clinical research would like to take advantage of these advancements. The Clinical Research Database (CRDB) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) was created as a client server application in 1992. In 2003, the first web based platform was made available to facilitate data entry from remote locations. During the past year, it became necessary to expand our application scope to keep up with the latest needs of the researchers. There are two main areas of our system expansion: 1) the multicenter internet platform and 2) mobile devices. Historically at MSKCC, data management for our multicenter protocols was mainly a paper based system. It became evident that participating sites needed access to CRDB to enter data directly. This brought about security and privacy concerns beyond what was needed for an internal database. The conversion to a new external platform to deal with these concerns brought its own set of challenges. In parallel, a mobile option was needed for survey completion by participants in clinic because desktop computers are not always available. However, CRDB was designed for data entry by clinical research professionals, not participants. We were able to design a tablet survey that addressed this as well as other concerns. In this presentation, we will review the need for alternative platforms for collecting clinical research data. We will also address the various challenges we faced while expanding our system from the traditional data entry model, as well as our suggested solutions. Clinical outcomes are an important component of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and are often used to complement patient reported outcome measures such as health-related quality of life. Although clinical outcomes were traditionally collected through clinical examination or laboratory results, routine data sources and self-reporting by patients are increasingly used. We examined four RCTs that collected patient reported clinical outcomes through postal questionnaires. In each RCT the patient reported clinical outcome was verified using either medical records, routine data sources or by contacting the patient's family doctor or hospital physician to ascertain the accuracy. The accuracy of patient reporting of clinical outcomes is dependent on a number of factors including the nature and timing of the clinical outcome and the phrasing of the clinical questions. For example, it may be easier for a patient to report a knee-related hospital re-admission than self-report a urinary tract infection. Nevertheless, approximately 15% of patient reported knee- related hospital re-admissions (collected through annual postal questionnaires) could not be verified through routine data sources and/or medical records. Such inconsistencies were shown to be a combination of misunderstanding by the patient and inaccuracies of the routine data sets. Obtaining clinical information from patients is feasible, especially if the outcome of interest is a symptomatic one. However with the potential inaccuracies associated with patient reporting of clinical outcomes, it may be necessary to consider verifying such outcomes with medical professionals and/or routine data sources. Such a strategy has implications in terms of staff time and cost and therefore has to be considered during the design stage of the RCT. We will discuss some challenges and inconsistencies between self-reporting and medically confirmed clinical outcomes. We will highlight processes involved in verifying patient reported clinical outcomes and how adopting such a verification strategy may impact on the overall trial results. Background: The availability of platforms and devices for electronic data capture has been a major step forward for the assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in clinical trials. The advantages of electronic PROs include real-time tracking of compliance, automated patient reminders, and date-time data for individual assessments. Multiple modes of ePRO data capture (e.g. PC/tablet, handheld, automated phone survey) allow flexibility in clinical trial design. This has raised the question of whether use of multiple modes in a single trial might affect statistical power. Methods: We review the growing body of research on the measurement reliability across modes, and estimate the effect on statistical power in several common PRO endpoint analyses. We consider this effect compared to other common and PRO-related threats to power. Results: Peer-reviewed studies indicate the measurement reliability across modes of administration is high (approx 0.90) and consistent with the test-retest reliability of individual modes. We have calculated that even if measurement reliability were more moderate (0.70 - 0.80), effects on statistical power would be small. The estimated reduction in statistical power from using multiple modes of data collection is dwarfed by the estimated loss of power associated with missing data (which can be prevented by allowing a second mode as alternate or backup). The threat of multiple modes to power is also far less than mis-estimation of variance in sample size calculation or use of PRO measures with low responsiveness. Conclusions: Very small reductions in measurement reliability from the use of multiple modes of ePRO are outweighed by the advantage of data completeness. To preserve power in clinical trials, researchers would be better off focusing on well-established areas of methodologic concern, such as accurate estimation of variance and choice of responsive outcome measures. Suppose a limited number (N) of patients is available for study and the traditional randomized trial design comparing 'standard' to 'new' is not feasible. This work was motivated by an interest in comparing two treatments for recurrent Wilm's tumor, where about 40% of patients are event-free long- term with standard treatment. One option is a study design which seeks to maximize the number of study subjects receiving the better treatment. Consider a design for which n1/2 patients are randomized to each of 2 treatments and then time-to-event is compared using the log-rank test. All remaining (N-n1) patients are then assigned treatment 1 (treatment 2) based on whether the log-rank test is positive (negative). We assumed an available sample size of 100. For exponential failure-time distributions with a baseline ? of 0.50 to 0.75, and for a range of relative risks from 0.65 to 0.80, the design which maximized the number of subjects receiving the better treatment was to randomize about 40 patients (having observed about 20% of the total expected information) and then assign the remaining 60 patients to the regimen with the better observed outcome. We hypothesized that, in other settings, the n1 corresponding to observing about 20% of the expected information would be optimal. We ran simulation studies assuming a cure model outcome: S(t) = 0.4 + (0.6)*exp(- 0.75t). We simulated studies of 100 patients, with n1 values from 20 to 80 and cure rate increases corresponding to relative risks from 0.65 to 0.80. The number of study subjects receiving the better treatment was maximized at an n1 value of 40-45 (corresponding to 17- 20% of the total expected number of events). In non-inferiority (NI) trials, the evaluation of the efficacy of a new experimental treatment allows for some defined level of reduced effect as compared to an active control standard. Serial use of NI trials may lead to erosion in the level of improvement provided by newly approved therapies; this phenomenon is called 'bio-creep'. Simulations were designed to facilitate understanding of bio-creep risk when approval of a new treatment with efficacy less than some proportion of the effect of the active control treatment would constitute harm, such as sulfonamides or penicillin for treatment of Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia. In this setting, risk of approval of insufficiently effective therapies may be great, even when the standard treatment effect is 'constant' across trials. Among the many possible factors contributing to this manifestation of bio-creep, the most influential were the method for selecting the active control, the choice of non-inferiority margin, and bias in the active control effect estimate. Therefore, when non-inferiority testing is performed, margins should be based upon the estimated effect of the active control, should account for the variability and for likely sources of bias in this estimate, and should address the importance of preservation of some portion of the effect of the standard. Purpose: This study demonstrates how errors in estimating the SD of a population can lead to inaccurate sample sizes and underpowered studies, and offers recommendations for maximizing the likelihood of achieving adequate statistical power. Results: Our simulated data show that greater sample size provides a more reliable estimate of the SD of the population than a smaller one. All minimal and 25th percentile sample SDs fell below 44 (the population SD) no matter how big the sampling sample size (from 2 to 100). For samples sizes 10 and 100, the minimum sample SDs underestimate the population SD by 47.1% ([44 - 23.27] / 44) and 18.3% ([44 35.93] / 44), respectively. For all sample sizes below 40, the mean sample SDs fell below the population SD; for sample sizes of 40 or greater, the mean sample SDs were close to the population SD. All maximum and 75th percentile sample SDs exceeded the population SD. Based on a published underpowered trial (n1=13, n2=17 and power 500/uL and were referred to the National Institutes of Health for further testing. Of the 41 referred patients, 33 (80.4%) had positive Strongyloides stercoralis-specific serology. Nine of these 33 (27%) also had schistosomiasis (n=6) or hookworm (n=3) infection. Although there was no statistical difference (p=0.15) in the baseline eosinophil levels between those with strongyloidiasis and those without, serum IgE levels differed dramatically between the two groups (geometric mean levels 74 U/ml vs. 566 IU/ml, p 48hr) without increasing risk to the mother. Women eligible for CHIPS are high risk from perinatal and maternal perspectives, such as serious neonatal complications (16%), admission to high level neonatal care (30%), pre-eclampsia (35%), or serious maternal complications (2-3%). We needed to further develop our method of SUE review to prevent anticipated outcomes from being sent to our Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for review as SUEs. In CHIPS, reported SUEs are reviewed by the Working Group (WG) to determine both the urgency of further review and what supporting documents are required. The Outcomes Adjudication Committee (OAC) reviews each SUE to determine whether the event is a pre- specified trial outcome or a 'true' SUE. This decision is reviewed by the Steering Committee (SC). A summary report is submitted to the DSMB at the interim and final analyses or immediately, as decided by the WG, OAC, and/or SC. To date in CHIPS, three SUEs have been reported, all of which were determined to be pre-specified outcomes and will be reviewed by the DSMB at the time of the first interim analysis. The T1DGC was an international effort to identify genes that determine risk of type 1 diabetes. The Consortium created a resource of 2,836 affected sibling pair families as well as 493 trios, 830 cases and 968 controls worldwide. Data and sample collection was conducted in four networks (Asia-Pacific, European, North American and United Kingdom) from January 2004 - January 2010, with support from a Coordinating Center for various activities. While implementing standardized data collection for this international study presented many challenges, study closure proved to be as formidable. Disassembling this complex infrastructure (composed of 214 clinics in 34 countries, four Network Centers and 17 laboratories) while preparing all data and samples for transfer to the NIDDK Central Repository proved as difficult and required as much effort as initiating the study. At the time that we started study closure activities, there were no established guidelines or experience to direct our actions or identify potential difficulties. Study close out was staggered, beginning in October 2006 and concluding in December 2011. We developed a clinic close-out data entry form, delineating key elements required for closure. Additionally, comprehensive checklists of closure tasks for laboratories and Network Centers were developed and utilized. Finally, the Coordinating Center held a meeting with the NIDDK Central Repository to outline the data, samples and study documentation to be deposited. By clearly defining close-out tasks, providing timelines, and performing close-out site visits and/or conference calls, staff at each facility can understand their responsibilities and ensure that all items are completed in this lengthy and complex process. Implementing these steps permits an orderly and efficient study closure and should be undertaken as soon as data collection has been initiated. We will present our procedures and solutions to problems encountered to assist other studies in the close-out process. Clinical Trials of Investigational Medicinal Products (CTIMPs) are regulated in the UK via the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations. This is implemented via a) Research Ethics Committee (REC) review, b) Research Management & Governance review by the NIHR Clinical Research Networks followed by c) local Trust R&D department review, and d) Competent Authority (CA) review. Non-CTIMPs are approved via the same routes (excluding CA review). However, these studies are not governed by the Clinical Trial Regulations; instead they are conducted in line with the UK Department of Health's Research Governance Framework, and in accordance with the Medical Research Council's Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Robust processes to ensure ethical and governance compliance are implemented but we have observed that low-risk non-CTIMP trials are subject to high levels of scrutiny by RECs and R&D departments, which is not necessarily commensurate with the risk to participants. This can detract from addressing key logistical issues associated with trial implementation (e.g. clinician training, optimising complex data collection processes from many sources), and can considerably extend the set-up phase of such trials, delay the start of recruitment, and even discourage site and patient participation. It is apparent that the measurement of risk in non-CTIMP trials needs to include the risk to the participant per se, but also the complexity of trial conduct (which impacts on participant risk if processes for implementing the trial are not thoroughly planned). We will discuss the risk to the participant and the complexity of trial conduct identified in 3 complex intervention trials co-ordinated by the CTRU, and present the impact this had on the set-up and implementation of each trial. We will present a risk-based approach for review and implementation of complex intervention trials, based on the type of intervention, participant, patient pathways and outcome measures to be used. Response rates of patient reported outcome measures administered postally influence robustness of trial results. We aim to present ways in which postal response rates can be maximised in pragmatic trials using experience gained in the implementation of postal follow-up process for two large multi- centre randomised controlled trials within stroke - Training Caregivers after Stroke (TRACS) and Longer Term Stroke Care (LoTS care) co-ordinated by the University of Leeds' Clinical Trials Research Unit. Both trials obtain their primary outcome measures via patient self-completed measures administered postally. Follow-up procedures include a mixture of postal and telephone reminders, typically undertaken at two weekly intervals. Response rates are carefully monitored and, where necessary, amendments to the process are made and accounted for in later trials. For example in TRACS, following initial monitoring of data to enhance completeness, the team instigated the collection of the primary endpoint via a telephone interview for patients who did not return questionnaires despite earlier standard postal and telephone reminders. This process was adopted much earlier in the subsequent LoTS care trial. In addition, after the publication of a systematic review on methods to increase response rates, trial pens were enclosed with questionnaire packs. Lessons from LoTS care and TRACS led to implementation of strategies to enhance compliance in subsequent trials (e.g. sending questionnaires to participants in advance of a face-to-face interview in participants' homes) Response rates during specific postal and telephone reminder stages will be reported as well as the characteristics (such as age, gender, level of anxiety and depression) of participants responding at the different stages. Many aspects need consideration when developing follow-up response strategies. Above all, strategies need to be easily adaptable, closely monitored from the outset and any lessons learnt disseminated. OBJECTIVE: Patient recruitment in trials often takes longer than expected. This is costly and if the sample size remains insufficient it might lead to indecisive conclusions for practice. The field of obstetrics is unique in the way that there are two patients: the mother and her baby. We aimed to identify reasons why women participated or declined participation in an RCT during or shortly after pregnancy. DESIGN: We performed a qualitative study with semi-structured interviews in women who were asked to participate in a RCT in obstetrics. We randomly selected both women who consented and those who did not for one of a set of 7 different RCT's. Transcripts of the interviews were analyzed anonymously using a constant-comparative approach. Two researchers independently identified barriers and facilitators for participation. Interviews were continued until saturation was reached. RESULTS: Of 22 women approached, 20 (90%) consented to be interviewed. Respondents varied by educational level, ethnicity, geographical area, age and parity. The main motivation for trial participation was either to contribute to research, as the women were convinced of it's importance (50%) and/or preference for a treatment arm not available outside the trial (60%). Key barriers for participation in non-consenters were a negative association with the intervention (100%) and/or with randomization (45%). Fear and uncertainty, probably due to unfamiliarity with research and the feeling of being inappropriate because of unique personal characteristics, also played a role. Stress and doubt about the decision were present in both groups. CONCLUSION: Trial participation is a tough decision for most women. The final choice about participation is made intuitively, but will be influenced positively if women are well informed about the importance of research in general and the specific trial in particular. A personal, complete, well-timed dialogue may facilitate to make a balanced decision and improve trial participation. Good clinical practice (GCP) compliance is required for state of the art quality in clinical trials (CT). For HASTA trial (Hand suture vs stapling for closure of loop ileostomy) most participating centers are non-university institutions with little experience in CT. Therefore, we established a quality assurance system with on site monitoring visits and audits in all 27 centers. Based on monitoring reports, GCP violations are analyzed and their impact on patient safety and data quality is assessed. Preparation for HASTA included a 2-day investigator meeting with surgical training and individual on site initiation visits. During recruitment 48 regular on site monitoring visits were conducted. Close out visits and independent audits are currently carried out and will be finished in February 2012. Most GCP violations concerned patient informed consent (IC), although no IC was missing. 16 findings were rated major, 42 minor. Safety: 27 events were identified requiring serious adverse event reporting according to protocol. Primary endpoint needed to be corrected in 6 cases following monitoring findings. Violation of eligibility criteria were reported 4 times only. Further violations were regarding performance of trial intervention (wrong treatment group, procedure not performed according to protocol) and time window for follow-up visits. Quantitative and qualitative results of monitoring findings will be presented and compared to findings discovered by on site audits. As on site monitoring is not routinely established for investigator initiated surgical trials, relevance of monitoring and auditing for conduct of HASTA trial and validity of trial data will be discussed. Like most clinical research studies, minority enrollment rates are low in the EPR, particularly for African American males. In addition, African Americans have higher attrition rates compared with Caucasians. Therefore, in the EPR, we have employed special methods for recruiting and retaining minority subjects with varying levels of success. In this report, we will describe these methods, the lessons learned, and strategies used to improve minority recruitment and retention. These include: relationship-building with key stakeholders; capitalizing on personal and professional contacts; utilizing community "champions" and leaders; and targeting health-related and faith-based organizations/events. Success rates for the various strategies are presented by sex, age, race, and ethnicity. Objectives: During participation in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) adherence to the intervention and to other protocol requirements (e.g. visit attendance and completion of questionnaires) is essential for the production scientifically robust and clinically meaningful outcomes. Yet little is known about the issues that affect adherence during trial participation. This study aimed to explore the factors that influenced adherence to research procedures by parents who were invited to enrol their infants in longitudinal RCTs aimed at allergic disease prevention. Methods: Two RCTs of an intervention to prevent food allergy in infants were used as case studies for this research. Data were collected using ethnographic methods: participant observation (130 hours) was carried out on the clinical trials unit; staff (n=26) who worked on the RCT and parents (n=55) who considered participation or had participated in the RCT took part in semi-structured interviews; and documents were gathered. Data were analysed thematically. Results: Parents appeared to commit to a contract in their participation in the studies. The potential to gain direct benefit from participation improved adherence to the protocol. However even when no personal benefit was obtained, parents put considerable effort into adhering. This reflected their beliefs in the worth of the RCT and the importance they placed on fulfilling the perceived contract. Staff took proactive and reactive approaches to improving adherence. This involved 'negotiating' adherence with colleagues and parents to balance manageable participation with achieving scientifically robust outcomes. Conclusion: Many factors are important in achieving optimal adherence to the intervention and other protocol requirements. Parental and staff willingness to invest considerable time and resources is essential to achieving optimal adherence. The results suggest that staff and parents considered that research participation represented a 'contract.' Maintaining an open dialogue regarding the nature of this contract helps to promote adherence in longitudinal RCTs. Objectives: Successful recruitment to clinical trials is essential for scientifically and clinically robust findings. Additionally problems with accrual results in increased trial costs and the inefficient use of resources. Yet little is known about effective recruitment to pediatric studies. This study aimed to explore the factors that influenced recruitment to non-therapeutic, pediatric longitudinal randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Two RCTs of an intervention to prevent food allergy in infants were used as case studies for this research. Data were collected using ethnographic methods: participant observation (130 hours) was carried out on the clinical trials unit; staff (n=26) who worked on the RCTs and parents (n=55) who considered participation or had participated in the RCT took part in semi-structured interviews; and documents were gathered. Data were analyzed thematically. Results: The potential value of participation had a substantial influence on recruitment. Parents considered possible benefits for their child and the scientific worth and integrity of the RCT before agreeing to participate. The possibility that participation would be mutually beneficial was relevant to parents and staff. The ability to manage the demands of participation was also important; parents delayed making a decision until they considered they could cope. The potential for participation to cause harm had a substantial influence; fathers were often more concerned about harm and placed less importance on the scientific worth of the study than mothers. Conclusion: Recruitment to non-therapeutic longitudinal RCTs in early childhood is influenced by complex inter-related factors. Holding detailed discussions with parents regarding the scientific value of the studies and the support that can be offered to improve the manageability of participation may help to promote recruitment. Mothers and fathers often appear to have different opinions about the potential for harm and benefit; holding discussions with both parents (where appropriate) may also increase recruitment. The Environmental Polymorphisms Registry (EPR) is a unique resource of subjects and their DNA samples that was created to facilitate genotype-driven translational research of complex disease. EPR goals are to recruit 20,000 individuals from North Carolina, collect their blood for DNA isolation, and make these DNA samples available to scientists to screen for genetic variants in environmental response genes. Once individuals with the "genotypes-of-interest" are identified, they are invited to participate in various types of follow-up studies ranging from basic laboratory ex vivo cell phenotyping investigations to observational studies and clinical trials. Since 2005, over 15,000 subjects of diverse sex, age, race, and ethnicity have been enrolled in the EPR from clinics at local hospitals, community-based events (health fairs, health conferences, community meetings, churches, etc.) and the internet. To minimize attrition and ensure high response rates for follow-up studies, these subjects are contacted annually (through multiple mailings and phone calls) and asked to update their contact information and other basic data. Nonresponders are traced using LexisNexis® and other public databases. Using these methods, our overall attrition rate is =5% and requires 236 patients (based on exact binomial probabilities). If >=230/236 patients (>=97.5%) are recurrence-free at 2 years then the trial will conclude that the event rate is =7 recurrences were observed the trial would be terminated, but more flexibility and guidance for interim monitoring was sought. In calculating the recurrence rate, total follow up for each patient is taken into account. As recurrences are more likely to occur in the early months following treatment, follow up is weighted according to recurrence rates observed in previous studies. To derive appropriate beta values for each analysis we simulated several design parameters. A repeated confidence interval approach was adopted. The beta spending function was selected so that: 1) overall alpha=0.05, beta=0.20 and 2) probability of stopping after 1 recurrence is very low. Results: The chosen rule was that at each recurrence the estimated rate and its exact confidence interval (CI) would be calculated. If the lower limit of this CI exceeded 2% then the trial would stop recruiting. Conclusions: A sequential interim monitoring plan has been developed. This methodology could be adopted in other studies to ensure that a rare event rate does not exceed a pre- specified threshold. Background: Reliable intermediate outcome measures are needed to assess clinical interventions in the current era of HIV treatment. We evaluated the performance of the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Index that uses routine clinical biomarkers to predict mortality as a surrogate outcome for randomized clinical trials. Methods: VACS Index scores were determined from data collected in the Options In Management with Antiretrovirals (OPTIMA) multi-national study of treatment strategies in patients with advanced HIV (Holodniy, 2011). OPTIMA data were used to validate the use of the VACS Index in a cohort of late-stage HIV patients. Proportional hazards regression and survival analysis using baseline VACS Index scores and changes in score during treatment were used to assess the utility of the index as an outcome for future clinical trials. Results: VACS Index scores at baseline correlated highly with mortality and with time to death in the advanced HIV patients enrolled in OPTIMA (Kirkwood, 2011; c = 0.749). Baseline score and change in score over 48 weeks of treatment were equally associated with all-cause mortality (c = 0.783). Conclusions: The VACS Index accurately predicted mortality and responded to changes in treatment. Measuring changes in VACS Index scores over relatively short time periods may offer an efficient alternative endpoint for the design of randomized clinical interventions among patients with HIV.

Session #423. Recruiting to target sample size is key to the success of all research yet continues to pose a significant problem. Potential barriers are often unknown at the time of securing funding and trials must have processes in place to identify and respond to these barriers. We present our experience from three UK publically funded multicentre RCTs of stroke patients and discuss ways in which recruitment strategies were adapted and refined to help achieve target recruitment. The main approaches we used focused on the site feasibility and the collection of screening data. Site feasibility and selection is used to understand the implementation and delivery of trials within existing services and provides recruitment estimates. This process revealed potential capacity and resource constraints which were subsequently used to facilitate discussion with service providers and allow appropriate allocation of funds. The recruitment estimates are used to engage in discussion with site during the recruitment phase to identify further barriers to target. Systematic collection of screening data from time of recruitment is reviewed monthly and is used to identify trends in the reasons for non-recruitment. This process led to changes in the recruitment and consent procedures to simplify the patient information and to allow obtaining consent on the same day as the provision of information. Eligibility criteria are reviewed and amended where clinically and scientifically valid. Amendments included increasing the time window of recruitment and allowing co-enrolment into other trials. Barriers to trials achieving target recruitment are multifaceted and trial teams need to be responsive to adapt trial processes accordingly. We have shown that the systematic identification of barriers from the time of site selection and during recruitment is essential and allows the trial to adapt to meet target sample size. Data on the impact of the changes on recruitment will be presented. Mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC), a condition characterized by cervical discharge and inflammation, can be caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs). For the 50- 80% of cases where the cause of MPC is unknown, it is unclear whether empiric antibiotic treatment is effective. Concerns that unnecessary antibiotic use may contribute to antibiotic resistance motivated a noninferiority clinical trial to compare the efficacy of empiric treatment with two antibiotics, azithromycin and cefixime, with placebo for MPC not attributed to STIs. The plan was to screen 3,357 women to enroll 772 participants with MPC, based on an estimated MPC prevalence of 23%. In one year, 577 women were screened at one family planning (FP) and 3 sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinics, and 131 (23%) met the definition of clinical MPC: presence of cervical discharge and/or easily induced cervical bleeding on pelvic exam. Eighty-seven (66%) women enrolled on the trial, 31 (24%) were excluded due to the presence of an STI, 10 (8%) met another exclusion criterion, and 3 (2%) chose not to participate. The number of women screened per enrolled participant was 4.6 and 7.0 from FP and STD clinics, respectively. Some entry laboratory test results were not available until after enrollment. They identified 32 participants who were ineligible for the study: 24 had positive results for STIs and 8 did not have > 30 WBCs per high power field on the cervical gram stain, a measure of inflammation. Fifty-five women met all eligibility criteria. The study was terminated due to low accrual. Among women with MPC, 42% had one or more STIs, mainly among those enrolled at STD clinics. Future studies of MPC with unknown etiology should consider recruiting from FP clinics or factor in the high rate of exclusions due to STIs among women recruited through STD clinics. In Europe requirements for conducting clinical trials with medical devices were changed fundamentally by the council directive 2007/47/EC (2007). Meanwhile the international standard ISO 14155:2011 and the German Medical Device Act have been amended accordingly. All these regulations demand appropriately qualified investigational site teams. A certified training curriculum was established in order to develop the required operational competence. It was not only harmonized within the German Clinical Trials Center (CTC)-network, but also reconciled with ethics committees as they examine the qualification of investigators. The curriculum was designed as a two-stage process. It was based on an already well established 2-day training course for investigators focusing on ICH-GCP E6 and German regulations for clinical trials with medicinal products. This course was supplemented by an advanced half-day course for medical devices. This half-day course concentrates on the characteristic requirements of the federal authority and ethics committees, the newly set up electronic application procedure, and the electronic SAE- reporting obligation of sponsor and investigators. In the next step we established a standalone training course qualifying investigators for trials with medical devices without previous knowledge of conducting clinical trials. The curriculum covers all regulatory specifications, good clinical practice, uses incorporated didactic quizzes to upgrade learning effects, and considers the characteristics of Investigator Initiated Trials (IITs). With their know-how and academy CTCs are important components in the field of qualifying for conducting clinical trials with medical devices even beyond the scope of IITs. Our report will show the challenges of developing these certified training courses for investigational site teams. And it presents the experiences of the CCT Cologne conducting these courses and the evaluation by attending investigators. The Network of Hubs for Trials Methodology Research (HTMR Network) was established by the Medical Research Council to create a UK- wide regionally distributed research resource to improve the design, conduct, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of clinical trials. Consisting of eight Hubs, the HTMR Network possesses methodological expertise and fosters links with clinical trials units and other methodological groups in universities, the National Health Service, industry and relevant professional bodies. The HTMR Network aims to (1) promote and fund high quality collaborative methodological research, both between Hubs and with other groups, UK-wide and internationally; (2) provide methodological advice to the clinical trials community; (3) encourage the implementation of the most effective and appropriate methodological practice, for example by providing education and training; and (4) work with stakeholders, in particular to agree on shared priorities for research and guidance and to advocate for improvements in the conduct of clinical trials. The HTMR Network has funded several successful projects involving the Hubs and other groups, including COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials), DIRUM (Database of Instruments for Resource Use Measurement) and workshops on topics such as randomised trials in surgery and on recruiting children to trials. We are working on methodological issues raised by stakeholders through consultation and provide the Methodology Advisory Service for Trials (MAST), a "second-line" advisory service for clinical trials units and Research Design Services in the UK. In February 2010, the Office of Clinical Research (OCR), at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), established an institutional clinical research monitoring program for MSKCC-sponsored studies. Although MSKCC has an extensive Data and Safety Monitoring plan which includes institutional and clinical department auditing, the focus on protocol compliance auditing only comprises a small percentage of the institutional portfolio in a given year (<15%). The new clinical research monitoring program focuses on in-house, investigator-initiated, MSKCC-sponsored studies, for which no outside organization provides monitoring or oversight. The goal of the monitoring program is to provide "real time" oversight of approximately 40% of MSKCC investigator initiated studies. In order to achieve this goal we developed the following: a set of criteria to evaluate protocols in our institutional portfolio for monitoring priority; documents to conduct protocol compliance, data verification, and regulatory documentation review; and guidelines for selection of participants to be monitored per visit. In addition, we identified department monitors and established written procedures for them to follow in the program. To determine the outcome of the monitoring visits, we created a rating system. Consistently high quality monitoring visits for a particular protocol would allow transition of that protocol off the monitored list and allow for us to initiate review of another protocol. Guidelines for serious and unresolved issues were also established which included suspension of new accruals for continuous unacceptable ratings. To keep a record of the monitoring visits, an access database to collect the summary letters of each visit and enter relevant data was created. In this poster presentation we will review our evaluation of the program and determine whether we are achieving our goal of "real time" oversight of 40% of our investigator initiated studies. We will also outline the challenges we encountered and methods we are developing to improve the program. Metformin in Women with Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy Trial (MiTy) is a multi-center, double masked, randomized placebo-controlled trial for pregnant women with type 2 diabetes. With 500 recruits expected from 25 participating centers across Canada, MiTy seeks to determine the effect of the addition of Metformin to a standard regimen of insulin on perinatal morbidity and mortality. Study sites are required to record specific outcomes for each study participant in prenatal visit forms every four weeks, based on gestational age at randomization. In order to accurately capture the complex nature of this large amount of data, it was decided that electronic data capture (EDC) would be more effective than paper data collection. Since EDC is a recent system, a strategy for disseminating user training was required. Collaborators participated in a three hour training session in which they were guided through a simulation that involved entering patient data into an EDC program. Due to differences in technical skills, abilities and learning styles, it was evident that the majority of the participants did not gain a comprehensive knowledge of how to use the EDC program. Following this, three separate strategies were implemented to provide more effective training. First, an EDC test website was created in which collaborators could enter simulated data to become proficient with the system. This allowed collaborators to familiarize themselves with the program according to their own skill level and pace. Next, a section in the Study Manual was created with step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting for further clarification. Lastly, email and phone support was offered to remedy problems that could not be resolved by the Study Manual. These strategies proved both cost-effective and successful in providing collaborators with comprehensive EDC training. INTRODUCTION: Patient recruitment in clinical trials often takes longer than expected. Trials with slow recruitment are more costly and an insufficient sample size leads to indecisive conclusions. We identified factors influencing recruitment in clinical trials. DESIGN We sent a questionnaire to principle investigators of all 1130 trials prospectively registered in the Netherlands Trial Register with an expected date of completing recruitment between 2005 and 2010. We used logistic regression analysis to assess whether characteristics of the trial or the principle investigator were associated with successful recruitment, i.e. 80% of the targeted number of patients was recruited within the planned time. RESULTS Of 392 trials questionnaires were completed. For these trials 232,707 persons were to be recruited. In half of the trials recruitment was unsuccessful. Although 42% of the trials were extended for ?6 months, when closing recruitment 46% still had recruited fewer patients than originally intended. Of the investigators 67% stated recruitment was more difficult than expected. Factors univariably associated with unsuccessful recruitment were: clear responsibilities for recruitment, investigator not PhD, multicenter trial, presentation at start for recruiters, newsletter for recruiters, pocket cards, email at start of the trial and a low expected number of randomizations per month. In multivariable analysis, adjusted for potential confounders, associated with recruitment were having a PhD (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0,17-0,83) and giving a presentation at start of the trial for recruiters (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.64) - the latter might be indicative for complexity of a trial. CONCLUSION Investigators frequently overestimate recruitment success when starting a trial. Although we identified factors associated with recruitment, we are unable to make general recommendations for improving recruitment. A possible limitation of this study is the risk for selective responses and unmeasured confounders. Investigators should be aware of potential recruitment difficulties when starting a new trial. The role of glucocorticoid receptor single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in receptor function and metabolic disease is being studied at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). This in vivo and in vitro observational gene association study investigates functional relevance of SNPs in the NR3C1 gene. Individuals with and without functionally relevant SNPs are identified and recruited from the Environmental Polymorphism Registry (EPR). The EPR is a DNA biorepository of over 15,000 participants developed at NIEHS to help researchers better understand relationships between environmental exposures, genetic susceptibility and disease. The primary objective is to investigate in vivo the role of hGR SNPs (hGR9b A3669G, hGR N363S) in steroid responsiveness using dexamethasone and comparing serum cortisol levels by genotype. Initial comparisons indicate some hGR9b A3669G carriers are resistant to dexamethasone. The secondary objective is to investigate the role of hGR SNPs (hGR9b A3669G, hGR N363S) in human steroid responsiveness by comparing gene expression profiles of macrophages exposed ex vivo to corticosteroids. A pilot microarray study on macrophages without hGR SNPs revealed that although there is great variability in gene regulation between individuals, treatment with dexamethasone significantly altered gene regulation. These initial study results suggest functional relevance of hGR SNPs in the NR3C1 gene. The study is also the first EPR study conducted at the NIEHS Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and will help define and enhance operations of future EPR studies, including recruitment strategies. Metformin in Women with Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy Trial (MiTy) is a multi-centre, double-masked, randomized placebo-controlled trial for pregnant women with type 2 diabetes. With 500 recruits expected from 25 participating centres across Canada, MiTy seeks to determine whether the addition of Metformin to their usual insulin regimen, will decrease the incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes. Study sites are required to schedule prenatal visits for study participants every four weeks, based on gestational age at randomization. At MiTy prenatal visits, collaborators are required to supply study drug, distribute glucose strips, take specific blood tests, measure serum creatinine, download glucometer readings, and count pills to verify patient compliance, in addition to routine standard care. Prenatal visit information is then entered on the prenatal visit form following each patient appointment. Specific strategies were needed to help collaborators keep track of prenatal visit schedules; identify which tasks were required to be completed at each visit; and to indicate when to complete the prenatal forms. Therefore, several tools were developed to ensure successful adherence to the study requirements. A study manual was created to explain the specifics on how to manage the trial. This included a timeline with descriptions of tasks to be completed at particular stages during the patient's pregnancy, as well as checklists of tasks to be completed at each appointment. Prenatal visit appointment schedules were programmed upon randomization, notifying study coordinators of the exact week to schedule prenatal visits according to gestational age. Appointment reminders were emailed one week prior to the appointment, along with consistent email and telephone communication. Furthermore, centres receive tips and reminders through the monthly MiTy newsletter, group teleconferences, and regional meetings. This presentation will share successful approaches used to ensure adherence to study requirements. Assessment of the change in tumor size in response to treatment is critical in the evaluation of anti-cancer agents. The purpose of this presentation is to review the status of standardized solid tumor response criteria published since the early 1980s including WHO criteria, RECIST 1.0, RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST 1.0. The existing criteria (WHO, RECIST 1.0, RECIST 1.1) will be compared in terms of number of target lesion requirement at baseline, lymph node usage in the calculation of tumor size, the requirement of confirmatory responses as well as other specific criteria used in the existing guidelines. Similarities and differences between the tumor assessment criteria will be illustrated using specific examples. Consideration of unidimensional and bidimensional measurements as well as the possibility of three-dimensional analyses will be discussed. New imaging techniques such as FDG-PET and MRI in tumor assessment as well as treatment classification, specifically cytostatic, will be examined. Non-measurable disease at baseline will also be considered with respect to each criterion. Other discussions will include "modified RECIST" and why it should be avoided. The limitations of standardization and possible future development will also be discussed. Background: Historically, there have been significant barriers to conducting research in tribal communities, including a lack of understanding of American Indian (AI) culture and research. Methods: Spring of 2002, University of Oklahoma Health Science Center (OUHSC) and four AI Tribe/Nations with Institutional Review Boards (IRB) (Absentee Shawnee Tribe, Cherokee Nation, the Chickasaw Nation, Choctaw Nation) and OKC Area Indian Health Service (IHS) IRB (collectively AI Partner(s)) proposed to participate in one of the largest pediatric diabetes research trials supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This venture required an agreement between AI Nations and academic university addressing essential elements: trust, collaboration, and successful outcome. Results: The four AI Tribe/Nations executed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). The MOA stipulated: 1) AI Coordinator hired to foster relationships, assist with recruitment, and facilitate pre- review by AI Partners of publications containing AI descriptive data. Sixty-one (61) AI patients were screened and forty (40) of those patients randomized into the TODAY Study. 2) Establish a committee comprised of AI Partner representatives to review publications. The committee meets for monthly publication updates with regular communication between meetings. The committee has met approximately 20 times and has reviewed approximately 50 items. Presentation will describe the efforts in retaining tribal partnerships including barriers that arose and resolutions. Conclusions: After 9 years, 4 AI IRBs and OKC IHS IRB have created and maintained a successful collaboration with an academic university in a large clinical trial. This multi-tribal research partnership is an excellent model of how community and multi-ethnic collaborative research can be effective. Purpose: To ascertain the experiences and perceptions of participation in cancer clinical trials by Hispanic and Black cancer survivors. Methods: As part of a larger study to develop a decision aid for participation in cancer clinical trials, we conducted semi-structured interviews with English-speaking Hispanic (15), Spanish- speaking Hispanic (15), and Black (15) cancer survivors. We employed quantitative content analysis to code responses to 16 specific questions based on transcripts from the interviews. Results: The average age of participants was 56.0 (SD 10.6) years; 93.3% were female, with most having had breast cancer (66.7%). Years since diagnosis ranged from 1-16, with an average of 3.3 (SD 3.0). Only 4 had been asked to participate in a clinical trial, and of these, 3 had joined a trial. Although only 4 had talked with a provider about participating, 23 (54.8%) wished that such a conversation had happened. In addition, 32 (71.1%) said that they would be willing to participate in a trial, and another 8 (17.8%) said that they may be willing. Almost all, 97.8%, said that it would be helpful to hear other cancer patients' experiences with clinical trials. However, most (81.8%) stated that it would not make any difference if the people relaying the experiences were of the participant's own race/ethnicity. Rather, information from someone with their own type of cancer was viewed as very important by 36%. Conclusions: Although few participants had even talked about clinical trials with their health care providers, most cancer survivors expressed willingness to participate. These findings highlight the need for discussions about clinical trials between physicians and patients. Increasing cancer patients' knowledge and self-efficacy to discuss clinical trials with healthcare providers, for example through a decision aid, may lead to a much needed increase in participation rates. Purpose: Participation in cancer clinical trials is very low, particularly for minority cancer patients. The goal of this research was to develop a web-based decision aid to improve minority cancer patients' decision making about whether to participate in a clinical trial. Methods: Steps in developing the decision aid were: a) collecting information on barriers and promoters of participation; b) developing a theoretical framework to conceptualize the decision aid components; c) using cognitive interviewing to pilot test the decision aid; and d) testing the decision aid to determine its effects on attitudes and knowledge about cancer clinical trials. Information was collected using 3 complementary approaches: a) data from a telephone survey of 1100 cancer survivors; b) a literature review; and most importantly, c) semi-structured interviews with cancer survivors. All participants were either Hispanic or Black. Results: For the semi-structured interviews, 45 participants were recruited. The information from the 3 sources was used to develop the KEV (Knowledge, Empowerment, and Values) framework for the decision aid. The website was developed, and successfully pilot tested with 8 participants. Currently, we are assessing the effectiveness of the decision aid to improve patients' knowledge about clinical trials, empower them to talk with their health care provider about trials, and clarify their values and preferences related to trials participation in 100 participants. Assessment of the effect of the decision aid is done by comparing knowledge, attitudes, and decisional conflict about clinical trials before and after viewing the decision aid. Conclusions: While quantitative data on the effectiveness and acceptability of the decision aid is not yet available, feedback from the participants has been extremely positive. Participants knowledge increases, and many state that they wish they had had such an instrument when they were first diagnosed. Our ultimate goal is to make this decision aid widely available. The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research (CMICR) was established to improve the health of women and their children through clinical research and education. As the data coordinating centre for several international randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is imperative that all trial operations are completed in a consistent manner to ensure maintenance of a quality management system. Thus, in adherence to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, CMICR uses written standard operating procedures (SOPs) in its daily operations. In a team setting, it is especially important to have a standard set of detailed SOPs, along with clear, well-established rules to follow. This allows for the management of various aspects of the organization to be structured and easily maintained. In previous years, each trial team created and maintained their individual SOPs. This resulted in varying procedures between each study and a lack of detail, which was addressed in the new format. Various methods were employed to identify the most effective way to achieve uniformity of all SOPs. A staff member was designated the specific role of standardizing all trial SOPs to ensure consistency. The existing SOP system was reviewed over a three month period to assist in developing an improved structure. This new structure includes a revised coding system, as well as improved methods for archiving and updating task-specific SOPs. A template was also created to ensure a simple, easy-to-read layout of all newly established SOPs. In addition, to assist in the implementation of the new SOP system, specific guidelines were established on how to create an SOP document. All SOPs are submitted to the designated staff member for review, and are made accessible to all staff. These revisions to the SOP system have addressed inconsistencies, and created cohesion throughout the organization. The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research, Sunnybrook Research Institute Toronto, Ontario, Canada The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research (CMICR) is the data coordinating centre and administrative site for several large, multi-centre, international randomized controlled trials that aim to improve clinical practice and the health outcomes of women and their children. CMICR has established an international collaborative group of research sites that may simultaneously participate in several CMICR-coordinated trials. It has become evident that successful recruitment and protocol adherence of a site in one CMICR-coordinated trial does not guarantee its success in another, and in trials with limited budgets and timelines, identifying suitable sites is vital. To assist in the site evaluation and selection process, CMICR developed an improved trial-specific Site Feasibility Questionnaire (SFQ). The revised SFQ developed by CMICR includes four main sections. The first, "Study Background", includes the research summary, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and outlines the study requirements. In the second section, "Site Information", sites are asked to provide information about their experience and performance in other research trials, resource information (i.e. research staff, facilities, equipment), and the total number of patients that meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria annually. The third section, "Study Protocol Requirements", is important in determining whether the site will be able to adhere to the study protocol. Sites are asked about their local standard of care and whether they will be able to follow the schedule of events and carry out all the required tasks. The final section covers recruitment topics and sites are asked to explain any anticipated difficulties with the trial. Once the centre has reviewed the protocol and considered all survey responses, the final requirement is to provide their expected annual recruitment goal. The presentation will share how to write an effective Site Feasibility Questionnaire that will help in site evaluation and selection process. Ensuring timely recruitment of appropriate subjects into clinical trials is not only a measure of study discipline, it provides economic efficiencies and also ensures that study results will be relevant since they are reflective of current practice. We have developed processes to ensure the timely recruitment of appropriate subjects and will provide suggestions and examples from several large international trials involving over 500 hospitals in more than 40 countries. Not only is timely recruitment essential to success of the trial, adherence to the trial intervention and complete follow-up on all patients is critical. We have developed tools to encourage compliance and prevent "potential lost to follow-up" . We will also present examples of specific impediments to follow-up. Among these examples is recent privacy legislation enacted in some countries which has fostered an environment of uncertainty and caution at many investigating sites. There is a perception that individual rights can take precedence over the completeness and accuracy of the clinical trial results. Site personnel have refused to follow any patient who has "withdrawn his/her consent". We will demonstrate how we have been able to overcome this obstacle in most countries by clearing up misconceptions and by re- educating the investigating site personnel. Successful blood sample collection in multi-center trials could be achieved through the implementation of a trial-specific Quality Assurance Monitoring System (QAMS) that ensures the high-quality sample retrieval needed for optimal biomarker measurement. In the SOX Trial, a Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Heart & Stroke Foundation funded multi-center RCT of active vs. placebo stockings to prevent PTS in 803 patients with acute proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), blood specimen samples were collected within the first 6-mths of diagnosis to evaluate whether biomarkers reflective of inflammation, coagulation activation and genetic thrombophilia influence PTS development. At baseline, 1 and 6-mth visits, blood samples drawn from consenting patients were processed, aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes, frozen at -80°C and batched from 24 study sites to the Trial Coordinating Centre (TCC) for central storage according to study Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) instructions. Specimens were then assessed for quality based on these standards: sample recovery (SR), correct sample type (CST), adequate sample volume (ASV) and correct tube labeling (CTL). For buffy-coat collection, all 4 criteria were met for 79% of samples: 99.2%, 79.9%, 99.8% and 100% for SR, CST, ASV and CTL standards, respectively. For platelet-poor plasma collection, all 4 criteria were met for 94.3% of samples: 97.7%, 98.2%, 99% and 100% for SR, CST, ASV and CTL, respectively. In general, we noted that sites with lower overall quality were those with a lower patient retention rate, frequent coordinator turnovers, and sample processing left to study personnel. Development of site-directed SOPs followed by routine TCC quality checks for sample integrity are two economical ways to implement a successful QAMS in budget-limited government-funded studies; these mechanisms help safeguard sample quality, reduce missing data and enhance credibility of study results. Additional site-specific monitoring may also be warranted for study sites with poor performance and limited resources. There are unique challenges faced in the conduct of clinical trials in the relatively new research field of cardiac surgery. Several strategies have been implemented in the start-up phase of a large, international, publically-funded clinical trial in cardiac surgery (the Steroids in Cardiac Surgery (SIRS) trial) to address these challenges. Currently, the largest published clinical trial in cardiac surgery is the ROOBY trial which recruited 2203 patients from 18 centers. SIRS will recruit 7500 patients from approximately 85 centers in 18 countries, making it the largest clinical trial conducted in cardiac surgery to date (recruitment as of Nov. 30, 2011 was 1919). From the experience of starting-up SIRS, many challenges were identified and strategies have been used which can be translated to other research fields, particularly to trials being conducted in new disease research areas. The most common challenges faced during the start-up phase of a large, international clinical trial are: adhering to project timelines; dealing with various country-specific regulatory issues; identifying appropriate clinical sites; and ensuring proper study conduct for the duration of the trial. In SIRS, there were the added unique challenges of being a study in a fairly new clinical research field with many novice investigators and without an established global cardiac surgery research network, as well as having limited funding. These challenges and the implemented strategies used to address these obstacles have been outlined in Table 1. Conducting global clinical research is complex and involves many hurdles, especially in a relatively new area such as cardiac surgery. SIRS will hopefully pave the way for future large clinical trials in cardiac surgery by building a global network of investigators, and by developing tools to meet the challenges (particularly in the start-up phase) which are crucial to the successful and efficient coordination of a large clinical trial. Under the Best Pharmaceutical for Children Act (BPCA), the protocol "Use of Lorazepam for the Treatment of Pediatric Status Epilepticus: A Randomized, Double- Blinded Trial of Lorazepam and Diazepam," changed from one Clinical Research Organization (CRO) to another CRO mid- study. The transition included moving from paper to electronic case report forms (CRFs). The transition involved four steps: 1) transferring the datasets from the previous CRO's data format to the new data format, 2) creating a user-friendly electronic data capture system that included all required fields and any new fields desired by the sponsor, 3) accurately mapping and uploading the data from the previous CRO to the new system and 4) transitioning the sites to the new system. To streamline these processes, collaboration with the previous CRO, the study sponsor, and the coordinators performing the data entry was essential. Building the electronic data system required identifying all required fields, determining the format of data fields, changing free text fields to drop-down fields, adding new fields requested by the sponsor, obtaining any data quality checks implemented by the previous CRO, and assuring sponsor approval for all changes made to the data collection procedures. All uploaded data required extensive quality control to assure the accuracy of the mapped data. Site transition involved creating a plan for the collection of ongoing data while the electronic system was in process, including reporting of serious adverse events and protocol deviations, and training the sites on the new system. Soliciting input from the site coordinators on the data collection process was valuable in improving efficiency of and satisfaction with the new data collection system. Background: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) invests heavily in the conduct of clinical trials benefiting public health. For the Division of AIDS (DAIDS), trial quality is managed in part through a risk-based monitoring program performed by contract monitors. Prior to 2010, these monitoring functions were not subject to independent review. In 2010, DAIDS began sponsoring an independent auditing program to assess the quality and effectiveness of the contract monitoring. We report on the development and progress of these quality assurance (QA) audits during the first 2 years of the auditing contract, where ~90 QA audits were conducted, and on their preliminary impact on the DAIDS monitoring program. Methods: Using an independent contractor for the NIAID Auditing Services Program (NASP), QA auditors sampled monitoring reports and performed on-site audits at selected clinical research sites (CRSs). About 12 CRSs were chosen quarterly based on several qualifying criteria, including monitoring report content and risk level of protocols. Routine NASP audits are characterized primarily as performance audits rather than Good Clinical Practice (GCP) audits, since DAIDS procedures for the monitoring contractor are very focused due to the risk-based monitoring program design. Teams of NASP auditors based in the United States, South Africa, and Brazil were trained on DAIDS-specific procedures and the same instructions provided to monitors. Auditors reviewed a sample of the same materials that were previously monitored, and reported directly to the DAIDS sponsor on any findings. Results: From over 740 CRSs in nearly 50 countries, over 1170 on-site monitoring visits were performed at about 233 CRSs in 21 countries over the past 2 years. Sampling those visits, ~90 NASP audits were completed in 14 countries, with no critical and few major findings observed. Several findings led directly to significant improvements in DAIDS monitoring policies and procedures. Over the past decade, the administrative burden of clinical trials has become an issue of national concern. One significant component of the bureaucracy is ensuring compliant billing practices. Where a coverage analysis at a single site may take as many as eight hours to complete, the inefficiency of this being repeated by every site in a multi-institution clinical trial highlights an unnecessary burden. One cooperative group, SWOG, piloted providing a coverage analysis to its sites and found the utility of doing so most benefited lower-accruing sites, who reported the most time spent completing analyses for trials they participated in and with the least resources to do so. The pilot also revealed that some sites had not yet adopted a practice of completing a coverage analyses, pointing to the increased risk of clinical billing fraud. With the future of cancer research diverging from standard of care and into innovative new directions such as biomarker discovery, the current federal funding system for cancer research requires processes to ensure compliant billing. In multi-institutional clinical trials, having the sponsor providing a coverage analysis using national guidelines and standards adds efficiency to an administratively over- burdened clinical trial management process. Further, the provision of a sponsor-provided coverage analysis particularly benefits the lower-accruing sites in reducing the risk of fraudulent billing. Cancer research sponsors can easily support success and continued participation by community practices by providing coverage analyses. Project supported by NIH funded grants CA032102 and CA037429 Many dose finding designs including the continual reassessment method (CRM) have been shown as statistically advantageous over traditional up down methods such as the '3+3'. However, these designs have been slow to gain popularity as they can be computationally intensive, often need specialized software, and require additional input during protocol development. We present a practical application that utilizes the likelihood-based CRM to monitor an ongoing investigator initiated '3+3' phase I trial for lymphoma patients at the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center. During this trial, dose-limiting toxicities were redefined and there were concerns about the flexibility of the '3+3' to accommodate these changes mid-cohort. Since the CRM accommodates various cohort sizes and makes use of all accrued patient toxicity information to estimate the dose closest to the maximum tolerated dose at any point in the trial, we monitored the ongoing trial to confirm dose escalation rules according to the '3+3' were appropriate. Additionally, we compared operating characteristics of various CRM designs that accommodate ordinal or binary toxicity grades. We describe what information was needed to construct the initial design as well as how current accrued toxicity data was included in the model to estimate the next dose needed, using the R package ordcrm. Interestingly, this monitoring exercise gave clinical investigators, biostatisticians, and other research team members the opportunity to learn more about the likelihood-based CRM and gain information regarding the logistical issues and advantages of applying this design in practice. Not only did this verify that the CRM is feasible to implement and incorporates more toxicity information throughout the trial, but it has educated clinical research team members on this alternative dose finding design and has sparked interest in using the likelihood-based CRM as the design in future trials. The utilization of randomization in phase II trials is increasingly being recommended in the evaluation of anticancer therapies prior to pursuing larger phase III trials. Randomized comparisons offer protection against selection bias and are needed when historical control data are not available for designing a new trial. Several candidate randomized designs can be considered depending on trial design and objectives. A phase II randomized trial in breast cancer of two candidate targeted therapies is planned in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The study endpoints are tumor response rate and progression-free survival (PFS). We consider different study designs to determine patient number requirements and assess feasibility and performance of the trial design under different scenarios. Specifically, we utilize i) selection design (design A); ii) two-stage selection design (design B); iii) screening design (design C); and iv) two-stage randomized phase II trial design (design D). Given the null and alternative hypotheses assumptions for response and PFS endpoints of this particular breast cancer trial, patient number requirements are reasonable across all potential trial designs. Designs C and D offer more conclusive results given the hypothesis-testing strategy of these designs. For the particular regimens and clinical problem being addressed in this phase II breast cancer trial, we favor the use of designs C or D which, although requiring slightly bigger patient numbers, affords more definitive conclusions on whether to proceed to a larger phase III trial. It is important to carefully assess a particular clinical trial scenario to decide not only whether to proceed with a single arm, historical control design but also the most appropriate randomized design if the latter is of interest. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has successfully completed phase Ia and Ib clinical trials of one of their leading HIV vaccine candidates in 2010. While China is committed to launch its first HIV vaccine efficacy trial, it is important to appropriately choose the most promising vaccine regimen to advance from Phase IIa safety and immunogenicity testing to later phase efficacy testing. The candidate vaccine regimen is comprised of 3 DNA prime immunizations followed by one replicating Tiantan Vaccinia (rTV) virus vector boost. Since the timing of the vector boost will have great impact on the potency and longevity of the vaccine-induced immune responses, the Phase IIa trial is designed to evaluate 3 different boosting schedules and to select the best to advance to efficacy testing. For Phase IIa testing, since multiple immunogenicity and safety endpoints with an ordering of preference are of interest for assessment with respect to clinical and biological relevance and importance, we propose a ranking and selection design that accounts for multiple endpoints of different types and allows for equal ranking when vaccine arms are indistinguishable within certain pre-specified margin from the best arm. Bootstrap-based evaluation of the precision of ranking is performed for each endpoint. In addition, to prevent advancing any vaccine arms from trials with uniformly week candidates, we require that a vaccine regimen to be selected must exceed an absolute minimum response probability and/or magnitude threshold. Sample size calculations are performed to evaluate how many vaccinees per arm are needed to achieve high probability of correctly selecting the arm with the best combination of 4 endpoints. Preliminary simulation results show that such selection design performs well. As the distinction between the best arm(s) and inferior arm(s) becomes larger, the selection accuracy increases. Overall the probabilities of incorrect selection are low. Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention plans to launch the country's first Phase IIb HIV vaccine efficacy trial in 2014. The candidate vaccine regimen is comprised of 3 DNA prime immunizations followed by one replicating Tiantan Vaccinia (rTV) virus vector boost. Supported by a supplementary fund to the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) by NIAID, the HVTN statistical team is currently working closely with Chinese researchers on the design and planning of this trial. The proposed trial design is considered to be reviewed by the Chinese State FDA in early 2012. We intend to apply a contingency two-stage evaluation of vaccine efficacy (VE), where durability of VE over a range of 0-3 years will be evaluated in Stage 2 if and only if positive VE proximal (e.g. over the first 18-24 months) to the immunization series is detected in Stage 1. Such a strategy is under consideration for the design of future HVTN trials in South Africa which may launch after the start of this China trial. To foster the most synergetic collaboration, we expect to work with a collaborative trial design team including representatives from trial sponsors, regulators, vaccine developers, manufactures, the Institutional Review Board of China CDC and key HIV vaccine researchers from both US and China. We acknowledge that the design phase will be highly iterative in order to finalize various context-driven trial design parameters, including study population, trial endpoint, type I and type II error rate level, trial outcome monitoring type and monitoring plan. Because the primary HIV vaccine trial sponsors are, for the first time, outside of US and the design expertise is primarily from the US, experience gained and lessons learned during such a process will be a treasure to share with the international clinical trial community. While many Phase III clinical trials have efficacy and safety endpoints, sample size calculations are generally based on efficacy, with safety addressed separately as a secondary endpoint. However, the overall clinical effect often involves efficacy and adverse safety or side effect trade-offs. While joint efficacy and safety endpoints have often been used for Phase II dose finding studies, such approaches have found limited application in Phase III trials. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a leading morbidity in extremely preterm infants, and prolonged mechanical ventilation increases BPD risk. Dexamethasone can facilitate extubation and decrease BPD incidence, but risk of neurodevelopment impairment (NDI) has led to decreased use. Because preliminary evidence suggests a better long-term safety profile for hydrocortisone than for dexamethasone, we designed a Phase III trial to sequentially evaluate the composite hypothesis that hydrocortisone (a) reduces the risk of death or BDP at 36 weeks; and (b) has an acceptable safety profile for death or NDI at 18 to 22 months. For the two- stage evaluation using robust Poisson models, we will first estimate relative risk and test the hypothesis that hydrocortisone lowers risk of death or BPD. If this test shows benefit, we will evaluate safety descriptively with safety considered achieved if either (1) the point estimate of risk of death/NDI is lower for hydrocortisone, or (2) death/NDI risk for hydrocortisone is increased, but the lower limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval for the ratio of death/BPD benefit to death/NDI risk is greater than 4. We describe procedures used for power and sample size calculations for this two- stage testing approach, present results from those calculations, and compare operating characteristics of this approach to one previously reported that involves joint testing of the bivariate death/BPD and death/NDI outcomes using extensions of methods described by Tournoux, et al (Contemporary Clinical Trials; 28:514). The objective was to undertake a phase II trial (TO-PARP) to identify the best CRPC patient group(s) to be studied for sensitivity to olaparib in a phase III trial. A multistage phase II design has been adopted which has a non-randomised component with response as the primary endpoint followed by a randomised component with overall survival as the primary endpoint. Non-randomised component : This allows early progression to a randomised comparison if there is evidence of a high response rate (50% or more) in unselected patients. Biomarker defined groups are investigated for treatment sensitivity if the response rate is weaker than this. The first stage involves entry of 30 patients. If 50% or more respond then no more patients will be entered and the randomised component will be undertaken in unselected patients. If 2 (7%) or less respond then olaparib will be rejected. If between 3-14 (10%-47%) patients respond then a further 15 patients will be entered. Should 23 (51%) or more respond overall then the randomised component will be undertaken in unselected patients but if 5 (11%) or fewer respond then olaparib will be rejected. Otherwise with 6-22 responders (13%-49%), biomarker analysis of tissue collected from all 45 patients will be undertaken with the aim of identifying a sensitive subgroup, with a response rate which is compatible with a 50% response rate. If such a subgroup is found, a confirmatory single stage 44 patient trial will be undertaken in this group; this will also yield experience of prospective biomarker testing in a multi-centre clinical trial setting. Randomised component : a phase II assessment of the results generated in the non-randomised part, offering more secure evidence before proceeding to phase III. 180 patients will be randomised 2:1 to olaparib or an appropriate standard of care (? 1-sided 10%, power 80%). Food can have very different effects in terms of health, because of nutrient composition and dosage. In nutritional field, multiple outcomes or multiple hypotheses related to the inter-relationships among those outcomes are common. This induces several statistical issues related to the inflation of the statistical error. Such aspects are not commonly taken into account in nutritional research, whereas are very commonly accomplished for in the drug-related investigations. In the context of multi-functional food, there can be both multiple effects on the health target of a given nutrient, or multiple nutrients acting toward a single target or perhaps even on multiple targets. In nutritional fields it unrealistic to take hypothesis and outcomes as independent, mostly because nutrient effects are strongly related to each other. This induces a different correlation structure among outcomes and targets. Basically, if no health claims intended for components, then the composite endpoint is tested at a predefined alpha-level and components are not statistically tested: then adjustment for multiplicity is needed, and the basic choice would be on how to consider the concurrent outcomes. If claims are intended for components, then a sequential testing scheme might be applied: the composite endpoint is statistically significant ant the alpha-level, and then tests for components are made in sequence for the same significance level alpha. No claims can be made if sequence breaks. The usage of more complex models allows for instance to approach the problem as a fallback testing strategy: allow to continue testing even if sequence breaks, testing the hypothesis after the failed using a weighted Bonferroni method. This paper discuss the issues arising in multifunctional research by multiplicity in testing, both with regard to multiple nutrients and to multiple effects of a single or more nutrients on the people's health. BACKGROUND. In the past few decades, it has become increasingly common for scientists based in richer countries to initiate clinical trials to be conducted in higher risk groups, in developing countries. This may creates opportunities for exploitation, as some activists and authors have argued, following early closure of several trials aiming at testing antiretrovirals for HIV prevention (PrEP), in 2004-2005. We aimed to compare the scientific methods of trials involving recruitment in developing countries to trials involving recruitment only in industrialized countries. METHODS. We conducted a systematic review, with a focus on efficacy/effectiveness trials. Based on guidance documents for the ethical conduct of HIV biomedical prevention trials (by UNAIDS/ WHO and by the Institute of Science), we developed a list of 33 key items. We searched Medline, Embase, Central, trial registries and the World Wide Web to identify eligible trials; and we communicated with investigators to obtain protocols and reports. Each protocol was fully reviewed by two independent assessors. RESULTS. We identified nine eligible trials, among which four had closed early at least one study site. We obtained full- text protocols for all efficacy trials. All but one trial had a Jadad score of 3/5 or more. On average, 20/33 validity items were reported in PrEP efficacy trials (61%). This average was 19/33 (58%) for trials closed early versus 2/33 (67%) for other trials. DISCUSSION. Early closures in HIV PrEP efficacy trials might be related to methodological issues. It is unclear how methods might have affected the ethical design and/or conduct of those trials. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

A decision of the Federal Joint Committee Germany states that negative pressure wound therapy is not accepted as a standard therapy with full reimbursement by the health insurance companies in Germany. This decision is based on the rapid report and the final report of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care, which demonstrated through systematic reviews and meta-analysis of previous studies projects that an insufficient state of evidence regarding the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for treatment of acute and chronic wounds exists. The Institute for Research in Operative Medicine (IFOM) as part of the University of Witten / Herdecke gGmbH is an independent scientific institute that is responsible for the planning, implementation, analysis and publication of trial projects regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapy for acute and chronic wounds in both medical sectors (in- and outpatient care) in Germany.
The study projects are designed and conducted with the aim to provide solid evidence regarding the efficacy of NPWT. The trials evaluate the treatment outcome of the application of a technical medical device which is based on the principle of negative pressure wound therapy (Intervention Group) in comparison to standard wound therapy (Control group) in the treatment of chronic foot wounds and acute subcutaneous abdominal wounds after surgery. All used treatment systems bear the CE mark and will be used within normal conditions of clinical routine and according to manufacturers instructions.
The aim of the trial projects is to compare the clinical, safety and economic results of both treatment arms. Study results will be provided until the end of 2014 to contribute to the final decision of the Federal Joint Committee Germany regarding the general admission of negative pressure wound therapy as a standard of performance within both medical sectors.

Introduction: Adequate patient recruitment is a key condition determining the validity, duration and costs of RCTs, yet remains challenging. The expanding interface between therapeutic endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery for the treatment of benign gastrointestinal diseases demands RCTs to compare safety and cost-effectiveness of comparable interventions. We aimed to identify patient motives and barriers for (non) participation in the TREND study.
Methods: Patients with large rectal adenomas counseled between January and July 2011 for participation in an RCT comparing endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) with transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) were invited for a semi-structured interview (14 participants, 12 non- participants). Interviewees were asked to discuss their main motive for (non-) participation in an open fashion. Subsequently, potential other barriers and motivations as previously described in the literature were presented by the interviewer. Interviews were coded and analyzed by 2 independent researchers.
Results: We interviewed 10 participants and 7 non-participants, aged 54-84. Key motive for trial participation was contribution to medical science and future clinical practice (all participants). Other motives included satisfactory counseling, sufficient time to reflect and the sense that participation was completely voluntary. The vast majority of non-participants had previous in-hospital experience, however more than half had

not been introduced to research prior. Although most non-participants felt contributing to research was important, key barriers to participation included a distinct preference for either EMR (n=4) or TEM (n=3) or intervention-specific characteristics like type of sedation (all non-participants). Consultation of family members affected half of all decisions. Study characteristics such as randomization, blinding, insurance and ethical approval hardly influenced the decision making.
Conclusion: In RCTs comparing similar endoscopic and surgical strategies, thorough, tailored and timely counseling is crucial to clarify the study purpose and to emphasize the presumed equality of allocation arms. Avoidance of common barriers to participation will improve trial inclusion.

FUNDING STRATEGIES FOR ESTABLISHING SURGICAL TRIAL

The establishment of clinical trial centers creates a demand for both infrastructure and skilled staff. While establishment and operation of clinical trial centers in surgical specialties have in recent years often been conducted by medical staff in addition to clinical practice, the intensification of legal regulations and the increased number of clinical trials in surgery requires rethinking. The ability to fulfill these more specialized demands can only be given by allocating sufficient funds. These funds can be used to employ trained para-medical staff and furthermore to release medical staff from clinical work and thereby enable full-time scientific work. On the other hand, a demand for funding is risen to implement infrastructural requirements such as IT hardware and premises. Once a clinical trial center has been established, further operation has to be ensured by generating additional funds. While the demand for start-up financing of a clinical trial unit is most meaningful arranged by governmental or institutional fundraising, the operation relies on generating sufficient funds through the conduction of industry-initiated trials. Own experience and further possibilities are demonstrated by reporting on different strategies for funding of clinical trial centers and the general demand of funds during establishment and operation of clinical trial centers. Therefore, different governmental, industrial as well as institutional supports are relevant factors.

In Europe safety management requirements in clinical trials with medical devices were changed fundamentally by the council directive 2007/47/EC in 2007 and internationally with the ISO 14155:2011 in 2011. Previously adverse incidents had to be reported to the competent authority. Since implementation of the directive in Germany each serious adverse event (SAE) which happened or might have happened to a patient, user, or third party, must be reported immediately. Sponsor and investigators must report SAEs via an electronic form centrally provided by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM). Besides profound knowledge adequate IT equipment at all investigator trial sites are needed. The latter being a challenge for academic trials with their low budgets. To develop operational competence the quality management (QM) working group of the Clinical Trials Centers (CTC)-network developed a harmonized SOP describing the complex procedures of safety management for sponsor and investigator trial sites. It includes appendices providing among others definitions, a template for an SAE-manual, and instructions for completing the electronic form. This document particularly suggests solutions regarding more general regulatory requirements,

e.g. follow-up information for the sponsor or for the competent authority. The implemented safety management procedures consider experiences derived from clinical trials with medicinal products and the special characteristics of academic trials. As increased numbers of clinical trials with medical devices are to be expected according to changed regulations CTCs will become more experienced with these complex procedures. Thus they will be competent partners to industry in conducting national and international clinical trials with medical devices. Our report will show the challenges of coping with this novel electronic reporting process, and provide our experiences in fulfilling the updated changed German national regulations.

Due to the ever increasing global activity in clinical research, knowledge transfer between researchers and all stakeholders in clinical health care (including patients) worldwide is an indispensable requirement. A prerequisite for knowledge transfer in clinical research is an unbiased and complete view on clinical trial results. How is the arising number of clinical trials registries and results databases being utilized by different user groups including ethics committees, clinicians, patients, researchers, reimbursement and funding institutions? What are the different requirements defined by the parties involved? How can variable needs be met? What seem to be the arising issues concerning database content, language barriers, retrieval problems, implementation of knowledge into daily work, evaluation of existing evidence? What efforts are made to overcome the obstacles?

Meanwhile it is daily experience that conduct of a clinical quality assurance audit involves some kind of computer system to be considered and assessed. The following fundamental question comes immediately to mind: how valid are data and information kept and handled by the systems employed? This question will be subdivided in five parts for the purpose of this session: Where does the basic computer system used come from, how has it been implemented and validated and how is it maintained? How has the computer system application used in a specific trial been developed, validated and deployed and how is it operated and maintained? Which regulations, guidelines and state of the art standards are to be expected to be observed for development, validation and operation? How big are the risks on data quality and acceptability of the study outcome in case of malfunction of the computer system application? How high are chances that system weaknesses can be detected in a standard audit setting and how can auditors optimise the preparation and conduct of their review to detect hidden system bugs? The session presents an overview over the current situation, naming specific risks and gives some answers to the questions posed afore, mainly by giving practical examples how to proceed in the most frequent audit situations, namely investigator site audits (eClinical and electronic source documents), CRO system audits and vendor audits.

A SIMPLE BAYESIAN DECISION THEORETIC DESIGN FOR DOSE FINDING TRIALS Ying Lu, Shenghua Fan, You-Gan WangPalo Alto VA CSP Coordinating Center & Stanford University, Mountain View, CA, USA
A flexible and simple Bayesian decision- theoretic design for dose finding trials is proposed in this paper. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we adopt a working model which produces analytic posterior

distributions. In addition, this working model is sufficiently flexible to fit all monotonic dose-toxicity curves. We also discuss how to use a proper utility function to reflect the interest of the trial. Patients are allocated based on not only the utility function but also the chosen dose selection rule. The most popular dose selection rule is the one-step-look-ahead (OSLA), which selects the best so far dose. More complicated rules such as two-step-look- ahead (TSLA) are surely more efficient than OSLA only when the required distributional assumptions are met which is however often not the case in practice. We carry out extensive simulation studies to evaluate a variety of dose selection rules and have found that OSLA is often more efficient than TSLA under our proposed method. Moreover, our simulation results show that the proposed method performs superior to several popular Bayesian methods and the negative impact of prior mis-specification could be considered in the design stage.

Isotonic Design using Normalized Equivalent Toxicity Score (ID-NETS) is a novel Phase I design originally proposed by Chen et al. by integrating the novel toxicity scoring system proposed by Chen et al. and the original Isotonic Design proposed by Leung et al. ID-NETS has substantially improved the accuracy of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation and efficiency of trial by fully utilizing all toxicities of each patient and treating toxicity response as a quasi-continuous variable instead of a binary indicator of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in a Phase I clinical trial. To facilitate designing and conducting a Phase I clinical trial with ID-NETS, we have developed a user-friendly software ID-NETSTM, which has two functions: 1) Calculating the recommended next dose level from completed data; and 2) Performing simulation to obtain the operating characteristics of a trial. Currently, ID-NETSTM v1.0 is available for download at http://winshipbbisr. emory.edu/IDNETS.html.

THE MODIFIED TOXICITY PROBABILITY INTERVAL (MTPI) METHOD FOR
PHASE I DOSE-FINDING TRIALSYuan Ji, Sue-Jane Wang, Ping LiuDepartment of Biostatistics The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Houston, Texas USA
Building on the toxicity probability interval (TPI) design in Ji et al. (2007), we present a modified TPI design (mTPI) that is calibration-free for phase I trials. Our goal is to further simplify the design and improve the trial conduct, and provide more effective and safer methods while maintaining the simplicity of the original TPI design. Like the TPI method, mTPI consists of a practical dose-finding scheme guided by the posterior inference using a simple Bayesian model. However, the new method benefits from improved dose-finding decision rules based on a new statistic, the unit probability mass (UPM). The improvement through the use of the UPM for dose finding is significant. We will present extensive simulation results comparing the mTPI design to the 3+3 and CRM methods, and provide convincing evidence why the mTPI is a practically superior method.

model (EWOC-PH) using time to toxicity to estimate the MTD. The method has been shown to be more efficient to estimate MTD comparing to the original EWOC and a version of time to event EWOC (TITEEWOC) proposed by Mauguen et al (2010). In this study, we will further extent EWOC-PH to take into account patients baseline covariates. The extension of EWOC to accommodate baseline covariates has been developed by Babb and Rogatko (2001) and Tighiouart and Rogatko (2010). We expect that the new design will provide better safety protection by assigning a personalized dose to the next available patient based on his/her own baseline characteristics and lead to an estimation for covariate specific phase II dose. We assess the operating characteristics for the design via extensive simulations including three scenarios: (1) design using a covariate; (2) Design ignoring the covariate; (3) Design using separate trials. The efficiency of estimating the conditional MTD and safety of the trial are compared with original EWOC with covariate using DLT as a binary indicator of toxicity.

Escalation with overdose control (EWOC) is a successful Phase I design and has been widely used. Chen et al. further extended EWOC to utilize fully all toxicities of patients instead of a binary indicator of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) by incorporating the normalized toxicity scoring system (NETS) proposed by Chen et al. into EWOC with a quasi-Bernoulli likelihood approach. The new design is called EWOC-NETS which has been demonstrated by simulation studies to have good operating characteristics and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation relative to common Phase I designs. In this study, we have developed an interactive software called EWOC-NETSTM which is very user friendly to facilitate designing and conducting a Phase I clinical trial with EWOC-NETS and available for free download at the website of Emory University http://winshipbbisr.emory.edu/Software.html. We would like to introduce this novel statistical software and translate EWOC-NETS into Phase I cancer clinical trials in the future.

A COX REGRESSION MODEL WITH ISOTONIC REGRESSORS WITH CHANGE-POINT
PROBLEMS: ADDRESSING A CLINICAL QUESTION Das Purkayastha; Stan Li
Affiliation:Novartis Pharmaceuticals Biometrics, US Medical East Hanover, NJ 07869, USA
Some clinical predictors may or may not have monotonic properties. They may have increasing or decreasing pattern or they may remain steady during a period of observation time. A clinical question is raised on how such increasing or decreasing or constant pattern of variations may have effect on survival or on clinical outcomes independently during a period of time. Generally we ignore such point of transitions and independent pattern of variations while investigating their overall effect.
Isotonicity is called the simple or partial ordered monotonicity mathematically. Isotonic regression is performed under ordered monotonic restrictions criteria. Either increasing or decreasing or constant variation of a clinical predicator or of a prognostic variable generates a change-point problem at the transition from increasing order to decreasing order or vice versa or from the steady condition to either increasing or decreasing pattern of clinical predictors.
The primary thrust of this paper is to address such clinical questions using a Cox Regression Model with isotonic regressors with such change-point problems. In a case study with multiple myeloma the impact of such change- point patterns of clinically significant predictors such as hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen, white blood corpuscles, platelets on patients median survival time have been explored.

THE LONG ROAD TO START UP RCTS WITHIN THE SOCIAL SERVICES INTERVENTIONS IN DENMARK Maiken PontoppidanSFI The Danish National Institute for Social Research, Copenhagen, Denmark.
Policy makers in Denmark are starting to realize that RCT designs are needed if they want to know the impact of social interventions. Therefore the Ministry of Social Affair granted funding to do three RCTs of family programs (Multidimension Treatment Foster Care-MTFC, Parent Management Training Oregon -PMTO and Multisystemic Therapy-MST). During the last year SFI has been planning the studies including all relevant parts in the process. The process has been long and challenging. Problems faced include: 1: A pronounced resistance to randomization within all levels of social services. 2: An economic crisis in the municipalities causing both unwillingness to participate in the research study and a significant lower caseload in the MST and MTFC teams. 3: Fear of the study going to steal half of the families from the programs. 4: Underfunding of the studies. 5: Resistance against using standardized tests because this is not common in social work, and 6: Difficulties in getting data for power calculations. Recurring issues that we have had to deal with are: do we really have to randomize? Cant we just do some kind of matching? and it would be much better to spend the money on a wider implementation of the program and practice oriented qualitative research. Recently the MST study was cancelled since all five MST teams declined to participate. Funding was transferred to the other two studies making them look more promising. A lot of resources have been used to prepare the studies and expectations are high. Hopefully by May 2012 the MTFC study will be recruiting families and the PMTO study will be ready to start recruiting in September 2012. If all goes well the two studies will be among the first RCTs carried out on social interventions in Denmark.

ELEMENTS OF A PHASE 3 IND STUDY PROTOCOL AN FDA STATISTICAL PERSPECTIVE Renee Rees, Ghideon Ghebregiorgis, Shiowjen Lee, Lihan YanFDA, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Division of Biostatistics Rockville, MD USA
Regulatory goals for a clinical study can be different from research and exploratory goals. For the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Phase 3 Investigational New Drug (IND) studies (i.e., adequate and well- controlled studies) will provide the primary clinical evidence to support a marketing application such as a Biologic License Application (BLA). To support approval and initiation of these studies, the protocol should cover all the statistical issues considered by the reviewers when assessing the study design and its ability to adequately address the study objectives. As an aid to statistical reviewers, as well as to improve efficiency and consistency in our reviews of these protocols, the Division of Biostatistics in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) has developed a checklist outlining the important elements of a Phase 3 protocol. Some elements included in this checklist are consistency between the study objectives and endpoints; number and regions of study sites; statistical hypotheses; planned interim analyses; sample size assumptions and calculations; randomization description; blinding techniques; analysis populations; multiplicity considerations; missing data considerations; study success criterion; and study conduct. Original IND submissions with protocols with such elements may also lead to less correspondence with the sponsor to clarify items in the protocol. We note that the elements identified in this checklist may also be helpful in designing earlier phase studies as well as non-IND studies. This presentation will focus on the motivation, contents, and use of the checklist.

pre-specified margin of non-inferiority cannot be easily defined? We will discuss a double-blind clinical trial in which SLE patients on long-term MMF therapy with stable disease are randomized to continue therapy or withdraw. It is expected that withdrawal from MMF will result in increased risk of disease reactivation; however, long- term MMF treatment is not without risk of side effects. The goal of the trial is to determine if the increase in risk of disease reactivation outweighs the benefits of withdrawal. One could frame this goal as a test of the non-inferiority hypothesis that the increased risk of disease reactivation is greater than a pre-specified margin, determined by potential benefit. However, how the risks and benefits should be weighed is highly individual, even for experienced rheumatologists. Rather than design the study to test a hypothesis of non- inferiority using an arbitrary risk margin that may or may not be relevant for any particular patient, the results of this trial will be reported as effect estimates for change in risk of disease reactivation in addition to other disease activity, safety, quality of life and medication use endpoints. These effect estimates and confidence intervals will describe the risks and benefits of withdrawal from study therapy and may be used to guide physicians and patients in making decisions based on individualized assessments of acceptable risk. As clinicians are likely to find interpretation of results difficult in the absence of hypothesis testing (and p-values), we will discuss the approach planned for disseminating clinical trial results.

METHODS OF ANALYSES FOR A COMPLEX INTERVENTION CLUSTER RANDOMISED
STROKE TRIAL LOOKING FOR THE GOOSE THAT LAYS THE GOLDEN EGG
Ivana Holloway and Amanda FarrinClinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU), University of Leeds, Leeds, UK
Cluster randomised trials (CRTs), compared to individually randomised trials, require specific analysis; statistical models need to take account of between-cluster variability. This abstract focuses on two main approaches to analysis, cluster-level (CL) and individual-level (IL), and examines their efficiency for the Training Caregivers After Stroke trial (TRACS). TRACS is a CRT evaluating a complex intervention in stroke rehabilitation with 928 dyads of patients and caregivers within 36 stoke rehabilitation units. The primary outcome is NEADL score at 6 months. CL analysis is attractive due to its simplicity. We compare performance of three techniques; simple summaries (using appropriate two- sample weighted t-tests), CL analysis adjusted for covariates and nonparametric methods. The CL approach is a two-stage method; in unadjusted analysis, a summary measure for each cluster is calculated and two sets of cluster-specific measures are compared using the weighted t-test. When performing CL analysis adjusted for covariates; we carried out an IL regression with all but intervention effect covariates ignoring the clustering effect. Secondly, we compared the residuals for each cluster between treatment arms using the weighted two-sample t-test. Wilcoxons rank sum test was used as a nonparametric substitute to the two-sample t- test. IL analysis, using a random effects linear mixed model with stroke rehabilitation units as level 2, was the preferred method, because of its greater computational convenience and it is possible to analyse the intervention effect and other covariates simultaneously. The CL approach is robust, particularly for a smaller number of clusters. However, it may not be statistically the most efficient, especially if clusters are of varying size. Such weighting is incorporated in IL analysis. Analysis of cluster randomised trials can be undertaken in a number of ways. We will present and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each of these analytical methods.

DOES USING MINIMISATION MAKE A DIFFERENCE?: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM
THREE MULTI-CENTRE STUDIES.
Gladys McPherson, Marion Campbell, Diana Elbourne1st and 2nd authors - Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, UK 3rd author - London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK
Simple randomisation is the easiest method for allocating participants to treatment groups in clinical trials. In the long run it balances all features of participants across the groups but may not be suitable for small to medium sized trials, or for larger trials at the time of interim analysis. If important prognostic factors are identified at the design stage then minimisation can help to balance these features.
Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 450 554 http://ctj.sagepub.com
Abstracts 457
There is uncertainty as to whether treatment groups need to be balanced at baseline, but many researchers believe this to be advantageous, allowing comparison between groups without the need for sophisticated analysis. Balance between treatment groups can be desirable in a range of scenarios: for small trials, interim analyses, early termination, analysis of subgroups or where the credibility of an unbalanced trial is considered problematic (e.g. in the case of a small treatment effect).
Three completed trials of varying size, originally using minimisation as method of treatment allocation, were re-randomised, in the order that participants joined the study, using simple randomisation. Datasets frozen at the time of either interim or full analysis were used.
For all three trials treatment allocation was well balanced across prognostic variables and between treatment arms when using minimisation at all time points, i.e. for any number of participants recruited at that time. With simple randomisation, at each timepoint imbalances were identified that could have made analysis more difficult. In some cases the potential imbalance across treatment groups within a factor reached 100% (where all participants with a given characteristic were in the same treatment allocation group) and no amount of sophisticated analysis could compensate for this. The simulations demonstrated the need for incorporating minimisation into the randomisation algorithm of trials of any size in order to achieve treatment balance which cannot be achieved by using simple randomisation alone.

FUTILITY BOUNDARY DESIGN BASED ON PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS Yijie Zhou, Ruji Yao, Bo Yang, Ramachandran Suresh
A futility analysis is commonly utilized in clinical trials for early read of trial efficacy data. An investigational drug will be declared futile if the prespecified futility boundary is met, and the trial will be stopped. In a conventional group sequential design, a futility boundary is selected based on power preservation or sufficient conditional power, which protects the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis at the end of a trial. However, the observed treatment effect size is of increasing importance beyond rejecting the null hypothesis and is directly associated with the eventual success of drug development. To ensure a high probability of observing a desired effect size, or in another words a high probability of success, we propose a new futility analysis design approach where the futility boundary is selected based on preserving the probability of success. We define the relative preservation of this probability as pseudo-power, using which we propose the boundary selection criteria. Via a case study, we evaluate various operational characteristic of this approach in term of the probability of correct and incorrect stopping, with respect to the futility boundary, the underlying true effect size and the timing of the futility analysis.

ONLINE STUDY MONITORING FOR LARGE MULTI-CENTER TRIALS VIA A DATA DASHBOARD
Ryan Bailey, Laurie McLeod, Jeremy Wildfire, Katy Jaffee, William Taylor,
Tee Bahnson, Rich Budrevich, Cynthia Visness
Rho, Inc. Chapel Hill, North Carolina
Increasingly, the NIH and Industry sponsors are establishing large multi-center collaborative research efforts that implement multiple studies simultaneously through a network of investigators. This presents a challenge for the sponsors and leadership teams who are responsible for monitoring activities across studies. The business world has addressed this need for complex information monitoring systems with a high- level summarized overview called a dashboard. We created a web-based dashboard for the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC), a large, federally-funded, multi-center research consortium. The consortium has eight active studies that are being conducted across ten clinical centers with total projected enrollment of over 3500 participants. Many research programs provide web-based resources to aid stakeholders with study supervision. Unfortunately, traditional study portals can be hindered by an overabundance of information and tedious top-down navigation. These characteristics make them an inefficient resource for large multi-center programs. Our dashboard avoids the typical information- dense, hierarchical construction of traditional websites in favor of a comprehensive single- webpage display that is easier for stakeholders to access and use. Dashboards summarize and display critical information on a single page, with an emphasis on graphical, rather than text-heavy displays. Our dashboard has a main page for the consortium, which
http://ctj.sagepub.com Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 450 554
458 Abstracts
provides comparative enrollment graphs for the active studies, and displays pertinent deadlines and announcements. Each study also has a dedicated page that follows this same dashboard approach. We update the dashboard data weekly. Sponsors have responded positively to the ICAC dashboard, voicing appreciation for the systems efficient presentation of data and ease of use. Given the success of the dashboard, we plan to expand the system to other federal and commercial programs. Our experience suggests that multi-center or multi-study programs would benefit from creating a dashboard to provide sponsors and network leadership teams with key study monitoring information in a quick, succinct manner.

TECHNOLOGIES SUPPORTING CLINICAL RESEARCH IN RESOURCE POOR SETTINGS Marisa De Rosa
Cineca
Due to the lack of infrastructure in resource poor settings and despite the strong need for Clinical Research coordination, Information and Communication Technology has not been systematically and sustainably integrated into health research, hospital administration and practice, thus limiting efficiency and outcomes of the efforts to fight poverty related diseases. Cloud-based technology could now overcome infrastructure scarcity problems of resource poor settings and thus greatly support Clinical Research by integrating mobile, online, offline and Voice over IP technology. The Italian Inter University Consortium Cineca , a non-profit Consortium of Italian Universities for high performance computing and ICT , has an over 20 year experience in providing technological support to health research for activities related to the design and development of IT systems and services in the health care and biomedical area, using advanced technologies and methodologies.
In particular, since 2008 Cineca has been involved in projects providing and developing technology to collect and analyze clinical and health related data in Africa. The European funded project Medishare, coordinated by Cineca, successfully managed to collect standardized data for over 15000 patients affected by HIV/AIDS, Malaria and TB in Kenya Tanzania and Uganda in one central database. Medishare was recognized supportive of the Millennium Development Goals by the United Nations. The Europe Africa Research Network for Evaluation of Second-line Therapy (EARNEST) is a trial supported by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) that is successfully using Cineca integrated technology in Uganda, Malawi, Zimbabwe.
Cineca exploits the integration of newer technologies to fill in the infrastructural gaps of Africa and provides a sustainable centralized infrastructure which is fully certified for quality, safety and security procedures.

DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A LABORATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM (LIMS) TO SUPPORT TRIALS IN THE UNITED KINGDOMJonathan Gibb (1), Sharon Kean (1), Caron Paterson (2), Jane Hair (2)(1) University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland (2) NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board, Glasgow, Scotland
We have developed a LIMS to manage biobank samples for the Scottish Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (SERA) cohort study. Commercial and open-source solutions were evaluated and it was concluded that development of a bespoke LIMS system was needed to provide scalability and flexibility to support future projects with different requirements.
The system developed includes a generic workflow which is capable of modelling:
Complex storage configurations with up to 1024 dimensions over multiple geographic sites Storage rules for sample type , method and time of storage Multi-event work flow processing from site collection to arrival at labs Lab technician workflows incorporating working plate practices Manual and automated validation methods using a combination of 1D and 2D barcode technologies
The system is based on a tree structure; all samples are stored in a parentage tree that shows the lineage of the sample allowing for exploration of any number of generations of derived samples. Our tree based approach allows the LIMS to be largely generic. By defining the storage, site configuration and the collection

protocols the system can operate with scenarios ranging from a single lab collecting ad-hoc samples, to a multi-lab, multi collection site protocol hosting thousands of samples.
We will discuss the functionality provided by the LIMS system, the tree based design and the possibilities it allows, the pros and cons of the development, its integration with two additional large multicentre, multinational, clinical trials and future functionality enhancements.

DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING GENERIC COMPONENTS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY WHEN BUILDING ELECTRONIC DATA CAPTURE SYSTEMS FOR CLINICAL TRIALS
Mary MacDonald, Sharon Kean, Ian Ford
University of Glasgpw
The Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow have been involved in the development of electronic solutions to enhance the conduct of clinical research projects for many years. This includes integrated secure electronic solutions for enrolment and randomisation (web and IVRS), electronic data capture and management via e-CRF (on- and off-line), trial management, information delivery and reporting, eg Independent Data Monitoring Committees. Our systems have been implemented for many clinical trials both commercial and academic. To enhance our ability to produce robust and validated systems efficiently we foresaw a requirement for a standardized library of components. In addition, our systems have to be able to provide specific functionality in accordance with our trial requirements. Included in our system:
Standard screens and functionality to allow trial co-ordinators to register their own users and assign the appropriate access rights.
Inclusion of previously developed screens eg standard questionnaires Demographics Concomitant medications Medical history Standard measurements eg Height, Weight, Blood Pressure Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, and regulatory reporting requirements Metrics required for reporting to funders within the United Kingdom Implementation of CDISC SDTM to standardize our databases Notification and communication to users, either by email or bulletin style within the system Document repository to ensure all sites have correct versions of approved documents
We will discuss the implementation of these components in our recent clinical trial systems and how this has improved efficiency in delivering validated systems to our clients. In addition, we will discuss and further explore our implementation of CDISC formats

COLLABORATIVE PEER-REVIEWING AND DATA AGGREGATION IN SITE
MANAGEMENT WITH CLINICALSITE.ORGGustav Vella, Dorothee Arenz, Aristoteles Pagaltzis, Dirk Colaert, Maik Stumpf, Michael Hallek, Oliver CornelyUniversity of Cologne, Clinical Trials Center Cologne, Cologne, Germany, BMBF01KN1106
Objective. We present a community developed system focussing on clinical sites, operated as a service by the Clinical Trials Center of the University of Cologne, which employs collaborative peer reviewing in order to support timeliness, efficacy, accuracy and safety in site management.
Background. Managing clinical sites in a trial can be very resource-intensive for sponsor and for study site, this, largely due to disconnect in systems and processes, impeding different parties from collaboratively capturing organizational data meaningful to all.
Methods. Sponsors, Coordinating Centers, Sites, Study Groups, Societies, Networks and other relevant parties participating in clinical trials each are individually best positioned and incentivized to capture and/or monitor certain organizational trial data. On clinicalsite.org role-based access and specific views enhance individual value and incentives. Reusability of data, meaningful to all, provides the strongest incentive. As a case in point, roles and responsibilities in a trial can be syndicated to be displayed on institutional websites. The data can also be aggregated to the trial track record by the investigator as part of his CV. The sponsor, in turn, can review site and investigator qualifications electronically, cutting turnaround considerably. Furthermore, with roles formally captured and confirmed, the system can act as a Physician Master Index and provide authentication and authorization credentials for external systems. A plugin framework enables parties to embed their own apps while saving the data locally. An API for various services and formats can serve data for aggregation within external systems. Both options provide added value and minimize centrally hosted data, ensuring better data privacy compliance.
Results. Currently 1282 trials with 1681 investigators and 997 organizational units involved are managed in the system.
Conclusion. Our approach provides critical organizational data of quality with less effort. Exposing the data for reuse and aggregation unlocks new possibilities within and outside the system.

CROSS TRAINING WITHIN A CLINICAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATION: DOES IT
WORK OR DOES IT MUDDY THE WATERS?
Fawna L. Start, NicoleC. Close EmpiriStat, Inc., Mt. Airy, Maryland, USA
Within any organization the workflow structure and departments are clearly defined. Through a case study we will examine the lessons learned and outcomes when staff within specific departments are trained round robin to understand the functions of other departments. By specifically reviewing the cross training of Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) to periodically perform data entry within a CRO, we show meaningful subject matter expertise improvements, positive study impact, and a gain in project efficiency.
Pros:Learning Experience: The trainer becomes more familiar with details of his or her position when outlining a training program to teach others. The trainee once completing the instructional information has a broader picture of the entire process and often is able to see the bigger picture and the results of where their work is going. Error Identification: CRAs have the skills to notice consistency errors that a site may be making emphasizing the need for additional training or reeducation in a particular area.
CRAs have the expertise to identify clinical errors including but not limited to the incorrect use of a specific form and inclusion/exclusion criteria errors.
Cons:Time and Funds: CRAs are often paid at a higher rate than data entry staff and their talents may be better utilized in their respective area of expertise.
Analysis of Data: CRAs in most cases have a significant understanding of site operations and clinical information which usually equates to a slow data entry process as they are always scouring data for errors and not just entering what is documented.

After considering both pros and cons and the review of a case study where CRAs perform data entry tasks for quality purposes this often proves to be beneficial not only to the project, but Corporate Structure and capabilities.

IS AN EVOLVING CHART AUDIT PLAN NECESSARY IN A LONG-TERM MULTI-CENTER TRIAL? Brenda Brewer, Kathy Clingan, Nancy Payte, Jennifer Rosenbaum
Westat Rockville, Maryland
The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) was a randomized controlled trial, funded by the National Cancer Institute, to determine whether screening with low-dose helical computed tomography reduces lung cancer mortality relative to screening with conventional chest x-ray in persons at elevated risk of lung cancer. It was comprised of two components: the Lung Screening Study (LSS) and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN). The Coordinating Center (CC) for the LSS (n=34,614) provided coordination and data management support for 10 screening sites. One CC challenge was to ensure completeness and accuracy of data collected throughout all stages of the study (e.g., recruitment, screening, follow up, endpoint verification, close-out). As part of monitoring, the CC conducted visits to each site annually for 9 years. Visits included observation of procedures and random chart audits. Chart audits served to confirm source documents for consents; eligibility and randomization verification; screening results; and diagnostic evaluation and followup. On-site monitoring also provided an opportunity to review and reinforce key study elements with project staff. Annual assessments of the CC audit plan resulted in 6 revisions to the audit form and 4 revisions to the chart selection, reflecting evolving focus from recruitment through close- out. Throughout the trial, 2457 randomly selected charts (7%) were reviewed. Source documents verified ~ 50 data elements during Year 1 and >150 data elements in later years. While chart audits confirmed overall data integrity, selected findings included 17 changes in eligibility status, 18 new protocol violations, and >200 requests for data clarification and modification. The CC found that chart audits were an important part of the total monitoring plan, and that it was important to develop a flexible approach. We will present the challenges of chart audits as part of a monitoring plan throughout the lifecycle of this complex long-term multi- center trial.

CENTRAL STATISTICAL MONITORING IN CLINICAL TRIALS

Clinical trial sponsors are required to set up appropriate measures to monitor the conduct of the trial. The aim of monitoring is to ensure the patients well being, compliance with the approved protocol and regulatory requirements, as well as data accuracy and completeness. Classical monitoring approaches that rely on on-site visits are useful for some of these purposes, but extensive source data verification is extremely time consuming and may have only a limited impact on data quality. It is therefore not surprising that the current practice of performing intensive on-site monitoring is coming into question and that interest focuses on more pragmatic, risk- based approaches that improve the cost- effectiveness ratio without compromising the quality and integrity of clinical trials. A recent draft guidance of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reflects this trend and states unequivocally: FDA encourages greater reliance on centralized monitoring practices than has been the case historically, with correspondingly less emphasis on on-site monitoring.
In this presentation, we first review the potential sources of data errors in clinical trials. We then outline the principles of central statistical monitoring and the challenges of its implementation in actual trials. Results from both terminated and on-going trials are presented to illustrate typical findings that can be expected from the monitoring approach. We conclude by a discussion of the potential role and limitations of central statistical monitoring, and we argue that it can both optimize on-site monitoring and improve the quality of clinical trial data.

RISK-BASED APPROACH TO MONITORING: THE WAY OF THE FUTUREPatti Shugarts, Rene Kozloff, Ph.D., Selma C. Kunitz, Ph.D.
KAI Research Inc., an Altarum Company 11300 Rockville Pike Rockville, Maryland 20850 United States
Due to a dramatic increase in the number and complexity of clinical trials and the costs associated with them, the FDA recently introduced a draft guidance Oversight of Clinical Investigations - A Risk-based Approach to Monitoring. This new guidance suggests it is acceptable to use alternative approaches to monitoring clinical trials including remote monitoring, centralized monitoring, and risk-based monitoring. The guidance also suggests that source data verification should be focused on critical fields (key efficacy and safety variables) and less than 100% source data verification for less important fields may be acceptable. The guidance gives a clear signal encouraging sponsors to explore cost-effective ways to conduct clinical monitoring instead of relying solely on the on-site monitoring.
KAI Research, Inc. has used a variety of alternative approaches to assess data quality and patient safety in its support of NIH clinical trials which often do not have budgets for 100% monitoring. We will describe lessons learned from implementing risk based monitoring approaches that include a central data review to identify potential anomalies. The anomalies help to focus site visits. Focusing on critical data elements has also helped to streamline monitoring visits. We have also implemented centralized monitoring techniques on a sample of data from each of the sites in a study. Through a description of these examples, we will demonstrate alternative methods for ascertaining data quality and subject protection that are both cost effective and efficient. We will also describe how our monitoring plans consider complexity of the study, risk associated with the intervention as well as its safety profile, severity of the illness of the study subjects and experience of the investigators and study sites.
We will demonstrate that well thought out alternative approaches to monitoring can meet FDAs expectations for quality assurance and participant safety.

EFFECTIVE MONITORING STRATEGIES IN A LONG-TERM CLINICAL TRIAL WITH VARYING
LEVELS OF CLINIC STAFF KNOWLEDGE: THE AREDS2 EXPERIENCE
Wendy L McBee*, Sherrie Schenning, Traci E Clemons, Emily Y Chew, John Paul SanGiovanni *The EMMES Corporation, Rockville, Maryland
Considerable time and expense are incurred to ensure data quality in a long-term clinical trial. The Protocol Monitor assumes much of the scientific responsibility of closely checking the accuracy and completeness of data collected prior to construction of the final data set. Administrative responsibilities involve assuring clinical sites adherence to the protocol, federal guidelines and regulations. Eighty-two clinical sites participate in the Age- Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) and are following approximately 4,000 participants throughout five years of follow-up. Data pertaining to effects of supplemental doses of xanthophylls and omega-3 fatty acids on the progression of age-related macular degeneration and vision loss, among other clinical outcomes, are collected at annual visits. Four AREDS2 Protocol Monitors serve as the front line of communication between the study leadership and the clinical sites. The Monitors employ multiple strategies to assist the sites in meeting project deliverables. Routine performance includes standardized protocol review calls on a variety of topics and frequent review of multiple types of data anomaly reports. Monitoring responsibilities constantly change in nature and effort with the revolving door of new Clinic Coordinators and amendments or additions to the protocol through the life of the study. When a new Clinic Coordinator is hired by a site, the Monitor must quickly determine the Coordinators knowledge of the protocol, disease topic, and general skills required for the proper conduct of clinical trials. Some clinical sites have educational sessions in place or access to the previous Clinic Coordinator, and others do not. The monitor also carries much historical knowledge of a sites subject population and may serve as a valuable resource to the new Clinic Coordinator. The many different hats of a Protocol Monitor, as experienced in AREDS2, will be described as both a challenging and rewarding experience.

CENTRAL STATISTICAL MONITORING: A MODEL TO PREDICT FRAUD IN CLINICAL TRIALS Janice Pogue, PJ Devereaux, Kristian Thorlund, Salim Yusuf
McMaster Universtity, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada
It has been suggested that central statistical monitoring may serve as the foundation for quality assurance and center monitoring in multicenter clinical trials (Knatterud 1998; Buyse 1999; Baiget 2008; Eisenstein 2008). Authors have proposed that central statistical monitoring may identify procedural errors, data errors and data fabrication at centers. Since there are no published evaluations of the different ways of performing central statistical monitoring to detect fraud, we constructed several prognostic models using data from a multi-center trial in which the data from 9 of 196 centers were documented to be fabricated. These data were used to build a series of risk scores to predict fraud at centers. Five different risk scores were identified and each had the ability to discriminate well between centers with and without fabricated data (area under the curve values ranged from 0.90 to 0.95). True and false positive rates are presented for each risk score to arrive at a recommended cut off of 7 or above (high risk score) out of a possible score of 12. We validated these risk scores, using an independent multi-center trial database that contained no data fabrication and found the occurrence of false positive high risk scores to be low and comparable to the model-building data set. With further validation, these risk scores may become part of a series of tools that provide evidence- based central statistical monitoring, which in turn may improve the efficiency of trials, and minimize the need for expensive on-site monitoring.

IDENTIFYING OPTIMAL OUTCOME MEASURES FOR PHASE II TRIALS IN CANCER Sarah BrownClinical Trials Research Unit, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK
Phase II studies in cancer usually consider short-term outcomes such as response, that are to some degree surrogates of phase III outcomes, most typically overall survival (OS). Understanding the relationships between phase II and phase III outcome measures is essential in designing phase II trials and understanding the degree of reliability with which we can move between phases. We consider the association between alternative phase II outcome measures and OS in advanced colorectal cancer (aCRC), to identify measures which may predict treatment effect on OS in phase III trials. Phase II outcomes of response, disease control, continuous tumour measurements and progression-free survival (PFS) were considered. Using surrogacy methodology originally proposed by Buyse et al (2000), estimates of R-squared(R2) were calculated to assess the relationship with OS for each outcome. Individual patient data on 5435 patients from seven trials of aCRC, recruited between 1999 and 2007, were obtained. Data from three 3- arm trials were split to form two treatment comparisons each, resulting in a total of 10 grouping units. As the reference outcome, response was found to have poor predictive ability of the treatment effect on OS, with R2 (trial)=0.14, 95% CI (-0.28,0.56). A much stronger relationship was observed for continuous tumour measurements (R2(trial) =0.65 (0, 0.86)) and PFS (R2(trial)=0.59 (0.18,1.00)). The relationship between OS and disease control was slightly weaker, but still stronger than for response, with R2(trial) =0.44, 95% CI (-0.05,0.93). Sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate alternative grouping units and the impact of covariates. Issues faced in applying surrogacy methodology to the phase II setting, and using these results to identify an optimal outcome measure for phase II aCRC trials, will be discussed. Specific issues include the use of OS as an appropriate phase III outcome, comparability of R2 values for differing outcome measures, and the number of grouping units incorporated.

behind the different designs and methodologies used will be explained. Difficulties and learning experiences with the implementation, wider understanding and interpretation of the trials will be discussed.
CLL201 used Gehans two-stage approach to assess response, and randomised to a control arm which was not included for formal comparison, but to give validity of the study results. The two stage approach was difficult to implement and of limited use as it only considered efficacy and not safety. Challenges were faced regarding the inclusion and interpretation of the control arm, although randomisation proved to be valuable.
CLL207 was a single arm trial designed using Bryant and Days two-stage design, incorporating toxicity considerations as well as efficacy. The two-stage aspect worked well, but the implementation of a toxicity stopping guide proved problematic.
ARCTIC and ADMIRE are two large, randomised phase IIb trials, both formally powered to compare responses against a common control arm. One of the trials assesses non-inferiority. The choice of the unusual phase II design, and difficulties in justifying it to reviewers will be discussed.
COSMIC is a randomised selection design with two experimental arms, combining two phase II trial designs to firstly assess efficacy, and secondly select the treatment to be taken forward. The AHern one-stage design is used to determine which treatments are eligible to be further investigated. In the case where both are acceptable, Sargent & Goldbergs selection criteria will be used. The sample size was inflated to ensure acceptable power for selecting the best treatment.

DEFINING CLINICAL AND STATISTICAL IMPROVEMENT IN CONSOLIDATION OR MAINTENANCE SINGLE-ARM TRIALS IN ONCOLOGYA Iasonos (1), P Sabbatini (2), DR Spriggs (2), H Thaler (1)

Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065
Single-arm Phase II consolidation/maintenance trials in oncology are currently designed to show an improvement in Progression-Free Survival (PFS) when considered against historical controls. PFS includes duration of second line therapy (SLT), treatment free interval (TFI), and time on the investigational therapy (IT). We hypothesize that the duration of SLT, the time on the investigational therapy and patient enrollment plan can affect efficacy measures from maintenance trials and might result in underpowered studies. Efficacy data from four published single-arm consolidation therapies in second remission in ovarian cancer (Sabbatini et al, Gyn Onc 2010, 116(1):66-71) are used for illustration. The studies were designed to show increase in estimated median PFS from 9 to 13.5 months (mos). We partitioned PFS as the sum of the duration of SLT, TFI, and duration of IT. We calculated the statistical power when IT is given concurrently with SLT or following SLT by varying the start of IT. Required sample sizes varied with duration of SLT. If IT starts with initiation of SLT, only 34 patients are needed to provide 80% power to detect a 33% hazard reduction. Alternatively, if one accrues 34 patients at start of SLT with expected 33% hazard reduction and the duration of SLT delays the start of IT to 7.5 months, the power drops to 50%. To maintain 80% power in this scenario, either the protocol therapy would have to reduce the hazard by 50%, or sample size would have to increase to 104. A longer duration of SLT is associated with lower statistical power unless the magnitude of benefit with the new investigational treatment is greater than expected, or the sample size is increased. Designs of consolidation trials should take into account the duration of SLT, by either excluding it from the definition of PFS or restricting it per protocol.

of lung cancer screening with low dose radiation computed tomography versus chest x-ray among heavy and/or long-term smokers, used a committee blinded to arm assignment to determine whether COD was due to lung cancer.
Methods: NLSTs committee reviewed a subset of deaths, chosen by a pre-determined algorithm. The algorithm selected deaths with a DC COD that were most likely to represent a death due to lung cancer (either directly or indirectly) and deaths that might have been erroneously assigned a DC lung cancer COD. Also included were deaths within six months of a screen suspicious for lung cancer and within 60 days of certain lung cancer diagnostic evaluation procedures. Using the committee assignment as the gold standard and a lung cancer COD as the outcome of interest, we calculated positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the death certificate COD assignment (lung cancer vs. non-lung cancer).
Results: The committee examined and assigned COD for 1643 deaths (42% of the 3877 NLST deaths). Sensitivity was 90%; specificity, 97%; PPV, 97%; and NPV, 88%. The kappa statistic was 0.87. 40% of the deaths with a DC non-lung cancer COD reclassified to lung cancer had a DC COD of a neoplasm other than lung. Limitations: 2141 deaths with a DC-non lung cancer COD were not reviewed because the DC COD was unlikely to have been in error. Had these deaths been reviewed and assigned a non-lung cancer COD, the specificity would have been 99% and the NPV 97%.
Conclusions: When assigning lung cancer COD among heavy/long-term smokers, death certificates provide accurate information nearly all the time.

Selma C. Kunitz, Ph.D.
KAI Research Inc., an Altarum Company 11300 Rockville Pike Rockville,
Maryland 20850 United States
To streamline the implementation of clinical studies, reduce start-up time and accelerate data aggregation across studies, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) together with KAI Research, Inc. (KAI), embarked on common data element (CDE) projects. KAI has developed a systematic approach to the development and implementation of data standards. These standards span the entire study lifecycle, facilitating study start up, data collection and management, and data archiving and sharing. With more and more CDEs developed, establishing standard approaches to manage CDEs becomes critical.
This abstract will provide information on the challenges with creating, implementing and managing standards. The challenges as well as our best practices in overcoming these challenges are:
Keeping up with current standards (CDISC, caBIG, etc.) o Harmonization efforts ongoing o Regular communications with these groups key
Reviewing the Literature o Including references for the CDEs adds credibility o Publications may lack detailed data management information
Limiting the universe o Identification of core CDEs (those most essential for data collection) o Build from existing forms to gain buy in from the clinical research community
Creating a team of experts o Identifying who should be part of the team o Advantages and disadvantages to top down vs. bottom up development
Establishing standard procedures for standard development o Development of standard procedures in parallel to standards o Internal standard review committee for quality and consistency
Tools to enhance use o Dictionary, template forms, suggested edits, data management plan (DMP), etc. o Website design/ layout - making it user friendly.
The process for creating, implementing and managing standards has been met with many challenges but the benefits outweigh the frustrations. CDEs and standards have demonstrated enhanced data quality, decreases the time and resources needed to develop a study database, and helps customize the DMP.

FUTURE OF DATA EXCHANGE AND DATA MINING: POSTING DATA ON THE GRID BY A DENTAL PRACTICE-BASED RESEARCH NETWORK
Sherita Alai
The EMMES Corporation, Rockville, Maryland
The Practitioners Engaged in Applied Research and Learning (PEARL) Network, a National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research- sponsored network of practice-based dentists have successfully created a data service on the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grids (caBIGs) open source platform (caGrid). PEARL has registered the semantically annotated model and implemented the necessary registration interface steps and posted the de-identified clinical data on the caGrid.
PEARL has taken the needed steps to create harmonized, semantic metadata in order to leverage the collaborative nature of caBIG with use of caBIG grid architecture and services. PEARL created the metadata based on the International Organization for Standardization Metadata 11179 Model in the Cancer Data Standards Repository (caDSR) which uses the semantic linkages of the hierarchical ontology contained in the National Cancer Institutes Enterprise Vocabulary Service. New components created by PEARL are:
1321 Data Elements 999 Data Element Concepts 254 Value Domains
PEARL used caBIG grid architecture to share Oral Health Inventory Profile and Tooth Sensitivity data from a study of postoperative hypersensitivity (Study PRL0602) following resin-based composite restoration of posterior teeth. The related Unified Modeling Language (UML) model for this data set has been registered in the caDSR where the related CDEs are classified as part of the UML model and visible in the UML Model Browser as a collection.
PEARL encountered some challenges during implementation. Firstly, some issues and bugs had to be resolved with the system configuration and web services communication that required additional steps between PEARL and the caGrid team. Additionally, the caGrid data extraction process is not as intuitive as anticipated, and requires detailed instructions to overcome this barrier to data sharing.
The projected benefit is that exposing clinically relevant data and the needed descriptive metadata that underpins those data provides informed, meaningful access to researchers, clinicians, and patients.

THE FUTURE OF THE CABIG CLINICAL TRIALS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT MISSION:
ENGAGING THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY
Robert Annechiarico Mohammad Farid Madeline Carroll Kimberly Johnson Duke University, Durham, NC 27705 USA
The Clinical Trials Management Systems (CTMS) workspace within the caBIG program was tasked to deliver integrated software solutions to the clinical research community. These tools are vetted by the community, who require the ability to securely gather, exchange, explore, integrate, and reuse data and information for clinical trials research. As a result the CTMS Workspace developed modular, interoperable and standards-based software tools designed to meet diverse clinical trials data management needs. The tools developed were configurable to work within trial sites with little or no clinical data management systems in place, as well as those sites with extensive existing systems. These tools took into account the diversity of clinical research activities and local practices that existed among trial sites.
CTMS software tools enable management of clinical trials tasks such as: patient registration; patient scheduling; integration of laboratory results; adverse events capture/reporting; and the capture, analysis and sharing of clinical data among relevant systems. All tools are also available as a modular enterprise clinical trials management system designed to facilitate clinical workflows and data sharing in single and multi-site settings for use in trial sites.
To continue the development/support of these tools with community and industry participation, the caBIG program is evolving from its role as an active software developer to a facilitator of open source, community-based development. The NCI will provide a range of mechanisms to support open-source development efforts, including:

CDISC DATA STANDARDS CAN FACILITATE COMPOSITION OF ADVERSE EVENT NARRATIVES Anisa Scott, Richard ZinkSAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA
When a clinical trial subject has a serious adverse event (SAE) or other significant adverse event (AE), such as those leading to the discontinuation of the study, a narrative is written for the clinical study report. These AE narratives summarize the details surrounding the event to enable understanding of the circumstances that may have led to the occurrence and its subsequent management. Such details may include the dose of study drug at the time of the event, the duration of the dose prior to the event, concomitant medications taken at the time of the event and used to treat the event, and other AEs that may have recently occurred. Other details include demography, medical history, laboratory results, the severity of the event and whether the event was related to study medication. Narratives are typically written from the original SAE report faxed from the clinical site in combination with data listings generated as part of the study deliverables. Information contained in the typical narrative requires manual review of these disparate data sources. This is time- consuming and often will require additional review and quality control. Too often, these narratives are written when the full data becomes available, which may become a rate-limiting factor in completing the study report. Since its inception in 1997, the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) has developed standards for data models, study design and supporting clinical trial documents. CDISC standards have made such gains that the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research strongly encourages their use and implementation for the submission of new drug applications. The benefits of CDISC standards for statistics, programming and data management are well established. We will illustrate how these data standards can be used to facilitate composition of adverse event narratives.

Background: Unique characteristics of cluster randomized trials (CRTs) complicate the interpretation of standard research ethics guidelines, including from whom, when, and how informed consent ought to be obtained. As part of a larger project to generate ethics guidelines for CRTs, we reviewed a random sample of 300 published CRTs and found that participant consent was reported in only 63% of trials. Whether this reflects an under- reporting of consent, or actual consent practices, is unclear. We therefore conducted a

survey of the CRT investigators to (a) gather detailed information about consent practices in the selected CRT, and (b) investigate factors associated with obtaining participant consent in CRTs.
Methods: A web-based survey was administered to corresponding authors of the sample of CRTs, in a series of six contacts. Trialists surveyed were based in USA/Canada (47%), UK/Ireland (18%), elsewhere in Europe (21%), Australia/New Zealand (5%), and various low/middle income countries (9%).
Results: The survey response rate was 64%. Participant consent had been sought for some aspect of the study in 93% of trials: in 79% of trials consent had been sought from participants at the individual level (56% for the experimental intervention(s), 75% for data collection). Among CRTs with participants at the cluster level, 82% indicated that consent had been sought from cluster level participants (62% for the experimental intervention(s), 75% for data collection). Factors associated with individual level consent for the experimental intervention(s) were a smaller cluster size, and whether experimental and data collection interventions were targeted at the individual level. In addition, setting (healthcare vs. non-healthcare) was associated with seeking individual level consent for data collection.
Conclusion: Unique characteristics of the CRT design are associated with participant consent practices, which are under-reported in CRT publications. Further ethical analysis is required to determine whether CRT consent practices meet the highest ethical standards.

POST TRIAL ACCESS TO SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS: ETHICAL AND PRACTICAL DILEMMAS Liza DawsonNIH/NIAID Division of AIDS Research Ethics Team 6700B Rockledge Dr., Room 4114 Bethesda, MD 20892
In some cases it is difficult for study participants to obtain access to a successful study intervention after the conclusion of a clinical trial. A number of international ethical guidelines call for researchers to provide access to products post trial for study participants when they are proven effective and unavailable through local mechanisms. The nature of this ethical obligation is debated, and the moral basis for such an obligation should help determine who bears responsibility for fulfilling it. There is no consensus among bioethicists about whether this is a firm obligation and if so, whether it is based on the idea of reciprocity or gratitude, as a safeguard against exploitation, as compensation for risk or burden, or some other basis. Also, ethical analysis is complicated by the fact that other community members who need the same medical care may have a competing claim for access to the product. Moreover, practical challenges in ensuring post trial access are numerous, and often multiple stakeholders need to be engaged. An interesting consequence of the call for post trial access is that many pharmaceutical companies decline to participate in research studies in countries where they have no plans to register their products. When studies are conducted in developing countries, challenges may arise due to slow or non-existent regulatory structures, lack of funds for product procurement and delivery, and lack of infrastructure. For research sponsors such as NIH, lack of authorization to use funds for non- research purposes may hamper efforts to support post trial access. These ethical and practical challenges will be discussed in detail, with recommendations for future policies to address them.

ETHICAL ISSUES IN CLUSTER RANDOMIZED TRIALS: INTERNATIONAL
SURVEY OF RESEARCH ETHICS CHAIRS
Monica TaljaardOttawa Hospital Research Institute
Background: Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) have unique characteristics that complicate the interpretation of standard research ethics guidelines. We conducted an international web-based survey of research ethics chairs in advance of a consensus meeting to generate ethics guidelines for CRTs. Methods: We included all biomedical ethics committees in Canada and the UK, and a random sample from the USA (one per institution). After the initial e-mail invitation, we sent three e-mail reminders and a final postal reminder. The 45-minute questionnaire presented three hypothetical CRTs evaluating: a community-level health promotion intervention, an educational intervention targeted at health professionals, and distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets to villages in a low income country. Using closed- and open-ended items, participants were asked to indicate the type of review required (full board or expedited), whom they would consider research subjects, and objections that might be raised

EXCEPTION FROM INFORMED CONSENT (EFIC): EXPERIENCES FROM A RANDOMIZED TRIAL IN PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY PATIENTSCaroline Kim, Traci Clemons, Diane Brandt, James Chamberlain, Bambi Bademosi Caroline, Traci and Diane: EMMES Corporation, Rockville, MD, USA James and Bambi: Childrens National
Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA
Use of Lorazepam for the Treatment of Pediatric Status Epilepticus: A Randomized, Double-Blinded Trial of Lorazepam and Diazepam (Status2), is a protocol conducted under the Best Pharmaceutical for Children Act (BPCA) to evaluate efficacy and safety of lorazepam compared to diazepam in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) in status epilepticus (SE).
Because of the potentially life threatening presentation, the narrow therapeutic window, and the lack of proven, effective treatments for SE in the pediatric population, this study was approved under the auspices of 21 CFR 50.24, the Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC) for Emergency Research.
Navigating the regulatory requirements required significant sponsor, study management and site resources. The design of the protocol included informed consent, data collection and follow up procedures to assure protection of human subjects under EFIC. All sites (14) conducted community consultation and public disclosure activities that were reviewed and approved by the sponsor and local IRBs. The sponsor created training materials on the EFIC regulations to educate study personnel and local IRB members and to assist with community consultation planning. Opt-out procedures were implemented at each site and nationally prior to study initiation. Due to the emergency nature of SE, protocol deviations were common. These included incorrect weight estimation and therefore inaccurate dosing, and failure to adhere to timely study procedures. Study monitoring included assuring that legally authorized representatives of study subjects were approached in a timely manner and that opt-out and study procedures were followed in accordance with the study protocol.
In conclusion, significant resources are required to meet the requirements of the Exception from Informed Consent regulations. Emergency conditions may preclude a carefully controlled study environment, so good training and monitoring are required to ensure that all protocol deviations are accurately recorded and reported to local IRBs.

STREAMLINED DRUG INDUCED LIVER INJURY DETECTION WITH HYS
LAW AND TEMPORAL VISUALIZATION
Kelci MiclausSAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA
Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) is the most common safety-related reason for withdrawing a drug from the market. Therefore, it is critical to assess potential hepatotoxicity from treatment using an analysis of liver-related laboratory tests. A starting point is to plot peak values of lab measurements with regard to the upper limit of normal reference ranges to identify patients with elevated levels of bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase as potential Hys Law cases. However, this plot alone does not acknowledge the temporal considerations of Hys Law and liver injury. Following the FDA Guidance of DILI evaluation, this view can be augmented to flag patients based on the occurrence of elevated liver tests within a clinically- relevant time period. Moreover, by incorporating the temporal dependence of liver test elevations, the frequency and duration of Hys Law instances across treatment groups can be interrogated and reported. This presentation will highlight a statistically-driven interactive visualization approach implemented in JMP Clinical software to streamline the detection of potential DILI cases through summary views of lab test elevations and Hys Law occurrence that lead to targeted patient time trend plots and cross-domain profiles for further clinical insight.

SUMMARIZING THE INCIDENCE OF ADVERSE EVENTS USING VOLCANO PLOTS AND TIME WINDOWS Richard C. Zink, Russ Wolfinger, Geoffrey MannJMP Life Sciences, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, United States
It can be challenging to perform a concise and easily-interpretable analysis of adverse events (AEs). For therapeutic areas where patients have frequent AEs, understanding the safety profile of a new intervention

is critical. In these instances, however, understanding the analysis is made more difficult by the sheer number and variety of AEs that occur.
Traditionally, the incidence of adverse events is presented in lengthy tables, with coded AE terms grouped by body system or system organ class and presented in order of descending frequency. Many times, statistical testing is not be performed due to the high likelihood of committing multiple Type I errors. Further tables may highlight AEs that occur for specific periods of time (for example, treatment phase or off-treatment follow-up). Needless to say, it is difficult to summarize this information to gain a clear understanding of the risk (or benefit) a new therapy may present.
Incidence analyses of adverse events are straightforward to present graphically using Volcano Plots to highlight treatment differences. Color indicates the treatment with higher incidence, with bubble size representing the total number of events that occur during the trial. Adjustments for multiple comparisons can be presented in a manner to clearly indicate which events exhibit statistically significant treatment differences. Further, the study can be broken into distinct time windows, with multiple plots or animation displaying changes in adverse event risk over time. This presentation can emphasize early differences across treatments that may eventually resolve or highlight events that could approach significance given a longer study duration.
The use of Volcano Plots is illustrated with an analysis of data on aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

REDUCING SURVEILLANCE BIAS IN ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING IN AN
UNMASKED TREATMENT TRIAL

Ocular Hypertension Treatment Trial
Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA
We describe the challenge of collecting adverse events (AE) data in an unmasked randomized treatment trial. The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study randomized 1,636 participants to either observation or to treatment with eye drops to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) to prevent the development of glaucoma. Masking would have been impossible to maintain. Participants could become unmasked at free IOP screenings or non-study eye examinations. Clinic personnel would become unmasked by measuring IOP to adjust medication to achieve IOP treatment targets. Efficacy outcomes were masked, but AE data were collected by unmasked clinic personnel and participant self-report. At 24 months, 774 AEs had been received, 31% in the observation group and 69% in the medication group. The clinic to clinic rate in AE reporting ranged from 7% to 60% signaling a standardization problem. To improve standardization, we reduced branching logic, consolidated forms, included more check boxes and used a scripted interview. The Data Safety Monitoring Committee recommended that AE data received prior to these protocol changes be excluded from future publications. In the 18 months after these protocol changes, 1,688 AE reports were received, more than double the previous rate, 44% of the AEs were in the observation group and 56% in the medication group. It is striking that the differential between groups decreased from 38% to 12%. This suggests that potential surveil-lance or detection bias in an unmasked treatment trial can be reduced by a rigorous protocol.

ASSESSMENTS FOR SAFETY AND EFFICACY IN CARDIOVASCULAR CELL THERAPY CLINICAL TRIALS Adam M Mendizabal, Erica Anderson, Melinda Tibbals, Nilay Shah, Robert Lindblad, Shelly Carter
The EMMES Corporation, Rockville, MD, USA
Stem cell clinical trials for cardiovascular disease in the last decade have been well tolerated with preliminary evidence suggesting efficacy. Standardization of endpoints is important to facilitate comparisons across studies. We describe our methods of safety and efficacy assessment based on our experience coordinating multiple studies using various cell populations and administration methods.
Adverse events (AEs) are collected after enrollment, evaluated by independent medical monitors throughout the trial and coded using the most current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and reviewed every 6-months by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) are defined as death, hospitalization for heart failure or non-fatal recurrent myocar-dial infarction. Patients are evaluated for complications during study product administration and within

24-48 hours. Cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and Troponin) are collected every 12 hours for the first 48 hours. Echocardiograms are performed following the procedure and within 24-48 hours to assess for pericardial effusions. Incidence of arrhythmias is assessed by ambulatory electrocardiograms. Hospitalizations are adjudicated independently and classified as cardiac related or not. Ectopic tissue formation is assessed using CT scan.
Functional benefit is evaluated using New York Heart Association Class, Six Minute Walk Test, Peak VO2, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Quality of life is measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is used for assessing global and regional function. Patients who are device dependent undergo cardiac CT at baseline and 12 months.
Clinical trials of cardiovascular cell therapy are expanding due to the excellent safety profile and early signs of efficacy. Safety is paramount and constantly monitored. Centralized cores such as imaging labs are important to maintain consistency and independence. As therapies evolve, consistency in the endpoint assessment should be considered to ensure comparability across studies.

SHRINKING THE GLOBAL VILLAGE: THE CHALLENGES OF TRIAL MANAGEMENT IN AN INTERNATIONAL MULTI-CENTRE TRIALClaire Cochran, Jennifer Burr, Augusto Azuara-Blanco, Pauline Garden, John Norrie, Alison McDonald,
Gladys McPherson on behalf of the EAGLE group
Univeristy of Aberdeen
Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) require efficient subject recruitment and retention. Often the management of such a trial poses significant challenges.
EAGLE (Effectiveness, in Angle closure Glaucoma, of Lens Extraction) is an international multi-centre, pragmatic, publicly funded randomised controlled trial (RCT). EAGLE addresses whether removal of the lens of the eye for newly diagnosed Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma results in better clinical, economic and patient focussed outcomes compared with standard management.
The EAGLE management team are UK based; however identification, recruitment and three year participant follow up is executed by staff working in sites across the UK, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, (Peoples Republic Of) China and Australia. The EAGLE study design requires minimal direct contact between the UK management team and the participant. The maintenance of effective working relationships between the UK management team and the international recruiting teams is, therefore, crucial to project success.
To conduct EAGLE across different health care, legal, and cultural settings, a robust but pragmatic protocol was designed. A process for individual site assessment in terms of suitability as a recruiting site was developed involving honest discussion of trial budget and realistic timelines at outset. Maintaining momentum and focus on the research question among collaborators was addressed through site visits, regular scheduled video conferences, newsletter bulletins and an ongoing training regime of bespoke design that altered as appropriate when the trial matured and entered new phases. Global teleconferences were negotiated across time zones. Escalating costs of printing and translating trial paperwork into three different languages required re-profiling of a fixed budget without compromising trial delivery.
This paper describes the challenges encountered in EAGLE across the first half of its data collection journey and the strategies employed to overcome them. The EAGLE study experience is widely applicable to any centrally managed international multi-centre RCT.

THE USE OF CENTRAL IRBS FOR MULTICENTER CLINICAL TRIALS Devon K. Check, Kathryn E. Flynn, Judith M. Kramer, Kevin P. Weinfurt Duke Clinical Research Institute; Durham, NC, USA
Background: Multicenter clinical trials are designed to generate data that may be generalized across diverse populations with the goal of facilitating unbiased answers to important medical questions. The Food and Drug Administration, the Office of Human Research Protections, and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) support the use of a centralized IRB review process, that is, a single IRB of record for a given protocol, to improve multicenter trial efficiency. Most recently, the DHHS proposed to change the Common Rule to include mandated centralized review for multicenter trials; however, there are concerns that the benefits of centralized review have not been sufficiently demonstrated.

472 Abstracts
Methods: We identified published articles relating to centralized review through PubMed and hand searching. We categorized articles by topic and type (commentary or empirical research).
Results: Our review includes 78 sources. Of these, 22 articles describe inefficiencies and inconsistencies with multiple review (12 empirical), 4 articles compare multiple to central review (1 empirical), and 5 articles describe barriers to the adoption of central review (1 empirical). The single empirical study directly comparing multiple and central review showed that affiliation with a central IRB was associated with faster reviews and financial savings.
Several limitations of the empirical work were noted: 1) Absent a standardized metric for measuring review quality, all studies focus on efficiency, without informing the debate over the ethical quality of central versus local review, 2) Methodological quality is weak, as the majority of articles are case studies using a sample size of less than 20, and 3) The existing empirical work is not generalizable, as it is unclear how descriptions of prior practices would carry over to a still-undefined system of mandated centralized review. Conclusions: The limitations of the existing empirical work constrain meaningful conclusions about centralized review.

TRACKING OF REGULATORY DOCUMENTS IN A LARGE CLINICAL TRIAL,
THE AGE-RELATED EYE DISEASE STUDY 2 (AREDS2)
Sherrie Schenning*, Wendy L. McBee, Traci E. Clemons, Emily Y. Chew, John Paul SanGiovanni *The EMMES Corporation, Rockville, Maryland
The storage and tracking of regulatory documents in a large, long-term clinical trial can quickly become unmanageable without a proper tracking system. Gone are the days of manual files, as clinical trials move to the use of electronic regulatory tracking databases. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) is a multi-centered clinical trial designed to assess the effects of oral supplementation of high doses of macular xanthophylls and/or omega -3 fatty acids for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and cataract in just over 4,000 participants. The Administrator and Protocol Monitors at the AREDS2 Coordinating Center have the immense task of tracking regulatory documents for the 82 clinical sites and the 1200 past and present clinical site personnel. A customized electronic regulatory tracking system, Site Management Utility (SMU), was implemented to manage all regulatory documents including those required for study activation at participating sites. SMU enables staff to efficiently track such documents as IRB approvals, medical licenses, Human Subject Protection Training notifications, and protocol specific certifications. The utility also allows the Coordinating Center to maintain a full project contact list and archive of present and former staff. During the study start-up phase, SAS reports linked to regulatory information in SMU were generated to monitor completion of all requirements for study activation. Throughout study follow- up, a SAS program was run to generate automatic email reminders to the clinical sites at 60, 30, and 7 days prior to IRB and/or medical license expirations. SMU and other effective tools utilized at the Coordinating Center will be highlighted during this discussion of efficient methods of regulatory tracking and storage.

Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland.
EHR4CR (Electronic Health Records for Clinical Research) is a research project funded by the European Union Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) within the Innovative Medicines Initiative framework. EHR4CR is a collaborative project involving primarily universities, the pharmaceutical industry with input from organisations and groups representing patients and covering aspects of the law, ethics and technologies associated with the use of electronic data for research purposes.
The EHR4CR project aims to improve the efficiency of, and reduce the cost of, conducting clinical trials, by better leveraging routinely collected clinical data through development of both an EHR4CR platform (primarily tools and services) and implementing an innovative and sustainable EHR4CR business model.
Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 450 554 http://ctj.sagepub.com
Abstracts 473
Introducing innovative technology involves cost, new ways of working and organisational change. The multinational scope of the project means that every effort must be made to ensure that the approaches, methodologies and technologies conform to local and international legal and ethical requirements related to data protection, privacy and confidentiality. The project must also conform to the standards required by national and international drug regulators (MHRA, EMA, FDA, etc.) and satisfy the needs of the pharmaceutical industry. The approaches taken also need to be acceptable to the general public, patients, medical professionals (both study investigators and otherwise), and also to politicians and professional bodies sensitive to the concerns of their constituencies.
Proactive management of the complex network of European stakeholders external to the EHR4CR project team is an essential task which will continue throughout the full four year lifecycle of the EHR4CR project. This presentation describes a pilot exercise that has been carried out in Scotland in order to develop a best practice approach for local national stakeholder identification, analysis engagement and management during the development phase of the EHR4CR project. A summary of the key outcomes of the Scottish pilot activity and the planned next steps for roll out of the stakeholder management process across Europe will be presented.

EXPLORATORY BIOMARKER ANALYSIS FOR RANDOMIZED PHASE 2 ONCOLOGY TRIALS Hongjie Deng, Rui(Sammi) Tang, Li Chen, Mike Hale
Amgen Inc. Thousand Oaks, CA, U.S.A
Randomized Phase 2 oncology trials are mainly aimed at demonstration of improved efficacy (e.g. improved Progression Free Survival, Overall Survival) and acceptable safety profile of the target therapy versus the control therapy. With the development of the new bio-assay technology, biomarkers may provide an important role in demonstrating mechanism of action and pathway intervention of drugs and provide preliminary evidence of treatment effect of the target therapies. In addition, biomarkers may also be used to select patients who are mostly likely to benefit from the treatments. Based on preliminary biological hypothesis of the biomarkers, data generated from Phase 2 studies can be used to identify biomarkers that have predictive potentials on treatment effect. The potential predictive effect of biomarkers can then be further tested in large Phase 3 trials with adequate planning to provide more definitive evidence of the utility of the bio-marker for patient selection.
In this presentation, we will discuss the exploratory statistical analysis of biomarker data for randomized Phase 2 oncology trials and the impact of the analysis on Phase 3 study designs. Both continuous and categorical biomarker data will be discussed. Applications of statistical methodology including survival analysis, subgroup analysis, logistic regression analysis and time dependent ROC curves will be presented. Potential confounding factors of the biomarkers will be discussed. Experience on practical considerations in exploratory biomarker data analysis such as data collection and transfer, potential un-blinding, ascertainment rate will be shared.

LEVERAGING ENRICHMENT DESIGN METHODS TO IMPROVE THE

Imogene Grimes John SchoenfelderImogene is from Otsuka/ John is from Abbott Ostuka Pharmaceutical

The sponsor owns the responsibility for a clinical study to comply with the protocol, including enrollment of patients who meet eligibility requirements. It is the responsibility of the investigator to give the best care available to patients. Struggles sometimes result when investigators, who have enthusiasm and optimism that a particular investigational drug will benefit their patients, have disappointment when trial eligibility criteria exclude patients that they want to enroll in a study. Patients who are enrolled into studies when they are on the edge of eligibility can chip away at the statistical power of a study to demonstrate treatment benefit. From the statistical perspective, having a homogeneous population with a smaller variance can have more statistical power for analysis than having a larger sample size when the population is more heterogeneous and the variability is greater. The enrichment design (referenced in FDAs Adaptive Design Clinical Trials

Strategic utilization of the enrichment design can improve the likelihood of success of a study by using Bauer closed procedures. The proposed methodology has two major advantages: (1) using the conditional sequence of hypothesis tests to control multiplicity, alpha can be 0.05 for each hypothesis test while preserving the overall study-wise alpha at 0.05; and (2) it allows patient recruitment to permit all comers in the study protocol while protecting the primary analysis to be done in a subpopulation enriched with patients in whom the benefit may be easier to measure, hence, demonstrate

SURVEY OF COMMONLY USED ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR ANALYZING

Biomarkers are laboratory measures of biological processes. Because they are viewed to be objective and quantifiable by providing valuable information in both assessing exposure and disease status, they are increasingly used in biomedical and public health sciences, drug development programs, testing for targeted therapeutics and personalized medicine. This increased use creates a venue for the development of methods to address important, unexplored analytic issues such as properly handling biomarker measurements below the limit of detection (LOD). Researchers working with biomarker data inevitably have to deal with data containing non-detects, and how to combine non-detects with values above the LOD for data analysis. The common statistical analysis approach has been either to exclude measurements with LOD or perform ad-hoc single imputation techniques. Ad-hoc imputation techniques include replacing each measurement below the LOD with a value such as zero, a half of the detection limit, or LOD value itself, and then conducting the analysis under the assumption that the imputed values are the actual observed values. However, there are other parametric and nonparametric statistical methods, such as model based single imputation methods, Reverse Kaplan-Meier method, and multiple imputation methods that are not widely used in the literature but are better alternatives to ad-hoc single imputation techniques. We will facilitate broader use of all of these methods by describing their properties, illustrating their use with population-based data for secondhand smoke exposure research and showing how they can be calculated using standard software.

A PHASE II DESIGN WITH DIRECT ASSIGNMENT OPTION FOR INITIAL MARKER VALIDATION Ming-Wen An, Sumithra Mandrekar, Daniel SargentAn - Vassar College, Poughkeepsie NY USA; Mandrekar & Sargent - Mayo Clinic, Rochester MN USA
Biomarkers are a critical component of targeted therapies as they can be used to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from a particular treatment. Several prospective clinical trial designs for biomarker directed therapy have been previously proposed including the marker-stratified, sequential testing strategy, adaptive, and enrichment designs. These designs differ primarily in study populations (marker-defined or all-comers) and randomization scheme (fixed or adaptive). Recognizing the need for randomization yet acknowledging the possibility of remarkably promising results at interim, we propose a two-stage Phase II marker-positive design that allows for direct assignment in Stage II. In particular, Stage I of our proposed design randomizes marker- positive patients equally to receive targeted therapy or control, while Stage II has the option to adopt direct assignment whereby all Stage II patients receive the targeted therapy. Through simulation, we study the effect of varying the alpha decision cutoffs at interim and timing of interim analysis on power and Type I error rate. We compare our design with a balanced randomized two-stage design. Our results suggest relatively minimal loss in power (<2%) and increase in Type I error rate (<5%). A sensitivity analysis to examine the possible effects of a population shift also suggests relatively minimal inflation of power, compared with no population shift. Our design has a greater appeal to clinicians and patients with its direct

assignment option, while maintaining relatively desirable statistical properties. The direct assignment, if adopted in stage II, provides for an extended confirmation phase as an alternative to stopping the trial early for efficacy which may help to avoid possibly prematurely launching into a Phase III trial, thereby potentially addressing the high failure rates of Phase III trials.

USE OF A OF A FORMAL STUDY RUN-IN PHASE TO REDUCE RECRUITMENT
ERRORS IN A MULTI-CENTRE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL:
IS QUALITY BETTER THAN QUANTITY?
Gordon S Doig, Fiona Simpson and Elizabeth A. SweetmanNorthern Clinical School Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia and Royal North Shore Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Sydney, NSW 2065, Australia.
Introduction: Major protocol violations occur more frequently during the early stages of a clinical trial, when investigators are less familiar with study processes. Recruitment errors arise when study eligibility criteria are violated and can account for 50% of all major protocol violations. Study Objectives: To determine whether a formal study run-in phase can improve familiarity with study eligibility criteria and reduce recruitment errors.
Methods: Prior to starting a multi-centre clinical trial, participating centres were required to submit de-identified potentially eligible patients to a study web site. The run-in web site did not allocate patients to treatment or control groups however, the information captured allowed true eligibility to be assessed. Appropriateness of enrolment was fed back to the participating centre. Each centre was required to demonstrate proficiency at identifying consecutive truly eligible patients before being allowed to start the trial.
Results: Thirty-two centres submitted 199 potentially eligible patients to the run-in site. 32 of 199 (16%) patients did not meet eligibility criteria (recruitment errors). After successful completion of the run-in phase, at the time of this analysis participating centres had enrolled 409 patients into the trial, with four (1%) recruitment errors (16% vs 1%, p<0.001). This is significantly lower than published benchmarks obtained from FDA Phase III licensing trials (PROWESS 159/1690, p<0.001 and INTERSEPT 77/531, p<0.001). Conclusions: A formal run-in phase that provides performance feedback can improve familiarity with trial eligibility criteria and significantly reduces recruitment errors. If a multi-centre trial does not offer a formal run-in phase, we strongly urge local investigators to conduct their own formal run-in phase.

PATIENTS AND CLINICAL TRIALS: HOW IMPROVE THEIR PARTICIPATION ?
Carlo TominoItalian Medicines Agency Via del Tritone 181 Rome - Italy
It will be explain the results of a large communication project performed by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA), together with the Italian Society of General Practitioners and the Italian Federation of Family Doctors, on topics related to clinical trial of drugs. To promote knowledge on clinical trials mechanisms, to explain how subjects involved are protected by specific rules, to define potential risks and benefits deriving from the use of unregistered drugs were among the goals of this campaign. A special informative poster had been distributed to a huge number of family doctors; citizens had been asked to fill in a questionnaire, regardless they had read the poster or not, and their answers analyzed. The number of filled-in questionnaires was high (around 25,000) and results show a fair distribution among population. Information campaign showed to be effective: people who read the poster gave answers up to 15 times more correct, especially in the case of technical questions. Instead, to questions regarding the possible involvement in clinical trials, all answered more or less in the same way. We have also performed the same process in different therapeutic area within public hospital and the results will be presented. The encouraging results of this first information campaign show the direction for future years programs: on one hand, conceiving an always more detailed mechanism to inform citizens and, on the other hand, expanding such program to health structures in which clinical trials are carried out, focusing on special populations (i.e. paediatric patients, elderly, pregnant women).

Abstract Objective: Achieving required enrollment and diversity in a multi-center international randomized clinical trial is an arduous mission. We will outline the strategies leading to BARI 2Ds success in reaching the final participant target number and doubling the minority participant enrollment recommended in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines.
Methods:Recruitment data were collected from pre-trial, Vanguard and recruitment phase assessments, site visit reports, screening logs and cost analyses before and during the four-year enrollment period to evaluate enrollment rates. Data were analyzed periodically throughout the enrollment phase, identifying barriers and strategies to reach recruitment targets.
Results: Pre-trial recruitment assessments of the pool of eligible participants from selected sites did not provide an accurate portrayal of the total number of sites required to reach recruitment goals. Recruitment during Vanguard was half what was expected due to delayed site regulatory approvals and ineffective recruitment procedures. The recruitment period was extended, sites were added including several carefully selected foreign institutions, and a composite end point utilized to adjust total recruitment necessary to power conclusions. Eighty-two percent of sites faced recruitment source barriers, notably reluctance from physicians to refer and difficulty identifying patients before clinical treatment decisions were made. Sixty-nine percent reported inadequate staffing and staff turnover as detriments to recruitment. Extra funding, although useful, did not necessarily equate to higher recruitment numbers. Recruitment and Minority Recruitment working groups were effective in fostering strategies to overcome barriers. Best practices were identified through site visits and a centralized recruitment coordinator disseminated this information to struggling sites. Conclusion: Time and resources must be invested early to complete a realistic pre-assessment of potential sites capabilities and initiate an adequate Vanguard phase to pre-test recruitment strategies ensuring success. Proficient study teams with dedicated internal and external support are crucial to meeting recruitment goals in large multi-center trials.

Patient information leaflets (PILs) are a core component of the informed consent process in clinical trials. Most evaluation of PILs, if conducted at all, is based on indices of readability, yet several writers argue that readability is not enough. We propose a framework for evaluating PILs that reflects the central role of the patient perspective in communication, based on simple principles from linguistic theory. The framework has three elements: a) Readability (attribute of text) which may be assessed using well- established procedures that assess superficial features of the text; b) Comprehensibility (attribute of reader-and- text) which may be assessed using multiple choice questions based on the lexical and semantic features of the text; and c) Communicative effectiveness (attribute of reader relative to writers intent) which focuses on discrepancies between responses of the reader and intentions of the writer. We will discuss the implementation of this framework using the case study of the CLASS trial: Comparison of LAser, Surgery and foam Sclerotherapy, a UK multi-centre randomised controlled trial comparing three treatments for varicose veins. Using the proposed framework, the overall reading grade of the CLASS PIL was observed to be borderline for reading ease acceptability. Readability differed across the descriptions of the three trial interventions with information

about laser therapy being most readable while surgery text was least readable. Similarly, communicative effectiveness differed across the descriptions. Foam sclerotherapy was the most communicative, with higher levels of agreement between participants and the clinician/authors views. The observations from this study could be used to revise the PIL to promote equal understanding across the descriptions of the interventions, and thus minimise a potentially hidden bias in trial paperwork. This approach has broad applicability to all clinical trials and has the potential to move the field beyond readability to broader indicators of quality, facilitating enhanced informed consent.

Background: There is no shared language in the research community for describing the active ingredients of behaviour change interventions. Hence, the body of evidence from randomized studies to assess the effectiveness of interventions for changing health-related behaviour is limited. Without a precise nomenclature, it is impossible to replicate effective interventions, discard ineffective interventions, validly synthesize evidence about behaviour change interventions, or propose causal mechanisms underlying behaviour change. The project reported here aims to develop a reliable method for specifying behaviour change techniques (BCTs), how they work and how to identify when they have been delivered.
Methods: In several stages, we generated lists of BCT labels based on a) systematic reviews of behaviour change interventions; b) systematic text-book search; c) expert brainstorming. We also identified definitions from textbooks and dictionaries. The resulting draft list of BCTs and definitions was refined using consensus methods to identify redundancy and improve clarity. The nomenclature was used to code published descriptions of complex behaviour change interventions and inter-coder reliability was assessed.
Results: To date, we have agreed specification for 87 BCTs relevant to changing health behaviours. These can now be adopted to accurately specify future trials of these interventions, facilitating appropriate reporting as required by CONSORT.
Conclusion: International consensus is required to facilitate the adoption of this nomenclature into standard reporting practice. An international advisory board has been convened. Further research will test the value of the developed system for increasing the reliability of coding of published interventions for evidence synthesis and increasing the replicability of effective interventions.

WHICH COMPONENTS OF INTERVENTIONS ARE REPORTED IN TITLES AND ABSTRACTS? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW TO COMPARE REPORTING PRACTICES FOR PHARMACOLOGIC AND NONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONSEilidh Duncan, Fiona Stewart, Jill FrancisUniversity of Aberdeen Aberdeen, Scotland United Kingdom
Background: Key components of healthcare interventions such as active ingredients should be reported in titles and abstracts of published reports of RCTs. Evidence suggests that reporting of non- pharmacologic interventions (NPIs) is inadequate compared to pharmacologic interventions (PIs). There are particular challenges for specifying the active ingredients of behaviour change interventions. Aim: This review compared the reporting of components of PIs and NPIs in the titles and abstracts of published reports of RCTs. It was hypothesised that active ingredients would be reported more often in PIs than NPIs and less often in behaviour change interventions than in other NPIs.
Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 2009 to March 2011 for randomised studies published in the BMJ, JAMA, NEJM, Lancet, and Annals of Behavioral Medicine. All types of interventions, participants, and outcomes were included. Data were extracted from titles and abstracts of 198 randomly selected reports. The papers were coded for the presence or absence of key intervention components. The resulting frequency data were subjected to chi-square analysis.

478 Abstracts
Results: The search strategy returned 1,454 papers. Of 198 papers randomly selected, 98 reported PIs, 96 reported NPIs, and four reported both PIs and NPIs. There were significant associations between intervention type and reporting of active ingredients: 88.2/94.6% of PI papers and 39.6/67.7% of NPI papers reported active ingredients in the title/abstract. Furthermore, 29.3/61.0% of behaviour change papers and 52.0/78.0% of other NPI papers reported active ingredients in the title/abstract. Reporting practice differed for other components such as trial setting, intervention provider and comparator interventions.
Conclusions: This review provides further evidence of the need for improved reporting of NPIs. Researchers need a shared language for describing active ingredients of behaviour change interventions. This would ensure that interventions could be faithfully replicated and evidence validly synthesized.

FAILURE TO REPORT PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS IN CLINICAL TRIALS:
A THREAT TO INTERNAL VALIDITY?
Elizabeth A. Sweetman and Gordon S. DoigNorthern Clinical School Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia and
Royal North Shore Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Sydney, NSW, Australia 2065
Background: Excessive protocol violations (PVs), defined as preventable mistakes in study conduct, may result in patient harm and may dilute statistical power.
Purpose: To gain a better understanding of reported PV rates, to describe interventions used to reduce PVs and to investigate relationships between trial characteristics and PVs.
Methods: We reviewed consecutive trials published in four major journals identified using a PubMed search. Two authors independently abstracted information on trial characteristics, PV reporting, PV rates and interventions used to reduce PVs. PVs were categorized into one of five distinct types: enrolment, randomization, study intervention, patient compliance and data collection. Associations between PVs and trial characteristics were investigated.
Results: Eighty clinical trials (20 from each journal) were identified from 101 consecutive abstracts. Median number of participants was 701 (range: 20-162,367) and median number of participating sites was 15 (range: 1-701). Nineteen percent (15/80) of included trials were single centred. Median study duration was 24 months (range: 5.81-127 months) and 74% (59/80) of trials were primarily academic funded.
Thirty two percent (26/80) of trials failed to provide explicit reporting of any type of PV and none (0/80) of provided explicit reporting of all five types of PVs. Larger trials (more patients, more sites, longer duration, more complex management structure) were more likely to have more complete reporting of PVs. Only 9% (7/80) of trials reported the use of a specific study method to prevent PVs. Use of a run-in phase was the only method reported.
Conclusions: PVs are under-reported. Although the CONSORT statement provides guidance on the reporting of PVs, reporting requirements are not explicit for all types of PVs. As a first step towards improved reporting by authors, we recommend the CONSORT statement highlight the importance of PVs by making reporting requirements more explicit.

There is growing recognition that insufficient attention is paid to the outcomes measured and reported in clinical trials. Selection of outcomes is crucial to trials designed to compare the effects of different interventions. For the findings to influence policy and practice, the chosen outcomes need to be relevant to patients and the public, healthcare professionals and others making decisions about health care.
Trials in a specific condition often report different outcomes, or address the same outcome in different ways. Inconsistency in reported outcomes causes well known problems for those who attempt to synthesise evidence, and many meta-analyses have to exclude key studies because relevant outcomes are not reported. Furthermore, the measured outcomes may not always be important to patients or health service users.
Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 450 554 http://ctj.sagepub.com
Abstracts 479
Much could be gained if an agreed core outcome set (COS) of a minimum number of appropriate and important outcomes was measured and reported in all clinical trials in a specific condition. Key stakeholders, including patients, should be involved in establishing COS, to ensure consideration of appropriate outcomes. COS may encompass all stages or severities of a condition or may focus on a particular disease category. Likewise, a COS may be for use in trials of all treatment types or only trials of a particular intervention. The scope of a COS should be defined to identify the relevant health condition, population and types of interventions.
The COMET Initiative (http://www.comet-initiative.org/) aims to foster and facilitate methodological research in the area of standardising outcomes, to develop much needed standards for methods of COS development and to develop and maintain a publically available internet-based resource to collate the knowledge base for COS development. Work on COS has been identified in over 80 clinical areas. The database will be demonstrated, progress to date presented, and the impact of COS discussed.

THE USE OF BAYESIAN PREDICTIVE DISTRIBUTION IN CLINICAL TRIALS Bo Yang and Ram Suresh
It is not uncommon in allergy field that a drug can be approved if two out of three pivotal clinical trials are successful. To limit the cost, many sponsors start with two pivotal trials. In situations where one of the two trials is successful and the other one only demonstrates numerical improvement, the decision has to be made as whether a third study should be conducted for the pursuit of approval. In this presentation, we apply the Bayesian approach to assist the decision making. Specifically, a Bayesian hierarchical model was utilized to evaluate the probability of success of the third trial. The posterior probability and predictive probability are derived for assessing the chances for a successful third study. A real example is used to illustrate such approach.

Background: Central to the validity of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) is a calculation of the number of participants needed (the sample size). This provides reassurance that the trial will identify a difference of a particular magnitude if such a difference exists. Given its importance, determination of this target difference, as opposed to statistical approaches to calculating the sample size, has been greatly neglected. A variety of approaches have been proposed for formally determining what an important difference is (such as the minimum clinically important difference approach). However, in practice the target difference may be driven by convenience or some other informal basis. The awareness and use of formal methods in the trial community is unclear.
Aim: To assess awareness and use of formal methods for determining the target difference and thereby the RCT sample size.
Methods: Members of the Society for Clinical Trials were sent an email invitation to complete an online survey through the societys email distribution list. The survey collected information about the individual responding (e.g. position, affiliation and location). Seven formal methods were identified that could potentially be used. Respondents were asked about their awareness and use of, and willingness to recommend, methods.
Results: 180 responses were received representing 13 countries and a variety of professions and institutions. Awareness of methods varied from 69 (38%) for health economic methods to 162 (90%) for using pilot data. A majority (96, 53%) had used no more than three of the available methods. Recommendation of methods tended to be lower than use except for health economic and reviewing the evidence base methods. Conclusions: Awareness, use and willingness to recommend varied greatly between methods. Trial specific guidance documentation may increase both awareness and use of formal methods.

ADAPTIVE DESIGNS FOR CLINICAL COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH: ARE WE READY?John A. Kairalla, Christopher S. Coffey, Keith E. Muller, Mitchell A. Thomann,

There is clearly increasing national interest in comparative effectiveness research (CER). Randomized controlled trials must have a prominent place in CER due to their reliable information and well respected standard; however, improved approaches and CER-focused rethinking are needed to ensure their feasibility and overcome tendencies to be slow, expensive, and homogeneous. As in other clinical research, randomized CE trials there may have limited information to guide initial design choices including the patient population, the primary outcome, or the target effect size. In the general RCT setting, adaptive designs have been proposed to address these concerns. There are potential advantages to expanding adaptive designs to within the CE context. However, although there are many similarities between the two, CE trials have some fundamental differences from standard clinical trials. For one, the heterogeneity in the population studied in CE creates higher variability in outcomes. CE studies could be underpowered if they use planning values obtained from tightly controlled clinical trials. Additionally, the concept of a minimum clinically meaningful difference is hard to define in the CE context. Even assuming equal cost and safety, a range of meaningful effect sizes could be defined with upper limit the largest effect with reasonable chance of being observed and lower limit the minimal effect deemed sizable enough to change practice in the study context. Following a brief introduction to clinical CER, this talk will focus on additional decisions and methodology needed before the promise of adaptive designs can be achieved in the CE setting. We will describe the evaluative process to determine the usefulness of these designs in CER, assess whether or not we are ready as a scientific community to move on from basic designs to more advanced methods, and discuss items that must be addressed in order to achieve this objective.

The DIA adaptive design scientific working group have conducted a survey of the perception and use of adaptive designs (ADs) for clinical development programs in the industry and academia. In this presentation, the results of the survey will be presented and compared to the results of a previous survey carried out by the same group in 2008 under the auspices of PhRMA [1].
The key objectives of the survey were to identify any persistent barriers to implementing such designs and provide recommendations to overcome these challenges. The questionnaire was sent out to a wide selection of organizations in September 2011 to enquire about ADs that were planned, ongoing or completed in their organization from 1st January 2008 to 1st September 2011.
In parallel, the medical and statistical literature and clinical trial registries were reviewed by the group to identify published AD case studies and consider to what extent the literature is representative of the information gathered in the questionnaire. The results of this review will also be presented.

Conducting follow-up studies in older adults presents particular challenges, especially if the research is done remotely. The SELenium and vitamin E prostate Cancer prevention Trial (SELECT) opened in 2001 and recruited 35,533 participants age 50 and older at over 400 study sites. In 2009, after study supplementation ended, 17,748 participants consented to continue follow-up by mail conducted centrally by the Coordinating Center. Older adults may retire, travel extensively or buy second homes. Frail adults may need more supportive environments such as assisted living centers. Many face co-morbid conditions that may affect their ability to read, understand or complete the study questionnaires. Although older adults may be reluctant to use newer data collection technology that is widely accepted in younger populations, some expect access to the study through cell phones, email and the web. Others may have limited options for contact, such as mail or land lines. Tracking and maintaining participant contact information requires extensive staff time.
In early 2011, we administered a mailed survey to our participants. Despite strong interest in a web data submission option, to date only 550 participants (3% of total) have accessed our website, and only 410 forms have been submitted online. We are now pursuing various strategies to understand barriers to website use and to encourage participants to submit data online.

EXTENDED FOLLOW-UP IN MULTI-PHASE CLINICAL TRIALS
Katherine Trigiani, Johanna Sanchez, Elizabeth AsztalosThe Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research (CMICR), Sunnybrook
Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada
Determining the value of an intervention in a specific population, particularly in neonatal or pediatric care, often requires extended follow- up to monitor patients for effects that may only present themselves years later. The knowledge to be gained through extended follow-up in clinical research can be impeded by several practical difficulties associated with connecting with the original patient population. These challenges include locating past participants, and repatriating them back to clinic. This presentation will outline strategies in extended follow-up to mitigate these issues and maximize the potential for complete data collection.
The first step involves contacting the local Research Ethics Board or Institutional Review Board to inquire about acceptable methods for locating patients who may have moved or lost touch with their follow-up team. Once study approval has been granted it can be helpful to get in touch with the coordinator or staff who managed the trial at earlier phases. These individuals may be able to share established practices and identify participants with special circumstances; patients may also prefer this continuity of contact with the research team. Additionally, patients several years out of the clinical setting may be reluctant to return; connecting these potential participants with familiar staff may be helpful when updating them on the aims of the current trial.
Subsequent strategies for repatriating patients to the clinic for assessment can include sending a letter outlining the next phase of the trial; following up with a phone call to address questions or concerns; and mailing out a recruitment package to potential participants. This package can include consent or assent forms and a pre-addressed, pre- stamped envelope to make the process of returning signed documents easier for the participant. Finally, a follow-up call prior to the appointment to discuss logistical details and possibly offer transportation assistance can decrease the likelihood of attrition.

ISSUES TO CONSIDER IN THE SET-UP OF COMPLEX INTERVENTION
TRIALS IN VULNERABLE POPULATIONS
Shamaila Anwar, Maria Bryant, Kayleigh Burton, Amanda Farrin, Liz Graham, Jonathan Wright Clinical Trials Research Unit, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom
Complex intervention trials within vulnerable populations are challenging to undertake. They are often difficult to design, implement and evaluate, and suffer from poor recruitment. Feasibility studies are key to testing the viability of trial designs, recruitment potential and other implementation aspects of larger scale trials. We illustrate practical and logistical challenges encountered in the design and set-up of two feasibility trials: OBI (Optimised Behavioural Intervention in chronic low back pain patients) and WATCH-IT

482 Abstracts
(a community-based obesity treatment intervention for children and adolescents). OBI is currently in recruitment, whereas the evaluation of the feasibility of WATCH-IT is now complete . Both studies were set up to determine: recruitment rates, acceptability of randomisation, data collection, drop-out rate, optimal outcome measures, and aid robust sample size calculation. In addition, OBI also aims to optimise the intervention and to measure its acceptability. Both trials recruited to target and the methods of randomisation and data collection were acceptable to participants. We found that for WATCH-IT self referral (via media promotion) resulted in a higher consent rate than professional referral, but that this did not necessarily translate to greater participant retention. Also, calculation for ultimate sample size was significantly greater than that reported in published trials. Importantly, WATCH-IT highlighted how the trial impacted on service delivery which was an important lesson for the design of the phase III trial. For OBI we found that two recruitment pathways were needed dependent on whether the physiotherapy service was involved in assessment and diagnosis as well as treatment. In addition we found that training of therapists took longer than anticipated and there was a paucity of therapists in general who could provide clinical cover for the OBI therapists. Feasibility studies of complex interventions are often overlooked. However, they are essential to assess the viability of larger definitive trials.

DESIGNING CLINICAL TRIALS FOR TESTING DISEASE-MODIFYING AGENTS
ON ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
Chengjie XiongDepartment of Biostatistics Washington University St. Louis, MO 63110
There are two types of therapeutic trials in the search of agents that can treat people with Alzheimers disease (AD): symptomatic and disease-modifying trials. The former includes these for symptomatic agents with a primary objective of improving cognition, function, and global measures or deferring decline over a short period of time. The latter consists of those for disease-modifying agents which strive to show that the course of AD has been altered and the rate of disease progression has been slowed. Randomized start and randomized withdrawal designs are two popular designs of disease-modifying trials on AD. Crucial design parameters such as sample size allocations and treatment switch time are important to understand in designing such clinical trials. A general linear mixed effects model is proposed to formulate the appropriate hypothesis for the test of disease- modifying efficacy of novel therapeutic agents on AD. This model employs a piecewise linear growth pattern for those in the delayed treatment or early withdrawal arm, and incorporates a potential correlation on the rates of change on efficacy outcome before and after the treatment switch. Optimum sample size allocations and treatment switch time of such trials are determined according to the model. An intersection-union test through an optimally chosen test statistic is used for the test of treatment efficacy. Finally, summary statistics from several reported symptomatic trials on AD in the literature are used to apply the proposed methodology for designing future optimum disease-modifying trials on AD.

SOUNDNESS OF EVIDENCE DERIVED FROM METANALYSIS OF HIGH QUALITY
OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES. A CASE IN CARDIOLOGY.

IRCCS Fondazione Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy
Background. Often, despite evidence from large and/or high quality randomized clinical trials (RCT) is not available, there are numerous large, high quality cohort studies presenting adjusted risk ratio (RR). For instance, we considered studies evaluating efficacy of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance in drug eluting stent positioning in percutaneous coronary intervention and compared evidence derived from RCT and observational studies.
Methods. We performed a literature search on Pubmed, Embase, Cinhal, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were: full-text articles in peer-reviewed journals (2003-2011), we excluded uncontrolled studies. The search included both RCT and observational cohort studies. The following outcome was metanalyzed: major adverse cardiac events (MACE: death, acute myocardial infarction and/or revascularization). Pooled fixed or random effect RR and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were computed.
Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 450 554 http://ctj.sagepub.com
Abstracts 483
Results. Overall 217 abstract were evaluated and 26 full texts were retrieved; 17 of them were excluded, (abstract, review, metanalysis, MACE missing, no pertinence). Of the 9 articles included in our study 1 was a RCT and 8 were observational studies (5 with adjusted estimates). A total of 17541 patients were enrolled, women were 28%. The median age was 64 years. Median follow-up duration was 18 months (25th-75th percentiles 12-24). The RR for the RCT was 0.92 (0.39-2.19, N=210 pts); for the adjusted cohort studies it was 0.79 (0.69-0.91, N=15405 pts) and for the unadjusted cohort it was 0.89 (0.70-1.13, N=2286 pts). Discussion. The small RCT does not provide sound evidence, as shown by wide 95%CIs, while the large well conducted cohort studies with adjusted estimates indicate a protective effect of IVUS towards MACE, with high level of confidence. Being the IVUS patients more critical, its effect would be diluted in unadjusted studies. Although large RCTs are needed to confirm IVUS role, good quality cohort studies might better reflect real life.

Background: Estimates of the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) (Hemoccult II) sensitivity differ widely between screening trials, and will lead to divergent conclusions on the effects of FOBT screening. We used micro-simulation modeling to estimate a preclinical colorectal cancer (CRC) duration and sensitivity for unrehydrated FOBT from the data of 3 randomized controlled trials of Minnesota, Nottingham and Funen. In addition to two usual hypotheses on the sensitivity of FOBT, we tested a novel hypothesis where sensitivity is linked to the stage of clinical diagnosis in the situation without screening.
Methods: We used the MISCAN-Colon microsimulation model to estimate sensitivity and duration, accounting for differences between the trials in demography, background incidence and trial design. We tested three hypotheses for FOBT sensitivity: sensitivity is the same for all preclinical CRC stages, sensitivity increases with each stage, and sensitivity is higher for the stage in which the cancer would have been diagnosed in the absence of screening than for earlier stages. Goodness of fit was evaluated by comparing expected and observed rates of screen- detected and interval CRC.
Results: The hypothesis with a higher sensitivity in the stage of clinical diagnosis gave the best fit. Under this hypothesis, sensitivity of FOBT was 51% in the stage of clinical diagnosis and 19% in earlier stages. The average duration of preclinical CRC was estimated at 6.7 years.
Conclusion: Our analysis corroborates a long duration of preclinical CRC, with FOBT most sensitive in the stage of clinical diagnosis.

COMBINING RANDOMIZED AND OBSERVATIONAL DATA USING NETWORK META-ANALYSIS TO EXPLORE DRUG SAFETY: THE CASE OF ANTIFIBRINOLYTICS IN CARDIAC SURGERYBrian Hutton, Lawrence Joseph, Dean Fergusson, David Mazer, Stan Shapiro, Alan Tinmouth Brian Hutton - McGill University (Montreal, Canada), Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Ottawa, Canada); Lawrence Joseph - McGill University (Montreal, Canada); Dean Fergusson - Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Ottawa, Canada); David Mazer - Saint Mikes Hospital (Toronto, Canada); Stan Shapiro - McGill University
(Montreal, Canada); Alan Tinmouth - Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Ottawa, Canada).
Background: Aprotinin was used to minimize blood loss in cardiac surgery patients before withdrawal from the market in 2008 for safety reasons. The drug has again become available.
Methods: We performed a systematic review and network meta-analyses to estimate the relative risks of death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and renal failure/dysfunction between aprotinin, tranexamic acid (TXA), epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA), and no therapy. A 2011 Cochrane review was used to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and a search of Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Register of Trials was conducted to identify propensity matched/adjusted observational studies. Odds ratios and 95% credible intervals for comparisons between therapies were estimated, as were the average rank and probability that each therapy was most safe. The probabilities of odds ratios excluding a null difference were also
http://ctj.sagepub.com Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 450 554
484 Abstracts
estimated. Network meta-analyses based on RCTs were fit first, and then observational evidence was incorporated.
Results: 83 RCTs and 11 obervational studies (>41,000 patients) were included (Figure 1). Based on RCTs, TXA was associated with a reduced risk of death versus aprotinin, while pairwise comparisons were inconclusive for MI, stroke, and renal failure/dysfunction; point estimates and coverage probabilities of these intervals suggested aprotinin was often associated with an elevated probability of increased risk (Table 1). When observational data were incorporated, pairwise comparisons showed increased risks of death with aprotinin relative to TXA and EACA, as well an increased risk of renal failure/dysfunction relative to all comparators. There were also probabilities suggestive of increased risks of MI with aprotinin compared to TXA and EACA (Table 1).
Conclusions: Data suggests there remains reason for concern regarding aprotinin safety. While meta-analyses of RCTs can lack sufficient sample size to definitively identify harms imbalances, appropriate incorporation of observational evidence and use of network meta-analysis can help reduce uncertainty in analyses of such data.

THE PUBLICATION OF PRECLINICAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTING TRANSLATION OF
NEW DRUGS: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS
Carole A. Federico, Jonathan Kimmelman, Dean A. Fergusson, Margaret Sampson Department of Biomedical Ethics, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Canada
The success of translational research requires sound judgment in the planning and implementation of trials. Such planning involves synthesis of previous literature. We sought to determine the accessibility of pre-clinical efficacy studies in a cohort of novel investigational agents entering clinical development between 2000 and 2003. A cohort of initial human trials of new agents reported as full journal publications was identified through systematic searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE. The cohort included 100 investigational agents, spanning 10 different indications. Identified agents were linked to preclinical studies by a search of references, EMBASE and PubMed. Preclinical evidence was considered published if at least one full journal article reported disease response in live, non-human animals. Of the 100 agents, 89 had published preclinical work, 80 of which tested the identical intervention and another 9 of which were based on closely related agents. Thirteen percent of agents published preclinical studies only after the initial human trial publication. Fifty-five percent of initial human trial articles referenced published animal work. Of the 89 agents, 57% had five or more animal studies available, 33% had between 2-4, and 10% had one preclinical study available. Of the 13 investigational agents that received eventual FDA approval, 12 had five or more preclinical studies available in the published record. The probability that preclinical evidence was publicly reported in more than five reports was significantly greater for FDA approved drugs than for drugs that did not receive licensure (85% vs. 38%; Yates chi-squared test, p=0.002). This work demonstrates that a large proportion of investigational agents had at least some preclinical studies available. This suggests that preclinical knowledge synthesis for many new drugs is feasibleespecially for those receiving licensure. However, we are unable to estimate what proportion of preclinical efficacy studies go unpublished.

Quitline is a national smoking cessation service that offers telephone delivered behavioral support (3 sessions) and an eight-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) at a subsidized rate for smokers

in NZ. The Fit2Quit trial aims to determine the effects of a home and community-based exercise intervention on increasing smoking cessation rates at six months when added to usual care.
A two-arm parallel randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in 2010-11. Eligible participants were recruited through Quitline who were interested in quitting, had their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking, aged 18 years and over, and wanted to be physically active. The intervention group received telephone-based exercise counseling programme delivered by existing Green Prescription (GRx) services over six months, in addition to usual smoking cessation support. The control group received usual care alone. Self-reported smoking abstinence, mood and physical symptoms (MPSS), and physical activity level (IPAQ) were assessed at 8 and 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was self-reported point-prevalence at 24 weeks, confirmed by salivary cotinine reading. Treatment evaluations were performed on the principle of intention-to-treat assuming missing as smoking. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted.
A total of 906 smokers were randomized (intervention N=455; control N=451). Participants were aged 37 years (18-78yrs), 31% Maori, 46% males, 83% smoked >10 cigarettes per day, 79% made previous quit attempts, and 55% didnt use NRT at baseline. Relative risk and adjusted odds ratio were calculated to assess the smoking abstinence. Repeated measures models were used to evaluate change in MPSS and IPAQ total score between groups. Statistical analyses and full trial results will be presented and discussed.

Trajectory-based models are increasingly applied in clinical research to understand the etiology and developmental course of different types of disorder [1, 2, 3]. More recently, the range of applications has been extended to capture heterogeneity in treatment responses to clinical and randomized trials [4, 5].
A double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial in nutrition was carried out on 197 subjects to investigate whether the consumption of an active dairy product can improve different clinical parameters, such as well-being scores. For exploratory purpose Group-based trajectory models (GBTM) [6] were used to map the developmental course of these distinct but related outcomes individually, and then according to a joint approach. The statistical analysis was performed with the Proc Traj [7] with SAS software release 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
GBTM provided empirical ways of identifying clusters of individuals in response of the product intake, following both typical and atypical courses of development. Overall, results suggested that the active product was associated with trajectories relating clinical improvements. In this application, GBTM also allowed to highlight different responders patterns in the active product group by identifying developmentally meaningful subgroups in the population for whom product effects vary.
In this communication, authors will discuss the results of applying such methods to a clinical trial in nutrition. Strengths and limits associated to this approach as well as the interpretation will be further detailed.

The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study is a Phase 3, multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to compare a moderate-intensity physical activity program to a successful aging health education program in 1,600 sedentary older persons, age 70-89 years, across eight field centers. The primary outcome is major mobility disability, defined as the inability to walk 400 meters. Secondary and tertiary outcomes include serious fall injuries, pulmonary events, and cardiovascular events. Given the number of participants and their age range, we expect to collect data on many outcomes throughout the length of the trial. The need for a central tracking and monitoring system initiated the construction of the Outcomes Management Tool (OMT).

The OMT allows the Data Management and Quality Control (DMAQC) Center to centrally track status of outcomes, compile cases for assignment to adjudication committee members, and track the adjudications via an online interface system. The web system registers each outcome reported, eliminates duplicate events identified, and enables field centers and the DMAQC to track outcomes as they move through the outcomes process. Making this process accessible on the web is efficient for real-time reporting, gives administrators the ability to manage documents, assign adjudicators, monitor active adjudication status, communicate with adjudicators when needed, and provides a central repository for outcome details.
Generating outcome events from participant reports begins with the data entry of a case report form (CRF). Upon submission of the CRF, if specific criteria are met, this triggers the creation of a unique outcome ID for each event reported by the participant and initiates the tracking of outcomes. This utilizes IBMs WebSphere ILOG-JRules business management system for rules validation and event provocation.
This presentation will outline the flow of outcomes in the Outcomes Management Tool from the entry of the CRF to the final adjudication.

IMPROVING DATA QUALITY USING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT2 Michael Kappelman 3 Melissa Disorda 4 Jesse Pratt 5 Eileen King2. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA 3. University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA 4,5. Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA
Patient registries may support a variety of functions, ranging from clinical care to quality measurement and reporting, to clinical and translational research. Compared to clinical trials, quality reporting registries typically involve more data collection (all patients and all visits within a set of practices), often with fewer resources (funding, personnel). Data coordinating centers for registries must be aware of these differences, assist practices in embedding data collection into clinical care, and provide time-efficient resources for monitoring and improving data quality.
To support ImproveCareNow, a quality reporting registry for pediatric IBD, we worked with an established multicenter network to standardize data definitions and review their processes of data collection and capture. Additionally, we developed a set of data quality metrics to define areas where data quality is critical to desired outcomes or known areas of deficiencies for the registry. Among the measures of interest are:
proportion of patients enrolled in the registry proportion of visits captured in the registry proportion of visits with all critical data elements captured proportion of visits entered in the registry within 30 days of visit date proportion of visits where data values are suspicious, based on inter or intra-visit inconsistencies
We also developed a pair of data quality reports-- a set of run charts that allow sites to track data quality metrics over time and a report that allows sites easily identify potential errors to a level of detail that allows for quick updates to be made to the registry. These reports were designed to have a look and feel similar to tools already in use by these sites to increase the probability of their integration into normal clinical practice. Analysis of the effectiveness of these strategies is ongoing. Preliminary results show an increase from 80% to 89% of visits with all critical variables recorded.

STREAMLINING DATA COLLECTION AND FLOW FOR CENTRAL UNITS IN
LARGE MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIALSPam Mangat, Ella Temprosa, Sharon Edelstein, Hanna Sherif George Washington University Biostatistics Center Rockville, MD USA
One major aspect of multi-center clinical trials coordinating centers includes the work, data flow and monitoring of central units which analyze samples and transmit data to the coordinating center. These include laboratories for blood samples and reading centers for electrocardiographs, retinal photos, CT scans, DEXA scans, etc. Data travels from clinical site to collection site (e.g. scan center) to central reading center and finally to the coordinating center. It is critical to ensure the integrity of the data while streamlining the process when data collection and management can be challenging. The first step in the design process is planning

the methods of participant flow from clinical site to collection site, including obtaining informed consent, verifying eligibility and participant scheduling. The second step is developing the method of data flow from collection site to reading center using tools such as web-based portals, transmission software or courier services. The third step is for the reading center to securely transfer the data to the coordinating center. Data transmissions should have preapproved formats and sets of components for consistency and accuracy such as dates of analysis and receipt, and unique identifiers for the individuals performing the analysis and the specific image or sample. The fourth step is to develop methods for data validation to ensure the correct attribution of assessment to the corresponding participant. The coordinating center should have a checklist for the incoming central unit data where the data must check and pass each step before moving to the next step. Finally, a process for the reporting of alert values to sites in a timely manner must be developed. Several options for these processes will be described and various methods in which data is collected and transferred from reading centers to coordinating centers will be compared, and future suggestions will be discussed.

DESIGN OF A COMPREHENSIVE RULE-BASED, REAL-TIME DATA VALIDATION FUNCTION
IN A WEB-BASED CLINICAL TRIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Keith Pauls, Jaemyung Kim, Wenle ZhaoMedical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, United States
With the popularity of electronic data capture (EDC) increasing in clinical trials, there is a growing demand for stronger and more efficient data validation tools. Traditionally, online single field range checks and batched offline logic checks performed by statisticians are used to identify data issues related to data transcription errors and protocol compliance discrepancies. Our home-grown, web-based Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) is equipped with a database driven data validation process to perform rule-based data checks at the time of data entry. This process uses a centralized database table to manage all data validation checks for all Case Report Forms (CRFs). Initial data checks against invalid data types, missing required data items and impossible data values are performed prior to saving the record to the database. Records that pass this initial process are saved to the database and further data validation is performed by using database queries involving one or more related data items to ensure sound data collection logic is enforced. Depending on the sources of these data items, such data validation queries can be defined within the current data record, across multiple records within the same data table, or across multiple records from different data tables. Violations of these data checks will be saved in a central rule violation table along with the values of the associated data items. Based on the level of the violation, an alert, warning, or rejection flag will be placed on the data form as an indicator for users to take the next appropriate action. Our data management experiences for more than ten large, multi-center phase III clinical trials demonstrated that this comprehensive, real-time data validation function has significantly reduced data errors occurring during the data entry process and shortened the time required for data cleaning and database lock.

SURVEY OF THE CURRENT BELIEFS AND ATTITUDES OF THE CANADIAN CRITICAL CARE TRIALS GROUP REGARDING SOURCE DATA VERIFICATION
Dean Fergusson, Kusum Menon
The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Clinical Epidemiology Program,
Childrens Hospital of Eastern Ontario
Background: Source data verification is the process of comparing information on source records to data recorded in a Case Report Form as part of a research study. Researchers are required to perform source data verification in order to comply with National Regulations and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. There is little guidance for researchers as to the amount and frequency of this process or the effect of source data verification on study outcomes. Recently there has been debate regarding the value of source data verification on data quality. There is little research on the beliefs and attitudes of Investigators and Research Coordinators regarding the amount, frequency, value and effect of source data verification and how it may be optimized. This project is part of a research program to determine the effect of source data verification on study outcomes and the amount of source data verification that should be done.

REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH AND CLINICAL TRIALS Paul A. Thompson, Ph.D.
MADA Center Sanford Research/USD Sioux Falls, SD, USA
The concept of reproducible research was introduced in the computational sciences some time ago, but has begun to be considered in biostatistics, bioinformatic, and other areas of medically related data analysis. Reproducible research, in this context, involves performing data analysis and statistical evaluation of data in a manner in which the relevant results (tables, figures, incidental text) can be recovered with minimal effort, analyses can be conveyed to data repositories with minimal effort, and analyses can survive the inevitable changes in personnel at the data management center. This has strong implications for clinical trials, which are usually conducted in a reproducible research concept, but which are not always analyzed in this manner. From the perspective of data analysis in SAS (a dominant tool in the clinical trials field), structural approaches to project setup, disciplined and consistent uses of macros, and archival approaches to manuscript construction are the first steps to reproducible research. These will be discussed and illustrated with several examples.

THE USE OF ANCILLARY DATA CAPTURE SYSTEMS IN CLINICAL TRIALS
Colleen Allen and Paul Van VeldhuisenThe EMMES Corporation Rockville, Maryland, USA
The use of technology in clinical trials is increasing where ancillary software is utilized to capture data beyond that typically collected via case report forms in an electronic data capture (EDC) system. In recent studies by the Clinical Trials Network of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, software systems have been used to administer and monitor adherence to trial interventions and perform study assessments. Utilization of ancillary systems requires appropriate advanced planning to address key issues.
Ancillary systems vary in complexity and sophistication, ranging from simple and home-grown to complex and well-validated. Upon identifying systems deemed necessary for the trial, a communication plan should be developed outlining expectations for software developer support, as well as the workflow and timeline for identifying and resolving issues. The software and hardware needed for hosting and using the system must be identified and procured.
Understanding the structure of the data collected in the system, which is facilitated by obtaining a system diagram and data dictionary, is key. If the system will be used to capture data for analysis, it is important to verify that those data are collected and identifiable in the system. The data dictionary can assist in identifying if protected health information is being collected and if so, to develop appropriate security measures, such as encryption. It is also important to explore whether the system can communicate with the EDC system, or at a minimum that the data captured in the system can be linked to those from the EDC system.
Finally, a plan for providing initial and ongoing training in the use of the system must be established. The plan should outline who is responsible for the training, the method of training (e.g., face-to-face, webcast), and the development of a users guide.

ELECTRONIC PATIENT REPORTED DATA FOR RISK SCREENING IN PRIMARY CARE CLINICS USING OPENCLINICA AND CDISC ODM
Cal CollinsOpenClinica, LLC, Waltham, MA
Despite best practice guidelines, patients presenting for primary care are often not screened for medical issues other than the presenting problem due to time and personnel constraints. This presentation details an electronic screening protocol and technology platform that: a) allows patients to complete a brief screening form prior to their appointment, and b) provides immediate feedback on health risks and conditions for clinicians to use in the patient visit.
Patients presenting at the primary care clinic self report via a Comprehensive Primary Care Screening (CPCS) instrument using Android-based tablets. The CPCS assesses risks related to falls, colon cancer, sexual health, domestic violence, oral health, alcohol, depression, and basic needs. Responses are entered via a touch-screen interface in English or Spanish, or via audio versions of the instrument. It incorporates dynamic branch logic to capture detailed information where needed from patients. Upon completion, data is saved into a EDC database where it is scored and analyzed for recommendations, including referrals and standing orders. Results are immediately accessible for physician use; scores and raw data may also be extracted for incorporation into de-identified research datasets.
We use a CDISC ODM-based form definition created using the OpenClinica open source EDC platform. The CDISC ODM protocol and data capture definitions are automatically transformed into to XForm definitions that are rendered via an open source medical data capture app on the tablets for patient entry and physician retrieval. The EDC engine provides data storage, validation, scoring, reporting, and analysis capability.
The project objectives are to: - increase referrals for health risks and conditions, - increase access to and use of de-identified screening results by researchers, and - promote adoption, dissemination, and adaptation of the screening tool by using reusable, configurable open source platform.

IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITAL PEN TECHNOLOGY TO CAPTURE CLINICAL TRIAL DATA Devin Hunt, Nicole CloseEmpiriStat, Inc., Mt. Airy, Maryland, USA
The methods for data capture have advanced as technology has evolved. Often studies utilize an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system, but many studies may still only be paper based. The costs and regulatory requirements of deploying an EDC system may not outweigh the benefits of conducting a paper based study through the use of fax forms, scanning optical character recognition software, telephone data entry, bubble forms, or digital pen capture. However, these methods are thought of as old technology, but with the proper technical approach, a paper based study may actually be more efficient and productive.
A model project was conducted in which digital pen data collection technology was examined for benefits and drawbacks. The digital pen was used by study staff members and/or subjects to complete CRFs, the pen is docked in a docking station attached to a computer, and data is uploaded to the data coordinating center. After project evaluation, it was found that the use of digital pen technology to instantly generate electronic copies of paper CRFs benefited the study by:
1. eliminating the need to ship completed CRFs,2. eliminating the need to scan paper forms for electronic storage and transmission,3. dramatically reducing data collection training for staff,4. using a source document as a CRF, and5. having the ability to track CRF completion virtually.
While there are multiple ways to implement digital pen technology, each with their own drawbacks, this project found that data still had to be entered into an electronic database manually, printing CRFs required using print vendors with previous experience with the software, and a method to transfer and track files and

The technology of personal computing has undergone great changes the last few years. Naturally, those conducting clinical research would like to take advantage of these advancements.
The Clinical Research Database (CRDB) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) was created as a client server application in 1992. In 2003, the first web based platform was made available to facilitate data entry from remote locations. During the past year, it became necessary to expand our application scope to keep up with the latest needs of the researchers. There are two main areas of our system expansion: 1) the multicenter internet platform and 2) mobile devices.
Historically at MSKCC, data management for our multicenter protocols was mainly a paper based system. It became evident that participating sites needed access to CRDB to enter data directly. This brought about security and privacy concerns beyond what was needed for an internal database. The conversion to a new external platform to deal with these concerns brought its own set of challenges.
In parallel, a mobile option was needed for survey completion by participants in clinic because desktop computers are not always available. However, CRDB was designed for data entry by clinical research professionals, not participants. We were able to design a tablet survey that addressed this as well as other concerns.
In this presentation, we will review the need for alternative platforms for collecting clinical research data. We will also address the various challenges we faced while expanding our system from the traditional data entry model, as well as our suggested solutions.

CHALLENGES AND IMPLICATIONS OF PATIENT REPORTED CLINICAL OUTCOMES
FOR RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS
Suzanne Breeman, Alison McDonald, Gladys McPherson, John Norrie, Graeme MacLennan,
Marion Campbell, Kath Starr, Seonaidh Cotton
University Of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK
Clinical outcomes are an important component of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and are often used to complement patient reported outcome measures such as health-related quality of life. Although clinical outcomes were traditionally collected through clinical examination or laboratory results, routine data sources and self-reporting by patients are increasingly used.
We examined four RCTs that collected patient reported clinical outcomes through postal questionnaires. In each RCT the patient reported clinical outcome was verified using either medical records, routine data sources or by contacting the patients family doctor or hospital physician to ascertain the accuracy.
The accuracy of patient reporting of clinical outcomes is dependent on a number of factors including the nature and timing of the clinical outcome and the phrasing of the clinical questions. For example, it may be easier for a patient to report a knee-related hospital re-admission than self-report a urinary tract infection. Nevertheless, approximately 15% of patient reported knee- related hospital re-admissions (collected through annual postal questionnaires) could not be verified through routine data sources and/or medical records. Such inconsistencies were shown to be a combination of misunderstanding by the patient and inaccuracies of the routine data sets.
Obtaining clinical information from patients is feasible, especially if the outcome of interest is a symptomatic one. However with the potential inaccuracies associated with patient reporting of clinical outcomes, it may be necessary to consider verifying such outcomes with medical professionals and/or routine data sources. Such a strategy has implications in terms of staff time and cost and therefore has to be considered during the design stage of the RCT.

ELECTRONIC PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME (EPRO) ASSESSMENT IN
CLINICAL TRIALS: STRATEGIES FOR PRESERVING STATISTICAL POWER
Antonia Bennett, AJ Vickers, EM Basch
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
Background: The availability of platforms and devices for electronic data capture has been a major step forward for the assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in clinical trials. The advantages of electronic PROs include real-time tracking of compliance, automated patient reminders, and date-time data for individual assessments. Multiple modes of ePRO data capture (e.g. PC/tablet, handheld, automated phone survey) allow flexibility in clinical trial design. This has raised the question of whether use of multiple modes in a single trial might affect statistical power.
Methods: We review the growing body of research on the measurement reliability across modes, and estimate the effect on statistical power in several common PRO endpoint analyses. We consider this effect compared to other common and PRO-related threats to power.
Results: Peer-reviewed studies indicate the measurement reliability across modes of administration is high (approx 0.90) and consistent with the test-retest reliability of individual modes. We have calculated that even if measurement reliability were more moderate (0.70 0.80), effects on statistical power would be small. The estimated reduction in statistical power from using multiple modes of data collection is dwarfed by the estimated loss of power associated with missing data (which can be prevented by allowing a second mode as alternate or backup). The threat of multiple modes to power is also far less than mis-estimation of variance in sample size calculation or use of PRO measures with low responsiveness.
Conclusions: Very small reductions in measurement reliability from the use of multiple modes of ePRO are outweighed by the advantage of data completeness. To preserve power in clinical trials, researchers would be better off focusing on well-established areas of methodologic concern, such as accurate estimation of variance and choice of responsive outcome measures.

RANDOMIZED DECISION DESIGNS WHEN THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE SUBJECTS
PRECLUDES A MORE STANDARD STUDY DESIGN
James R. Anderson and Lynette SmithUniversity of Nebraska College of Public Health, Omaha, NE, 68198-4355
Suppose a limited number (N) of patients is available for study and the traditional randomized trial design comparing standard to new is not feasible. This work was motivated by an interest in comparing two treatments for recurrent Wilms tumor, where about 40% of patients are event-free long- term with standard treatment. One option is a study design which seeks to maximize the number of study subjects receiving the better treatment.
Consider a design for which n1/2 patients are randomized to each of 2 treatments and then time-to-event is compared using the log-rank test. All remaining (N-n1) patients are then assigned treatment 1 (treatment 2) based on whether the log-rank test is positive (negative).
We assumed an available sample size of 100. For exponential failure-time distributions with a baseline ? of
0.50 to 0.75, and for a range of relative risks from 0.65 to 0.80, the design which maximized the number of subjects receiving the better treatment was to randomize about 40 patients (having observed about 20% of the total expected information) and then assign the remaining 60 patients to the regimen with the better observed outcome.
We hypothesized that, in other settings, the n1 corresponding to observing about 20% of the expected information would be optimal. We ran simulation studies assuming a cure model outcome: S(t) = 0.4 + (0.6)*exp(- 0.75t). We simulated studies of 100 patients, with n1 values from 20 to 80 and cure rate increases corresponding to relative risks from 0.65 to 0.80. The number of study subjects receiving the better treatment was maximized at an n1 value of 40-45 (corresponding to 17- 20% of the total expected number of events).

BIO-CREEP UNDER SERIAL USE OF NON-INFERIORITY TRIALS DESIGNED FOR PRESERVATION OF EFFECTKatherine Odem-Davis; Thomas R. FlemingUniversity of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA
In non-inferiority (NI) trials, the evaluation of the efficacy of a new experimental treatment allows for some defined level of reduced effect as compared to an active control standard. Serial use of NI trials may lead to erosion in the level of improvement provided by newly approved therapies; this phenomenon is called bio-creep. Simulations were designed to facilitate understanding of bio-creep risk when approval of a new treatment with efficacy less than some proportion of the effect of the active control treatment would constitute harm, such as sulfonamides or penicillin for treatment of Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia. In this setting, risk of approval of insufficiently effective therapies may be great, even when the standard treatment effect is constant across trials. Among the many possible factors contributing to this manifestation of bio-creep, the most influential were the method for selecting the active control, the choice of non-inferiority margin, and bias in the active control effect estimate. Therefore, when non-inferiority testing is performed, margins should be based upon the estimated effect of the active control, should account for the variability and for likely sources of bias in this estimate, and should address the importance of preservation of some portion of the effect of the standard.

Sophie Chen, Health
Canada, Ottawa, Canada.
Purpose: This study demonstrates how errors in estimating the SD of a population can lead to inaccurate sample sizes and underpowered studies, and offers recommendations for maximizing the likelihood of achieving adequate statistical power.
Results: Our simulated data show that greater sample size provides a more reliable estimate of the SD of the population than a smaller one. All minimal and 25th percentile sample SDs fell below 44 (the population SD) no matter how big the sampling sample size (from 2 to 100). For samples sizes 10 and 100, the minimum sample SDs underestimate the population SD by 47.1% ([44 23.27] / 44) and 18.3% ([44 35.93] / 44), respectively. For all sample sizes below 40, the mean sample SDs fell below the population SD; for sample sizes of 40 or greater, the mean sample SDs were close to the population SD. All maximum and 75th percentile sample SDs exceeded the population SD. Based on a published underpowered trial (n1=13, n2=17 and power < 30%), we found the reported SDs ranged from 1.8 to 9.3 from the literature, with a weighted average SD of 8.1. This study needs to have n=66 for each group to reach a power of 80% according to our calculation. Conclusion: No explicit guidelines have been available for choosing an appropriate SD to use in the calculation of sample size for a clinical trial. To remedy this problem, we have developed an algorithm and recommendations for making a judicious choice intended to minimize the risk of conducting an underpowered study.

MEASUREMENT ISSUES IN THE HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR DEPRESSION MAY CONCEAL POSITIVE FINDINGS IN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR MAJOR DEPRESSION
Chengwu Yang; Wenle Zhao

Many depression trials used the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) as the primary measure of depression, although its severe measurement issues had been well-known. In a trail (Kellner, Kanpp, et al., 2006) that compares continuation electroconvulsive therapy (C-ECT) vs. Pharmacotherapy (C-Pharm) for relapse prevention in major depression, the total score of the 24-item HRSD (HRSD24) was used to define

relapse or remission. That trail found no statistically significant differences between the two arms. However, the results might be misleading, simply because the uni-dimensional assumption made for the HRSD24, i.e., all of the 24 items are measuring a single domain (depression) and therefore the 24 item scores can be summed to a single total score as a measure of depression, might be wrong. In this study, the original data from that trial (201 patients with 98 C-ECT, 103 C-Pharm) were utilized to investigate measurement issues in the HRSD24. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) for the uni-dimensional assumption of the HRSD24 were implemented on the data at visits 1, 2, 3, and 4. Results showed that this uni-dimensional assumption failed at each of the 4 visits. This indicated that the single total HRSD24 score should not be used as the defining variable for relapse or remission at any of the visits, thus the analyses using this total score was misleading, and may conceal some true positive findings in that trial. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on all of the 24 items failed to yield a consistent factor structure across the 4 visits. Then item-level analyses of the 24 items were implemented, and results showed that statistically significant differences exist on 3 of the 24 items between the two arms. It might be worthy to re-investigate the findings from some of the large depression trials that used the HRSD, especially those with negative findings.

LASSO TREE FOR CANCER STAGE GROUPINGYunzhi Lin; Sijian Wang; Rick ChappellDepartment of Statistics, University of Wisconsin - Madison; Department of Biostatistics &
Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin - Madison; Department of Biostatistics & Medical Informatics and Department of Statistics, University of Wisconsin - Madison
The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system has been the lynchpin of cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis for many years. For meaningful clinical use, an orderly, progressive grouping of the T and N categories into an overall staging system needs to be defined, usually with respect to a time-to-event outcome. This can be reframed as a model selection problem for a censored response grouped with respect to features arranged on a partially ordered two- way grid (the TN table), and a L1 penalized regression method is proposed for selecting the optimal grouping.
Instead of penalizing the L1-norm of the coefficients like lasso, in order for the grouping to occur, we place L1 constraints on the differences between neighboring coefficients. The underlying mechanism is the sparsity-enforcing property of the L1 penalty, which is expected to give a reduced number of unique coefficients that represent different groups. A partial ordering constraint is also required as both the T and N categories are ordinal. A series of optimal groupings with different numbers of groups can be obtained by varying the tuning parameter. This gives a tree-like structure for partitioning the TN table, and thus offers a visual aid on how the groupings are made progressively. We hence call the proposed method the lasso tree.
We illustrate the utility of our method by applying it to the stage grouping of colorectal cancer. Simulation studies are carried out to examine the finite sample performance of the selection procedure. We demonstrate that the lasso tree is able to give the right grouping with moderate sample size, is robust with regard to changes in the data, and is not affected by random censorship.

SOME STRATEGIES FOR DEFINING NON-INFERIORITY BOUNDS IN ACTIVE-CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH NO PLACEBO-CONTROLLED DATA FOR THE ACTIVE COMPARATOR
Aditi Sapre, Uma Kher
Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ USA
Non-inferiority trials are appropriate when there is clear clinical rationale that a placebo cannot be used, and inference needs to be made to a putative placebo group to ensure the test compound is effective. However, with the development of drugs that have greater efficacy than the existing gold standard therapy, the use of this standard as a comparator treatment in future trials with new novel drugs may be inappropriate. This is particularly true in the area of antithrombotics for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. With the existing gold standard, Warfarin, likely to be replaced by one of possibly three new compounds in coming years, newer drugs for the treatment of SPAF will be faced with the challenge of showing non-inferiority to a new gold standard, that was never tested in a placebo-controlled setting. This leads to the challenge of

defining a NI bound based on preserving a certain percentage of the placebo effect, where no placebo-controlled studies exist. We propose a strategy that incorporates placebo controlled data for the existing gold standard (warfarin) and warfarin controlled data for the new gold standard in defining the NI bounds for a time to event endpoint.

Interventions to improve patient care are sometimes delivered to whole primary care medical centres. In such instances, it is natural to use a cluster randomized clinical trial design to test the intervention effect. Ideally, outcome data are collected at the individual level, though follow-up rates can be poor, particularly for patients in non- intervention centres who may have little involvement with the study beyond providing data. However, after an initial contact with patients to obtain consent and baseline information not otherwise available, utilization of routinely collected data, in the form of medical centre records, allows for near complete follow-up at an individual level with minimum additional contact. In Scotland, data on all hospitalizations and deaths are also routinely collected and can be linked to individual patients, allowing for long-term passive follow-up. These data include reasons for hospitalization, length of hospital stay, and causes of death.
There are several advantages to cluster randomized studies, such as simplified trial organization and reduced contamination between intervention groups. Disadvantages include the increased sample size required for the same statistical power and the need for more complex analyses. Use of routinely collected data is advantageous for several reasons, including reduced trial costs and maximization of follow-up, though limitations include the accuracy and completeness of the data collected.
These issues will be discussed in relation to the Heart failure Optimal Outcomes from Pharmacy Study (HOOPS), recently completed in Glasgow, Scotland, which used primary care medical centres to recruit patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and to deliver an intervention of pharmacist-led medication review, to optimize the use of evidence-based medicines. Details of medication use up to two years post-randomization were collected through medical centre records. Routinely collected national hospitalization and death records were also used to follow patients up for a median of 4.7 years.

ROUTINE DATA IS IT GOOD ENOUGH FOR TRIALS?
Alex Wright-Hughes, Liz Graham, Amanda Farrin, David CottrellAlex Wright-Hughes, Liz Graham, Amanda Farrin: Clinical Trials Research Unit, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK. David Cottrell: School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK
We explore the possibility of obtaining routinely available data for use in clinical trials, the reliability of this data, and the benefits of this approach if found to be successful.
The SHIFT Trial (a randomised controlled trial of family therapy vs. treatment as usual for adolescents following self-harm) is used to illustrate the process. The Trials primary endpoint (repetition of self-harm leading to hospital attendance) requires timely and regular collection of hospital attendance data to inform the timing of analysis, and is thus a resource intensive task requiring researcher visits to Hospitals to interrogate local medical records.
We are exploring the feasibility of collecting this data from a central source, the NHS Information Centre (IC). The IC holds data provided periodically by English Hospitals, their main aim being to provide England-wide statistics to inform frontline decision makers. However we wish to assess whether this is also a complete and reliable means of acquiring data for research. Benefits include: a) Regular, fast England-wide data retrieval rather than collection from an identified, limited hospital pool; b) avoidance of potentially biased data collection due to, for example, more frequent visits to some Hospitals than others; and c) to free up researcher resources.
After comparing data gathered by the Researchers from pre-identified, representative Hospitals with data retrieved from the IC, a change to the method of primary outcome data collection may be instigated after

CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL RESEARCH IN ADULT CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE: A PERSPECTIVE FROM CLINICALTRIALS.GOVDavid F. Kong; Karen P. Alexander; A. Zoe Starr; Judith M. Kramer; Karen Chiswell; Robert M. Califf Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, NC, USA; Duke Translational Medicine Institute, Durham, NC, USA;
Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative, Durham, NC, USA
To describe the broad portfolio of cardiovascular clinical research, the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) and the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) derived a dataset for aggregate analysis from ClinicalTrials.gov. We identified 40,970 clinical research studies registered after September 2007 where human subjects received diagnostic, therapeutic or other interventions per protocol. By analyzing 18,491 descriptors from the National Library of Medicines Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) thesaurus and 1,220 free-text terms, we included only studies related to the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of diseases of the heart and peripheral arteries which enrolled adults ?18 years (N=2,325 studies). The identified studies were 74% ongoing, 22% completed, and 4% terminated, withdrawn, or suspended. The study intervention was drug in 45%, device or procedural in 39%, behavioral in 8%, and biologic or genetic in 3%. Development phase was Phase 4 in 25.6% , Phase 3 in 19.1% , Phase 2 in 15.9%, Phase 0 or 1 in 4.9% , and inapplicable in 34.5%. Many studies (46.3%) anticipated enrolling fewer than 100 subjects. Only 16.8% of phase 3 studies anticipated more than 1,000 subjects. In phase 3 studies, the median anticipated enrollment was 200 subjects. Most studies had one (26.8%) or two arms (59.9%); 94.7% of studies with two or more arms were randomized. Only 32.0% were double blind, 15.1% were single blind, and 52.9% were open label. Industry was the most frequent sponsor overall (32.0%) and across development phases. Non-US oversight authority was listed for 60% of studies. Of studies with US oversight, 47.9% reported FDA oversight. Cardiovascular medicine is widely regarded as a vanguard for evidence-based drug and technology development. This survey of cardiovascular studies reported in the clinicaltrials.gov registry reveals substantial heterogeneity in study design and sponsorship. The preponderance of small trials represents an opportunity to encourage collaboration and foster research networks.

THE CLINICALTRIALS.GOV RESULTS DATABASE AS A RESOURCE FOR DESIGNING CLINICAL TRIALS Elizabeth C WrightNational Institute of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA
Background: Many clinical trials have endpoints that are changes in a measurement over time. An example is change in kidney function as measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Sample size and power depend on the standard deviation of the change, but this is difficult to estimate from published data. ClinicalTrials. gov now requires the submission of results for completed trials. The objective of this analysis is to determine the number of trials with GFR as an outcome, the number with results, and the usefulness of the results data for planning new trials.
Methods: A search was performed on November 10, 2011 using the terms (NOT epidermal growth factor receptor) [ALL- FIELDS] AND (NOT cancer) [DISEASE] AND (gfr OR creatinine clearance OR egfr) [OUTCOME]. SAS data sets were created from protocol descriptive data downloaded from ClinicalTrials.gov. These data sets were used to classify the protocols and to identify the outcome variables. Posted results data were reviewed and coded and publications were identified by searching for the NCT number.
Results: Of 584 interventional studies that met the above criteria, 122 had completion dates in 2008-2009 and results were posted for 39 (32%). Results were more likely to be posted for studies funded by industry (35/75 versus 4/47), p<0.0001. In total, 61 studies had results and change in GFR was an outcome for 22 of these (6 kidney disease, 9 post- transplant, and 7 other diseases). The duration of follow-up ranged from 24 hours to 5 years and the SD ranged from 3 to 35. Thirteen of the 61 studies had publications that included the NCT number.

Conclusions: Only 32% of eligible trials have results at this time. Review of results is time- consuming and baseline data are often incomplete, but the results database should be a useful resource in the future.

SUPPLEMENTING THE DESIGN OF COMPARATIVE BINARY OUTCOME TRIALS
WITH SEQUENTIAL META-ANALYSES
Mireya DiazDetroit, MI, US
Sequential meta-analyses, those in which power is determined via group sequential boundaries, have been suggested as a method to evaluate the status of the current evidence as well as tools for the trial planning process. Regarding the latter, some may consider counterproductive to use design parameters from a meta-analysis rather than from conventional sample size calculations. Here we examine conditions under which this could be actually of gain. The minimum sample size for a target effect size of small magnitude (odds ratio up to 1.5) was estimated using conventional formula for superiority and equivalence, considering alpha=0.05 and 80% power. This size was estimated for a minimal proportion varying between 0.1 and 0.9, and adjusted for various values of the inconsistency across studies in the meta-analysis ranging between 0 and 0.5. Meta-analyses subjected to sequential monitoring with 5 and 20 studies were considered.
For a hypothesized difference of 20%, the average sample size for the trial ranges between 112 and 224 for superiority and 206 and 412 for equivalence (a 95% reduction) within a meta-analysis of 20 studies. Likewise, for a difference of 50% the average sample size for the trial ranges between 92 and 184 for superiority and 170 to 338 for equivalence (an 80% reduction) within a meta-analysis of 5 studies. The smaller the target effect size, the greater the number of studies required in the meta-analysis. It is important to highlight that the individual trial at this reduced sample size is underpowered but not the meta- analysis that will include it.
Here it is shown that incorporating meta- analytic information in trials comparing binary outcomes may be beneficial in cases where the target effect size is small as well as when heterogeneity of estimates across studies is moderate. This is true from both superiority and equivalence points of view.

DEVELOPING STOP-GO CRITERIA FOR PILOT / FEASIBILITY STUDIES TO
CONTINUE TO FULL TRIALS
John NorrieCentre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT), Health Services Research Unit,
University of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK
Randomised trials are difficult to design, expensive to conduct, and frequently fail to deliver precise enough answers to relevant healthcare questions. Particularly for complex intervention studies, in which there may be poorer background knowledge going into the trial, being confident that all design elements (PICO -Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes) are properly understood and optimised is a considerable challenge. In addition, the majority of trials struggle to recruit on time and to budget, and there are often issues of retention that can undermine a trial.
Increasingly public funders (e.g. UK NIHR HTA/MRC) are requiring reassurance on many of these issues via an internal pilot or feasibility study, before releasing funding for the full trial. Although there has been an explosion of interest in adaptive designs, much of this has been from a theoretical statistical perspective, without so far corresponding attention paid to the practical challenges of how you embed such design flexibility into a real trial, and make reliable decisions on the basis of an often small amount of information of uncertain quality, probably tainted by many sources of bias as the trial struggles to get itself established.
This talk will discuss the issues around developing stop-go criteria to confirm whether a trial should expand to a full trial. These usually include performance metrics for recruitment, but may also include fidelity to the randomised intervention, completeness of follow up (retention), and cost profiles. This will be from a practical perspective and use real examples of such stop-go criteria from publicly funded trials. It will contrast information (waiting until a pre-specified level of information is accrued) vs. time (information accrued in a fixed time) approaches to stop-go algorithms, and will emphasise the need for careful interpretation of the signals from a pilot/feasibility study to inform progression to full trial.

WORKING WITH AT-RISK POPULATIONS
Allison Caban-Holt, Cecil Runyons, Josh Turner, Korey Vallance, Sarah Hatcher University of Kentucky Sanders-Brown Center on Aging
Introduction: Conducting research with an aging population in a longitudinal clinical trial can pose unique challenges, particularly when cognitive decline is the primary endpoint. Unanticipated issues can arise due to use of data gathering methods that may be routinely used with younger research participants, but are less effective when used with older adults. Such differences may lead to false impressions of participant status and incidence of endpoints. The analysis of procedural methods that may disproportionately affect older adults is of critical importance at this time when many clinical trials are being undertaken to investigate interventions aimed at the older adult population.
Further, research challenges can be magnified when a clinical trial is undertaken as an ancillary study to another larger trial. The directions of the larger study affect the ancillary study in profound ways that may also lead to dramatic changes in research procedures.
The NIA-sponsored PREADViSE study is an ancillary study of the prostate cancer prevention trial, SELECT. The goal of PREADViSE is to examine the effectiveness of the antioxidants Vitamin E and Selenium in preventing Alzheimer s disease in older men in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico.
Objectives: The purposes of this poster are to: 1. Discuss challenges facing an ancillary clinical trial when the parent study undergoes major changes. 2, Elucidate some of the challenges encountered with cognitive evaluations of older men via telephone contact. Such as:
a) Logistics of contacting aging men who are still actively working outside the home b)Obtaining meaningful test results from participants who have sensory deficits c)Recognizing the impact of health issues, including recent surgery, chemotherapy, or serious illness on cognitive measurement d)Accelerated lost-to-follow-up, due to death, chronic illness, or placement in a nursing home.

INTEROBSERVER RELIABILITY OF TONGUE DIAGNOSIS USING TRADITIONAL
KOREAN MEDICINE FOR STROKE PATIENTS
Mi Mi Ko, Ju Ah Lee, Myeong Soo Lee, Byoung Kab Kang, Tae Yong ParkBrain Disease Research Center, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, 1672 Yuseongdae-ro, Yuseong-gu,
Daejeon 305-811, Republic of Korea
Background: In Korea, many stroke patients receive traditional medical care because the country has its own system of traditional alternative medicine called Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM). Observation of the tongue, also known as tongue diagnosis, is an important procedure in diagnosis by inspection in TKM. However, the clinical competence of tongue diagnosis was determined by the experience and knowledge of the clinicians who used tongue diagnosis. Much of the experiences in traditional tongue diagnosis have not been verified scientifically or quantitatively. We investigated the reliability of TKM tongue diagnosis in stroke patients by evaluating interobserver reliability regarding tongue indicators as achieved by TKM practitioners. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 658 patients with stroke admitted to 9 oriental medical university hospitals participated in this study between February 2010 and December 2010(Figure 1). Each patient was independently seen by two experts from the same department for an examination of the status of the tongue. Interobserver reliability was measured in three ways: simple percentage agreements, Cohens kappa coefficient and Gwets AC1 statistic. Interobserver agreement for the tongue indicators among all subjects (n=628) was generally high, ranging from moderate to excellent (AC1=0.43~0.97), while the interob-server agreement about subjects regarding pattern-identification with the same opinion between the raters (n=451) was also generally high, ranging from moderate to excellent (AC1=0.5~0.98). Interobserver agreement was nearly perfect for certain signs of special tongue appearance (mirror [AC1=0.95~1], spotted [AC1=0.96~0.98], bluish purple [AC1=0.85~0.95]), poor for one of the tongue colors (pale [AC1=0.32~0.66]) and moderate for others(Table1, Table2).
Conclusions: Clinicians displayed measurable agreement regarding tongue indicators via both observation and pattern identification consistency. However, interobserver reliability regarding tongue color and fur quality was relatively low. Therefore, it is necessary to improve objectivity and reproducibility of tongue diagnosis through the development of detail- oriented criteria and enhanced training of clinicians.

FACTORS THAT AFFECT MENS FEELINGS ABOUT THEIR URINATION: FINDINGS FROM A MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIAL OF PHYTOTHERAPY TO TREAT LOWER URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS Alan Cantor, Michael Barry, and Claus Roehrborn for the CAMUS Study Group
University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama
INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Saw palmetto (SP) extracts are widely used by men as phytotherapy for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Factors associated with perceptions about their urinary function in men who use phytotherapy for their LUTS have not been well described.
METHODS: The Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Urologic Symptoms (CAMUS) trial was a randomized, placebo- controlled double blind multi-center trial of 369 men ? 45 years of age with AUA (American Urological Association) symptom index score ? 8 and ? 24 at study entry who were treated with SP at single, double, and triple usual dose or placebo (P). Assessments were made at baseline and at 24, 48 and 72 weeks after randomization. These included questions about how the participant felt about his urinary function. We used multivariate ordinal logistic regression to assess the effects of changes in AUA Symptom Index score, quality of life (QOL), and BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) Index Score, age, and randomized treatment assignment on the participants perceptions of their urinary function.
RESULTS: Improvement of AUA Symptom Index Score, QOL, and BPH Index Score were associated with subjects perceptions of better urinary function from baseline to weeks 24, 48 and 72 (Table, change at 24 weeks shown). Older age at enrollment was associated with more negative perceptions about the participants urinary function. Randomized treatment assignment was not associated with these perceptions. Conclusion: The main determinants of improved perception of urinary function seen in the CAMUS study were improvements in AUA Symptom Index Score, BPH Index, and QOL. Older age was marginally associated with poor perception after adjusting for these other factors. Treatment with saw palmetto was not associated with better perceptions about their urinary function.

COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT FOR ELIGIBILITY IN A 1-YEAR-LONG OPHTHALMIC CLINICAL TRIAL INVESTIGATING EYE DROPSTalat Almukhtar for the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network
Jaeb Center for Health Research, Tampa, FL.
Purpose To present an objective and relatively straightforward method of assessing compliance in a randomized clinical trial using eye drops.
Background Achieving good compliance is of crucial importance to success of clinical trials. Various methods have been used to assess compliance with eye drops in ophthalmic studies. Subjective methods, such as patient questionnaires or diaries, are prone to bias. Objective methods like digital monitoring devices require additional resources and logistics to implement.
Design The topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for non-central diabetic macular edema study is a 1-year phase II randomized trial evaluating effects of 3-times daily nepafenac 0.01% drops compared with placebo. In an attempt to minimize the number of poorly-compliant participants randomized, a run-in phase for 30-60 days prior to randomization was implemented to assess compliance. At the end of the run-in phase only participants who achieved 80% or more compliance were randomized (provided other eligibility criteria were met).
Each study bottle was weighed using a calibrated sensitive scale prior to dispensing to participants, and at each follow-up visit after use. Since the length of the run-in phase will vary, a database of expected bottle weight after each required dose was created. A compliance formula that takes the following into consideration was defined: expected initial bottle weight, expected follow-up weight, observed initial bottle weight, observed follow-up weight. Based on previous reports, 80% was chosen as the compliance threshold below which participants would not be eligible for randomization.
This approach has many limitations; for example, weight change may not necessarily reflect the proper dosage or installation timing of drops. Furthermore, short-term compliance may not necessarily translate into long-term compliance.
Conclusion Compliance with study drops poses challenges in ophthalmic clinical trials. We present an objective and relatively easy method to evaluate compliance that may help exclude potentially non-compliant participants.

STRATEGIES IMPLEMENTED TO ENSURE DATA ACCURACY FOR FINAL ANALYSIS

Toronto, Ontario, Canada
The Twin Birth Study (TBS) is an international multicentre randomised controlled trial that recruited 2804 patients from 106 centres in 27 countries. TBS seeks to determine, in women expecting twins, whether a policy of planned Caesarean section decreases the likelihood of perinatal or neonatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity, compared to a policy of planned vaginal birth. Recruitment for the trial ended in April 2011 and the final analysis is scheduled to be completed by January 2012.
In order to prepare for the final analysis and answer this important research question, an intensive process of cleaning the data began. In May 2011, specific processes were implemented to facilitate the data cleaning. All the raw data was extracted from the database and multiple reports were compiled to ensure that all missing answers had been queried. In addition, multiple data reviews were scheduled, to analyse the data by the allocated groups according to the analysis tables. Outliers and missing variables were reviewed, and centres were asked to confirm or correct their responses. To keep centres informed of the status of their data, a Complete and Clean report listing the percentage of data forms returned and queries resolved were emailed to each centre. An Overdue Primary Queries report was sent monthly to the centres listing the queries that were still outstanding. These strategies led to TBS achieving 99.6% clean data for the final analysis, as of November 30, 2011.
This presentation will share data cleaning strategies implemented by TBS to ensure data accuracy for the final analysis.

INTEGRATION OF DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR LARGE INTERNATIONAL RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALSMichael X. Shi, Johanna Sanchez, Elizabeth AsztalosSunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada
The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research (CMICR) is the coordinating centre for several large, international randomised controlled trials (RCTs). To streamline data collection in the clinical trials, a web-based Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system was acquired and implemented. To facilitate the operational side of clinical trials, CMICR has been developing in-house data management systems, including a clinical trial management system (CTMS), an interactive web response randomisation system (IWRS), and a drug supply management system (DSMS).
One of the biggest challenges of leveraging the new EDC technology is having it be able to interchange and integrate data with CTMS, IWRS, DSMS and other technologies being used in the studies. Data integration is vital for large RCTs because of the volume of data generated. The integrated data provide a more comprehensive overview of trial progress, allow a closer monitoring of recruitment and data collection, improve trial analysis and allow for better-informed decisions across the variety of tools and sources of information. From a data-handling perspective, integration reduces redundancies and improves data consistency and quality through less human interaction.
This presentation will discuss the design and implementation of the system integration and data exchange between the different management systems. It will describe and demonstrate the use of the interfacing approach that allows the flexibility and scalability to incorporate new components into data management systems.

Data Capture (EDC) system to collect study data on electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs).The EDC system has a summary screen that displays the status of each eCRF. Each eCRF has a scheduled timeframe for when it should be completed, and those completed outside the timeframe are considered overdue or invalid if completed too early. The EDC summary screen does not display the date when the eCRF was completed. To view the eCRF completion date, the user must go through the time-consuming task of opening each eCRF. The date is then manually entered into a standalone Access database to track the completion status each eCRF. This method can be both labor intensive and error-prone. Therefore, a method to accurately and efficiently track each eCRF completion date was needed.
A solution to this problem was to develop a process to automate the transfer of data from the EDC system to the Access database. The process involved downloading the data from the remote EDC system to a local copy of the EDC database, on weekly basis. This local database was then directly linked to the Access database, allowing the data to by automatically transferred. This allowed the eCRF completion date to be automatically entered while also eliminating the potential security risk of directly linking the EDC system to the Access database.
The introduction of this new process has eliminated the need to manually enter the date into the Access database. It has increased efficiency at the coordinating centre by ensuring that accurate records of the eCRF completion date are being kept, ultimately allowing for more effective data management.

The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study is a Phase 3, multi- center randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to compare a moderate-intensity physical activity program to a successful aging health education program in 1,600 sedentary older persons, age 70-89 years, across eight field centers. The primary outcome is major mobility disability, defined as the inability to walk 400 meters. Secondary and tertiary outcomes include serious fall injuries, pulmonary events, and cardiovascular events. Given the number of participants and their age range, we expect to collect data on many outcomes throughout the length of the trial. These outcomes require central adjudication. The need for a central tracking and monitoring system initiated the construction of the Outcomes Management Tool (OMT) Adjudication System.
While the OMT manages and tracks outcomes, it also supports central adjudication of those outcomes. The Adjudication System is an online system which tracks adjudicator assignments, allows medical records to be reviewed online, allows voting by assigned adjudication committee members, and allows tracking of full committee votes. Administrators at the Data Management and Quality Control (DMAQC) Center also have the ability to assign specific cases to adjudicators on a predetermined date and assign the full committee access to the case, if required.
The final adjudication of the LIFE outcomes is made by the central adjudication committee based on satisfaction of diagnostic criteria delineated in adjudication report forms. The electronic access allows adjudicators the freedom to review records online, communicate with administrators, and vote without being tied to a stack of papers.
This presentation will highlight the flow and functions of the Adjudication System within the Outcome Management Tool.

expectation that few drug shipments will be performed during the study. When the study drug(s) has short expiration dates, is in short supply, is expensive to manufacture, or accrual rates are difficult to predict, careful monitoring of sites inventory is necessary to avoid study drug shortage or wastage. As the Coordinating Center (CC) of two studies with some or all of these features, we integrated a utility for managing drug inventory into the enrollment module of our electronic data capture (EDC) system.
In both studies, a master treatment table (MTT) houses the sequence in which treatments are assigned and a kit inventory table (KIT) houses the kit numbers, their corresponding treatment group and availability status. An EDC user interface allows the CC to request the number of drug kits to be shipped to a site. An email requesting shipment of drug is automatically sent to the drug supplier. As shipments occur, the KIT is updated to indicate that requested kits have been allocated to a particular site and are available for randomization. As randomization occurs, the enrollment module accesses the drug utility tables to provide the appropriate blinded treatment assignment to the enrolling site.
An additional feature of the utility for the second study is an automated nightly process in which site inventory levels and expiration dates are monitored and when pre-defined thresholds are crossed, a shipment request is emailed to the drug supplier.
The benefits and risks of implementing a complex drug utility within an EDC deployment will be discussed, along with the technical challenges, role of the drug supplier and necessary elements to make it successful.

The BID Pilot Study is the test phase of a randomized clinical trial comparing effects of two levels of blood pressure control. Sixteen dialysis units at 5 participating sites will participate. This study is funded jointly by NIH/NIDDK via R01 and the non-profit Dialysis Corporation Inc.
Because the studys protocol requires standardized blood pressure measurements and data acquisition by distributed data entry, trial leadership determined that face to face training was required before patient enrollment could begin. Minimal funding was available. Starting the training session at 11 am near an OHare airport saved money on air fare, let most attendees find direct flights, and allowed same-day fly in.
Since the coordinators attending training needed to learn standardized blood pressure measurement, ABPM, and calibration of the machines used for both types of measures, staff needed to bring multiple pieces of equipment.
Planning training for data entry was challenging. BID Coordinators use the internet to access Oracle forms housed in an Oracle 10g database at the DCC. A location with strong and reliable but inexpensive wireless in the meeting room was required.
Each coordinator needed a laptop computer with java installed. The system did not support Apple Macintosh computers. Because several coordinators did not have laptops, we brought loaners from the DCC.
The training session, held in October 2011, successfully trained staff in blood pressure measurement, equipment calibration and on- line data entry and data discrepancy resolution. Only two glitches occurred: 1) the team could not find a soda can needed for a calibration procedure and 2) one coordinator brought a laptop running Windows Vista and had to use a DCC staffers 10-inch netbook. The training session was judged to be cost- effective and highly successful. Patient enrollment began in November 2011.

BID is the pilot for an RCT comparing two levels of blood pressure control. Sixteen dialysis units at five sites began enrollment in November 2011, collecting extensive data on safety, feasibility, and optimal use of four blood pressure estimates (dialysis machine, standardized, home, and ambulatory blood pressure measurement). Efficiently integrating data from disparate sources maximizes data quality and minimizes cost.
Patients are identified by ID and a random alpha code, and the DCC is blinded to patient names. Site study coordinators enter blood pressure data, oral medications, dialysis details and other clinical information via Oracle forms to the Oracle 10g database at the DCC. Central MRI personnel similarly enter cardiac MRI results. Extensive edit checks are applied at the data entry level.
BID is funded by NIH/NIDDK and Not for Profit Dialysis Clinic, Inc. (DCI), facilitating access to laboratory, dialysis dose, and injectable medication data stored by DCI ID in DCIs Nashville medical information system DARWIN. As patients enroll, participating sites securely notify the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) staff, who then securely provides the DARWIN database team a link between DCI ID and the BID ID and alpha code. Once a month, each BID patients new data are securely transmitted to Cleveland for batch loading into the DCC database.
Data files from ABPM devices are securely transmitted from participating sites to the CCC, where data are cleaned, formatted, and then securely transmitted to Cleveland for batch loading into the DCC database.
These batch loading processes save coordinators time and motion and increase data quality since coordinators do not need to enter data that was previously machine-generated and stored.
The DCC emails weekly reports to Steering Committee members and participating sites showing the status of missed visits, missing forms, missing data, and discrepant data. Thus, data acquisition is continually monitored.

THE ITALIAN REGISTER FOR CLINICAL TRIALS; THE UNIQUE E-ACCESS FOR REGULATORY, SUBMISSION AND MANAGEMENT OF CLINICAL TRIALS
Carlo Tomino
Italian Medicines Agency Via del Tritone 181 Rome, Italy
In accordance with the provisions of the national legislation issued in 2007, the National Monitoring Centre for Clinical Trials - OsSC (http://ricerca- clinica.agenziafarmaco.it/en/node/22 ) supervised by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) has become a legally binding tool for applicants who wish to submit a clinical trial application to the Regulatory Authority and the Ethics Committee. Within 2012 a switch over from paper to electronic submission is expected. A Telematics Implementation Group (TIG) chaired by AIFA has been set up in 2008. In the TIG are represented Ethics Committees, National Regulatory Authorities, sponsors (both commercial and non commercial) and CROs. The TIG has the mandate of defining user requirements with respect to e-submission; validate software development through user acceptance testing; actively participate in the pilot phase of the project; provide support to AIFA initiatives to promote harmonization and guidelines in compliance with the EU legislation. The user requirements and technical specifications of the single portal have been agreed and the software development and testing is on-going (Beta-version). Within 2011 a pilot phase with the participation of the TIG delegates has been completed. Either the initial clinical trial application and the substantial amendment module of the single portal are being extensively tested in terms of functionality, reliability and performance. The new portal is expected to be launched in early 2012 with the ultimate aim of reducing bureaucracy, harmonize

AN EFFICIENT AND INEXPENSIVE SYSTEM FOR THE DISTRIBUTION AND TRACKING OF INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS IN CLINICAL TRIALSPatrick G. McDonnell, Thomas M. MacDonald, Isla S. Mackenzie, Robert Flynn Medicines Monitoring Unit (MEMO), University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom
Purpose: The efficient distribution and tracking of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) and Non-Investigational Medicinal Product (NIMP) in clinical trials confers certain legal requirements together with meticulous record- keeping. Manual systems that update a paper record each time a product shipment arrives, is supplied to a study participant, or is returned for reconciliation and destruction are time consuming, prone to errors and expensive. Implementing a system whereby records are maintained electronically and updated automatically can reduce costs whilst improving record-keeping.
Methods: We examined state-of-the-art in pharmacy systems and concluded that a barcode-based product tracking system was the most practical solution. Each IMP and NIMP are bar-coded and products are tracked from arrival at the dispensary storage facility, supplied to patients, unused drugs returned with tablet counts and destruction records. The system is integrated into the electronic Clinical Report Form (eCRF) and study web portal from which regimen changes can be made. The system also produces bespoke medication labels, Patient Information Leaflets (PILs), and other paperwork, both in English and other languages to be dispatched to patients. Packages are also bar-coded to facilitate identification. Technicians assemble distribution packs in one work-stream and then check packs in another work-stream to reduce errors.
Results: We have built an inexpensive, robust and legally-compliant system of managing supply of medication to study participants. The system is currently being used in one large multi-national multi-centre study with a complex IMP and NIMP regimen.
Conclusions: We have produced a semi-automated system for drug distribution that we predict will reduce cost, errors, provide a robust audit trail and improve the quality and efficiency of drug supply in the clinical trial setting.

GYNECOLGIC ONCOLOGY GROUP (GOG): MAKING A WEB-BASED CARDIFF TELEFORM GENERATED PDF PATIENT CLINICAL REPORTING FORM DYNAMIC WITH THE USE OF ADOBE FDF FILES
Karen Puehn, Quang Le, Susan Klier, Bill Elgie
GOG Statistical and Data Center Buffalo, NY USA
Gynecologic Oncology Group Statistical & Data Center, Buffalo, New York The GOG Statistical and Data Center (SDC) developed the SDC Electronic Data Entry System (SEDES) to capture clinical data electronically via a secure website. Over 800 sites have used SEDES to enter and amend over 500,000 electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs). One of the foundations of this dynamic database driven application is the use of proprietary Adobe Forms Data Format (FDF) files to programmatically manipulate the Adobe Acroform pdf web-based eCRFs created with Cardiff Teleform software. FDF files can be used to import data into a pdf form. The SDC chose to use static FDF files created and stored on the server to import patient database data into eCRFs stored on the server. These FDF files contain the eCRFs form field names and values to be imported as well as the web link to the pdf form. A patient registered to a GOG Protocol has a set of study specific expectations assigned and accessible as links in an electronic Patient Form Schedule available via SEDES. Clicking on an eCRF link generates a FDF file on the server for that patient and form type which in turn automatically opens the semi-prefilled eCRF allowing the user to complete and submit the data for processing and storage. The FDF file minimally consists of data needed to prefill the form header with patient study identifier, todays date and web account username. Upon submission, data are immediately available for use through the same process via a FDF file generated from the submitted data prefilling the eCRF for updating.

EOSINOPHILIA AS A POTENTIAL SURROGATE FOR DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS OF STRONGYLOIDIASIS IN AN IMMIGRANT POPULATION AT A COMMUNITY CLINIC Kathryn E. Spates 1, Nicole C. Holland 2, Amara G. Pabon 3, JeanAnne M. Ware 4,

Determining the cause of persistent eosinophilia in immigrants to the United States can be hampered by costs needed to evaluate suspected parasitic infections. Thus, diagnosing eosinophilia- causing helminth infections by stool examination or serology is often beyond the means of community health clinics that commonly serve immigrant populations. To define the causes of persistent eosinophilia among an immigrant population seen at a single community free health clinic, 41 patients (originally from Central and South America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East) -- who arrived in the United States 1-27 years (median 7 years) previously--were found to have an absolute eosinophil count (AEC) >500/uL and were referred to the National Institutes of Health for further testing. Of the 41 referred patients, 33 (80.4%) had positive Strongyloides stercoralis-specific serology. Nine of these 33 (27%) also had schistosomiasis (n=6) or hook-worm (n=3) infection. Although there was no statistical difference (p=0.15) in the baseline eosinophil levels between those with strongyloidiasis and those without, serum IgE levels differed dramatically between the two groups (geometric mean levels 74 U/ml vs. 566 IU/ml, p<0.01). Interestingly, 16/33 (48.7%) Strongyloides positive patients had an AEC greater than 1000/uL during screening, whereas only 2/8 (25%) without Strongyloides had eosinophil levels that exceeded 1000/uL. All 33 patients with a definitive parasitologic diagnosis received ivermectin and (when appropriate praziquantel and/or albendazole) treatment; 11 have been evaluated one-year post treatment. Not unexpectedly, there was a dramatic and significant (p<0.01) decrease in AEC following treatment, with all returning to normal levels. IgE levels also fell dramatically following treatment. Thus, in community clinics that provide health care to immigrants well after arrival in the United States, an AEC can be used as a surrogate for stool examination and serology and may be a trigger for empiric treatment when testing is limited by cost.

POSTING STUDY RESULTS TO CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: EFFECTIVE TOOLS AND LESSONS LEARNED Elizabeth Paynter, Heather Kopetskie, Gary Johnson
Rho, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA
The Food and Drug Administration requires most clinical trials to post results to ClinicalTrials.gov within one year after completion of data collection for the studys primary endpoint measure. The studys sponsor is responsible for posting results to ClinicalTrials.gov, however the statistical and data coordinating center at Rho has been employed to help with this process. Novice users may find the system difficult to navigate. Often users are unsure of what information is required or allowable. Additionally, many study teams want to review and approve results before they are posted. In an effort to help both the person posting results and the reviewer(s), Rho created a fill-able Word template. This template provides instruction and structure for the person posting results. The template also informs the user of character limits, possible selections, what information is required versus optional, and guidance on typical entries. For the reviewer(s), the template provides a means to see the results without having to be given login-access to ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, the reviewer can see the system limitations and what options are available, which can aide in constructive feedback. Part of posting study results to ClinicalTrials.gov is to post adverse events. Hand-entering adverse events for most trials can be a tedious task. ClinicalTrials.gov allows results to be uploaded in a prescribed XML format. Software developers at Rho created a program that will take a SAS data table and convert it into an XML file that is compatible with the structure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov. Once study results are released to ClinicalTrials.gov, the website staff review study entries and provide feedback and suggestions. During this process we have modified our tools to better meet those expectations. From the lessons learned

CHANGING DIRECTIONS IN THE ANTIHYPERTENSIVE AND LIPID-LOWERING TREATMENT TO PREVENT HEART ATTACK TRIAL INVOLVING OUTSIDE INVESTIGATORS IN MANUSCRIPT
PREPARATION AND ANCILLARY STUDIES
Sara L. Pressel, Barry R. Davis, Linda B. Piller, Lara M. Simpson, Charles E. Ford, Jose-Miguel Yamal, Ellen Breckenridge, Jeffrey L. ProbstfieldUniversity of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, Texas
The leadership of most clinical trials, including the Antihypertensive and Lipid- Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), facilitate manuscripts and ancillary studies by investigators within the study. To enable data use by outside investigators, studies sponsored by the National Institutes of Health provide a limited-access public use data set, and ALLHAT has done this. Additionally, ALLHAT policies allowed outside investigators to submit data requests directly, but limited the releases to those data that were already publicly available or not being pursued by its investigators.
To facilitate and encourage use of ALLHATs dataset by outside investigators, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has funded a new phase entitled ALLHAT Continuation and Outreach. Its purposes are to:
(1) develop processes that assure optimal scientific contributions, build on to- date publications and explore new areas, in part through involving appropriate consultants as leaders of relevant scientific areas; (2) encourage productive interdisciplinary collaboration and mentor early-stage investigators from a diverse set of institutions, especially investigators with no recent history of participating in ALLHAT; and (3) promote awareness of the ALLHAT resources among research and clinical communities.
This represents a change in direction for ALLHAT. Previous ALLHAT policies protected the interests of study investigators and reserved most Coordinating Center resources for study investigators. ALLHATs new phase will widen participation in paper- writing and ancillary studies to investigators within and outside of ALLHAT. It also represents a new approach among clinical trials. While several epidemiologic studies have successfully adopted such an approach, ALLHAT will be the first clinical trial to do this.
Additional details of the rationale for ALLHATs new phase will be discussed, as well as details of the new study governance structure and the Engagement Plan, which provides guidance for achieving the above aims.

THE GLOBAL OBSTETRICS NETWORK (GONET): AN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE GROUP Elizabeth Thom and Ben Willem Mol for the Global Obstetrics Network
Rockville, Maryland, USA Amsterdam, The Netherlands
Background: Multiple groups conduct national and international clinical trials in obstetrics. The rarity of the most compelling outcomes, such as maternal or neonatal death and childhood disability, at least in developed countries, has led to the use of less compelling outcomes and/or lower power. Meta-analyses are often employed in this field but these are challenging when different definitions of outcomes are used or different data fields collected. In addition, trials have been unwittingly duplicated, leading to a poor use of global resources. For example, seven large overlapping trials of antioxidants to prevent preeclampsia were conducted all were negative. The process of setting up an international collaboration to address these issues is described.
Methods: In 2010, investigators representing different study groups met for the first time, and formed a core group who defined the goals of the collaboration. These include developing a database of ongoing and planned trials, harmonizing obstetrical terms and definitions, defining common endpoints, coordinating study protocols to facilitate meta-analyses, setting up an education program on trial design and performance, establishing priority areas for future trials, and obtaining funding to support all activities including international collaborative trials. All clinical researchers are invited to participate, especially researchers from resource poor countries.

ESTIMATING DEATH RATES IN SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CLINICAL TRIALS Lindblad, Robert; Hu, Lian; Campanella, Maria; Kondapaka, Radhika; Rosa, Carmen;
Allen, Colleen; Van Veldhuisen, Paul
Rockville, MD USA Bethesda, MD USA
Interpreting results of safety reporting in substance use disorder (SUD) clinical trials is difficult when the baseline rate of serious events like deaths in this population is not well described. Particularly for Data and Safety Monitoring Board reviews, defining a threshold event rate could provide guidance to recognize increased risk in a given clinical trial. Often, the reported number of deaths in any given trial is too small to characterize this issue. National death rates by age and gender are publically available and provide a baseline. Since 1999, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trial Network (CTN) has posted 21 SUD pharmacologic and/or psychosocial intervention clinical trials spanning various SUD populations to the CTN public data share. Protocols and safety data from these completed trials were reviewed. A total of 61 deaths (0.6%) were identified from adverse event reports across 9,396 enrolled participants (5,543 male, 3,844 female, 9 unknown). The overall death rate in the CTN SUD clinical trials was 14.4 deaths per 1,000 person years (PY), and was numerically higher in females (17.1 per 1,000 PY) than males (12.1 per 1,000 PY). By age, the highest death rate was observed in the 25-34 year olds (17.6 per 1,000 PY). These death rates are numerically higher when compared with age- and gender- specific rates to the national death rate information and likely represent underlying social issues surrounding SUD populations, particularly in women, and likely are not attributable to clinical trial participation. Estimating death rates within types of substance use disorders may further contribute to the understanding of underlying risks in SUD populations

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ANALYSIS OF PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL DATA Imogene Grimes Janet WittesOtsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commericalization, Inc.; Rockville, MD, USA
Progression- free survival (PFS) is a composite endpoint incorporating the time to either death or progression, with varying definitions of progression. Time to death is a continuous variable where death occurs at random times, and the date of death is known specifically. Time to progression is, strictly speaking, an interval measure, as the date of progression is unknown so the time to progression is not precisely known. When the assessment of progression is made, a patient is classified as having progressed or not having progressed, but the time of progression is unknown. In our experience in oncology, the most common statistical methods for PFS include a graphical display of a Kaplan-Meier curve and analysis using a logrank test or a Wilcoxon test with some type of accommodation for censoring (usually). When PFS in the particular dataset is composed mostly of time to death (as a continuous measure) and time to progression (not measured continuously), these analysis methods perform well. When, however, PFS is dominated by time to progression, and when the assessment times are infrequent, the Kaplan-Meier graph resembles a step function, and these analysis methods may be far from optimal. A life-table extension of the Mantel-Haenszel test may perform better, and Cutler-Ederer estimates for interval data may describe the data more accurately. This paper presents a discussion of the appropriateness of the analytical methods for PFS with examples of comparisons from PFS datasets.

A STUDY OF AUTOLOGOUS VALVE REPLACEMENT - CD133+ STEM CELL-PLUS-FIBRIN COMPOSITE BASED SPRAYED CELL SEEDING FOR INTRA-OPERATIVE HEART
VALVE TISSUE ENGINEERING
Aenne Glass, Guenther KundtInstitute for Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research IBIMA,
University of Rostock (Germany)
Objective The development of biological valve prostheses with lifetime native-like performance and optimal host engraftment is a goal of heart valve tissue-engineering. We describe a new concept for autologous graft coating based on a CD133+-stem-cells-plus-fibrin-complex (SC+F) processed from bone marrow and peripheral blood of one and the same patient. Methods CD133+-SC (1x106cells/ml) from human bone marrow and autologous fibrin (20mg/ml) were administered simultaneously via spray administration. During static cultivation, SC+F performance was monitored about 20 days after delivery and compared to controls. For dynamic testing SC+F-composite was sprayed on a decellularized porcine pulmonary valve and transferred to a bioreactor under pulsatile flow conditions for 7 days. Quantitative analysis of the data is given for experimental group containing fibrin and control group without fibrin, respectively. Because measurements were made several times within three independent groups we applied the GLM Repeated Measures procedure for statistical analysis to test the null hypotheses about the effects of both the between-subject factor (group) and the within-subject factor (time). For the endothelial differentiation parameters during endothelial colony forming assay differences between day 0 and day 28 were investigated, using paired t test or Wilcoxons rank test, as appropriate. Test selection was based on evaluation of differences for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Results Static cultivation of SC+F-composite induced significant improvements in stem cell proliferation as compared to controls. For dynamic testing, microscopic analyses on a smooth engineered heart valve surface detected homogenous distribution of stem cells. Ultrasonic analysis executed native-like valve performance. Applied CD133+ stem cells differentiated into endothelial-like cells positive for CD31 and VEGF Receptor 2 and engrafted the valve. However, occasional delamination was observed. Conclusion SC+F serves as an excellent autologous matrix for intra-operative tissue-engineering of valve protheses promising optimal in-vivo integration. However, stability remains an issue.

CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FOR DIFFERENCE OF CORRELATED PROPORTIONS
BASED ON PAIRED AND UNPAIRED DATA
Jiajun Liu; Yue Shentu; Yabing Mai;
Merck Research Laboratories Rahway, NJ, 07065, USA
In clinical trials, paired binary data often arise from crossover study design or pre-test/post- test comparisons. Missing data due to drop- outs and other reasons may lead to incomplete paired binary data for a subgroup of subjects. Interval estimation for the proportion difference can be problematic in these situations. In this article we propose an extension of the method of variance of estimates recovery (MOVER) to construct confidence intervals (CIs) for the correlated proportion difference based on paired and unpaired data. Two sets of CI estimators, one based on paired data, the other based on pooled paired and unpaired data, are utilized in the double-MOVER procedure to construct the asymptotic CI. Extensive simulations show that the double-MOVER estimator performs well under various degrees of missingness and correlations, even with small to moderate sample sizes. Two real examples of clinical studies are used to demonstrate the proposed method.

viewed as change points. However, when there are too many steps, over-fitting can occur and further reduction is desirable. Here we propose adaptive partitioning to allow combination of small steps which do not differ greatly. In this approach, a second step, the reducing step, is integrated into the usual monotonic step building by appropriate statistical testing of the adjacent steps. Adjacent steps not significantly different at a pre-specified alpha level are combined. We achieve this through a modified dynamic programming algorithm. Two popular parametric survival distributions, exponential and its extension Weibull, are implemented first. Then we explored a more robust piece- wise exponential distribution, which is less stringent in model assumptions and the model can potentially be used in interval censored survival data. We apply this methodology to the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) data set to study the relationship between HbA1C and the time to a severe hypoglycemia event. All three approaches are used and the results compared. The models are very similar to each other and all suggest a negative non- linear association between HbA1C and time to severe hypoglycemia. When the alpha level is set at a modest level (for example, 0.05), HbA1C at 6.2, 7.3 and 9.6 are identified as the potential change points in its association with severe hypoglycemia.

SAS ENTERPRISE GUIDE AND GRAPHICS IN CLINICAL TRIALS Levent Bayman, Jon Yankey, Chris Coffey, William Clarke
Clinical Trials Statistical and Data Management Center,
Department of Biostatistics, University of Iowa
Sometimes one picture is worth one thousand words, especially in the scientific community. Coding and managing SAS Graphics is difficult even for experienced SAS programmers. It is common to use other software to visually represent data even though the analyses were performed using SAS. Enterprise Guide, a newer facility within SAS, has emerged as a remedy to these problems and creates automated and/or semiautomated graphical displays via a point and click user interface with minimal or no coding required on the users part. More importantly, the produced graphics are of high quality and SAS statements that produced the graphs are automatically generated. This added flexibility allows the user to modify the code if needed or to incorporate it into existing SAS programs. This presentation will first investigate traditional SAS coding used to generate graphics. Second, step-by-step instructions will be provided to obtain the same (and even better) graphics by using Enterprise Guides built-in graph facility. Finally, use of the Enterprise Guide applications in the University of Iowa Clinical Trials Statistical and Data Management Center to accelerate producing graphics will be discussed.

METHODS FOR CALCULATING VARIABILITY OF THE INCREMENTAL
COST EFFECTIVENESS RATIO IN COST-EFFECTIVENESS STUDIESNicole Foster, Michele Melia for the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) Jaeb Center for Health Research Tampa, FL, USA
Cost-effectiveness is an important method for gauging the impact of one health care strategy over another. Cost-effectiveness is defined by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), that is, the difference in cost of the two strategies divided by the difference in the effect of interest. Because the ICER is a ratio of two random variables, its sampling distribution cannot be easily derived, and quantification of the uncertainty in ICER estimates can be problematic. Recommended procedures for calculation of a confidence interval on the ICER can only be applied in the case where there is a significant difference in both cost and effect. The bootstrap method of sampling with replacement is a relatively straightforward and popular approach for estimating uncertainty in the ICER, but it has been criticized for giving overly narrow confidence regions and involving many unstated assumptions. The purpose of this presentation is to explore methods for calculating and displaying the variability of the ICER using data from a recently completed clinical trial conducted by the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) to illustrate the methods.

Background: The primary efficacy study for a vaccine to prevent herpes zoster (HZ) and its complications followed subjects for a median of 3.1 years post-vaccination and analyses of vaccine durability showed that the vaccine was effective for four-years post-vaccination. Of interest is the assessment of how long the zoster vaccine remains effective against HZ. Extended follow-up of study subjects was carried out in one substudy (3.3 to 7.8 years post-vaccination), but once placebo subjects were vaccinated, there was no longer a concurrent control group for direct estimation of vaccine efficacy.
Objectives: A method for determining historical control rates for long-term follow-up study was needed in order to provide estimates of long-term efficacy for the three study outcomes: burden of illness due to HZ associated pain or discomfort; incidence of HZ; and incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).
Methods: The extended follow-up protocol initially planned to use historical controls adjusted for increasing age of the study population. However, the final analysis of the primary efficacy study showed that the incidence of HZ in placebo recipients increased over the study duration even after the adjustment for increasing age. Poisson regression methodology was used to develop and select models to estimate the age and calendar time effects. Age and calendar time adjusted controls were then calculated by multiplying the model-based estimates times the number of person-years of follow-up observed for each age year in the long-term follow-up of vaccinated subjects (4.7 to 11.6 years post-vaccination).
Results: Models selected for calculating the historical controls for the incidence of HZ included effects for both age and study (calendar) time, while models for outcomes related to severity of HZ only included age. Methods for assessing age and calendar time effects, for model selection, for the calculation of controls and for calculating vaccine effectiveness will be presented.

SAMPLING CONSIDERATIONS FOR GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL POLYMORPHISMS REGISTRY (EPR)
Lindsey A. Ho and Patrick W. CrockettSRA International, Inc., Durham, North Carolina, USA
The Environmental Polymorphisms Registry (EPR) of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) was established as a recruit-by-genotype resource which houses a databank of DNA linked to participants who may be recontacted for phenotype information. The EPR is designed to screen for functionally significant polymorphisms by identifying individuals with shared genotypes at candidate genes and then recontacting them for phenotype information that can be used for genetic association testing. We show that sufficient power is obtained by equally sampling few numbers of individuals per genotype group. For example, assuming a 25% change in TNF-alpha release between each genotype group (and a standard deviation of 200 units), we calculated 89% power by including a total of 12 subjects (4 per genotype group). In contrast, if we randomly sampled subjects and measured both their continuous phenotypes and genotypes using the same distributional assumptions and mode-of-inheritance, a rare susceptibility allele of 2% would require 166 subjects to achieve similar power, a substantial increase in the number of subjects as compared to the EPR approach. This suggests that contrasting equal numbers of homozygotes dramatically improves power for less common alleles as opposed to sampling genotypes at random. We note that there is no need to include heterozygotes if investigators seek only to test the presence of an effect, rather than including this group to distinguish among inheritance models.

When inclusion/exclusion criteria are considered during protocol development for a clinical trial, previous study experience is routinely considered exclusionary only if a previous drug or intervention is likely to have a direct effect on the intervention under study. However, patients who have participated previously in a research study may respond differently to an intervention compared to new participants, even when the interventions are not similar. We examined data from the National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study (NCICAS) and the Inner-City Anti-IgE Therapy for Asthma (ICATA) Study to assess the impact of previous research experience on the response to the intervention.
The NCICAS Phase II study enrolled 1033 participants, 457 (44%) of whom were recruited from NCICAS Phase I, a 12-month observational study designed to identify risk factors for asthma morbidity. The ICATA Study enrolled 419 participants, 39 (9%) of whom were previously enrolled in the Asthma Control Evaluation (ACE) Study, a trial that used measurement of exhaled nitric oxide as an adjunct to clinical care in the intervention group. In both studies, the intervention was more effective in the study-nave population compared to the study-experienced population. In NCICAS II, there was a strong intervention effect for the study-nave population and the experience-by-intervention interaction was statistically significant. The results of ICATA were consistent with NCICAS and showed a significant decrease in asthma symptom days for the study-nave participants in contrast to study-experienced participants, but the interaction term was non-significant.
In both NCICAS and ICATA, study-nave participants responded more favorably to the intervention than study-experienced participants. These study-experienced participants began the second study with a lower level of symptoms, which may reflect better asthma management learned during the previous study. Researchers should consider the effect of prior study experience even when it is not directly related to the current intervention.

RESULTS OF REMOTE MONITORING TECHNIQUES FOR MULTI-CENTER
OPHTHALMIC IMAGING TRIALS Dana AH KeaneOptos, Inc. Marborough, MA, USA
Background: Imaging in clinical trials has become more important than ever to help predict treatment outcomes, monitor disease progress and document treatment effectiveness. With the ever-present need for shorter, more cost effective trials quality assurance in imaging is an essential component of ensuring trial success. It is generally recognized that the implementation of digital imaging systems and cloud computing may be improve remote imaging methods, but data is limited.
Purpose: To report on remote monitoring techniques use to ensure protocol adherence and high image quality in a study where quantification of small peripheral retinal changes was the key endpoint.
Methods: This trial is an ancillary imaging study to a large multi-center randomized interventional trial for Age-related Macular Degeneration. Images were obtained using a widefield imaging system in which peripheral changes were to be observed and quantified. The primary aim of monitoring was to ensure each site was obtaining full field images taken in the appropriate sequence for evaluation. Images were submitted remotely to the reading center for evaluation and mirrored to the sponsor for monitoring purposes. Images were reviewed by the sponsor on a weekly basis and feedback to the site occurred immediately. If issues arose with image quality a monitor was dispatched to the site for a traditional site visit.
Results: Trial is ongoing however the average amount of retakes requested has been reduced by 30% with a reduction in site visits by 50%. Prior trials relied on on-site monitoring visits in 8 week intervals. Monitors would review study image databases and request reimaging as well as re-train imagers if necessary. This often led to delays in assessing quality issues and required more recall visits for reimaging. Monitoring in this trial allowed for more swift feedback to be given to sites thus reducing reimaging requests and technical failures.

Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Sydney, NSW 2065, Australia
Introduction: Excessive protocol violations (PVs), defined as preventable mistakes in study conduct, may result in patient harm and may dilute statistical power.
PVs are more likely to occur early during trial conduct, while research staff are still learning the trial protocol.
Incorporation of interactive workshops into start-up meetings addresses the needs of research staff as adult learners and may lead to improved study conduct.
Purpose: To evaluate the attendees responses towards interactive workshops as part of clinical trial start-up meetings.
Methods: In 2010 we commenced two novel multi- centre clinical trials (Study A and Study B) at 29 sites across Australia and New Zealand. We held five sequential start-up meetings over seven months, each attended by research staff from three to five study sites.
Didactic lectures were followed by interactive group workshops to reinforce new skills and study processes. Both Study A and Study B introduced new study processes however only Study B taught a new skill, which involved a specific technique for measuring QT intervals. At the final start-up meeting for each study, attendees evaluated the interactive workshops.
Results: Study A and Study B: New Study Processes When asked whether the interactive workshops were useful for reinforcing the learning of new study processes, 16/16 (100%) participants responded YES.
Study B: New Skills When asked whether the interactive workshops improved confidence with new skills, 8/8 (100%) participants responded YES. When asked whether the interactive workshops should be held in future meetings if new skills were being taught, 10/10 (100%) participants responded YES.
Conclusions: Interactive workshops provide a protected learning environment for research staff learn new trial protocols prior to enrolling their first patient. Attendees reported improved confidence in the mastery of new skills, which may translate to improved study conduct. Additional research is required in this field.

After clinical trials end, continued follow-up of the assembled cohort is often pursued for additional research. Factors influencing participants decisions to consent to additional follow-up and how these shape post-trial cohorts have not been broadly studied. The WHI Hormone Therapy (WHI HT) clinical trials were designed to assess the impact of two regimens of postmenopausal hormone therapies compared to placebo. Postmenopausal women, 50-79 years of age at initial screening, were eligible for participation. We examine how two re- enrollment campaigns, occurring in 2004-2005 and 2009-2010, and the passage of time altered broad features of the post-trial cohorts compared with the original WHI cohort, which was recruited in 1993-1998. Associations that markers of socio- demography, health, lifestyle and on-trial experiences had with re-enrollment were examined and the characteristics of successive post-trial cohorts were contrasted with those of the original enrollees. The post-trial enrollment campaigns re- enrolled 81.1% and 82.5% of available women, respectively. Women who re- enrolled tended to have better health characteristics than those not re-enrolled. Compared to women of comparable age in the original cohort, women retained for the second post-trial follow-up were less likely to have a history of cardiovascular disease [odds ratio=0.36: 95% confidence interval: 0.32,0.41], hypertension [0.57: 0.54,0.61], diabetes [0.59: 0.54,0.61], or measured cognitive deficit [0.40: 0.26,0.64]. These women were more likely to have graduated from high school [1.72:

1.54,1.92] and to have participated in other WHI trials [1.76: 1.66,1.87]. Although we have examined a single study and cannot clearly generalize how our findings might apply to other cohorts and protocols, these methods may be used to estimate re- enrollment in other studies. Post-trial enrollment can be successful, however the characteristics of the resulting cohort may differ substantially from the originally assembled cohort and it may be important to collect predictors of differential re-enrollment during the original trial to facilitate re-enrollment.

IMPACTING A CLINICAL TRIALS SUCCESS BY INTEGRATING REGULATIONS, STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES INTO ORGANIZATIONAL CULTUREJan Hickey, Mike Sather, Stanley Johnson, Julia Vertrees, Kathy BoardmanDepartment of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center,
Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA
The Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center (Center) is responsible for clinical supplies used in multicenter clinical trials conducted by the CSP. Clinical supplies lay at the core of drug and device trials. They must meet stringent quality standards to ensure patient safety. The integrity of the clinical supplies and the controls on their processing must provide a guarantee that the results of the trial, whether positive or negative, cannot be questioned.
The Center integrates quality regulations, standards and guidelines into all their processes to ensure the integrity of not only the clinical supplies, but all their processes. These regulations, standards and guidelines include:
current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulation 21 CFR 210 and 211 for drugs, Quality System Regulation, 21CFR Part 820 for medical devices, Quality Management System Standard, ISO 9001:2008, Primary Packaging Materials for Medicinal Products Standard, ISO 15378:2007, Organizational Quality processes, Malcolm Baldrige Criteria, and ICH guidelines for Stability testing and other processes.
This poster demonstrates how quality standards and guidelines apply to all processes associated with the clinical supply chain including the typical cGMP regulated product development, manufacturing, laboratory testing, packaging, labeling, distribution, corrective and preventative actions, training and document controls.
But equally important, in addition to using regulations, standards, and guidelines to control the supply chain processes, they also support administrative processes including management responsibilities, planning and design, pharmaceutical project management, budget and finance, treatment assignment, continuous improvement, document control, and study closeout.
The organizational model for the Centers quality management system melds industry standards, quality models and federal regulations into an effective infrastructure, resulting in a high-performing organization that designs and controls all processes to assure the successful conduct of large and small scale clinical trials from design to closeout.

EFFECTIVE PROCESSING AND MONITORING OF CONTRACTS BETWEEN SPONSOR AND COLLABORATIVE CENTRESDalah Mason, Johanna Sanchez, Elizabeth AsztalosThe Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada
The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research (CMICR) designs and conducts investigator-initiated academic multi-centre randomized controlled trials and disseminates the findings in order to improve clinical practice and the health outcomes of women and their children. Currently, CMICR is managing six international and national multi- centre trials.
To ensure the success of these studies, the acquisition of a sufficient number of collaborative centres is critical. CMICR relies on these collaborative centres to recruit patients and collect data concerning these patients, which will be analyzed and reported at the conclusion of the studies. To join a study, potential centres send several documents to CMICR which demonstrate their ability to participate. Among these documents is a contract called the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA/CTA).
Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 450 554 http://ctj.sagepub.com
Abstracts 513
Acting on behalf of each Sponsor-Investigator, CMICR prepares a CSA in the form of a standard template. This template is sent to each potential centre, after which the approval process begins with a legal negotiation and ends with the execution of the agreement. In some negotiations, no revisions are requested and the template is accepted, however, most negotiations require a series of revisions prior to execution. In these cases, efficiency becomes vital because delays can be costly and impact recruitment. The handling of one agreement for one study is straightforward, but when multiple studies and agreements have to be managed, the process becomes complex. To facilitate the process, CMICR 1) prepared a flow chart for guidance, 2) created a filing system for record keeping, and 3) kept a detailed spreadsheet to log and document the steps. This presentation will illustrate an efficient way of handling and monitoring several Clinical Study Agreements for the respective CMICR trials, as centres move from Potential status to becoming Active collaborative centres in a process that is sometimes convoluted.

RESOLVING THE CONFLICT: SPONSOR-INVESTIGATORS AND THE ETHICAL
CONCERN BEHIND THE CONSENT PROCESS
Melissa Brown, Johanna Sanchez, Dalah Mason, Elizabeth AsztalosThe Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre is the sponsoring institution and lead site for several multi-centred clinical trials. As such, investigator-initiated trials are conducted by clinical research teams generally comprised of the Sponsor-Investigator, Site Principal Investigator (PI), and Research Coordinator. As a policy at Sunnybrook, the initial approach for participation in a trial must be made through a member of a patients circle of care. Because of their access to the patients, their knowledge of the question and commitment to the study, Sponsor- Investigators that are clinicians are most suitable for the approach phase of the recruitment process. However, due to ethical standards, their exclusion from the consent process during recruitment is imperative.
The requirements for autonomy and informed consent in research are competence, information, understanding and voluntariness. Due to factors of trust and dependency in a physician-patient relationship, the imposition of undue influence is commonly an area of ethical concern. To avoid this, the inclusion of a Site PI and Research Coordinator to the research team has become vital.
As a task delegated by the Sponsor- Investigator, the Site PI assumes responsibility for the oversight of the consent process, which establishes a chain of command that results in the Coordinator reporting consent to the Site PI instead of the Sponsor-Investigator. This order alters the physician-patient relationship and eliminates any obligation the Coordinator may have to the Sponsor-Investigator, allowing an unbiased approach to potential participants.
The implementation of these precautionary measures assists in building trust between the Coordinator and each participant, which leads to increased study compliance and decreased rates of attrition. Furthermore, they allow the Sponsor-Investigator to continuously drive the study with enthusiasm and commitment without ethical compromise during the consent process.

THE QUALITY OF MEDICAL RECORD ABSTRACTION IN A MULTI-CENTER STUDY: THE IMPORTANCE OF TRAININGNancy Payte, Brenda Brewer, Kathy Clingan, Jennifer Rosenbaum
Westat Rockville, Maryland
The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) is a randomized controlled trial, funded by the National Cancer Institute, to determine whether screening with low-dose helical computed tomography reduces lung cancer mortality relative to screening with conventional chest x- ray in persons at elevated risk of lung cancer. It was comprised of the Lung Screening Study (LSS) and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN). Lung cancer diagnosis, a critical study outcome, relied on data abstracted from medical records. The Coordinating Center (CC) for the LSS was responsible for training and monitoring abstraction at 10 sites.
A medical record abstractor (MRA) training program was developed and implemented by the CC to include centralized initial training, refresher training at annual meetings, quarterly conference calls and individual

training as needed. Training sessions focused on comprehension of specifications and proper completion of MRA forms, and emphasized the responsibility of the abstractor in collecting quality data. Effectiveness of training was assessed during the on-going QA process: central re-abstraction of all primary lung cancer cases and a random sample of positive screens without a lung cancer diagnosis. Over 2000 sets of medical records were reviewed. MRA QA reports monitoring 13 key data elements were compiled quarterly, depicting the number and type of errors. Findings from the QA reports changed during the study. Overall adherence to abstraction specifications and reporting of diagnostic procedures improved over time.
In studies requiring medical record abstraction, it is vital to develop thorough standardized training approaches and to engage in continual abstraction training and monitoring. The use of quarterly QA reports enabled us to focus training efforts on problem areas and to identify individual MRAs and/or sites requiring additional training. We will demonstrate how our on-going training program was an integral part of the MRA process.

Sunnybrook Research Institute,Toronto, ON, Canada
The CHIPS Trial (Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study) is an international multi-centre randomised controlled trial recruiting 1028 women from 100 centres internationally. CHIPS aims to determine whether less tight or tight control of non-proteinuric hypertension will decrease the likelihood of pregnancy loss or high level neonatal care, without increasing serious complications for the mother. A committee of clinicians (representing obstetrics, medicine, and neonatology), masked to treatment, convenes quarterly to review perinatal and maternal outcomes and adjudicate whether or not the outcomes have occurred. As the Trial expects approximately 30% of babies and 2% of mothers to have a serious complications, an efficient adjudication preparation process is required.
To accurately adjudicate the outcomes, it is necessary to review all reported cases with fetal, neonatal, and/ or maternal complications to ensure that case report forms (CRF) have been accurately completed, and the hospital documents received. These cases are assessed in a preliminary review to confirm they meet the relevant trial outcome definition. The following are resolved prior to adjudication: CRF inaccuracies, missing hospital documents, discrepancies between the CRFs and hospital records, and translation of international hospital documents. At the adjudication meeting, all data forms for each case are reviewed along with the corresponding hospital records.
Due to the high volume of outcomes and various steps required for preparation, a Microsoft Access tracking system was developed. Cases requiring adjudication are added to the tracking system, and issues requiring clarifications are recorded. Lists are generated to identify outstanding issues, which are resolved by corresponding with the centre, and subsequently tracked to monitor case progess. Once all issues have been resolved, case identifiers are blocked, an identifying code is assigned, and cases are mailed to the adjudication committee members. The tracking system allows for systematic collection of information resulting in an efficient adjudication preparation process.

of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health. Participants were randomized between the ages of 10-17 and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) less than 2 years at baseline. As the first large national study of this vulnerable population of youth diagnosed with T2D, it was considered important to continue to follow this unique, well-characterized, ethnically diverse cohort in order to understand the persistence of effects of the treatment regimens used in TODAY and the development of vascular complications. The youth are now participating in a post- intervention, prospective follow-up study called TODAY2.
While other studies have undergone the transition from a clinical trial of blinded experimental intervention regimens to a post- intervention follow-up study, TODAY provides insights into procedures and strategies specific to this cohort. We will describe our experience and impart lessons learned, which have resulted in several important study-wide changes intended to increase compliance during the follow-up period. We encountered challenges due to major life changes occurring in participants shifting from adolescence to young adulthood. Further, we were providing standard practice patient care and management in TODAY2, which meant a switch from blinded pill packets to open-label bottled pills and from an over-encapsulated pill size (described as a horse pill) to a smaller tablet. These changes had ramifications for encouraging and tracking study drug adherence at the start of TODAY2. We make recommendations and suggestions for other study groups facing a similar situation.

ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING FOR HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT STUDIES Mary Crann BSN, MSN, Adam M. Mendizabal MS, Iris Gersten MS, Shelly L. Carter ScD
The EMMES Corporation 401 North Washington Street, Suite 700 Rockville, MD 20850
The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN), sponsored by the NHLBI and NCI, was established in 2001 to conduct multi-institutional clinical trials in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The Data and Coordinating Center (DCC) is responsible for data collection, review, monitoring, and reporting of adverse events (AE). Significant regimen-related adverse events are anticipated in this patient population that warrants a systematic approach to reporting adverse events.
The BMT CTN utilizes the AdvantageEDCSM electronic data management system to capture unexpected grades 3-5 AEs in six case report forms (CRFs): AE1-Initial Report, AE2-Summary, AE3-Therapy/Concomitant Medications, AE4-Laboratory/Diagnostics, AE5- PI Review, and AE6-Medical Monitor Review. AEs are graded according to the National Cancer Institutes Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Grades 3-5 AEs not listed in the protocol, informed consent, or drug label are determined to be Unexpected and are reported expeditiously regardless of attribution. Expected adverse events including protocol- specific toxicities are captured on calendar and event driven CRFs. Examples of expected data collected on these CRFs include infectious complications, graft-versus-host disease, relapse, readmission, graft failure and other protocol-specific events.
AdvantageEDCSM generates an automated e- mail notification when an unexpected grade 3- 5 AE has been entered. The AE coordinator notifies the DCC Medical Monitor who makes a determination of the expectedness and grade. The AE coordinator is responsible for managing the process including queries to the transplant center and filing reports to the NHLBI Project Officer and the FDA in compliance with reporting timeframes.
The BMT CTN AE process was developed to manage unexpected grades 3-5 AEs without burdening the system with expected events that are common among HSCT clinical trials. The AE process is coordinated by the DCC and requires constant vigilance to ensure events are reported, processed, and reviewed expeditiously with the objective of protecting the safety of study participants.

Petra Kaufmann, Walter Koroshetz
University of Iowa, Massachusetts General Hospital, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
The need to independently develop infrastructure for each trial is one of the impediments to efficiently implementing phase 2 trials. To improve efficiencies, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) recently initiated the Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT).
http://ctj.sagepub.com Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 450 554
516 Abstracts
The goals of NeuroNEXT are to lower barriers for individuals to bring good ideas forward in adult and pediatric neurological disorders, and to provide a flexible and accessible infrastructure to facilitate the development and deployment of phase 2 clinical trials and biomarker studies. To accomplish this goal, a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) is funded at the University of Iowa and a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and 25 clinical sites are funded throughout the United States. The first year of the project is aimed at establishing Standard Operating Procedures between the DCC and the CCC, Master Trial Agreements with each site to facilitate contractual requirements, and Reliance Agreements between the Central Institutional Review Board (IRB) at MGH and the IRBs at each site to facilitate IRB review. In addition, there are Protocol Working Groups (PWGs) that provide CCC and DCC assistance to academic, industry and advocacy partners in order to design and finalize robust protocols and grant applications. Data entry systems are being developed using the NINDS Common Data Elements to harmonize data sets at the end of each trial. The NeuroNEXT will develop and implement at least 7 clinical trials over the next 7 years, with at least one trial expected to start within the first year. Metrics on site performance, protocol development, and success of implementation are being collected to examine efficiencies and identify barriers. This innovative approach to improving efficiencies in phase 2 clinical trials may lead to more rapid development of therapies for adults and children with neurological disorders.

SERIOUS UNEXPECTED EVENTS IN AN OBSTETRIC CLINICAL TRIAL DEFINITIONAL CHALLENGES

University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, CANADA.
The concept of serious unexpected events (SUEs) is rooted in drug research in which unintended effects of medication (e.g., skin rash) must be identified. Although routine reporting of SUEs is an essential part of conducting a clinical trial, how to define a SUE in a pragmatic trial of high risk women is problematic.
The CHIPS Trial (Control of Hypertension In Pregnancy Study) is a multicentre randomised controlled trial recruiting 1028 women in 100 centres internationally (2008-14). CHIPS aims to determine whether less tight control [target diastolic blood pressure (dBP) 100mmHg] or tight control [target dBP 85mmHg] of non-proteinuric hypertension in pregnancy is better for the baby (primary outcome: pregnancy loss or high level neonatal care for > 48hr) without increasing risk to the mother.
Women eligible for CHIPS are high risk from perinatal and maternal perspectives, such as serious neonatal complications (16%), admission to high level neonatal care (30%), pre-eclampsia (35%), or serious maternal complications (2-3%). We needed to further develop our method of SUE review to prevent anticipated outcomes from being sent to our Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for review as SUEs.
In CHIPS, reported SUEs are reviewed by the Working Group (WG) to determine both the urgency of further review and what supporting documents are required. The Outcomes Adjudication Committee (OAC) reviews each SUE to determine whether the event is a pre- specified trial outcome or a true SUE. This decision is reviewed by the Steering Committee (SC). A summary report is submitted to the DSMB at the interim and final analyses or immediately, as decided by the WG, OAC, and/or SC.
To date in CHIPS, three SUEs have been reported, all of which were determined to be pre-specified outcomes and will be reviewed by the DSMB at the time of the first interim analysis.

controls worldwide. Data and sample collection was conducted in four networks (Asia-Pacific, European, North American and United Kingdom) from January 2004 - January 2010, with support from a Coordinating Center for various activities. While implementing standardized data collection for this international study presented many challenges, study closure proved to be as formidable. Disassembling this complex infrastructure (composed of 214 clinics in 34 countries, four Network Centers and 17 laboratories) while preparing all data and samples for transfer to the NIDDK Central Repository proved as difficult and required as much effort as initiating the study. At the time that we started study closure activities, there were no established guidelines or experience to direct our actions or identify potential difficulties. Study close out was staggered, beginning in October 2006 and concluding in December 2011. We developed a clinic close-out data entry form, delineating key elements required for closure. Additionally, comprehensive checklists of closure tasks for laboratories and Network Centers were developed and utilized. Finally, the Coordinating Center held a meeting with the NIDDK Central Repository to outline the data, samples and study documentation to be deposited. By clearly defining close-out tasks, providing timelines, and performing close-out site visits and/ or conference calls, staff at each facility can understand their responsibilities and ensure that all items are completed in this lengthy and complex process. Implementing these steps permits an orderly and efficient study closure and should be undertaken as soon as data collection has been initiated. We will present our procedures and solutions to problems encountered to assist other studies in the close-out process.

RISK MANAGEMENT OF NON-CTIMP TRIALS: FOCUS ON COMPLEX INTERVENTION TRIALS Liz Graham, Shamaila Anwar, Maria Bryant, Suzanne HartleyClinical Trials Research Unit, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom
Clinical Trials of Investigational Medicinal Products (CTIMPs) are regulated in the UK via the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations. This is implemented via a) Research Ethics Committee (REC) review, b) Research Management & Governance review by the NIHR Clinical Research Networks followed by c) local Trust R&D department review, and d) Competent Authority (CA) review.
Non-CTIMPs are approved via the same routes (excluding CA review). However, these studies are not gov
erned by the Clinical Trial Regulations; instead they are conducted in line with the UK Department of Healths Research Governance Framework, and in accordance with the Medical Research Councils Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Robust processes to ensure ethical and governance compliance are implemented but we have observed that low-risk non-CTIMP trials are subject to high levels of scrutiny by RECs and R&D departments, which is not necessarily commensurate with the risk to participants. This can detract from addressing key logistical issues associated with trial implementation (e.g. clinician training, optimising complex data collection processes from many sources), and can considerably extend the set-up phase of such trials, delay the start of recruitment, and even discourage site and patient participation. It is apparent that the measurement of risk in non-CTIMP trials needs to include the risk to the participant per se, but also the complexity of trial conduct (which impacts on participant risk if processes for implementing the trial are not thoroughly planned).
We will discuss the risk to the participant and the complexity of trial conduct identified in 3 complex intervention trials co-ordinated by the CTRU, and present the impact this had on the set-up and implementation of each trial.
We will present a risk-based approach for review and implementation of complex intervention trials, based on the type of intervention, participant, patient pathways and outcome measures to be used.

controlled trials within stroke - Training Caregivers after Stroke (TRACS) and Longer Term Stroke Care (LoTS care) co-ordinated by the University of Leeds Clinical Trials Research Unit.
Both trials obtain their primary outcome measures via patient self-completed measures administered postally. Follow-up procedures include a mixture of postal and telephone reminders, typically undertaken at two weekly intervals. Response rates are carefully monitored and, where necessary, amendments to the process are made and accounted for in later trials. For example in TRACS, following initial monitoring of data to enhance completeness, the team instigated the collection of the primary endpoint via a telephone interview for patients who did not return questionnaires despite earlier standard postal and telephone reminders. This process was adopted much earlier in the subsequent LoTS care trial. In addition, after the publication of a systematic review on methods to increase response rates, trial pens were enclosed with questionnaire packs. Lessons from LoTS care and TRACS led to implementation of strategies to enhance compliance in subsequent trials (e.g. sending questionnaires to participants in advance of a face-to-face interview in participants homes)
Response rates during specific postal and telephone reminder stages will be reported as well as the characteristics (such as age, gender, level of anxiety and depression) of participants responding at the different stages.
Many aspects need consideration when developing follow-up response strategies. Above all, strategies need to be easily adaptable, closely monitored from the outset and any lessons learnt disseminated.

Academic Medical Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 2. Onze Lieve Vrouwen Gasthuis, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
OBJECTIVE: Patient recruitment in trials often takes longer than expected. This is costly and if the sample size remains insufficient it might lead to indecisive conclusions for practice. The field of obstetrics is unique in the way that there are two patients: the mother and her baby. We aimed to identify reasons why women participated or declined participation in an RCT during or shortly after pregnancy.
DESIGN: We performed a qualitative study with semi-structured interviews in women who were asked to participate in a RCT in obstetrics. We randomly selected both women who consented and those who did not for one of a set of 7 different RCTs. Transcripts of the interviews were analyzed anonymously using a constant-comparative approach. Two researchers independently identified barriers and facilitators for participation. Interviews were continued until saturation was reached.
RESULTS: Of 22 women approached, 20 (90%) consented to be interviewed. Respondents varied by educational level, ethnicity, geographical area, age and parity. The main motivation for trial participation was either to contribute to research, as the women were convinced of its importance (50%) and/or preference for a treatment arm not available outside the trial (60%). Key barriers for participation in non-consenters were a negative association with the intervention (100%) and/or with randomization (45%). Fear and uncertainty, probably due to unfamiliarity with research and the feeling of being inappropriate because of unique personal characteristics, also played a role. Stress and doubt about the decision were present in both groups.
CONCLUSION: Trial participation is a tough decision for most women. The final choice about participation is made intuitively, but will be influenced positively if women are well informed about the importance of research in general and the specific trial in particular. A personal, complete, well-timed dialogue may facilitate to make a balanced decision and improve trial participation.

non-university institutions with little experience in CT. Therefore, we established a quality assurance system with on site monitoring visits and audits in all 27 centers. Based on monitoring reports, GCP violations are analyzed and their impact on patient safety and data quality is assessed.
Preparation for HASTA included a 2-day investigator meeting with surgical training and individual on site initiation visits. During recruitment 48 regular on site monitoring visits were conducted. Close out visits and independent audits are currently carried out and will be finished in February 2012.
Most GCP violations concerned patient informed consent (IC), although no IC was missing. 16 findings were rated major, 42 minor. Safety: 27 events were identified requiring serious adverse event reporting according to protocol. Primary endpoint needed to be corrected in 6 cases following monitoring findings. Violation of eligibility criteria were reported 4 times only. Further violations were regarding performance of trial intervention (wrong treatment group, procedure not performed according to protocol) and time window for follow-up visits.
Quantitative and qualitative results of monitoring findings will be presented and compared to findings discovered by on site audits. As on site monitoring is not routinely established for investigator initiated surgical trials, relevance of monitoring and auditing for conduct of HASTA trial and validity of trial data will be discussed.
Like most clinical research studies, minority enrollment rates are low in the EPR, particularly for African American males. In addition, African Americans have higher attrition rates compared with Caucasians. Therefore, in the EPR, we have employed special methods for recruiting and retaining minority subjects with varying levels of success. In this report, we will describe these methods, the lessons learned, and strategies used to improve minority recruitment and retention. These include: relationship-building with key stake-holders; capitalizing on personal and professional contacts; utilizing community champions and leaders; and targeting health-related and faith-based organizations/events. Success rates for the various strategies are presented by sex, age, race, and ethnicity.

PARENTAL PERCEPTION OF A CONTRACT IMPROVES ADHERENCE IN LONGITUDINAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF DISEASE PREVENTION IN EARLY LIFEHelen Fisher (1,2), Dr Annette Boaz (1), Dr Christopher McKevitt (1), Professor Gideon Lack (2)1. Health and Social Care Research, Kings College London, London, UK. 2. Asthma Allergy and Lung Biology, Kings College London, London, UK.
Objectives: During participation in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) adherence to the intervention and to other protocol requirements (e.g. visit attendance and completion of questionnaires) is essential for the production scientifically robust and clinically meaningful outcomes. Yet little is known about the issues that affect adherence during trial participation. This study aimed to explore the factors that influenced adherence to research procedures by parents who were invited to enrol their infants in longitudinal RCTs aimed at allergic disease prevention.
Methods: Two RCTs of an intervention to prevent food allergy in infants were used as case studies for this research. Data were collected using ethnographic methods: participant observation (130 hours) was carried out on the clinical trials unit; staff (n=26) who worked on the RCT and parents (n=55) who considered participation or had participated in the RCT took part in semi-structured interviews; and documents were gathered. Data were analysed thematically.
Results: Parents appeared to commit to a contract in their participation in the studies. The potential to gain direct benefit from participation improved adherence to the protocol. However even when no personal benefit was obtained, parents put considerable effort into adhering. This reflected their beliefs in the worth of the RCT and the importance they placed on fulfilling the perceived contract. Staff took proactive and reactive approaches to improving adherence. This involved negotiating adherence with colleagues and parents to balance manageable participation with achieving scientifically robust outcomes.
Conclusion: Many factors are important in achieving optimal adherence to the intervention and other protocol requirements. Parental and staff willingness to invest considerable time and resources is essential to achieving optimal adherence. The results suggest that staff and parents considered that research participation represented a contract. Maintaining an open dialogue regarding the nature of this contract helps to promote adherence in longitudinal RCTs.

Objectives: Successful recruitment to clinical trials is essential for scientifically and clinically robust findings. Additionally problems with accrual results in increased trial costs and the inefficient use of resources. Yet little is known about effective recruitment to pediatric studies. This study aimed to explore the factors that influenced recruitment to non-therapeutic, pediatric longitudinal randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Two RCTs of an intervention to prevent food allergy in infants were used as case studies for this research. Data were collected using ethnographic methods: participant observation (130 hours) was carried out on the clinical trials unit; staff (n=26) who worked on the RCTs and parents (n=55) who considered participation or had participated in the RCT took part in semi-structured interviews; and documents were gathered. Data were analyzed thematically. Results: The potential value of participation had a substantial influence on recruitment. Parents considered possible benefits for their child and the scientific worth and integrity of the RCT before agreeing to participate. The possibility that participation would be mutually beneficial was relevant to parents and staff. The ability to manage the demands of participation was also important; parents delayed making a decision until they considered they could cope. The potential for participation to cause harm had a substantial influence; fathers were often more concerned about harm and placed less importance on the scientific worth of the study than mothers. Conclusion: Recruitment to non-therapeutic longitudinal RCTs in early childhood is influenced by complex inter-related factors. Holding detailed discussions with parents regarding the scientific value of the studies and the support that can be offered to improve the manageability of participation may help to promote recruitment. Mothers and fathers often appear to have different opinions about the potential for harm and benefit; holding discussions with both parents (where appropriate) may also increase recruitment.

The Environmental Polymorphisms Registry (EPR) is a unique resource of subjects and their DNA samples that was created to facilitate genotype-driven translational research of complex disease. EPR goals are to recruit 20,000 individuals from North Carolina, collect their blood for DNA isolation, and make these DNA samples available to scientists to screen for genetic variants in environmental response genes. Once individuals with the genotypes-of-interest are identified, they are invited to participate in various types of follow-up studies ranging from basic laboratory ex vivo cell phenotyping investigations to observational studies and clinical trials.
Since 2005, over 15,000 subjects of diverse sex, age, race, and ethnicity have been enrolled in the EPR from clinics at local hospitals, community-based events (health fairs, health conferences, community meetings, churches, etc.) and the internet. To minimize attrition and ensure high response rates for follow-up studies, these subjects are contacted annually (through multiple mailings and phone calls) and asked to update their contact information and other basic data. Nonresponders are traced using LexisNexis and other public databases. Using these methods, our overall attrition rate is <20%.

A major benefit of long-term clinical trials is the ability to collect large amounts of prospective data on individual participants. With such large amounts of data, it is critical to ensure the integrity of the data and the methods with which it is collected. Long-term clinical trials may span much of a participants lifetime. To accommodate for this aging transition, minor adjustments may need to be considered during the course of the trial in order to collect valid data while ensuring systematic collection. With an aging cohort, it is important to consider your methods of data collection to ensure the best quality of the data. Such methods include specialized staff trainings to deal with age-related sensory, functional, and physiologic decline and cognitive impairment. To increase functional capability, modified equipment such as sitting scales, wider examination tables and assistive devices may be necessary. Altering phlebotomy techniques such as utilizing smaller needles and tubes may help alleviate poor venous access caused by physiologic decline. Cognitive impairment can affect the accuracy of the data collected and a proxy may need to be consulted for verification. Prolonged illness and decreased mobility of aging participants create barriers to clinic access for data collection. In such cases, performing collection at convenient locations for participants including their home or nursing home may combat possible retention issues. Specific equipment such as a portable centrifuge or scale may be needed for non-clinic study visits, so long as consistent methods of data collection and types of equipment between the home and clinic setting are maintained. Prioritizing data collection for non-clinic visits will help staff capture the essential outcomes while reducing burden on participants. This presentation will discuss data collection and retention issues and the important considerations necessary to retain data quality for an aging cohort in a long-term clinical trial.

PARTICIPANT PERCEPTION OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT IS RELATED TO SYMPTOM SEVERITY IN A CLINICAL TRIAL OF PHYTOTHERAPYJeannette Lee, Michael Barry, John Kusek for the CAMUS Study Group
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common condition among older men, is characterized by lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Symptom severity is measured by the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) with higher scores reflecting greater symptom burden. The Complementary and Alternative Medicines for Urological Symptoms (CAMUS) trial, a randomized, double-blinded trial, found that saw palmetto, a phytotherapy, did not differ from placebo with respect to symptom relief over a 72-week period. Saw palmetto participants received a single daily 320 mg gelcap for the first 24 weeks, two gelcaps from weeks 25-48, and three gelcaps from weeks 49-72. Placebo participants received the same number of matching gelcaps for each period. At the end of each 24-week period, participants were asked to guess their treatment assignment and the AUA-SI was administered. Across assessments, no significant difference was found between treatment groups with respect to the participants guesses of their treatment assignments (P=0.638) (Table 1). Regardless of actual treatment assignment, participants who thought they were on saw palmetto had significantly greater decreases in AUA-SI than those who thought they were on placebo (Table 2). Using a general estimating equations analysis that adjusted for intrapatient variation, the effects of actual treatment assignment, time and AUA- SI change on participant guess were evaluated. Only change in AUA-SI was significantly associated with participant guess of treatment assignment (P<0.001). Men with greater improvement in LUTS were more likely to believe they were assigned to saw palmetto than placebo. It is unclear whether the perception of treatment assignment had an effect on AUA- SI or AUA-SI change influenced perception of treatment assignment.

BACKGROUND: CREST received five-years funding ($21,268,366) from NIH/NINDS to compare stenting to surgery for stroke prevention in 2500 randomized participants at 40 sites. Reimbursement denial by Medicare

and device malfunction delayed start-up. Strategies to conserve funding when the trial was halted and recruitment lagged are described and may benefit other trials.
METHODS: Immediately, site-payment was changed from line-items for physicians, coordinators and technicians salaries, mailings, and indirect costs, to a flat fee-for- service reimbursement for trial visit data. Reimbursement was highest for enrollment visits and increased ($1500-$2500 per participant) when recruitment lagged. Core- centers were combined and reduced (eight to three); payments were converted to fee-for-service for consultants and readings of angiogram and ultrasound studies. Nonessential visits were eliminated. Credentialing study follow-up was decreased from four-years to one-year. With additional funding from Abbott Vascular, CREST assumed the Investigational Device sponsorship, centralizing regulatory and site management by adding previously- unbudgeted research associates, a regulatory expert, paralegal, site monitoring organization and services of Abbott field personnel.
RESULTS: NINDS funding was extended by no-cost extension from five to eight years. During these three years, credentialing-study sites increased from 52 to 98, and 773 (50%) additional patients were enrolled. Randomizing sites tripled (34 to 109), and 9,528 follow-up visits occurred. Of the 2500 sample size, 138 (5.5%) were randomized during the first five years and 1387 (55.5%) during the no-cost extensions, contributing to completion of enrollment (2008) and publication of results (2010).
CONCLUSIONS: Performance-based budgets for data submitted are cost-effective, conserve funding during slow recruitment, promote visit and data compliance, and allow for additional sites at little additional cost. Partnering with industry for unbudgeted resources enhances productivity. Costs of large-scale clinical trials can thus be reduced through effective management without compromising scientific integrity.

ADJUDICATION OF SAFETY OUTCOMES IN A WEB-BASED CLINICAL TRIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Aaron Perlmutter, Holly Battenhouse, Cassidy Conner, Catherine Dillon, Jordan Elm, Keith Pauls, Wenle ZhaoDepartment of Medicine, Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Data Coordination Unit; Charleston, SC, USA
The central adjudication of primary safety and efficacy outcomes has been frequently used in multicenter clinical trials in order to ensure the accuracy and consistency of outcome assessments.[1] A recent review indicated roughly one third of randomized controlled trials used central adjudication. [2] In addition, a task-dedicated, web- based outcome adjudication system has been used in clinical trial practice.[3] The NIH NINDS-funded Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) Trial plans to enroll 4150 subjects from up to 150 clinical sites. The trial requires a complex adjudication procedure for primary safety outcomes, involving up to seven review steps. This adjudication procedure has been implemented into a web-based Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS), using its generic form review function, which allows a form record to be reviewed by a designated user based on the contents of the record and the results of previous review steps. To accomplish this in the CTMS, the adjudication procedure was broken down into seven steps with clear definitions of triggering conditions and review questions. A transition logic matrix was used to avoid dead loops and broken chains. Scheduled and action driven email notifications and main menu alerts were designed to notify users of action items. The preliminary experience of using this web-based adjudication function demonstrates that the average time from a sites first submission of the safety event case report form to final adjudication was trimmed about 50 percent compared to manual coordination, in addition to benefits in automatic documentation of the review process. While the advantages of web-based trial operation management are easy to show, the complexity level of the adjudication procedure must be justified based upon cost- benefit considerations. Also, the close monitoring of the adjudication process by a designated project manager is needed in order to address unforeseeable situations.

studies to compare clinical and economic outcomes of immediate treatment versus deferred treatment strategies. Evaluating cost-effectiveness can be particularly important when the timing of treatment affects how much the treatment costs.
One example is treatment of nasolacrimal duct obstruction (blocked tear ducts) in infants. This common condition often resolves without surgery, either spontaneously or with non-surgical treatment, and is sometimes treated with a surgical probing of the nasolacrimal duct. In infants younger than one year, the surgical probing can be performed with the infant awake in the office setting. In infants older than one year, the surgical probing must usually be performed under general anesthesia in a more costly surgical facility setting. We designed a randomized trial to address the question is it more cost- effective to perform the less expensive surgery on all patients or to perform the more expensive procedure on the subset of patients whose condition doesnt resolve with observation and non-surgical treatment?
Using our randomized trial as an example, we explore the impact of the rate of resolution in the observation/deferred treatment group on cost-effectiveness and illustrate study design issues related to defining outcomes, choosing an outcome timepoint, deciding on a subject-level or eye-level analysis, estimating sample size, and the impact of loss to follow up. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages to the approach we have taken to handling these issues.

STARTING A GENETIC REPOSITORY
Alice K. HenningThe EMMES Corporation, Rockville MD USA
Genetic Repositories are increasingly common components of clinical trials since identifying genetic risk factors for disease is an area of great interest to the research community. In the process of setting up a Genetic Repository for the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2), a large multi-center study sponsored by the National Eye Institute, we found a number of areas needed to be considered both in the design of the sample collection and the selection process of the laboratory to serve as the Repository. Maximizing research goals given budgetary considerations will determine what type of samples will be collected (blood and/or saliva) and which materials (DNA, RNA, serum, and/or plasma) will be isolated and stored in the Repository. Participants may be offered a choice in the consent document whether their samples are to be used for research for any disease or a specific disease. However, if this choice is provided, this means that data from the different consent groups will need to be provided in separate data tables when sent to the Database of Genotype and Phenotype (dbGaP). While assigning a different number to the material than the one on the blood/saliva sample helps protect participant confidentiality, this should be weighed against the potential for labeling error at this step. Quality control procedures should be put into place to identify labeling errors. One possibility is DNA fingerprinting the materials obtained from multiple samples from the same participant. In evaluating the laboratory that will serve as the Repository, it is important to assess how sample history is documented and to evaluate the procedures for adjudication and documentation of mishandled/ mislabeled samples. In addition, the experience of the laboratory in handling a similar volume of samples and whether staff will be dedicated to processing samples for the study should be considered.

re- estimation was proposed, in addition to monitoring for efficacy and futility. This presentation will describe the interim monitoring and sample size re-estimation plan, focusing on the concepts and implementation rather than statistical details, and discuss points to be considered and pitfalls to be avoided. The plan used the method proposed by Li et al [Biostatistics, 2002], and consisted of a single interim analysis when outcome data was available for approximately of the initial sample size. If this analysis showed a strong benefit of treatment meeting a pre- defined criterion, the plan recommended early stopping for treatment benefit. Otherwise, the sample size needed to give 90% conditional power to detect the treatment effect of interest (2:1 ratio of events control:treated) was calculated based on the observed outcome proportion, pooling both treatment groups, at the time of interim analysis. If the new sample size was the same or less than the original sample size, the plan recommended continuing with the original sample size. If the new sample size was greater than the original sample size but less than a pre- specified maximum, the plan recommended continuing using the new sample size. If the new sample size was greater than the pre-specified maximum sample size, the conditional power at the pre-specified maximum was computed. If this conditional power was less than a pre-specified minimum acceptable power, the plan recommended stopping for futility. Otherwise, the plan recommended continuing to the maximum sample size.

Single arm studies with intervention delivered to clusters of participants have been used to assess strategies for the prevention and control of chronic disease, but sample size approach for such a design have not been available. In this paper, we propose sample size approaches for pre- post comparison with intervention delivered to clusters. Both equal and unequal cluster sizes are considered. With assumptions that the pre-post difference is normally distributed and that the paired t-test is used to test the intervention effect, the t statistic has a central and non-central t distribution under the null and alternative hypotheses, respectively, while taking account clustering. For unequal cluster sizes, the relative efficiency (RE) of unequal versus equal cluster size, under the alternative hypothesis, is defined as the ratio of the noncentrality parameter of unequal versus equal cluster sizes. The RE is straight forward to calculate and easy to interpret. Furthermore, the proposed RE connects directly the required mean cluster size to the required sample size with equal cluster sizes for assessing study power. Consequently we can calculate the required mean cluster size to achieve the same power as an equal cluster sizes trial. There exists a minimum required number of clusters for a pre-specified power, which provides a quick evaluation of feasibility as to achieving a statistical power. All results are obtained analytically.

ALCOHOLISM TREATMENT STUDIES: A DESIGN PROPOSAL TO IMPROVE RELEVANCE Robert Lew, Jasmine Escalera, John HermosMassachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA Cooperative Studies
Program Coordinating Center, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, United States
Randomized trials designed to determine effective treatments for alcoholism have produced, at best, minimally positive, short- term findings. To obtain more clinically relevant results, studies need to address: the heterogeneity and diverse treatment goals of the population with alcohol problems, narrow eligibility criteria that limit generalizability; subjects reluctance to enter and remain in studies; and short-term interventions that, even if successful, have little impact on long- term courses and recoveries. We propose an adaptive study design which would be potentially feasible within the large cohort of veterans seen at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities. The VA electronic data capture (EDC) system collects nearly all data from clinical visits, pharmacy, procedures, radiology, and follow-up visits. Utilization of this system would allow for the potential to passively follow a cohort of perhaps 50,000 veterans for a decade. Some randomization

is needed to detect and minimize confounding by indication; this process would entail attention to eligibility and informed consent. Physicians must comply with rules about regular follow-up evaluations. With these provisos, the range of problems, goals, and treatments could be evaluated as in a phase II design with statistical adjustment for missing data and dropout. Adaptively, new patients can receive more of the promising treatments and weaker treatments can be dropped as if seeking an optimal dose, with the ongoing cohort providing long-term results for the promising treatments. If a particularly promising treatment emerges and some past randomization has occurred, then a formal phase III randomized trial can begin making use of the past accrued data and following the analysis plan in Berrys seamless designs.

A decision of the Federal Joint Committee Germany states that negative pressure wound therapy is not accepted as a standard therapy with full reimbursement by the health insurance companies in Germany. This decision is based on the rapid report and the final report of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care, which demonstrated through systematic reviews and meta-analysis of previous studies projects that an insufficient state of evidence regarding the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for treatment of acute and chronic wounds exists. The Institute for Research in Operative Medicine (IFOM) as part of the University of Witten / Herdecke gGmbH is an independent scientific institute that is responsible for the planning, implementation, analysis and publication of trial projects regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapy for acute and chronic wounds in both medical sectors (in- and outpatient care) in Germany. The study projects are designed and conducted with the aim to provide solid evidence regarding the efficacy of NPWT. The trials evaluate the treatment outcome of the application of a technical medical device which is based on the principle of negative pressure wound therapy (Intervention Group) in comparison to standard wound therapy (Control group) in the treatment of chronic foot wounds and acute subcutaneous abdominal wounds after surgery. All used treatment systems bear the CE mark and will be used within normal conditions of clinical routine and according to manufacturers instructions. The aim of the trial projects is to compare the clinical, safety and economic results of both treatment arms. Study results will be provided until the end of 2014 to contribute to the final decision of the Federal Joint Committee Germany regarding the general admission of negative pressure wound therapy as a standard of performance within both medical sectors.

Methods Centre-DMS manager, OHRI-CEP
The management of multicentre trials is a tremendous undertaking from an administrative perspective. Too often, multicentre trials operate as silos and there may be a lack of standardization in how administrative aspects of the trials are organized. Presently, it is extremely inefficient for the development, implementation and management of a multicentre trial using a paper-based data capture system. The bigger the multicentre trial, the bigger the challenges for the management of a paper-based, non-standardized system.
The OHRI Methods Centre Electronic Data Capture System Platform is an integrated, electronic multicentre trial management software package (thin-client /web-based) that is comprehensive in scope, yet general enough that it can be adapted for use in multicentre trials of various designs and in different clinical areas. It has many advanced features and fully compatible with all the popular internet browsers.

The Human Intervention Studies Database (HISD), developed by KAI Research, Inc. for the National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health, helps NIA program officials to manage their scientific portfolio. The database tracks all NIA funded clinical trials and provides detailed information and customized reports. We have used the NIA HISD data to analyze the frequency of health conditions, diseases and interventions the NIA targets in its mission to improve the health and quality of life of older adults. We compare these data to aging statistics and key indicators of well- being available from the National Center for Health Statistics and to the strategic initiatives of the NIA. Indicators of chronic health conditions, mortality, age-related diseases and disabilities and various health care indicators are used for the comparison. The HISD frequency data are well aligned with the strategic goals of the NIA and the national health statistics. We will provide case studies of uses of the data and illustrate how an administrative tracking tool can yield valuable information for describing current initiatives and planning future directions. Since the database tracks only interventional studies, these data show an important part but not all of the clinical research and strategic initiatives sponsored by the NIA in support of an aging society.

FACTOR ANALYSIS OF THE CORRELATES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF STRESSFUL
LIFE EVENTS IN THE TODAY COHORTLaura Pyle, Natalie Walders Abramson, Jennifer Berry, Laure El ghormliGeorge Washington University Biostatistics Center, Rockville, Maryland, USA; University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO, USA
Relationships between deterioration in health status and exposure to stressful life events have been well-documented among patients with various chronic illnesses; however, little is known about the impact of life stressors on the course and management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth. The TODAY clinical trial provided an opportunity to examine associations between stressful life events and physiologic markers, specifically, elevations in HbA1c and BMI among youth with T2D. TODAY (Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth) was a multi-center NIH-funded clinical trial to test treatment regimens for youth-onset T2D. Participants were age 10-17 inclusive and diagnosed with T2D < 2 years at baseline. They were treated and followed for 2-6 years. During the trial, the study teams had to address multiple challenges to retention and participation in the study due to the psychosocial environment of the participant and the youths family. In the final year of the trial, participants completed a self-report life stressor form adapted from the Yeaworth Adolescent Life Change Event Scale(1980) and inclusive of selected items from the Holmes and Rahe (1967) Social Readjustment Rating Scale. The 33-item measure assessed frequency and self-rated level of distress associated with stressful life events over the past year. Data are available from 517 overweight youths from predominantly minority backgrounds (41.1% Hispanic; 31.5% Non-Hispanic Black; 19.6% Non- Hispanic White).
After presenting descriptive statistics and correlations to describe the associations between stressful life
events and select physiological markers, we report the methods and results of factor analysis to identify any relevant subgroups of stressor types. Findings will increase our understanding of the psychosocial challenges faced by youth with T2D which will help shape and optimize clinical practice, as well as inform the development of intervention programs to maximize self-care and functional status among this vulnerable population.

The Multiple Courses of Antenatal Corticosteroids for Preterm Birth Study: A 5-year Follow-up (MACS-5), is an international multi-centre trial assessing 1200 children from the original MACS study at 5 years of age. The MACS-5 study aims to determine the long-term effects of antenatal corticosteroids with emphasis on cognitive, behavioral and motor development. It was important to implement specific data retrieval strategies in the early phases of the study, since challenges with long term follow-up were anticipated.
Throughout the study, regular communication via email was maintained with all sites. Monthly reminder reports listing all overdue data were mailed to collaborators, and reminders to send in all data were also included in a bi-monthly newsletter. Efforts to ensure data accuracy were maintained by generating quarterly query reports for each site and conducting annual frequency reviews for all MACS-5 data.
In the final year of follow-up, efforts to retrieve data and resolve queries were intensified and specific strategies were implemented to collect the remaining data. A site status report was created to regularly monitor outstanding data and queries for each site. Focus on retrieving query replies was increased by sending monthly query reports to sites, followed by telephone calls if no reply was received within a three week period. For sites who still had not returned their data, the Principal Investigator contacted the sites by email and telephone. Continued delays of receiving data led to the implementation of a pre-arranged courier to have data picked up from the sites. Site visits were undertaken as a last resort where communication remained unsuccessful.
The approaches implemented in the MACS-5 study were successful in surpassing the original target follow-up goal of 1200 children. As of December 1, 2011, 1539 children had completed MACS-5 follow-up assessments. In addition, 98.6% of these follow-up cases had no outstanding queries.

AN APPROACH TO STUDY DRUG MANAGEMENT IN RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS Sunny Chan, Michael Shi, Elizabeth AsztalosThe Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario,
In randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving study drug, supply management is a challenge that is often faced by the site and trial coordinating centre. The drug supplier and drug distributor may work independently, and as a result, a combined effort is essential to maintain a consistent flow of study drug for the duration of the trial. The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research (CMICR), is the data and clinical coordinating centre for several multi-centre RCTs. Several of the RCTs evaluate study drug intervention. The approach to study drug management was to design and develop a software program to facilitate the process of ordering treatment kits containing study drug, tracking shipment, and maintaining precise details of all assigned treatment kits.
In the study drug management program, treatment kits are uniquely numbered and a corresponding document is generated as a reference for the drug distributor. As new sites join the trial, treatment kits are ordered and shipped to prepare for patient recruitment. Additional kits are ordered for participating sites on an as-needed basis. The process is completed using automated electronic communication with instant update of the site inventory that is available for patient randomisation. For the trial coordinator, the program gives them the control over the amount of treatment kits to store at a particular site and better manage the overall supply parameters. The program is also able to facilitate drug reconciliation, drug recall, and set triggers for low inventory and drug expiry.
The study drug management program greatly reduces the administrative effort needed by the trial coordinator while improving the efficiency of the drug supply management process.

studys primary intervention involves listening to medication adherence messages on an iPod that is provided to each participant and pre-loaded with songs. Participants in the intervention arm meet as a group weekly to record messages to each other that encourages his/her peers to take their medication as prescribed. These messages are overlaid on a song of the participants choice. While mirroring in content, the control arms messages are recorded by a physician and dont incorporate music. Participants iPods are updated weekly with five new songs of his/her choice as well as new adherence messages. During these weekly visits the iPod statistics, including song name, artist, length of song, number of times played, and number of times skipped, is extracted from the iPods. Usage statistics are reset between individuals to ensure clean data. These data are stored in iTunes and can be exported and stored in Microsoft Excel sheets by participant and time period, and can be exported to any database of choice. This data allows investigators to monitor intervention fidelity by comparing listening habits, particularly to medication adherence messages. In ADEPT, the iPod serves as not only the intervention delivery method, but also the means to remotely monitor intervention fidelity and dosage.

ESTABLISHING A REMOTE DATA ENTRY SYSTEM IN A RURAL TRIAL COMMUNITY Dixie J. Ecklund, David Drake, Kathy Phipps
University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA
American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations within the United States are underserved in their access to health care as well as clinical trials. Our goal was to establish a clinical site in a rural Tribal community for an observational trial and train staff at the clinical site in remote data entry. In order to conduct a clinical trial with members of a tribe, approval must first be obtained from the Tribal Research Review Board and the Tribal Institutional Review Board of record. To facilitate interactions with the Tribe, the Principal Investigator contracted with a researcher who has an established professional history of working in and among AI/AN populations to serve as a liaison. A clinical site coordinator was hired who did additional hirings of staff for recruitment, clinical assessments and data entry. A data entry system was developed with up to 15 electronic case report forms collected at each of 8 visits. Because of the likelihood of missing data or missing visits, none of the forms or fields were developed as required or mandatory data entry. When the data entry system was completed and validated, we traveled to the clinical site on the reservation and conducted data entry training with the staff, all of whom were Tribal members. The clinical site staff quickly learned the requirements of data entry and have entered data on almost 250 subjects into the data entry system. The tribal liaison has traveled to the site on several occasions to review data entry and perform quality control. Follow-up is expected to be completed by May 2014 and the data will be ready to be analyzed by statisticians at the University of Iowa.

CLINICAL DATA MANAGEMENT OF HIV/AIDS-RELATED ILLNESSES IN HIV CLINICAL TRIALS: CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONSMaija Anderson, Jenny Tseng, San-San Ou, and Lei WangStatistical Center for HIV/AIDS Research and Prevention, Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA
Objectives: HIV/AIDS-related illnesses are key endpoints in multi-site HIV prevention trials. Accurate reporting of these endpoints requires systematic procedures for collecting, reviewing, and cleaning the clinical data. The U.S. Center of Disease Control (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) provide guidelines that define HIV/AIDS-related illnesses; yet clinical data management and operational challenges are rarely discussed. Methods: The Statistical Center for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Research (SCHARP) was responsible for collection and analysis of clinical data from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)-sponsored HIV Prevention Trials Network protocol 052 (HPTN 052). In HPTN 052 primary clinical endpoints were reviewed by blinded protocol team physicians for acceptance. Clinical data reconciliation challenges included reporting of multiple symptoms instead of one known diagnosis, inaccurate onset and outcome date, inconsistent reporting on worsening of illness, and over reporting of events. Discrepancies in reporting any of the above key data elements ultimately affect the medical review and data analysis.
Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 450 554 http://ctj.sagepub.com
Abstracts 529
Results: SCHARP clinicians and statisticians routinely partnered with protocol team physicians to assess and reconcile discrepancies in HIV/AIDS-related illnesses using multiple data sources. The SCHARP clinicians then worked with study sites to resolve identified issues. SCHARP designed a web-based tool to facilitate and track the clinical medical review. A consistent work flow was developed and utilized for the clinical data management and operational process for review of HIV/AIDS-related illnesses.
Conclusion: Close collaboration between the SCHARP statistical and clinical groups and the protocol team physicians ensured accuracy and completeness in HIV/AIDS-related illnesses for endpoint analysis. The web-based tool, though in its nascence, proved useful to streamline the review process and reduce potential data errors. The utilization of this web-based tool, providing blinded clinical cases for protocol team member review, can serve as a useful model for other clinical trials.

CODING OPEN-ENDED RESPONSES: IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS Jennifer Talton, Ralph DAgostino Jr., Joseph Grzywacz, Thomas Arcury, Maria Mirabelli,
Grisel Trejo, Sara Quandt
Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA
Open-ended responses are common in many questionnaires, and coding of responses is challenging. La Familia Sana Promotora Program was a demonstration project conducted to evaluate the translation of an intervention designed to improve farmworker family pesticide-related knowledge and practices. The Promotora Program used open- ended responses to measure changes in behavior and knowledge from pre- to post- test. This paper identifies complexities and solutions in the process of ensuring reliability in coding of responses in order to create discrete categories for evaluation of results.
The evaluation included 20 questions used to address 18 learning objectives. Seven questions relied completely on participants narrative responses and were coded as correct, incorrect, or partially correct. Thirteen questions had other as a response field, and the text was then coded as correct or incorrect.
Primary and secondary coders were trained to code the open-ended responses. The primary coder coded all participant responses; the secondary coder coded a 10% random sample. Kappa statistics were used to gauge the inter-coder reliability. The seven questions based solely on narrative responses were highly discordant (range: 21% to 60%). The partially correct and correct codes were combined into a single correct code, and the discordance decreased (range: 8% to 27%). Despite this improvement, the investigators decided that an expert should code these problematic questions. For the thirteen partial narrative responses, the kappa statistics showed favorable reliability between coders and did not require expert coding (range: 0% to 2% discordant). This study illustrates the need for content experts to code responses to completely open-ended questions; training staff is not sufficient to ensure quality data is coded.

DATABASE STRUCTURE FOR MULTIPLE PROTOCOLS WITHIN A PROJECT Danielle SmithThe EMMES Corporation
Data structure can be straightforward for a single protocol in a project. However, when sub-studies need customization, there can be many obstacles when variation is required for each protocol. The Autism Treatment Network (ATN) began a data registry to collect retrospective and prospective data on children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) between the ages of 3-18 with a primary focus on nutrition and sleep issues. With a grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the ATN conducted two sub- studies: The Diet and Nutrition in Children with ASD (Nutrition) and Sleep Education Program for Parents of Children with Autism (Sleep).
Both studies had assessments that overlapped with the Registry as well as assessments that were exclusive to each protocol. Data from the Registry was used for the sub-study if collected within a specific window. For example, the Child Behavior Checklist was completed for the Registry and required for both the Nutrition and Sleep protocols but did not need to be repeated as long as the data were collected within 60 and 90 days, respectively.
Initially, only assessments exclusive to the Nutrition and Sleep protocols were required in the database for each participant at the time of enrollment. Assessments that overlapped with the Registry were already

developed and as the assessment was only repeated for a portion of the participants, any repeated assessments were entered under the Registry protocol. This allowed the data to be pulled from one database for all three protocols using the form date to determine most recent data. However, when the Registry protocol was amended and the database was restructured, the Nutrition and Sleep databases also required restructuring. This presentation will also highlight other obstacles related to the management of sub-studies.

OPTIMIZING OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION SOFTWARE FOR HIGH QUALITY DATA

Rosemary Miller, Carolyn Powers
Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA
Accurate, high quality data are essential to any research study, making it critical to proactively identify and eliminate errors before they enter the database. A major challenge to using optical character recognition (OCR) software for data entry is identifying errors produced by stray marks, respondent corrections, or improperly completed fields. While many errors can be caught by carefully defining fields through built-in field property settings, we have found that the error reducing capacity of OCR software is greatly expanded by use of customizable scripts. Common checks scripted into data collection forms typically verify skip pattern logic, logical comparisons between fields, and restrict numeric entries to discrete values. If data read by the OCR fails these checks, they are flagged for review. Customizable scripting allows developers to add additional checks and flag data during processing. In instances where noise or an unintended mark was interpreted as data, or valid data was not detected by the OCR, use of customizable scripts enables the data manager now to prevent such errors from migrating to the database. Furthermore, if the data reported were captured accurately but fails a check, the data manager can query the reporting site and rectify the issue. We selected an OCR software system (TeleForm) as our primary tool for data collection and management in a multi-center study investigating the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in adolescents. We conducted an in-depth evaluation of the database, encompassing more than 250,000 data fields, and found very few errors (0.065%). Among critical data elements, the error rate was 0.048%. By optimizing TeleForm through robust error checking scripts, we produced accurate, high quality data in a timely fashion for a multi-site clinical study.

The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research (CMICR) is a central coordinating centre for several large national and international multi-centre randomized controlled trials to improve the health of women and their children. The unit has conducted research trials since 1988, and has evolved in clinical research practices alongside technological advancements. The data collection process has transitioned with each new trial, from paper-based data collection to online PDF data forms to electronic data capture. With every transition, it is important to maintain the integrity of data quality and ensure that the process is in compliance with International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH)/ Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards.
The challenges and considerations in transitioning the data collection process include programming to set up the database and training for both the CMICR data coordinator and site coordinators. The transition requires changes in programming for how the data are captured in the database and updating various reporting systems such as data form tracking, queries, funding and compliance reports. Furthermore, it is necessary to consider training each site coordinator in the new process of reporting data, and how to interpret the associated reports.
This presentation will illustrate the approaches used in the technological transition of the data collection process.

UTILIZING A WEB-BASED TELEPHONE CALL TRACKING SYSTEM IN THE
COLLECTION OF COGNITIVE DATADarrin Harris, Patricia Hogan, Sarah Guassoin, Claudine Legault, Michelle Naughton, Julia Robertson, Debbie PleasantsWake Forest School of Medicine Winston-Salem, NC United States
The Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) is an ancillary study to the Womens Health Initiative (WHI), designed to determine the short and long-term effects of hormone therapy on the development and progression of dementia symptoms in postmenopausal women. The Womens Health Initiative Memory Study - Epidemiology of Cognitive Health Outcomes (WHIMS-ECHO) provides annual cognitive assessments of women who were aged 65 or older at the time of randomization to WHI, and The Womens Health Initiative Memory Study of Younger Women (WHIMS-Y) assesses the long-term impact of random assignment to postmenopausal hormone therapy among women who were aged 50-54 at the time of randomization into the WHI hormone trials.
To increase efficiency, lower participant burden, and reduce costs, cognitive data on consenting women from WHIMS-ECHO and WHIMS-Y are obtained annually through centralized cognitive telephone interviews conducted by trained and certified staff at the WHIMS Coordinating Center. To assist in this process, a web-based telephone call tracking system has been implemented, identifying administrative tasks and the order in which participants should be called based on study rules and priorities that have been established. Additionally, it is flexible enough to allow interviewers to schedule calls in accordance with participant needs. When a participant is selected, the interviewer is provided the contact information, pertinent study data and call history. After a call has been made the interviewer inputs the date, start time, end time, and outcome of the call allowing the system to track each attempt. Real-time reports monitoring study calls are used to detect any issues that may have a significant impact on data collection, personnel needs, or costs. The poster will describe the Telephone Call Tracking System in detail discussing the benefits and challenges.

IMPROVING THE RELIABILITY OF WEB-BASED RANDOMIZATION USING ENCRYPTED
ALLOCATION INFORMATION EMBEDDED INTO DATA ELEMENTSGordon S. Doig and Fiona Simpson.
Northern Clinical School Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia and Royal North Shore
Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Sydney, NSW 2065, Australia.
Background: The use of web sites to conduct patient allocation is increasing in popularity. Embedding encrypted information into a data element that is fed- back to the user after a patient is allocated is an inexpensive and effective way to provide an off-site back-up to protect machine rooms from catastrophic failures. Methods: Assume a multi-centre trial generates an allocation sequence using variable sized permuted blocks, stratified by site and one patient factor. Each site requires a unique allocation sequence matrix (Table 1).
Table 1. Allocation sequence, Site 1StrataA 0_A1 0_A2 1_A3 1_A4 0_A5 treatment_AX
StrataB 1_B1 1_B2 1_B3 0_B4 0_B5 treatment_BY
To allocate patients, the web server must track two counters at each site: the number of patients previously assigned to StrataA (AX) and StrataB (BY). Using a hash function based on a block cipher, or a trapdoor function, the study server can generate a variable representing these counters (Site1_AXBY) and pass the variable back to the participating site as an encrypted transaction code (enc- Site1_AXBY). This transaction code is recorded on paper and stored locally at the participating site.
Results: To randomise a patient during a catastrophic server failure, the site research coordinator telephones the study coordinating centre (SCC) and provides the transaction code (enc-Site1_AXBY) for the patient randomised immediately prior to the server failure. The transaction code is decrypted and matched against the site- specific allocation sequence matrix which enables the SCC to make the appropriate treatment allocation for the next patient to be enrolled.

Conclusion: This approach to backing-up trial status is inexpensive, robust and enables a study to recover from catastrophic server failures with zero down time with no reliance on archived electronic information. It can be extended to work with any type of allocation sequence (Ex. blocked or adaptive, such as minimization).

A TAILORED COMMUNICATION PLATFORM FOR A VIRTUAL INTERVENTION TEAM Elizabeth F. Avery, Tamara Olinger, Steven K. Rothschild, Erin E. Emery Department of Preventive Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA
Optimal healthcare is often accomplished by enlisting a team of interventionists. However, an intervention team does not have to meet in person to achieve effective communication. The intervention arm of the BRIGHTEN Heart behavioral trial employs an interdisciplinary virtual team strategy to enable experts to jointly develop and implement treatment plans for older adult trial participants with depression. The virtual team consists of BRIGHTEN Heart interventionists and the participants primary care physician (PCP). The PCPs access is limited to their patients using built in security. In order to facilitate secured remote communications between team members, the Data Core of the Rush Center for Urban Health Equity has developed a Microsoft SharePoint web server to host an intervention communication platform that is HIPAA compliant. All data and written communications are held in a series of connected lists that appear on the web-page in a set of interactive, easily readable forms. Data from the initial research assistant interview is combined with a report from an evaluation by a social worker to create a patient description. Initial communications about the participant are handled in a separate linked list. The platform allows each virtual team member to have an individual entry line to record their recommendations for each participant. This communication platform is used to keep the intervention team informed of each participants progress in the study by the Data Core and treatment personnel, offers the means to make new recommendations, and allows effective communication among team members. The lists also enable the Data Core to track specific intervention fidelity measures (e.g. level of engagement and quality of care for each virtual team member). By utilizing standard components of SharePoint we have created a tailored communication platform that is easy to use, efficient, cost effective, tracks intervention fidelity and protects participant information.

THE USE OF A MULTIFACETED CLINICAL TRIAL IMPLEMENTATION AND EDUCATION
STRATEGY TO MINIMISE MAJOR PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS
Fiona Simpson, Gordon Doig, Elizabeth SweetmanNorthern Clinical School, Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia and Royal North Shore
Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Sydney, NSW 2065.
Introduction: Evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of clinical trial interventions may not become apparent until major protocol violations are minimised. Certain change management strategies are proven to promote adherence to clinical protocols and guidelines and can successfully narrow gaps between knowledge and practice. These strategies may also be useful in minimising major protocol violations in a clinical trial. Study Objectives: To design a clinical trial implementation and education strategy using change management strategies and evaluate its impact on major protocol violations.
Methods: The change management and clinical trials literature was reviewed. The resultant implementation and education strategy included: formal training for local recruitment coordinators; educational outreach visits with one-on-one education (academic detailing); a formal run-in phase and; staggered site start-up meetings. This strategy was used to initiate a multi-centre clinical trial. Major protocol violation rates are reported and compared to published figures.
Results: At the time of analysis, 409 patients had been enrolled from 32 sites, with 9 (2.2%) major protocol violations: four recruitment errors; three study process errors and; two technical website errors (2/9). This is significantly lower than published Phase III FDA licensing trial figures (PROWESS 351/1690 vs 9/409, p <0.001).
Conclusions: An implementation and education strategy based on change management strategies can reduce major protocol violations significantly lower than published rates. We believe that formally trained local trial recruitment coordinators, who retain primary responsibility for patient identification, recruitment and protocol implementation, are the most effective component of our strategy.

THE NOVEL USE OF SITE SELECTION SURVEYS TO IMPROVE SUB-OPTIMAL RECRUITMENT Fiona Simpson and Gordon DoigNorthern Clinical School Intensive Care Research Unit, University of Sydney, Australia, and Royal North Shore
Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Sydney, NSW 2065, Australia.
Background: Recruitment fatigue is known to occur in numerous trials. Many strategies have been utilised in the past in order to improve and/or maintain steady recruitment, such as use of patient screening logs. Screening logs have been shown to be effective in increasing trial recruitment but require dedicated persons to screen, which may not always be feasible.
Methods: In preparation for a 26-hospital randomised controlled trial, potentially eligible sites interested in participating in the trial were required to complete a detailed site selection survey. Interested sites recorded trial eligibility criteria information on 15 consecutive patients in a de-identified manner. Realistic minimum and maximum expected recruitment rates were then calculated for each site.
Results: After study onset, certain sites were found to be recruiting sub-optimally. Although many sites kept accurate screening logs, others were incomplete, as research coordinators worked part-time. Where no complete screening logs were available, site selection surveys were used to facilitate open communication between the site and the lead investigators. We found that site investigators, who had not previously seen the completed site selection surveys, were very responsive to the results of the survey and were motivated to work actively to improve recruitment. Minimum recruitment rates estimated by the site selection survey were then set as their future recruitment rate targets.
Conclusion: When accurate screening logs are not available, detailed site selection surveys can be used to improve sub-optimal recruitment and combat trial fatigue.

CONSORT-LIKE FLOWCHARTS IN DSMB REPORTS
Patricia Feeney, Neil Wohlford
Statistics Collaborative, Inc.
Data Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs) perform an important role in overseeing participant safety during randomized clinical trials. DSMBs generally review unblinded data and report back to the sponsor or Steering Committee. Interim reports to the DMSB typically include data by study arm that encompass enrollment, treatment, patient disposition, data collection, laboratory values, adverse events, and/or efficacy.
While DSMB reports generally include tables and listings, figures can be particularly effective in communicating overall trends. A CONSORT like (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) flowchart can provide an effective way for DSMB members to easily review the time course of participant status with respect to randomization, time on- study, treatment, and other events.
Like the CONSORT diagram used in publications of final study data, a CONSORT- like figure in a DSMB report would typically include the number of participants enrolled, randomized, treated, and discontinued by study arm relative to their time on-study. For a DSMB review, this type of figure provides an interim snapshot of relevant study data illustrating the study flow and can incorporate important reference events such as achieving study goals, completion of milestone visits, deaths, or withdrawal of consent. The report could also contain separate figures with the same layout to display events of interest particular to the study or the DSMB, such as data lag, secondary outcomes, elements of a composite outcome, or adverse events on a timescale.
We will present several examples of CONSORT-like flowcharts that can be used to enhance interim reports to DSMBs to help them monitor the ongoing safety, conduct, and efficacy of a trial in a succinct and clear manner. We will also provide an outline highlighting select SAS version 9.2 statistical graphing procedures that can be used to automate the generation of the flowcharts, saving time and reducing the possibility of transcription errors.

Specimens collected in clinical trials are an important resource for biomedical investigation. Frequently secondary analyses are conducted on specimens, or they may be banked in repositories for future access by researchers. Researchers and oversight bodies often struggle with the question of consent for secondary uses of specimens. Frequent questions include 1) whether it is acceptable to anonymize specimens which were collected for a specific purpose and use them for research outside the original scope of the project; 2) whether general consent for future unspecified use is ethically acceptable; 3) whether genetics research requires a separate specific consent; 4) when re-consent may be needed when research aims change. As recent developments in the Advance Notice of Proposed Rule-Making (ANPRM) on 45 CFR 46 have demonstrated, this area of research oversight is hotly debated. This presentation will describe three models for addressing consent for research with specimens: 1) the risk based model, where oversight is tied solely to identifiability of the materials; 2) the contribution model, where oversight is based on donors interests in controlled future use of materials, regardless of identifiability and 3) the public health model, where consent is presumed when research serves public health goals and when risks of information breaches are appropriated reduced through secure data management and in some cases, anonymization. The ethical and practical implications of these three models will be discussed.

Introduction: The Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention in New York has led current research on health-care delivery models to reduce time to treatment in oncology patients through patient navigation. Patient navigation resolves barriers, e.g. financial, socio-economic, personal obstacles that preclude adherence or completion to screening, cancer care and trial participation. This activity, begun by Harold Freeman, MD led to the Improving Access to Clinical Trials Act (IACTA) (S.1674 [111th]), signed into United States public law on October 5, 2010, amending title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act and title XIX (Medicaid) through lessening financial barriers to participation in clinical trials and increasing enrollment in clinical trials for individuals with rare diseases or conditions.
Objective: Here we explore specific barriers to care faced by cancer care patients, review the number of patients receiving navigation, its impact on treatment adherence, demonstrate the navigation process, its operational integration for decreasing barriers from their cancer care and clinical trial participation. Methods: The following subsets of data were analyzed: number of: clinical trial participants; patients receiving navigation; patients with barriers to care; and time duration for resolving these barriers. We compared the number who received navigation to those who did not and their compliance to cancer care.
Results: Of 293 participants studied at the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention, barriers to care were identified as English-language proficiency issues (insurance/financial issues), cancelled appointments, scheduling issues (lack of proper documentation as United States residents), treatment complications and pain. Conclusions: In this poster presentation we will review the outcomes for participation in clinical trials and cancer care adherence with navigation. We suggest increasing the resources for on-site foreign language translation, reducing administrative barriers for legal and non-legal residents, and continuing support of patient navigation services and hospital compliance evaluation.

entitled to free medical treatment for such injury and to such financial or other assistance as would compensate them equitably for any resultant impairment, disability or handicap. While Helsinki Declaration of World Medical Association (2008) describes that the protocol should include information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. This (no- fault) compensation is different notion from legal liability/indemnity/reparation due to malpractice or negligence in clinical trials.
Un-notified clinical trials to the authorities are still allowed in Japan, other than IND/IDE trials. The Ethical Guidelines for Clinical Studies, the only regulation for those, were fundamentally revised and enacted in April 2009, which obligate researchers to take measures on compensation such as insurance in clinical trials to assess pharmaceuticals or medical devices.
Since casualty insurance companies have not accumulated know-how to estimate the risk of un-notified trials besides IND/IDE trials, compensation insurance remains inadequate in quality; 1) Medical expense or medical allowance cannot be paid. 2) There are considerable exceptions for such clinical trials as employ anticancer agents, immunosuppressants, and implantable devices in this insurance.
In order to overcome the situation, we have set a working group of Risk-based protection of trial participants in un-notified clinical trials among academic clinical institutes and casualty company. The working group has investigated legal restriction for insurance, medical expense reduction system in the academic hospital, and an academic guideline for compensation in researcher-initiated un-notified clinical trials.

As of September 2011, there were 79 active MSKCC-coordinated multicenter protocols (MCPs) spanning six clinical departments and involving 104 unique active sites in 29 states and 5 countries. Until recently, regulatory oversight of MCPs was investigator dependent and staff efforts were duplicated around the Center. In December 2009, the MSKCC Office of Clinical Research established the Multicenter Protocols Group (MCPG) to provide institutional support for MSKCC- coordinated MCPs. The goals of the MCPG are to institute policies and procedures, as well as provide tools and training to ensure participant safety, protocol and regulatory compliance, and data integrity for all MSKCC- led MCPs.
The MCPG participates in protocol development, tracks regulatory documentation for all participating sites in MSKCCs Protocol Information Management Database, trains MSKCC research staff, manages an intranet page housing information and tools for MCP management, conducts MSKCC-based MCP regulatory audits, and advises on and reviews all participating sites audits.
Since the establishment of the MCPG, there has been an increase in the number of new participating sites opened to accrual as well as the number of inactive participating sites closed; a decrease in the average time for sites to obtain amendment approvals, from 82 to 67 days. Thirty sites were suspended for regulatory non-compliance; 93% were re- opened following corrective action. The MCPG conducted the first two regulatory audits of MSKCC-coordinated MCPs; and the study teams conducted fifteen audits of participating sites on eight protocols across four clinical departments.
Staff report that MCPG oversight has improved overall regulatory management and streamlined MCP development and oversight. The MCPG will continue tool development, quality assurance, and work closely with Clinical Research Informatics towards web- based data entry by participating sites. This poster will compare trends in regulatory compliance on MSKCC led MCPs since the inception of the MCPG and discuss MCP best practices and challenges.

USE OF BARNARDS TEST AS A MORE POWERFUL ALTERNATIVE TO FISHERS EXACT TEST Peter CalhounJaeb Center for Health Research, Tampa, FL
Although Barnards exact test is not as commonly known or used as Fishers exact test, it typically offers more statistical power for analyzing 2x2 tables. The difference between the two tests is how they handle the nuisance

parameter of the common success probability under the null hypothesis. Fishers test avoids estimating this parameter by conditioning on the margins thereby considering fewer tables and restricting the number of distinct values of the test statistic. Barnards test considers all possible values of the nuisance parameter and chooses the one that maximizes the p-value. This typically provides greater power because the discreteness is less pronounced.
A previous barrier to the widespread use of Barnards test was likely the computational burden of considering all possible values of the nuisance parameter. However, with the continuing improvements in computing speed and the implementation of Barnards test now accessible in StatXact, Matlab, and R, the computational burden is no longer a barrier.
The advantages of using Barnards test were shown when comparing the two tests by running 10,000 simulations with different sample sizes and proportions. Both tests give type 1 error rates at or below the nominal alpha level, but Fishers test was often more conservative. This resulted in less power under the alternative hypothesis. For example, when Fishers test required a sample size of 50 to achieve 90% power, Barnards test required a sample size of 44 to attain the same power (Figure).
The limitation with using Barnards test is that it only applies to 2x2 tables and often requires more computation time. However, implementing Barnards test using R with an Intel vPro processor took around 0.1, 1, and 20 seconds for sample sizes of 30, 100, and 500 respectively. Using Barnards test can require fewer observations to achieve the same level of statistical power.

INTERPRETATION AND RESULTS COMPARING FREQUENTIST AND BAYESIAN INTERIM MONITORING: SURVIVAL AND CONTINUOUS OUTCOMESAlice Pressman(1), Marnie Bertolet(2) and Alice Jacobson(1)
(1) Kaiser Permanente Division of Research; Oakland, CA USA (2) University of Pittsburgh, Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology; Pittsburgh, PA USA
Background: Frequentist group-sequential and Bayesian interim analysis techniques are increasingly promoted for improved efficiency and ethical conduct of clinical trials. However, use of these methods is seldom reported outside of data and safety monitoring boards. In addition, there are few published reviews of the different techniques. This project is a comparative effectiveness study which compares and contrasts Bayesian analyses with frequentist group-sequential analyses using examples of data from two published clinical trials. We offer interpretation and evaluation of these two types of sequential analyses. Methods: For each trial, we use a commonly utilized frequentist method (OBrien-Fleming) and implement Bayesian sequential analyses with non-informative prior. Because current practice dictates the preservation of an experiment-wise false positive rate (Type I error), we approximate these error rates for our Bayesian analyses with the posterior probability of detecting an effect in a simulated null sample. In order to consider stopping for futility, we use a frequentist group sequential inner wedge and conditional power, a concept that translates easily to the Bayesian realm. Thus for these trials, we are able to compare the relative performance of these techniques and evaluate both the Bayesian and frequentist methods. Results: In the two trials we present, Bayesian and frequentist methods lead to the same decisions about treatment efficacy or futility, however the interpretations differ. The frequentist method, more commonly reported, uses observed data to refute the hypothesis of no effect, while the Bayesian method uses the data to build a probability distribution from which to determine likelihood of effectiveness of the treatment. Conclusions: Bayesian methods provide an easily interpretable outcome distribution, however there is little emphasis on decision making. Frequentist methods provide an easy decision-making tool, but tend to be more difficult to explain. Code is provided for all analyses.

IMPLEMENTATION AND DIAGNOSTICS FOR FREQUENTIST AND BAYESIAN INTERIM MONITORING: SEQUENTIAL BOUNDS AND CHAIN CONVERGENCE IN SASMarnie Bertolet(1), Alice Pressman(2) and Alice Jacobson(2)(1)University of Pittsburgh, School of Public Health; Pittsburgh, PA USA (2)Kaiser Permanente Division of Research; Oakland, CA USA
Background: Interim analyses provided to data and safety monitoring boards in clinical trials address ethical, cost and efficacy issues. Both frequentist group-sequential and Bayesian interim monitoring approaches address these issues; however their implementation and verification involve very different steps.
Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 450 554 http://ctj.sagepub.com
Abstracts 537
Methods: SAS 9.2 has recently developed procedures to facilitate both frequentist and Bayesian interim monitoring. For frequentists, PROC SEQDESIGN and PROC SEQTEST will develop and identify interim monitoring bounds and account for sequential testing of interim results. The effects of various parameters, and the interplay between the two procedures is explained and demonstrated on a real data set. Tips and troubleshooting for these procedures are discussed. For Bayesians, a BAYES option has been introduced into PROC GENMOD, PROC PHREG and PROC LIFEREG. This option executes a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) technique to obtain draws from the posterior distribution. Tools needed to monitor convergence and techniques for improving convergence are presented and discussed.
Results: Bayesian and frequentist methods of interim monitoring will often, though not always, agree. Frequentist methods have the advantage of familiarity among trialists. Bayesian methods have the advantage of a more natural interpretation and the ability to take interim looks at any time during the analysis. They have different diagnostics and options that must be understood before implementing either method. Conclusions: Beginning with the dissemination of SAS9.2, group sequential and Bayesian methods are accessible without high-level programming expertise. SAS9.2 provides a relatively easy-to-use set of procedures that allows flexible analysis plans for clinical trials analysis. Understanding how to implement both sequential method approaches should help trialists adopt a flexible approach to choosing among available options.

ANALYSIS OF SAFETY DATA USING SAS
Thomas Bruckner, Justine Rochon, Stefan EnglertInstitute of Medical Biometry and Informatics, University Heidelberg, INF 305, G-69120 Heidelberg Germany
Data and safety monitoring committees (DMC) become more common to evaluate the safety of new therapies, especially in clinical trials with long duration, or life-threatening diseases requiring more or less dangerous therapies. The task of the DMC is to monitor independently the course of the study and recommend whether an intervention is too dangerous for patients to continue the trial or it is not ethical to continue due to efficacy of the new therapy. While efficacy analysis is mainly focused on one primary endpoint looking for differences, analysis of safety has to consider several adverse events which may occur during the course of a trial and therefore the focus lies more on rates and confidence intervals. We developed SAS-macros to calculate measures for safety analyses such as crude rates, exposure adjusted incidence rates and poisson rate ratios. Graphical methods to illustrate the course of adverse events over time include Kaplan-Meier time to event plot and mean cumulative function (1). The application of the SAS macros will be given by an example comparing two different surgical interventions within a randomized clinical trial (2). The proposed SAS-macros provide measures to evaluate the safety of an intervention with standardized tables and plots, which can be applied several times over the course of a trial. We hope this is a contribution to the wish to a DMC helping them to do their job well (3).

MULTIPLE HYPOTHESES TESTING AND SIMULTANEOUS CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
FOR MULTIPLE ADVERSE EVENT ASSESSMENT
Zhibao Mi and Joseph CollinsVA Cooperative Studies Program, Perry Point, Maryland, USA
Adverse effect assessment often involves many clinical symptoms, and each individual may experience multiple adverse events (AE) in a clinical trial. The common practice for AE analysis compares the proportions between the treatment arms by forming confidence intervals of the proportional differences or ratios for each individual AE type. However, this analysis is often not adequate, and sometimes, it may not be methodologically appropriate. We propose to analyze multiple AE data by comparing the multiple AE incidence

densities and constructing simultaneous confidence intervals of both the relative risks (RR) and the hazard ratios (HR) derived from Cox proportional hazard models. This approach usually involves multiple testing procedures that control for inflation of type I error, such as using family-wise error rate (FWER) across all AE types. Commonly used procedures include the Bonferroni-based corrections. These methods are straightforward and easy to implement, but they are conservative and reduce sensitivity. A less conservative method that considers dependencies among the various tests is employed to control for type I error by using false discovery rate (FDR). Multiple AE data from a VA/NIDA double-blinded randomized multi-center clinical trial was used to test the proposed methods clinical relevance. From the analysis, among thirty AEs, three of them were significant between two treatment arms using an unadjusted confidence interval level or significance level; when adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing, no AE was significant by controlling either FDR or FWER. Among the procedures used, the Benjamini- Hochberg-Yekutieli procedure (BHY), which controls for FDR, was more powerful when assuming a positive dependency among the multiple tests than both the Bonferroni-Holm step-down method and the simple Bonferrni procedure by controlling for FWER. However, the BHY procedure was more conservative when assuming a negative dependency among the multiple tests.

ENROLLMENT PROPENSITY WEIGHTING TO ASSESS THE GENERALIZABILITY OF A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALMarie Gantz, Darryl Creel, Wade Rich, Rosemary Higgins and Abhik Das for the SUPPORT Trial
Subcommittee of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN) RTI International, Statistics and Epidemiology Unit, Research Triangle Park, NC
Randomized trials typically enroll a convenience sample of eligible patients without regard to formal probability sampling. However, trial results often substantively change clinical practice for the population at large, without systematic evaluation of the generalizability of results.
The Surfactant Positive Airway Pressure and Pulse Oximetry Trial (SUPPORT) used a 2X2 factorial design to test different ventilation and oxygenation strategies for respiratory management of extremely premature babies. This influential and largest of its kind trial demonstrated that a less invasive ventilator strategy may be safe to use and indicated increased mortality at lower oxygen saturation.
Because intervention started upon delivery, antenatal consent was required, restricting the ability to enroll some eligible infants, including those who were born precipitously following the mothers admission. Enrolled babies had significantly higher socioeconomic status and greater exposure to antenatal steroids compared to the non-enrolled, which raised questions about the generalizability of the trial results. We conducted a sensitivity analysis by incorporating enrollment propensity weights so the analysis would better reflect the eligible population.
We used Classification and Regression Trees to model enrollment based on maternal and infant characteristics at delivery. Using the groups created by the trees, we constructed enrollment propensity weights. Then we analyzed the weighted data using models that reduced the variance based on a finite population correction. The results were largely similar to the original unweighted analysis.
Although weighting to reflect the characteristics of the larger population is common in survey statistics, to our knowledge the approach has not been used to explore the generalizability of results from randomized trials conducted on convenience samples of eligible patients. When adequate data on the eligible population are available and enrolled individuals are known to differ from those not enrolled, these methods provide a means to assess the sensitivity of trial results to such differences.

SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS IN CLUSTER RANDOMISED TRIALS WITH UNEQUAL CLUSTERS EXPERIENCE FROM TWO UK STROKE REHABILITATION TRIALS
Ivana Holloway and Amanda Farrin
Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU), University of Leeds, Leeds, UK
The aim of RCTs is to obtain unbiased estimates of treatment effects to answer the question of interest. In a cluster randomised trial (CRT), maximum statistical efficiency is obtained with equally sized clusters. In practice, the ability to achieve such balance is an exception rather than the norm. Two CRTs run by the

Abstracts 539
Leeds CTRU; TRACS (Training Caregivers After Stroke) and LoTS Care (Longer Term Stroke Care) demonstrate potential solutions to this issue.
Unequal cluster sizes decreases the statistical power in CRTs and leads to underestimated sample size.
In the TRACS trial, all centres were randomised simultaneously and unequal cluster size was not anticipated. However, the recruitment attrition rates differed by centre and the attrition rate was higher than expected. Including more clusters, each recruiting the same number of patients, would be an optimal solution. Due to time, logistics and budget constraints, the number of centres was fixed, so overall more participants were recruited and the maximum cluster size was capped. In the LoTS Care trial, imbalances were expected; centres were randomised in two phases but the recruitment period was fixed.
In both trials, we re-assessed the sample size calculations and studied the effect of conservative, typical and extreme cluster size scenarios on the statistical power. Various values of the drop-out rate, design effect and coefficient of variation were considered and the impact on statistical power was calculated. Using the most conservative estimates, the overall power dropped by 2-3% when compared to the power based on equal cluster size. For both trials, statistical power based on equal cluster size was estimated to be 90% - despite unequal cluster size, power above 80% was maintained.
Using TRACS and LoTS Care trials as examples, we have demonstrated the importance of incorporating unequal cluster sizes into calculations of robust sample size for CRTs.

MONITORING RARE EVENTS IN A SINGLE ARM NON-INFERIORITY TRIAL (111; CRUK/09/011) Roger AHern, Michael Cullen, Sally Stenning, Emma HallThe Institute of Cancer Research, Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit, Sutton, UK University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Cancer Centre, Birmingham, UK MRC Clinical Trials Unit, London, UK The Institute of
Cancer Research, Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit, Sutton, UK
Background: Futility analysis is common when seeking to demonstrate non-inferiority. When the expected event is rare careful monitoring is required. 111 is a single group trial in a very good prognosis group of patients, evaluating one cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy (BEPx1) in high risk, stage 1 non-seminomatous germ cell tumours of the testis. BEPx2 (standard treatment) is associated with a 2% 2-year recurrence rate (Cullen et al. Journal Clinical Oncology 1996).
Methods: 111 was designed to exclude a 2- year recurrence rate of >=5% and requires 236 patients (based on exact binomial probabilities). If >=230/236 patients (>=97.5%) are recurrence-free at 2 years then the trial will conclude that the event rate is <5% (power=80%, alpha=5%). A trivial futility boundary is therefore defined: if >=7 recurrences were observed the trial would be terminated, but more flexibility and guidance for interim monitoring was sought.
In calculating the recurrence rate, total follow up for each patient is taken into account. As recurrences are more likely to occur in the early months following treatment, follow up is weighted according to recurrence rates observed in previous studies. To derive appropriate beta values for each analysis we simulated several design parameters. A repeated confidence interval approach was adopted. The beta spending function was selected so that: 1) overall alpha=0.05, beta=0.20 and 2) probability of stopping after 1 recurrence is very low. Results: The chosen rule was that at each recurrence the estimated rate and its exact confidence interval (CI) would be calculated. If the lower limit of this CI exceeded 2% then the trial would stop recruiting. Conclusions: A sequential interim monitoring plan has been developed. This methodology could be adopted in other studies to ensure that a rare event rate does not exceed a pre- specified threshold.

Background: Reliable intermediate outcome measures are needed to assess clinical interventions in the current era of HIV treatment. We evaluated the performance of the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Index that uses routine clinical biomarkers to predict mortality as a surrogate outcome for randomized clinical trials.

540 Abstracts
Methods: VACS Index scores were determined from data collected in the Options In Management with Antiretrovirals (OPTIMA) multi-national study of treatment strategies in patients with advanced HIV (Holodniy, 2011). OPTIMA data were used to validate the use of the VACS Index in a cohort of late-stage HIV patients. Proportional hazards regression and survival analysis using baseline VACS Index scores and changes in score during treatment were used to assess the utility of the index as an outcome for future clinical trials. Results: VACS Index scores at baseline correlated highly with mortality and with time to death in the advanced HIV patients enrolled in OPTIMA (Kirkwood, 2011; c = 0.749). Baseline score and change in score over 48 weeks of treatment were equally associated with all-cause mortality (c = 0.783).
Conclusions: The VACS Index accurately predicted mortality and responded to changes in treatment. Measuring changes in VACS Index scores over relatively short time periods may offer an efficient alternative endpoint for the design of randomized clinical interventions among patients with HIV.

RESPONSIVE RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES TO MAXIMISE RECRUITMENT: EXPERIENCE
FROM NATIONAL UK STROKE TRIALS
Shamaila Anwar, Suzanne Hartley, Lorna Barnard, Sharon Ruddock, Amanda Farrin University of Leeds, Leeds, UK
Recruiting to target sample size is key to the success of all research yet continues to pose a significant problem. Potential barriers are often unknown at the time of securing funding and trials must have processes in place to identify and respond to these barriers. We present our experience from three UK publically funded multicentre RCTs of stroke patients and discuss ways in which recruitment strategies were adapted and refined to help achieve target recruitment.
The main approaches we used focused on the site feasibility and the collection of screening data.
Site feasibility and selection is used to understand the implementation and delivery of trials within existing services and provides recruitment estimates. This process revealed potential capacity and resource constraints which were subsequently used to facilitate discussion with service providers and allow appropriate allocation of funds. The recruitment estimates are used to engage in discussion with site during the recruitment phase to identify further barriers to target. Systematic collection of screening data from time of recruitment is reviewed monthly and is used to identify trends in the reasons for non-recruitment. This process led to changes in the recruitment and consent procedures to simplify the patient information and to allow obtaining consent on the same day as the provision of information. Eligibility criteria are reviewed and amended where clinically and scientifically valid. Amendments included increasing the time window of recruitment and allowing co-enrolment into other trials.
Barriers to trials achieving target recruitment are multifaceted and trial teams need to be responsive to adapt trial processes accordingly. We have shown that the systematic identification of barriers from the time of site selection and during recruitment is essential and allows the trial to adapt to meet target sample size. Data on the impact of the changes on recruitment will be presented.

contribute to antibiotic resistance motivated a noninferiority clinical trial to compare the efficacy of empiric treatment with two antibiotics, azithromycin and cefixime, with placebo for MPC not attributed to STIs. The plan was to screen 3,357 women to enroll 772 participants with MPC, based on an estimated MPC prevalence of 23%. In one year, 577 women were screened at one family planning (FP) and 3 sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinics, and 131 (23%) met the definition of clinical MPC: presence of cervical discharge and/ or easily induced cervical bleeding on pelvic exam. Eighty-seven (66%) women enrolled on the trial, 31 (24%) were excluded due to the presence of an STI, 10 (8%) met another exclusion criterion, and 3 (2%) chose not to participate. The number of women screened per enrolled participant was 4.6 and 7.0 from FP and STD clinics, respectively. Some entry laboratory test results were not available until after enrollment. They identified 32 participants who were ineligible for the study: 24 had positive results for STIs and 8 did not have > 30 WBCs per high power field on the cervical gram stain, a measure of inflammation. Fifty-five women met all eligibility criteria. The study was terminated due to low accrual. Among women with MPC, 42% had one or more STIs, mainly among those enrolled at STD clinics. Future studies of MPC with unknown etiology should consider recruiting from FP clinics or factor in the high rate of exclusions due to STIs among women recruited through STD clinics.

In Europe requirements for conducting clinical trials with medical devices were changed fundamentally by the council directive 2007/47/EC (2007). Meanwhile the international standard ISO 14155:2011 and the German Medical Device Act have been amended accordingly. All these regulations demand appropriately qualified investigational site teams. A certified training curriculum was established in order to develop the required operational competence. It was not only harmonized within the German Clinical Trials Center (CTC)-network, but also reconciled with ethics committees as they examine the qualification of investigators. The curriculum was designed as a two-stage process. It was based on an already well established 2-day training course for investigators focusing on ICH-GCP E6 and German regulations for clinical trials with medicinal products. This course was supplemented by an advanced half-day course for medical devices. This half-day course concentrates on the characteristic requirements of the federal authority and ethics committees, the newly set up electronic application procedure, and the electronic SAE- reporting obligation of sponsor and investigators. In the next step we established a standalone training course qualifying investigators for trials with medical devices without previous knowledge of conducting clinical trials. The curriculum covers all regulatory specifications, good clinical practice, uses incorporated didactic quizzes to upgrade learning effects, and considers the characteristics of Investigator Initiated Trials (IITs). With their know-how and academy CTCs are important components in the field of qualifying for conducting clinical trials with medical devices even beyond the scope of IITs. Our report will show the challenges of developing these certified training courses for investigational site teams. And it presents the experiences of the CCT Cologne conducting these courses and the evaluation by attending investigators.

In February 2010, the Office of Clinical Research (OCR), at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), established an institutional clinical research monitoring program for MSKCC-sponsored studies.
Although MSKCC has an extensive Data and Safety Monitoring plan which includes institutional and clinical department auditing, the focus on protocol compliance auditing only comprises a small percentage of the institutional portfolio in a given year (<15%). The new clinical research monitoring program focuses on in-house, investigator-initiated, MSKCC-sponsored studies, for which no outside organization provides monitoring or oversight. The goal of the monitoring program is to provide real time oversight of approximately 40% of MSKCC investigator initiated studies.
In order to achieve this goal we developed the following: a set of criteria to evaluate protocols in our institutional portfolio for monitoring priority; documents to conduct protocol compliance, data verification, and regulatory documentation review; and guidelines for selection of participants to be monitored per visit. In addition, we identified department monitors and established written procedures for them to follow in the program.
To determine the outcome of the monitoring visits, we created a rating system. Consistently high quality monitoring visits for a particular protocol would allow transition of that protocol off the monitored list and allow for us to initiate review of another protocol. Guidelines for serious and unresolved issues were also established which included suspension of new accruals for continuous unacceptable ratings. To keep a record of the monitoring visits, an access database to collect the summary letters of each visit and enter relevant data was created.
In this poster presentation we will review our evaluation of the program and determine whether we are achieving our goal of real time oversight of 40% of our investigator initiated studies. We will also outline the challenges we encountered and methods we are developing to improve the program.

LESSONS LEARNED: EFFECTIVE TRAINING STRATEGIES FOR ELECTRONIC DATA CAPTURING Siobhan Tobin, Asma Qureshi, Johanna Sanchez, Dalah Mason, Denice Feig, Elizabeth Asztalos The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research Sunnybrook Research Institute Toronto, Ontario, Canada
Metformin in Women with Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy Trial (MiTy) is a multi-center, double masked, randomized placebo-controlled trial for pregnant women with type 2 diabetes. With 500 recruits expected from 25 participating centers across Canada, MiTy seeks to determine the effect of the addition of Metformin to a standard regimen of insulin on perinatal morbidity and mortality. Study sites are required to record specific outcomes for each study participant in prenatal visit forms every four weeks, based on gestational age at randomization. In order to accurately capture the complex nature of this large amount of data, it was decided that electronic data capture (EDC) would be more effective than paper data collection.

Since EDC is a recent system, a strategy for disseminating user training was required. Collaborators participated in a three hour training session in which they were guided through a simulation that involved entering patient data into an EDC program. Due to differences in technical skills, abilities and learning styles, it was evident that the majority of the participants did not gain a comprehensive knowledge of how to use the EDC program. Following this, three separate strategies were implemented to provide more effective training.
First, an EDC test website was created in which collaborators could enter simulated data to become proficient with the system. This allowed collaborators to familiarize themselves with the program according to their own skill level and pace. Next, a section in the Study Manual was created with step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting for further clarification. Lastly, email and phone support was offered to remedy problems that could not be resolved by the Study Manual.
These strategies proved both cost-effective and successful in providing collaborators with comprehensive EDC training.

INTRODUCTION: Patient recruitment in clinical trials often takes longer than expected. Trials with slow recruitment are more costly and an insufficient sample size leads to indecisive conclusions. We identified factors influencing recruitment in clinical trials. DESIGN We sent a questionnaire to principle investigators of all 1130 trials prospectively registered in the Netherlands Trial Register with an expected date of completing recruitment between 2005 and 2010. We used logistic regression analysis to assess whether characteristics of the trial or the principle investigator were associated with successful recruitment, i.e. 80% of the targeted number of patients was recruited within the planned time. RESULTS Of 392 trials questionnaires were completed. For these trials 232,707 persons were to be recruited. In half of the trials recruitment was unsuccessful. Although 42% of the trials were extended for ?6 months, when closing recruitment 46% still had recruited fewer patients than originally intended. Of the investigators 67% stated recruitment was more difficult than expected. Factors univariably associated with unsuccessful recruitment were: clear responsibilities for recruitment, investigator not PhD, multicenter trial, presentation at start for recruiters, newsletter for recruiters, pocket cards, email at start of the trial and a low expected number of randomizations per month. In multivariable analysis, adjusted for potential confounders, associated with recruitment were having a PhD (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0,17-0,83) and giving a presentation at start of the trial for recruiters (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.64) - the latter might be indicative for complexity of a trial. CONCLUSION Investigators frequently overestimate recruitment success when starting a trial. Although we identified factors associated with recruitment, we are unable to make general recommendations for improving recruitment. A possible limitation of this study is the risk for selective responses and unmeasured confounders. Investigators should be aware of potential recruitment difficulties when starting a new trial.

The role of glucocorticoid receptor single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in receptor function and metabolic disease is being studied at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). This in vivo and in vitro observational gene association study investigates functional relevance of SNPs in the NR3C1 gene. Individuals with and without functionally relevant SNPs are identified and recruited from the Environmental Polymorphism Registry (EPR). The EPR is a DNA biorepository of over 15,000 participants

developed at NIEHS to help researchers better understand relationships between environmental exposures, genetic susceptibility and disease. The primary objective is to investigate in vivo the role of hGR SNPs (hGR9b A3669G, hGR N363S) in steroid responsiveness using dexamethasone and comparing serum cortisol levels by genotype. Initial comparisons indicate some hGR9b A3669G carriers are resistant to dexamethasone. The secondary objective is to investigate the role of hGR SNPs (hGR9b A3669G, hGR N363S) in human steroid responsiveness by comparing gene expression profiles of macrophages exposed ex vivo to corticosteroids. A pilot microarray study on macrophages without hGR SNPs revealed that although there is great variability in gene regulation between individuals, treatment with dexamethasone significantly altered gene regulation. These initial study results suggest functional relevance of hGR SNPs in the NR3C1 gene. The study is also the first EPR study conducted at the NIEHS Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and will help define and enhance operations of future EPR studies, including recruitment strategies.

ENSURING SUCCESSFUL ADHERENCE TO STUDY REQUIREMENTS IN A MULTI-CENTRE STUDY Asma Qureshi, Siobhan Tobin, Johanna Sanchez, Dalah Mason, Denice Feig, Elizabeth Asztalos The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research Sunnybrook Research Institute Toronto, Ontario, Canada
Metformin in Women with Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy Trial (MiTy) is a multi-centre, double-masked, randomized placebo-controlled trial for pregnant women with type 2 diabetes. With 500 recruits expected from 25 participating centres across Canada, MiTy seeks to determine whether the addition of Metformin to their usual insulin regimen, will decrease the incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes. Study sites are required to schedule prenatal visits for study participants every four weeks, based on gestational age at randomization.
At MiTy prenatal visits, collaborators are required to supply study drug, distribute glucose strips, take specific blood tests, measure serum creatinine, download glucometer readings, and count pills to verify patient compliance, in addition to routine standard care. Prenatal visit information is then entered on the prenatal visit form following each patient appointment. Specific strategies were needed to help collaborators keep track of prenatal visit schedules; identify which tasks were required to be completed at each visit; and to indicate when to complete the prenatal forms. Therefore, several tools were developed to ensure successful adherence to the study requirements.
A study manual was created to explain the specifics on how to manage the trial. This included a timeline with descriptions of tasks to be completed at particular stages during the patients pregnancy, as well as checklists of tasks to be completed at each appointment. Prenatal visit appointment schedules were programmed upon randomization, notifying study coordinators of the exact week to schedule prenatal visits according to gestational age. Appointment reminders were emailed one week prior to the appointment, along with consistent email and telephone communication. Furthermore, centres receive tips and reminders through the monthly MiTy newsletter, group teleconferences, and regional meetings.
This presentation will share successful approaches used to ensure adherence to study requirements.

Assessment of the change in tumor size in response to treatment is critical in the evaluation of anti-cancer agents. The purpose of this presentation is to review the status of standardized solid tumor response criteria published since the early 1980s including WHO criteria, RECIST 1.0, RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST 1.0. The existing criteria (WHO, RECIST 1.0, RECIST 1.1) will be compared in terms of number of target lesion requirement at baseline, lymph node usage in the calculation of tumor size, the requirement of confirmatory responses as well as other specific criteria used in the existing guidelines. Similarities and differences between the tumor assessment criteria will be illustrated using specific examples. Consideration of unidimensional and bidimensional measurements as well as the possibility of three-dimensional analyses will be discussed. New imaging techniques such as FDG-PET and MRI in tumor assessment as well as treatment classification, specifically cytostatic, will be examined. Non-measurable disease at baseline will also be considered with

University of Oklahoma Health Science Center, Oklahoma City, OK (USA); George Washington University, Rockville, MD (USA); OKC Area Indian Health Service, Oklahoma City, OK (USA); Absentee Shawnee Tribe, Little Axe, OK (USA); Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, Tahlequah, OK (USA); the Chickasaw Nation, Tishomingo, OK (USA); Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Durant, OK (USA); and University of Oklahoma Health Science Center, Oklahoma City, OK (USA)
Background: Historically, there have been significant barriers to conducting research in tribal communities, including a lack of understanding of American Indian (AI) culture and research. Methods: Spring of 2002, University of Oklahoma Health Science Center (OUHSC) and four AI Tribe/Nations with Institutional Review Boards (IRB) (Absentee Shawnee Tribe, Cherokee Nation, the Chickasaw Nation, Choctaw Nation) and OKC Area Indian Health Service (IHS) IRB (collectively AI Partner(s)) proposed to participate in one of the largest pediatric diabetes research trials supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This venture required an agreement between AI Nations and academic university addressing essential elements: trust, collaboration, and successful outcome. Results: The four AI Tribe/Nations executed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). The MOA stipulated: 1) AI Coordinator hired to foster relationships, assist with recruitment, and facilitate pre- review by AI Partners of publications containing AI descriptive data. Sixty-one (61) AI patients were screened and forty (40) of those patients randomized into the TODAY Study. 2) Establish a committee comprised of AI Partner representatives to review publications. The committee meets for monthly publication updates with regular communication between meetings. The committee has met approximately 20 times and has reviewed approximately 50 items. Presentation will describe the efforts in retaining tribal partnerships including barriers that arose and resolutions. Conclusions: After 9 years, 4 AI IRBs and OKC IHS IRB have created and maintained a successful collaboration with an academic university in a large clinical trial. This multi-tribal research partnership is an excellent model of how community and multi-ethnic collaborative research can be effective.

Purpose: To ascertain the experiences and perceptions of participation in cancer clinical trials by Hispanic and Black cancer survivors.
Methods: As part of a larger study to develop a decision aid for participation in cancer clinical trials, we conducted semi-structured interviews with English-speaking Hispanic (15), Spanish- speaking Hispanic (15), and Black (15) cancer survivors. We employed quantitative content analysis to code responses to 16 specific questions based on transcripts from the interviews.
Results: The average age of participants was 56.0 (SD 10.6) years; 93.3% were female, with most having had breast cancer (66.7%). Years since diagnosis ranged from 1-16, with an average of 3.3 (SD 3.0). Only 4 had been asked to participate in a clinical trial, and of these, 3 had joined a trial. Although only 4 had talked with a provider about participating, 23 (54.8%) wished that such a conversation had happened. In addition, 32 (71.1%) said that they would be willing to participate in a trial, and another 8 (17.8%) said that they may be willing.

Almost all, 97.8%, said that it would be helpful to hear other cancer patients experiences with clinical trials. However, most (81.8%) stated that it would not make any difference if the people relaying the experiences were of the participants own race/ethnicity. Rather, information from someone with their own type of cancer was viewed as very important by 36%.
Conclusions: Although few participants had even talked about clinical trials with their health care providers, most cancer survivors expressed willingness to participate. These findings highlight the need for discussions about clinical trials between physicians and patients. Increasing cancer patients knowledge and self-efficacy to discuss clinical trials with healthcare providers, for example through a decision aid, may lead to a much needed increase in participation rates.

Purpose: Participation in cancer clinical trials is very low, particularly for minority cancer patients. The goal of this research was to develop a web-based decision aid to improve minority cancer patients decision making about whether to participate in a clinical trial.
Methods: Steps in developing the decision aid were: a) collecting information on barriers and promoters of participation; b) developing a theoretical framework to conceptualize the decision aid components; c) using cognitive interviewing to pilot test the decision aid; and d) testing the decision aid to determine its effects on attitudes and knowledge about cancer clinical trials. Information was collected using 3 complementary approaches: a) data from a telephone survey of 1100 cancer survivors; b) a literature review; and most importantly, c) semi-structured interviews with cancer survivors. All participants were either Hispanic or Black. Results: For the semi-structured interviews, 45 participants were recruited. The information from the 3 sources was used to develop the KEV (Knowledge, Empowerment, and Values) framework for the decision aid. The website was developed, and successfully pilot tested with 8 participants. Currently, we are assessing the effectiveness of the decision aid to improve patients knowledge about clinical trials, empower them to talk with their health care provider about trials, and clarify their values and preferences related to trials participation in 100 participants. Assessment of the effect of the decision aid is done by comparing knowledge, attitudes, and decisional conflict about clinical trials before and after viewing the decision aid. Conclusions: While quantitative data on the effectiveness and acceptability of the decision aid is not yet available, feedback from the participants has been extremely positive. Participants knowledge increases, and many state that they wish they had had such an instrument when they were first diagnosed. Our ultimate goal is to make this decision aid widely available.

DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES FOR A MULTI-TRIAL DATA COORDINATING CENTRECeris Robinson, Johanna Sanchez, Dalah Mason, Elizabeth AsztalosCentre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA
The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research (CMICR) was established to improve the health of women and their children through clinical research and education. As the data coordinating centre for several international randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is imperative that all trial operations are completed in a consistent manner to ensure maintenance of a quality management system. Thus, in adherence to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, CMICR uses written standard operating procedures (SOPs) in its daily operations. In a team setting, it is especially important to have a standard set of detailed SOPs, along with clear, well-established rules to follow. This allows for the management of various aspects of the organization to be structured and easily maintained. In previous years, each trial team created and maintained their

individual SOPs. This resulted in varying procedures between each study and a lack of detail, which was addressed in the new format. Various methods were employed to identify the most effective way to achieve uniformity of all SOPs. A staff member was designated the specific role of standardizing all trial SOPs to ensure consistency. The existing SOP system was reviewed over a three month period to assist in developing an improved structure. This new structure includes a revised coding system, as well as improved methods for archiving and updating task-specific SOPs. A template was also created to ensure a simple, easy-to-read layout of all newly established SOPs. In addition, to assist in the implementation of the new SOP system, specific guidelines were established on how to create an SOP document. All SOPs are submitted to the designated staff member for review, and are made accessible to all staff. These revisions to the SOP system have addressed inconsistencies, and created cohesion throughout the organization.

DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE SITE FEASIBILITY QUESTIONNAIRE FOR THE SITE SELECTION PROCESS Johanna Sanchez, Dalah Mason, Elizabeth Asztalos
The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research, Sunnybrook Research Institute Toronto, Ontario, Canada
The Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research (CMICR) is the data coordinating centre and administrative site for several large, multi-centre, international randomized controlled trials that aim to improve clinical practice and the health outcomes of women and their children. CMICR has established an international collaborative group of research sites that may simultaneously participate in several CMICR-coordinated trials. It has become evident that successful recruitment and protocol adherence of a site in one CMICR-coordinated trial does not guarantee its success in another, and in trials with limited budgets and timelines, identifying suitable sites is vital. To assist in the site evaluation and selection process, CMICR developed an improved trial-specific Site Feasibility Questionnaire (SFQ).
The revised SFQ developed by CMICR includes four main sections. The first, Study Background, includes the research summary, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and outlines the study requirements. In the second section, Site Information, sites are asked to provide information about their experience and performance in other research trials, resource information (i.e. research staff, facilities, equipment), and the total number of patients that meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria annually. The third section, Study Protocol Requirements, is important in determining whether the site will be able to adhere to the study protocol. Sites are asked about their local standard of care and whether they will be able to follow the schedule of events and carry out all the required tasks. The final section covers recruitment topics and sites are asked to explain any anticipated difficulties with the trial. Once the centre has reviewed the protocol and considered all survey responses, the final requirement is to provide their expected annual recruitment goal.
The presentation will share how to write an effective Site Feasibility Questionnaire that will help in site evaluation and selection process.

RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF TRIAL SUBJECTS IN THE 21ST CENTURY: INSIGHTS FROM EXPERIENCE FOM CONDUCTING SEVERAL RECENT LARGE
INTERNATIONAL TRIALS IN CARDIOLOGY
Susan ChrolaviciusMcMaster University Hamilton, ON Canada
Ensuring timely recruitment of appropriate subjects into clinical trials is not only a measure of study discipline, it provides economic efficiencies and also ensures that study results will be relevant since they are reflective of current practice. We have developed processes to ensure the timely recruitment of appropriate subjects and will provide suggestions and examples from several large international trials involving over 500 hospitals in more than 40 countries. Not only is timely recruitment essential to success of the trial, adherence to the trial intervention and complete follow-up on all patients is critical. We have developed tools to encourage compliance and prevent potential lost to follow-up . We will also present examples of specific impediments to follow-up. Among these examples is recent privacy legislation enacted in some countries which has fostered an environment of uncertainty and caution at many investigating sites. There is a perception that individual rights can take precedence over the completeness and accuracy of the clinical trial results. Site personnel have refused to follow any patient who has withdrawn his/her consent. We will

MONITORING BLOOD SAMPLE COLLECTION AND SHIPMENT IN A PUBLICLY FUNDED POST THROMBOTIC SYNDROME (PTS) RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT)
Adrielle H. Houweling, Vicky Springmann, Stan Shapiro and Susan R. Kahn
McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
Successful blood sample collection in multi-center trials could be achieved through the implementation of a trial-specific Quality Assurance Monitoring System (QAMS) that ensures the high-quality sample retrieval needed for optimal biomarker measurement. In the SOX Trial, a Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Heart & Stroke Foundation funded multi-center RCT of active vs. placebo stockings to prevent PTS in 803 patients with acute proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), blood specimen samples were collected within the first 6-mths of diagnosis to evaluate whether biomarkers reflective of inflammation, coagulation activation and genetic thrombophilia influence PTS development. At baseline, 1 and 6-mth visits, blood samples drawn from consenting patients were processed, aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes, frozen at -80C and batched from 24 study sites to the Trial Coordinating Centre (TCC) for central storage according to study Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) instructions. Specimens were then assessed for quality based on these standards: sample recovery (SR), correct sample type (CST), adequate sample volume (ASV) and correct tube labeling (CTL). For buffy-coat collection, all 4 criteria were met for 79% of samples: 99.2%, 79.9%, 99.8% and 100% for SR, CST, ASV and CTL standards, respectively. For platelet-poor plasma collection, all 4 criteria were met for 94.3% of samples: 97.7%, 98.2%, 99% and 100% for SR, CST, ASV and CTL, respectively. In general, we noted that sites with lower overall quality were those with a lower patient retention rate, frequent coordinator turnovers, and sample processing left to study personnel. Development of site-directed SOPs followed by routine TCC quality checks for sample integrity are two economical ways to implement a successful QAMS in budget-limited government-funded studies; these mechanisms help safeguard sample quality, reduce missing data and enhance credibility of study results. Additional site-specific monitoring may also be warranted for study sites with poor performance and limited resources.

CHALLENGES AND STRATEGIES IN THE START-UP PHASE OF LARGE, INTERNATIONAL
CLINICAL TRIALS IN CARDIAC SURGERY
Jessica VincentPopulation Health Research Institute, Hamilton Health Sciences/ McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada
There are unique challenges faced in the conduct of clinical trials in the relatively new research field of cardiac surgery. Several strategies have been implemented in the start-up phase of a large, international, publically-funded clinical trial in cardiac surgery (the Steroids in Cardiac Surgery (SIRS) trial) to address these challenges.
Currently, the largest published clinical trial in cardiac surgery is the ROOBY trial which recruited 2203 patients from 18 centers. SIRS will recruit 7500 patients from approximately 85 centers in 18 countries, making it the largest clinical trial conducted in cardiac surgery to date (recruitment as of Nov. 30, 2011 was 1919). From the experience of starting-up SIRS, many challenges were identified and strategies have been used which can be translated to other research fields, particularly to trials being conducted in new disease research areas.
The most common challenges faced during the start-up phase of a large, international clinical trial are: adhering to project timelines; dealing with various country-specific regulatory issues; identifying appropriate clinical sites; and ensuring proper study conduct for the duration of the trial. In SIRS, there were the added unique challenges of being a study in a fairly new clinical research field with many novice investigators and without an established global cardiac surgery research network, as well as having limited funding. These challenges and the implemented strategies used to address these obstacles have been outlined in Table 1.
Conducting global clinical research is complex and involves many hurdles, especially in a relatively new area such as cardiac surgery. SIRS will hopefully pave the way for future large clinical trials in cardiac surgery

EMMES Corporation, Rockville, MD, USA
Under the Best Pharmaceutical for Children Act (BPCA), the protocol Use of Lorazepam for the Treatment of Pediatric Status Epilepticus: A Randomized, Double- Blinded Trial of Lorazepam and Diazepam, changed from one Clinical Research Organization (CRO) to another CRO mid- study. The transition included moving from paper to electronic case report forms (CRFs).
The transition involved four steps: 1) transferring the datasets from the previous CROs data format to the new data format, 2) creating a user-friendly electronic data capture system that included all required fields and any new fields desired by the sponsor, 3) accurately mapping and uploading the data from the previous CRO to the new system and 4) transitioning the sites to the new system. To streamline these processes, collaboration with the previous CRO, the study sponsor, and the coordinators performing the data entry was essential. Building the electronic data system required identifying all required fields, determining the format of data fields, changing free text fields to drop-down fields, adding new fields requested by the sponsor, obtaining any data quality checks implemented by the previous CRO, and assuring sponsor approval for all changes made to the data collection procedures. All uploaded data required extensive quality control to assure the accuracy of the mapped data.
Site transition involved creating a plan for the collection of ongoing data while the electronic system was in process, including reporting of serious adverse events and protocol deviations, and training the sites on the new system. Soliciting input from the site coordinators on the data collection process was valuable in improving efficiency of and satisfaction with the new data collection system.

NIAID AUDITING SERVICES PROGRAM (NASP): PROVIDING WORLDWIDE QUALITY ASSURANCE AUDITS OF DAIDS MONITORING FUNCTIONSJan S. Peterson, Suheila Abdul-Karrim, Michael Fillius, and E. Michelle BushThe EMMES Corporation, Rockville, Maryland, Unites States (Peterson, Fillius and Bush); Johannesburg, South
Africa (Abdul-Karrim)
Background: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) invests heavily in the conduct of clinical trials benefiting public health. For the Division of AIDS (DAIDS), trial quality is managed in part through a risk-based monitoring program performed by contract monitors. Prior to 2010, these monitoring functions were not subject to independent review. In 2010, DAIDS began sponsoring an independent auditing program to assess the quality and effectiveness of the contract monitoring. We report on the development and progress of these quality assurance (QA) audits during the first 2 years of the auditing contract, where ~90 QA audits were conducted, and on their preliminary impact on the DAIDS monitoring program. Methods: Using an independent contractor for the NIAID Auditing Services Program (NASP), QA auditors sampled monitoring reports and performed on-site audits at selected clinical research sites (CRSs). About 12 CRSs were chosen quarterly based on several qualifying criteria, including monitoring report content and risk level of protocols. Routine NASP audits are characterized primarily as performance audits rather than Good Clinical Practice (GCP) audits, since DAIDS procedures for the monitoring contractor are very focused due to the risk-based monitoring program design. Teams of NASP auditors based in the United States, South Africa, and Brazil were trained on DAIDS-specific procedures and the same instructions provided to monitors. Auditors reviewed a sample of the same materials that were previously monitored, and reported directly to the DAIDS sponsor on any findings.
Results: From over 740 CRSs in nearly 50 countries, over 1170 on-site monitoring visits were performed at about 233 CRSs in 21 countries over the past 2 years. Sampling those visits, ~90 NASP audits were completed in 14 countries, with no critical and few major findings observed. Several findings led directly to significant improvements in DAIDS monitoring policies and procedures.

PROVISION OF COVERAGE ANALYSIS IN MULTI-SITE CLINICAL TRIALS AIDS ALL SITES AND PARTICULARLY SMALLER, COMMUNITY-BASED PRACTICES
Kelly Willenberg, Laurence Baker
Chesnee, South Carolina, University of Micigan
Over the past decade, the administrative burden of clinical trials has become an issue of national concern. One significant component of the bureaucracy is ensuring compliant billing practices.
Where a coverage analysis at a single site may take as many as eight hours to complete, the inefficiency of this being repeated by every site in a multi-institution clinical trial highlights an unnecessary burden.
One cooperative group, SWOG, piloted providing a coverage analysis to its sites and found the utility of doing so most benefited lower-accruing sites, who reported the most time spent completing analyses for trials they participated in and with the least resources to do so. The pilot also revealed that some sites had not yet adopted a practice of completing a coverage analyses, pointing to the increased risk of clinical billing fraud. With the future of cancer research diverging from standard of care and into innovative new directions such as biomarker discovery, the current federal funding system for cancer research requires processes to ensure compliant billing.
In multi-institutional clinical trials, having the sponsor providing a coverage analysis using national guidelines and standards adds efficiency to an administratively over- burdened clinical trial management process. Further, the provision of a sponsor-provided coverage analysis particularly benefits the lower-accruing sites in reducing the risk of fraudulent billing. Cancer research sponsors can easily support success and continued participation by community practices by providing coverage analyses.

IMPLEMENTATION OF LIKELIHOOD-BASED CONTINUAL REASSESSMENT METHOD
DESIGNS IN DOSE FINDING TRIALS
Emily Van Meter, Stacey Slone, Heidi Weiss, Jeri Reynolds, Jay Hayslip University of Kentucky, Markey Cancer Center, Lexington, KY, USA
Many dose finding designs including the continual reassessment method (CRM) have been shown as statistically advantageous over traditional up down methods such as the 3+3. However, these designs have been slow to gain popularity as they can be computationally intensive, often need specialized software, and require additional input during protocol development. We present a practical application that utilizes the likelihood-based CRM to monitor an ongoing investigator initiated 3+3 phase I trial for lymphoma patients at the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center. During this trial, dose-limiting toxicities were redefined and there were concerns about the flexibility of the 3+3 to accommodate these changes mid-cohort. Since the CRM accommodates various cohort sizes and makes use of all accrued patient toxicity information to estimate the dose closest to the maximum tolerated dose at any point in the trial, we monitored the ongoing trial to confirm dose escalation rules according to the 3+3 were appropriate. Additionally, we compared operating characteristics of various CRM designs that accommodate ordinal or binary toxicity grades. We describe what information was needed to construct the initial design as well as how current accrued toxicity data was included in the model to estimate the next dose needed, using the R package ordcrm. Interestingly, this monitoring exercise gave clinical investigators, biostatisticians, and other research team members the opportunity to learn more about the likelihood-based CRM and gain information regarding the logistical issues and advantages of applying this design in practice. Not only did this verify that the CRM is feasible to implement and incorporates more toxicity information throughout the trial, but it has educated clinical research team members on this alternative dose finding design and has sparked interest in using the likelihood-based CRM as the design in future trials.

The utilization of randomization in phase II trials is increasingly being recommended in the evaluation of anticancer therapies prior to pursuing larger phase III trials. Randomized comparisons offer protection against selection bias and are needed when historical control data are not available for designing a new trial. Several candidate randomized designs can be considered depending on trial design and objectives. A phase II randomized trial in breast cancer of two candidate targeted therapies is planned in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The study endpoints are tumor response rate and progression-free survival (PFS). We consider different study designs to determine patient number requirements and assess feasibility and performance of the trial design under different scenarios. Specifically, we utilize i) selection design (design A); ii) two-stage selection design (design B); iii) screening design (design C); and iv) two-stage randomized phase II trial design (design D). Given the null and alternative hypotheses assumptions for response and PFS endpoints of this particular breast cancer trial, patient number requirements are reasonable across all potential trial designs. Designs C and D offer more conclusive results given the hypothesis-testing strategy of these designs. For the particular regimens and clinical problem being addressed in this phase II breast cancer trial, we favor the use of designs C or D which, although requiring slightly bigger patient numbers, affords more definitive conclusions on whether to proceed to a larger phase III trial. It is important to carefully assess a particular clinical trial scenario to decide not only whether to proceed with a single arm, historical control design but also the most appropriate randomized design if the latter is of interest.

RANKING AND SELECTION DESIGN OF A PHASE IIA HIV VACCINE CLINICAL TRIAL IN CHINA WITH THREE ACTIVE ARMS AND MULTIPLE ENDPOINTS OF INTEREST

Control and Prevention, Beijing, China
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has successfully completed phase Ia and Ib clinical trials of one of their leading HIV vaccine candidates in 2010. While China is committed to launch its first HIV vaccine efficacy trial, it is important to appropriately choose the most promising vaccine regimen to advance from Phase IIa safety and immunogenicity testing to later phase efficacy testing. The candidate vaccine regimen is comprised of 3 DNA prime immunizations followed by one replicating Tiantan Vaccinia (rTV) virus vector boost. Since the timing of the vector boost will have great impact on the potency and longevity of the vaccine-induced immune responses, the Phase IIa trial is designed to evaluate 3 different boosting schedules and to select the best to advance to efficacy testing. For Phase IIa testing, since multiple immunogenicity and safety endpoints with an ordering of preference are of interest for assessment with respect to clinical and biological relevance and importance, we propose a ranking and selection design that accounts for multiple endpoints of different types and allows for equal ranking when vaccine arms are indistinguishable within certain pre-specified margin from the best arm. Bootstrap-based evaluation of the precision of ranking is performed for each endpoint. In addition, to prevent advancing any vaccine arms from trials with uniformly week candidates, we require that a vaccine regimen to be selected must exceed an absolute minimum response probability and/or magnitude threshold. Sample size calculations are performed to evaluate how many vaccinees per arm are needed to achieve high probability of correctly selecting the arm with the best combination of 4 endpoints. Preliminary simulation results show that such selection design performs well. As the distinction between the best arm(s) and inferior arm(s) becomes larger, the selection accuracy increases. Overall the probabilities of incorrect selection are low.

We intend to apply a contingency two-stage evaluation of vaccine efficacy (VE), where durability of VE over a range of 0-3 years will be evaluated in Stage 2 if and only if positive VE proximal (e.g. over the first 18-24 months) to the immunization series is detected in Stage 1. Such a strategy is under consideration for the design of future HVTN trials in South Africa which may launch after the start of this China trial. To foster the most synergetic collaboration, we expect to work with a collaborative trial design team including representatives from trial sponsors, regulators, vaccine developers, manufactures, the Institutional Review Board of China CDC and key HIV vaccine researchers from both US and China. We acknowledge that the design phase will be highly iterative in order to finalize various context-driven trial design parameters, including study population, trial endpoint, type I and type II error rate level, trial outcome monitoring type and monitoring plan. Because the primary HIV vaccine trial sponsors are, for the first time, outside of US and the design expertise is primarily from the US, experience gained and lessons learned during such a process will be a treasure to share with the international clinical trial community.

DESIGN OF A NEONATAL INTERVENTION BASED ON JOINT EVALUATION
OF EFFICACY AND TOXICITY

While many Phase III clinical trials have efficacy and safety endpoints, sample size calculations are generally based on efficacy, with safety addressed separately as a secondary endpoint. However, the overall clinical effect often involves efficacy and adverse safety or side effect trade-offs. While joint efficacy and safety endpoints have often been used for Phase II dose finding studies, such approaches have found limited application in Phase III trials. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a leading morbidity in extremely preterm infants, and prolonged mechanical ventilation increases BPD risk. Dexamethasone can facilitate extubation and decrease BPD incidence, but risk of neurodevelopment impairment (NDI) has led to decreased use. Because preliminary evidence suggests a better long-term safety profile for hydrocortisone than for dexamethasone, we designed a Phase III trial to sequentially evaluate the composite hypothesis that hydrocortisone (a) reduces the risk of death or BDP at 36 weeks; and (b) has an acceptable safety profile for death or NDI at 18 to 22 months. For the two- stage evaluation using robust Poisson models, we will first estimate relative risk and test the hypothesis that hydrocortisone lowers risk of death or BPD. If this test shows benefit, we will evaluate safety descriptively with safety considered achieved if either (1) the point estimate of risk of death/NDI is lower for hydrocortisone, or (2) death/NDI risk for hydrocortisone is increased, but the lower limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval for the ratio of death/BPD benefit to death/NDI risk is greater than 4. We describe procedures used for power and sample size calculations for this two- stage testing approach, present results from those calculations, and compare operating characteristics of this approach to one previously reported that involves joint testing of the bivariate death/BPD and death/NDI outcomes using extensions of methods described by Tournoux, et al (Contemporary Clinical Trials; 28:514).

Abstracts 553
The objective was to undertake a phase II trial (TO-PARP) to identify the best CRPC patient group(s) to be studied for sensitivity to olaparib in a phase III trial.
A multistage phase II design has been adopted which has a non-randomised component with response as the primary endpoint followed by a randomised component with overall survival as the primary endpoint.
Non-randomised component : This allows early progression to a randomised comparison if there is evidence of a high response rate (50% or more) in unselected patients. Biomarker defined groups are investigated for treatment sensitivity if the response rate is weaker than this.
The first stage involves entry of 30 patients. If 50% or more respond then no more patients will be entered and the randomised component will be undertaken in unselected patients. If 2 (7%) or less respond then olaparib will be rejected. If between 3-14 (10%-47%) patients respond then a further 15 patients will be entered. Should 23 (51%) or more respond overall then the randomised component will be undertaken in unselected patients but if 5 (11%) or fewer respond then olaparib will be rejected. Otherwise with 6-22 responders (13%-49%), biomarker analysis of tissue collected from all 45 patients will be undertaken with the aim of identifying a sensitive subgroup, with a response rate which is compatible with a 50% response rate. If such a subgroup is found, a confirmatory single stage 44 patient trial will be undertaken in this group; this will also yield experience of prospective biomarker testing in a multi-centre clinical trial setting.
Randomised component : a phase II assessment of the results generated in the non-randomised part, offering more secure evidence before proceeding to phase III. 180 patients will be randomised 2:1 to olaparib or an appropriate standard of care (? 1-sided 10%, power 80%).

DESIGNING TRIALS FOR PROVING EFFICAY OF MULTIFUNCTIONAL FOOD: SOME NOTES ON THE NEED FOR MULTIPLICITY ADJUSTMENTFederica Zobec, Marco Ghidina, Giada Morpurgo, Ileana Baldi, Dario Gregori
ZETA Research Ltd, Trieste, Italy University of Padova, Padova, italy
Food can have very different effects in terms of health, because of nutrient composition and dosage. In nutritional field, multiple outcomes or multiple hypotheses related to the inter-relationships among those outcomes are common. This induces several statistical issues related to the inflation of the statistical error. Such aspects are not commonly taken into account in nutritional research, whereas are very commonly accomplished for in the drug-related investigations. In the context of multi-functional food, there can be both multiple effects on the health target of a given nutrient, or multiple nutrients acting toward a single target or perhaps even on multiple targets. In nutritional fields it unrealistic to take hypothesis and outcomes as independent, mostly because nutrient effects are strongly related to each other. This induces a different correlation structure among outcomes and targets. Basically, if no health claims intended for components, then the composite endpoint is tested at a predefined alpha-level and components are not statistically tested: then adjustment for multiplicity is needed, and the basic choice would be on how to consider the concurrent outcomes. If claims are intended for components, then a sequential testing scheme might be applied: the composite endpoint is statistically significant ant the alpha-level, and then tests for components are made in sequence for the same significance level alpha. No claims can be made if sequence breaks. The usage of more complex models allows for instance to approach the problem as a fallback testing strategy: allow to continue testing even if sequence breaks, testing the hypothesis after the failed using a weighted Bonferroni method. This paper discuss the issues arising in multifunctional research by multiplicity in testing, both with regard to multiple nutrients and to multiple effects of a single or more nutrients on the peoples health.

COULD METHODS BE A FACTOR IN EARLY CLOSURES OF HIV PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS TRIALS? Madzouka Kokolo, William Cameron, Dean FergussonOttawa Hospital Research Institute, University of Ottawa
BACKGROUND. In the past few decades, it has become increasingly common for scientists based in richer countries to initiate clinical trials to be conducted in higher risk groups, in developing countries. This may creates opportunities for exploitation, as some activists and authors have argued, following early closure of several trials aiming at testing antiretrovirals for HIV prevention (PrEP), in 2004-2005. We aimed to compare

554 Abstracts
the scientific methods of trials involving recruitment in developing countries to trials involving recruitment only in industrialized countries. METHODS. We conducted a systematic review, with a focus on efficacy/ effectiveness trials. Based on guidance documents for the ethical conduct of HIV biomedical prevention trials (by UNAIDS/ WHO and by the Institute of Science), we developed a list of 33 key items. We searched Medline, Embase, Central, trial registries and the World Wide Web to identify eligible trials; and we communicated with investigators to obtain protocols and reports. Each protocol was fully reviewed by two independent assessors. RESULTS. We identified nine eligible trials, among which four had closed early at least one study site. We obtained full- text protocols for all efficacy trials. All but one trial had a Jadad score of 3/5 or more. On average, 20/33 validity items were reported in PrEP efficacy trials (61%). This average was 19/33 (58%) for trials closed early versus 2/33 (67%) for other trials. DISCUSSION. Early closures in HIV PrEP efficacy trials might be related to methodological issues. It is unclear how methods might have affected the ethical design and/or conduct of those trials.

Abstract: The article addresses the interaction between science and society, focusing on the role of higher education institutions in promoting scientific literacy and knowledge management. It presents the case of a university Science Communication Center (SCC), exploring how this center contributes to effective linking between academia and the community through a dynamic knowledge management model. This model is structured in three phases: knowledge generation, knowledge transfer, and societal feedback, thus facilitating a continuous cycle of interaction and improvement. The article highlights the importance of scientific education from an early age and how it influences public perception and the utility of science in everyday life. It discusses the need for more robust public policies to address inequalities in access and performance in science and technology in Chile, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the SCC’s open science approach is emphasized, which seeks to democratize access to scientific knowledge and foster more active public participation in science. The document concludes that, despite challenges such as funding and impact measurement, effective management of scientific knowledge and public science communication are essential for an informed and engaged society. This case serves as a reference for other institutions aspiring to enhance the interaction between science and society, highlighting the transformative role that universities can play in this process.

Abstract: Education of patients prior to an invasive procedure is pivotal for good cooperation and knowledge retention. Virtual reality (VR) is a fast-developing technology that helps educate both medical professionals and patients. INTRODUCTION Education of patients prior to an invasive procedure is pivotal for good cooperation and knowledge retention. Virtual reality (VR) is a fast-developing technology that helps educate both medical professionals and patients.To prove non-inferiority of VR education compared to conventional education in patients prior to the implantation of a permanent pacemaker (PPM). OBJECTIVE To prove non-inferiority of VR education compared to conventional education in patients prior to the implantation of a permanent pacemaker (PPM).150 participants scheduled for an elective implantation of a PPM were enrolled in this prospective study and randomized into two groups: the VR group ( n = 75) watched a 360° video about the procedure using the VR headset Oculus Meta Quest 2, while the conventional group ( n = 75) was educated by a physician. Both groups filled out a questionnaire to assess the quality of education pre- and in-hospital, their knowledge of the procedure, and their subjective satisfaction. METHODS 150 participants scheduled for an elective implantation of a PPM were enrolled in this prospective study and randomized into two groups: the VR group (n = 75) watched a 360° video about the procedure using the VR headset Oculus Meta Quest 2, while the conventional group (n = 75) was educated by a physician. Both groups filled out a questionnaire to assess the quality of education pre- and in-hospital, their knowledge of the procedure, and their subjective satisfaction.There was no significant difference in the quality of education. There was a non-significant trend towards higher educational scores in the VR group. The subgroup with worse scores was older than the groups with higher scores (82 vs. 76 years, p = 0.025). Anxiety was reduced in 92% of participants. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the quality of education. There was a non-significant trend towards higher educational scores in the VR group. The subgroup with worse scores was older than the groups with higher scores (82 vs. 76 years, p = 0.025). Anxiety was reduced in 92% of participants.VR proved to be non-inferior to conventional education. It helped to reduce anxiety and showed no adverse effects. CONCLUSION VR proved to be non-inferior to conventional education. It helped to reduce anxiety and showed no adverse effects.

INTRODUCTION
Edge computing has emerged as a formidable paradigm that brings data processing and analysis closer to where data originates, enabling real-time insights, reduced latency, and improved privacy. However, the success of contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), is largely dependent on the upscaling of the model size and the availability of data. This trend is at odds with the highly restricted computational resources of edge devices, which are usually constrained by size, cost, and energy consumption limitations. In addition, the management complexity of all resources of the edge computing system, such as computation, communication, and data sensing, keeps increasing. These trends necessitate the need for wide deployment of new AI solutions to infuse more efficient and powerful intelligence into edge devices and to facilitate closer connections and better coordination between the edge devices. In essence, this concept can be referred to as "Big AI for Small Devices."
Athena (Athena, 2021) aims at making scientific contributions in both edge computing and AI with an emphasis on computer systems research. These include (i) novel practical and algorithmic foundations of AI to ensure the new functionalities, efficiency, scalability, security, privacy, and fairness of the AI solutions adopted in future edge computing systems; (ii) new edge computing systems for efficient and reliable execution of Al-operations; (iii) edge networked computing system designs and operations across the stack by leveraging a data-driven, Al-based approach; and (iv) novel use-inspired services and applications, focused on diverse cyber-physical systems that leverage the innovations of the other thrusts. The researchers of Athena work closely with external collaborators to translate research outcomes to industrial practice and policy making. The educational and outreach activities of Athena empower students and postdocs to develop their interests, build skills, and acquire knowledge about AI and computer and network systems through research experiences, industry internships, and community engagements. The Inclusive AI Initiative-one of Athena's innovations in education and workforce development-strengthens the ethical AI competencies of all Athena members to better promote and be aware of equity and fairness in their research and the communities impacted by the institute's research.
ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Athena is a multi-university and transdisciplinary AI Institute including eight academic institutions (Duke
University, Arizona State University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Princeton University, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Yale University) and five industry collaborators (AT&T, Microsoft, Motorola Solutions, EdgeMicro, and 5NINES), as shown in Figure 1. The Athena team includes 28 senior reserchers with diverse backgrounds from eight participating universities, three international collaborators respectively from Switzerland, Germany, and Israel, and 1 program manager. Athena also sponsors more than 60 students and PostDocs to perform research with our faulty members. All the researchers are associated with one or more research pillars (more details can be found in the section Technical Thrusts and Pillars). An external advisory board (EAB) has been created to provide advice and suggestions on the operation of Athena, including six members from both industry and academia. Athena is also working with several community and educational partners on its broader impact activities, including Cary Township, NC School of Science and Math (NCSSM), STEM Early College@NC A&T, STEM from Dance, etc. In the recently announced NSF Expand AI awards, the Athena team is working with UT San Antonio to promote research and education for under-represented groups. Athena also works closely with the Duke-led NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) for Alternative Sustainable Intelligent Computing (ASIC, 2018) to create a consortium to foster research collaborations with industrial and government partners.
Every year Athena hosts an annual review meeting and Tech Showcase, which is open to all Athena members, students, and invited government and industry stakeholders. The meeting is composed of keynote talks, technical sessions, panels, and poster and demo sessions. All the research, educational, and other projects are also reviewed in the meeting and the feedback from internal and external reviewers is provided to the researchers and Pis.
TECHNICAL THRUSTS AND PILLARS
The Athena's research builds upon four interrelated thrusts: Foundational AI, Computer Systems, Networked Computing Systems, and Services and Applications, which cover multiple layers of modern edge computing systems and cross both foundational and use-inspired research. On top of the advances and breakthrough of AI technologies, the research outcomes are integrated into and demonstrated by three primary research pillars, namely, edge computing AI systems, collaborative extended reality (XR), and situational awareness and autonomy.
AI foundation
We envision that functionality, efficiency, heterogeneity, and trustworthiness are four major challenges in the AI research of Athena to deliver the promised next-generation edge computing systems. The unique operational requirements of Al-powered networks and computing systems demand for new functions of AI, such as the abilities to handle the unseen circumstances and to debug root reason of concerned system behaviors. Efficiency and scalability of AI models is also crucial in the target large-scale and heterogeneous edge computing system. The heterogeneity of the edge devices and the data to be processed enables great opportunities to advance the computing paradigm of AI, while also imposing many challenges on maintaining reliability and robustness of the computation. The distributed and heterogeneous architecture introduces many security, privacy, and fairness concerns of the adopted AI models.
The members of Athena's AI thrust are developing novel causality analysis methods to grant the AI models an ability to handle the unforeseen circumstances based on out-of-distribution (OOD) data analysis (Linderman et al., 2023). The team is also investigating the techniques to enable efficient deployment and execution of the AI models and automate the model design by considering the system heterogeneity (Lin et al., 2022). The new federated learning (FL) framework and computing hierarchy are being developed to combat the system heterogeneity and preserve the data integrity. Finally, the team members are also developing defenses against security and privacy attacks with provable guarantees and exploring the societal fairness implications of the AI models and the corresponding algorithmic bias mitigation methods. All these techniques are being seamlessly integrated into the three research pillars together with the techniques developed by other thrusts.
Edge computing AI systems
Due to the limited scale hindering economies of scale benefits, naively architected edge data centers face issues of not only high operating costs but also constrained performance and flexibility in edge computing applications such as AI/ML workloads. Hence, the team of the Edge Computing AI Systems pillar of Athena proposes to leverage resource disaggregation in edge data centers where compute and memory/storage resources are physically separated into network-attached resource blades, particularly through network-centric operating systems (OSes). Based on our team members' expertise in the OS's memory management subsystem, the team focuses on key OS components and services for disaggregated edge data centers. Specifically, we looked at (a) efficient synchronization (Yu et al, 2023), and (b) near-memory accelerators (Tang et al., 2023). In addition, the ongoing research aims to achieve (c) performance isolation and fairness among edge applications, such as real-time AI inference and database workloads.
Our research activities include two major directions: (i) Systems for AI. We are using programmable network hardware to design and implement in-network memory and process management. Our goal is to boost resource elasticity and hardware flexibility, ultimately improving the efficiency of serving AI workloads, (ii) Alfor systems. We are exploring system optimizations using ML algorithms, utilizing an overarching view of all inter-resource communications to establish Al-optimized system management. Our efforts toward the key directions have been demonstrated across research focuses such as (a) Efficient and Scalable Synchronization Primitive, (b) Distributed Near-memory Accelerator, and (c) Performance Isolation and Fairness. The team is putting efforts to expedite AI/ML and traditional tasks in disaggregated edge data centers through a network-centric OS design and extend the scope to other OS components and devices. A key goal is to simplify data synchronization across diverse computing resources like CPUs, CPUs, and accelerators. Our ambition is to enable universal data sharing using a unified virtual address across accelerators, enhancing development convenience and data center modularity.
Collaborative Extended Reality (XR)
XR is an application domain of Athena where the goal is to create an end-to-end system where multiple augmented reality users enter an environment and share data with each other to collaboratively solve specific problems. This includes sharing 2D/3D point-cloud style data to create 3D maps. It can also focus on allowing cloud/edge supported object detection and tracking in various challenging environments. Collaborating with the Situational Awareness and Autonomy Pillar (see section Situational Awareness and Autonomy) to provide an end-to-end sensing service, which involves gathering data from wide-area sensors, collecting them at edge sites, suitably compressing them, and then leveraging necessary decoding capabilities in the cloud. Figure 2 shows a demo that uses a VR headset to simulate brain surgery, which showcased in the NSF AI Hill day on September 1, 2023.
The pillar focuses on challenging systems problems to deliver a seamless end-user experience to users of XR systems. The activities of the project have different systems components that primarily run on end devices, and on edge systems and edge servers, with coordination and support of a data center's computational power. The activities are split into the following categories: (i) Scalable object detection and learning, (ii) Continuous localization and mapping, (iii) Energy efficiency, (iv) FL, (v) Scalable data compression, (vi) Edge dimensioning, and (vii) Multi-modal interfaces. The ultimate goal of these projects is to create an end-to-end system demonstrating showcasing different aspects of the collaboration in XR. It will showcase an indoor environment where a group of users can collaboratively create 3-dimensional maps and floor plans using data gathered by their headsets, be able to efficiently detect different object types in the environment, leave markers for each, and collaboratively solve various tasks assigned. An example use of this capability is for public safety agency personnel, for example, firefighters, attempting to navigate an unknown building to conduct search and rescue operations.
Situational awareness and autonomy
Over the past decade, the scientific foundations of model-based design have established rigorous design and analysis approaches for safety-critical systems. However, in the context of data-driven, Al-enabled systems, such methods still have limited use in the real-world scenarios. Consequently, our goal is to provide assured, robust, and resilient services for autonomous systems at the edge. To achieve this, we focus on two critical, interdependent components: edge-based trusted autonomy and situational-awareness, that provide strong safety and performance (i.e., functionality) guarantees both at design- and run-time, as the system, its functional requirements and environment evolve. In particular, we focus on two applications that will be used to illustrate the promise and effectiveness of the next generation of edge-based autonomy: (1) multi-drone search and target tracking in contested and uncertain environments, and (2) collaborative sensing in Connected and Automated/Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs).
Our approaches to achieve the above goals include the following. We have been developing trustworthy and adversarially robust models for the fusion of asynchronous heterogeneous sensing used for perception and situational awareness in autonomous systems (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, radar). To deal with contested environments, realistic threat models and security analyses for such scenarios have been introduced (e.g., Hallyburton et al., 2022) demonstrating the vulnerability of existing perception models). Further, to exploit on-demand computation availability, we have been developing autonomous services capable of employing a combination of centralized (e.g., on an edge-server) and decentralized data aggregation, as well as the development of secured FL models (e.g., Sun et al., 2022). Similarly, we have focused on the design of adversarially robust decision-making policies. For example, we have recently extended the standard adversarial training approach for robust reinforcement learning agents, based on two-player max-min games; specifically, two-player games were extended by introducing an adversarial herd (i.e., a group of adversaries), in order to reduce the difficulty of the inner optimization problem, and the potential over-pessimism due to selection of an adversary set that may include unlikely scenarios (Dong et al., 2023).
EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT
In an era driven by technological advancements, Athena is dedicated to cultivating a diverse workforce for the future. Athena actively tailors educational innovations to cater to students from kindergarten to postdoctoral researchers, emphasizing the broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.
Our Embedded STEM Labs is a novel mechanism for supporting community-based k-12 education outreach. Through collaborative partnerships with nonprofit organizations, Athena develops programs that enhance the STEM educational capacity of nonprofit staff, creates culturally relevant and design-based STEM curricula, and provides university faculty and students with community engagement opportunities. By summer of 202, we will have reached over 450 students with 96% of our k-12 participants from minoritized groups, ensuring our institute contributes to broadening participation in AL Recognizing the significance of undergraduate involvement, Athena offers academic year and summer research opportunities. Moreover, Athena organizes an annual graduate bootcamp with virtual and online components to equip students with essential skills for the application process, statement writing, and selecting the right educational path. This holistic approach ensures that students are empowered to pursue graduate studies.
Athena's team has also made remarkable strides in the realm of Al ethics education. By developing multiple modules that can be utilized broadly, they have bolstered the understanding of ethical considerations in the field. Furthermore, a newly approved undergraduate course titled "Let's Talk About Digital You" will enable a broader reach and serve as a blueprint for ethical technology education for higher educational institutions.
To foster advancements in autonomous vehicles (AV), teams have created AVstack-a groundbreaking, open-source software platform. AVstack facilitates the development, evaluation, and analysis of Al-based modules for AV autonomy and situational awareness. The teams' ongoing efforts focus on producing course materials and laboratory modules that utilize AVStack and open-source datasets/simulators to educate students on Al-based AV design. In the graduate studies realm, faculty have actively engaged master's and PhD students in Athena-related research.
Athena exemplifies a visionary approach to shaping the next generation of ethical Al talent. Through our comprehensive educational programs, research opportunities, and impactful partnerships, Athena is at the forefront of shaping a future where Al is leveraged responsibly and for the benefit of all.
COMMUNITY BUILDING AND BROADER IMPACT
Athena is collaborating with three foreign universities: Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Tech-nische Universitat Miinchen (TUM), and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU). The PI/co-PIs from both Athena and the international institutions have collaborated on various activities including joint research projects, for example, FL framework for biomedical applications (EPFL + Duke), machine learning accelerator design based on emerging nanoscale devices (TUM + Duke), and new machine learning methods for integrating situational awareness radar and communications for autonomous vehicles (BGU + Duke). Besides collaborative research, Athena continues to work with international collaborative institutions on curriculum developments, graduate student and young faculty training and mentoring, personnel exchange and visit, workshops, and summer camps. Athena is also participating in the Next Generation Internet (NGI) Enrichers Program, an initiative funded by the European Union, where Athena will be hosting the selected "Fellow" for a 3-6-month fellowship at Duke University.
The Athena Monthly Seminar Series has successfully entered its third year. Speakers range from internationally acclaimed scientists to Athena graduate students. Of the audience members, typically, 5% are government representatives, 10% are industry members, and 85% are students or faculty from both domestic and international universities. These seminars are open to the public and are advertised widely on our social media pages.
Athena is also committed to technology transfer and has been actively working with industrial partners to apply the research outcomes to practical problems. So far, the team members of Athena have filled 5 patent disclosures in the applications of system safety, biometric data analysis, autonomous driving, and healthcare. A company of the team members has recently been acquired by NVIDIA.
CONCLUSION
Sponsored by the National Science Foundation and Department of Homeland Security, Athena will deliver the key technologies for next-generation edge computing systems powered by AI with unprecedented efficiency, reliability, and performance. Athena is now serving as the nexus point of community, facilitating the ecosystem of the emerging technologies, and cultivating diverse next-generation technical leaders having the values of ethics and fairness. The success of Athena will disrupt the future edge computing industry, create new business model and entrepreneurial opportunities, and transform the competition model of future edge computing industry and research.

INTRODUCTION
The recent breakthroughs of AI and Machine Learning (ML) as well as their successful applications in a broad range of domains provide a unique opportunity for designing Al-driven next-generation networks that are "intelligent" in many different ways. The NSF AI Institute for Future Edge Networks and Distributed Intelligence (AI-EDGE) was established to fully explore the power of AI to revolutionize next-generation edge networks. AI-EDGE will develop new foundational AI tools for designing next generation intelligent edge networks (6G and beyond), and enabling true distributed intelligence. Our objective is to cultivate an environment that will not only foster innovation in cutting-edge technologies but also prepare a new wave of professionals equipped to navigate this rapidly evolving landscape.
To address the above mentioned challenges, the institute is made of a strong, diverse, and growing consortia of research leaders from university, industry, and government labs that will work collaboratively to realize the overall vision of designing next generation edge networks and distributed intelligence (AI-EDGE 2023).
The overarching mission of the institute's research is to design next-generation hyper-scalable, heterogeneous and dynamic networks that are highly efficient, reliable, robust, and secure. New AI tools and techniques will be developed to ensure that these networks are self-healing and self-optimized. These networks will in turn be designed to unleash the power of collaboration to help solve long-standing distributed AI challenges, making AI more efficient, interactive, and privacy-preserving. Applications and practical use cases at experimental scale are the pillars (Figure 1) that will be built on and will interact with this foundation in a virtuous cycle to deepen our understanding and magnify the impact of our work. Use Case 1 is built around sensing and re-engineering the wireless network environment. Use Case 2 is built around extreme mobility applications where machines, humans, and in some cases network elements could be in motion at the same time. Use Case 3 focuses on the development of programmable and virtualized edge networks. Looking to the future, our institute will develop the key underlying technologies for distributed and networked intelligence that will have an impact on future transformative applications well-beyond the institute's funded years.
The success of the institute will be measured on several fronts. On the research front, success will be measured by the development of (i) a new intelligence plane for designing next generation edge networks, (ii) how that plane will be used to enable distributed AI, and (iii) the integration of the research tasks to successfully implement the three key use cases identified by the institute. Success in education and workforce development will be measured by the impact on AI-EDGE in helping to build a large and diverse workforce in AI and networks.
The research is currently conducted across eight interrelated thrust areas under two main themes: AI for Networks and Networks for AI, as shown in Figure 1.
Alfor Networks: While preliminary successes of AI for Networks have been promising, developing ML tools to networking with minimal or no human oversight poses many important research challenges that need to be explored. In Thrust , we re-engineer the physical fabric for 6G and beyond (6G+) wireless communications through AI, thus treating the fabric itself as a controllable entity. In Thrust , we develop new AI techniques for the design and control of these next-generation networks taking into account practical resource constraints. In Thrust , we further generalize these techniques to allow for multi-agent, possibly noncooperative, network entities. In Thrust , we develop AI methods to secure the network edge.
Networks for AI: The vision of distributed intelligence requires capabilities beyond today's AI algorithms. The research foundation here starts with Thrust , where distributed AI adapts its operation seamlessly by taking into account computation, communication, and data constraints. In Thrust , we go further by aiming to re-engineer the networks themselves to better serve the needs of distributed AI operations. In Thrust , we investigate collaborative (human + machine) analysis of data produced by our application drivers, which will be far more effective than with either humans or machines in isolation. In Thrust , we design and control the network such that it is privacy-aware and can be optimized to facilitate protection from information leakage and attacks.
In the rest of this paper, we will provide a sampling of the institute's recent representative work along the above two main themes. Additionally, we will outline the institute's endeavors in education and workforce development, as well as broadening participation (BP) and enforcing collaboration. More details can be found on the institute webpage (AI-EDGE 2023).
RESEARCH THEMES OF AI FOR NETWORKS
The growth of edge networks in scale and complexity implies that intelligent and autonomous design becomes paramount. We describe below in detail two key learning areas that the institute has been exploring that will have a demonstrable impact on edge network design and control: (i) reinforcement learning and (ii) meta learning and active learning.
Reinforcement learning (RL) empowered edge network control
RL is a major AI paradigm in which an online learner interacts with an unknown environment sequentially in order to achieve a large expected cumulative reward. Such a mathematical framework precisely captures how edge networks acquire, process, and communicate data, and hence can play a vital role in designing data-driven network resource allocation and control mechanisms. AI-EDGE has made a number of fundamental contributions to reinforcement learning with a primary focus on addressing challenging issues that practical edge networks encounter, including various constraints such as resource and safety constraints and switching cost, partial observability, model misspecification, and so forth.
Edge devices are generally subject to resource constraints such as power, computation, and memory constraints. Their data processing can be modeled as constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs). AI-EDGE researchers have developed several innovative algorithms to handle such constraints while maintaining the best possible performance. For example, Wei, Liu, and Ying (2022) developed model-free RL algorithms with optimal regret and constraint violation guarantees. Ghosh, Zhou, and Shroff (2022) further expanded our exploration to larger, potentially infinite, state spaces via a new model-free constrained RL algorithm that also enjoys near-optimal performance bounds. These novel algorithms exhibit significant performance improvements in comparison to existing solutions, especially in edge networks with latency and energy constraints.
Unlike energy constraints which are typically cumulative over time, safety and power constraints are instantaneous at each step/time. For example, in autonomous driving, improper operations at any time can cause catastrophic consequences such as crashing of a car. Thus, such safety-critical systems need to avoid violation of safety constraints at each time instance. It is highly challenging because the safety at each step should both depend on history steps due to the system evolution and predict the impact on future steps. Recently, we made a fundamental breakthrough in Shi, Liang, and Shroff (2023) to address such a challenge, where we constructed novel safe subgraphs to design safe exploration and planning, and showed that our approach achieves a regret that nearly matches the state-of-the-art regret in the unsafe-action setting and that in the unconstrained setting.
Meta-learning for autonomous transportation
Meta-learning is a powerful learning technique to reduce sample requirement for learning tasks while still maintaining the desired performance. AI-EDGE researchers have made several significant contributions to these learning methodologies and have further demonstrated their successful applications in multimodal fusion design for beamforming over autonomous vehicles.
Autonomous vehicles typically move in dynamic conditions, and thus a car may encounter new environments that were not explicitly included in an apriori training dataset. A major challenge here is that a single pre-trained model is unable to generalize well. We approached such a problem by leveraging a popular meta-learning framework of model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), for which we first made several innovative contributions, including characterizing the optimization performance (Ji, Yang, and Liang 2021), understanding the statistical convergence guarantee (Collins et al. 2022), and characterizing the generalization performance in the overparameterized regime (Ju, Liang, and Shroff 2023). Equipped with these powerful tools, we further demonstrated the advantages of MAML over traditional deep-learning techniques wherein a model retrained in the unseen test environment (i) uses a fraction of the data compared to classical retraining, which, in turn, simplifies data collection and storage, and (ii) results in equal or higher accuracy in optimal beam selection compared to the case when the new environment dataset is fully available during initial training. Our results in Gu, Collins et al. (2023) reveal that our MAML implementation on camera images for the objective of beam selection improves test accuracy by up to 86% with fine-tuning when encountering an unseen non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environment compared to conventional supervised learning. We are currently comparing MAML-based approaches with traditional transfer learning, using initial results in our earlier work (Gu, Salehi, et al. 2023).
RESEARCH THEMES OF NETWORKS FOR Al
Future Al problems will be at large scale, for which federated learning (FL) implemented over edge networks is a powerful paradigm to decentralize the computation, protect data privacy, and offer maximum design flexibility. To this end, we have made substantial efforts in designing innovative network-aware FL algorithms that address various challenges of edge networks such as node heterogeneity, communication constraints, unequal client participation, uncertainty of wireless communication medium, and so forth. We also investigated more complex Al problems, decentralizing which requires further novel designs. Below, we discuss in more detail about our work along these directions.
Network-aware federated learning (FL)
Nodes in edge networks typically have different computational capabilities, quality of datasets, and levels of participation. Hence, we have extensively addressed these types of network heterogeneity and proposed new FL algorithms that are communication-efficient, personalized, straggler-resilient, and privacy-preserving.
As one such work, we studied model heterogeneous FL for classification where different clients have different model architectures (Regatti et al. 2022). Unlike existing works on model heterogeneity, we do not require access to a public dataset, nor do we impose constraints on the model architecture of clients. We also ensure that the clients' model architectures and data are private. We developed a communication-efficient algorithm with provable convergence and generalization properties that aligns conditional distributions of each client in the feature space and achieves a consensus on the final layer classification weights.
We also proposed a novel straggler-resilient FL method that incorporates statistical characteristics of clients' data to adaptively select the clients in order to speed up the learning procedure (Reisizadeh et al. 2022). The key idea is to start the training with faster nodes and gradually involve slower nodes once the statistical accuracy of the data corresponding to the current participating nodes is reached. The proposed approach reduces the overall runtime (theoretically and via numerical evaluation) required to achieve the statistical accuracy of data of all nodes, as the solution for each stage is close to the solution of the subsequent stage with more samples and can be used as a warm-start.
Federated learning with diverse structures
AI problems can have diverse structures in order to capture various practical domains, encompassing the basic risk minimization problem such as supervised learning, the minimax problem such as robust adversarial training and generative adversarial networks, and the bilevel problem that captures meta-learning, hyperparameter optimization, neural architecture search, and so forth. Building on our work on decentralizing the basic minimization as discussed in the preceding subsection, we have recently pioneered the research on FL into the much wider scope of minimax and bilevel problems while still addressing network constraints and heterogeneity.
More specifically, we recently proposed a general federated minimax optimization framework (Sharma, Panda, and Joshi 2023), that accounts for heterogeneity across clients and subsumes several existing methods like local stochastic gradient descent-ascent (SGDA). To fix this mismatch caused by heterogeneity, we proposed normalizing the client updates by the number of local steps undertaken between successive communication rounds. Our algorithms showed significant improvements over existing computation and communication complexity results.
EDUCATION AND BROADENING PARTICIPATION
There is a tremendous demand for Al-related skills not only in computer science and engineering, but also across many disciplines, from agriculture and manufacturing to business and entertainment. Further, the growth of future-generation wireless edge networks will require a large workforce with expertise in wireless networking and communications, security, and privacy. Thus, it is a priority to educate students, professionals, and practitioners in AI and networks and substantially grow and diversify the workforce. Since it was founded, AI-EDGE has made significant progress in educating undergraduate and graduate students, practitioners, and professionals, and expanding our reach to under-represented communities. Some highlights are provided below.
AI-EDGE team members received a major grant for establishing and growing the workforce needed to expand 5G and broadband access in Ohio 5G-Ohio website (2023) This has led to synergistic work between AI-EDGE and the 5G-OH Broadband and 5G Connectivity Center to establish BS specialization and Professional MS programs at OSU.
AI-EDGE has developed an educational repository for AI and networks, where the course contents have been partitioned into self-contained modules covering different topics, each with student notes, lecturer notes, and appropriate paper reading assignments. The course repository also includes bridge projects to integrate learning across AI and the networks, personalized curriculum for individual students and professionals, and professional MS programs via "stackable certificates" with modular contents from across universities.
Further, AI-EDGE consistently provides industrial experience and training opportunities for students and post-docs. We currently have multiple ongoing collaborations, where PhD students and postdocs work with scientists and engineers across several industries.
To facilitate synergistic research interactions and expand our students' scope of knowledge, the institute hosts a highly successful regular online seminar series that feature research talks and tutorials given by students, faculty, and postdocs of the institute, as well as world-leading researchers in networking and AI. Recordings of the talks are maintained on the institute's website for easy access. We also organize regular institute-wide meetings, during which the students and postdocs are given opportunities to present lightning talks and posters about their research outcomes, which significantly encouraged their engagement in this multidisciplinary research program.
Inclusivity and BP are cornerstones of AI-EDGE's ethos. We continually keep this focus at the forefront of our institute's activities. We next summarize three key BP activities and efforts that we have made during the initial 2 years of AI-EDGE's establishment.
Building a large diverse workforce: AI-EDGE has partnered with another OSU-AFRL led large-MSI consortium to develop a community of under-represented engineers and scientists and provide them with opportunities to develop science, technology, and leadership skills. By leveraging this consortium, AI-EDGE has recruited undergraduate students from under-represented groups (URGs) and run two 8-week summer programs during which the students work with their mentors who are faculty and post-docs/graduate students at AI-EDGE. The research projects that students can select cover a broad range of topics in ML, networking, and security.
Women in AI program: The institute has launched an institute-wide virtual "Women in AI program" participated by all female faculty, students, and postdocs as well as other institute's members. The program events are organized by a student committee and monitored by the BP committee. The institute has organized several networking events with different themes for women students and postdocs, including research highlight presentations, panel discussions on topics of interest such as the process of academic job search, work-life balance, and strategies for a successful career, and more.
Community outreach and engagement: AI-EDGE faculty members have given several interviews to local and international news organizations, at libraries, and keynotes/invited talks on the importance of AI and networking technologies. Our faculty, students, and postdocs across the institute have actively participated in various outreach events for high-school and undergraduate students and teamed up to give tutorials at various high-school summer camps.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have introduced the AI-EDGE institute, which seeks to build on the synergies between AI/ML and networking to develop intelligent next-generation edge networks and distributed AI. We have provided an overview of the institute's key focus areas and summarized some of our exciting research advancements on various learning methods (such as RL and FL) and their applications. We have also highlighted some main AI-EDGE endeavors in education, workforce development, and BP.

Introduction
There is a shortage of skills and talent in the metal and mining industry. Paucity of qualified and experienced professionals is undeniably a global issue. Around 73% of the companies identified skills gaps in the local labor market as the biggest barrier to the adoption of new technology (ICMM, 2021). The challenges metal and mining companies face in attracting and retaining talent are certainly exacerbated by the industry's perception of them as unattractive and slow to respond to rapid technological changes (Chikatamaria and Prasad, 2019). The metal and mining industry has been through a significant technological transformation. These continuous innovations and technological changes make it more challenging to draw and hold young talented professionals in any sector that is unfashionable to younger generations, perceived as damaging to the environment, and requires hard physical work (Mateus and Martins, 2019).
According to a study conducted by McKinsey and Company (Abenov et al., 2023), 71% of metal and mining leaders find that due to the immense shortage of talented professionals in the company, there is a grievous impact on production targets. It is obstructing the planned objectives of the company as well. Recruiting and retaining talented people in specific fields, such as mining, metallurgy, and process engineering, is more complex than others. According to recent data from Minerals Tertiary Education Council: Key Performance Measures Report 2018, there has been a significant 63% decline in the enrolment ratio for Mining Engineering in Australia since 2014, and a notable 39% decline in courses like mining graduating in the US since 2016. The data demonstrates that the mining and metals industries do not attract young technical experts.
It is extremely disappointing that there is an unprecedented shortage of skills in the metal and mining industry, which will undoubtedly negatively impact the sector's overall productivity and growth. The metal and mining industry has a complete dearth of motivated and trained workforce. Chikatamaria and Prasad (2019) suggested that mining businesses must embrace business risk management practices and integrate change management with developing digital technology to maintain operational sustainability and transparency. The authors also highlighted that one of the major issues in mining industry in India is lack of skill/competent labor. Emerging digital technologies should be incorporated into the training of the next generation of mining professionals to facilitate real-time data collecting, better data analysis, reporting, and process monitoring.
Digital transformation makes businesses more flexible and competitive. There is an urgent need to nurture a learning-friendly culture by introducing different strategies to enhance innovative minds. This learning culture will accelerate the organization's sustainability in digital transformation, raising employee wellbeing and retention (Jain, 2022).
Gamification is one of the most effective and engaging transformations for learning and development. It is a concerted effort to apply different game mechanisms in working environment gaming designs to increase collaborative participation through purposeful and enjoyable interaction. It enables employees to participate wholeheartedly in an interactive experience sharing. It makes learning more enjoyable and inspires and motivates the users to effectively engage with the content. Games incentivize employees to learn and accomplish more skills, which can eventually transform the compelling approach to enjoying and doing approach. It was also reported that a significant number of people are motivated and work more effectively in a competitive environment. Gamification will provide prospects for competitive openings for rewards, incentives, and leaderboard rankings (Mulkeen, 2018).
In this context, one of the major online platforms, Deloitte Leadership Academy, provides a course with multiple components that cover a broad range of themes in consultation. The course aims to simplify several executive training and development initiatives, particularly for those at higher levels. With the aid of Badgeville Game Mechanics, Deloitte adds particular guidelines and incentives like leaderboards, badges, etc., which appear as appropriate gamified features. Trailing leaderboards and status signals is made easier with the app. It also aids in determining how many individuals enroll in, continue, and complete the course. This app aims to generate prompt feedback on the participants progress and eventually guide them toward timely and successful course completion. The prime motive for developing gamification is to boost the senior executives motivation and morale toward completing the training program.
Literature Review
The foremost apprehension in the metal and mining industry today is intrinsically training, motivating, and attracting new talent (Kowalski et al., 2001). The evolving mining workforce has several training issues, like differences between colleagues and their nature of executing job roles. For example, let us compare the newly joined workers who are the youngest (Generation Z) and the existing working population (Boomers) concerning their physiological, mental, social, and cultural characteristics. We can identify a considerable gap. There will also be noticeable differences in their learning modes and job expectations.
Work accomplishments among millennials at the workplace depend on their understanding of work requirements and job roles, which positively influence their learning capacities and motivate them to work more effectively within organizations. According to Jain and Dutta (2019), it is high time to modify the learning contrivances as per millennials preferences and styles. Based on several theoretical studies, the gamification model allows millennials to implement their learning optimally. Adding game elements to the work environment satisfies the needs for immediate satisfaction, accomplishment, and recognition. Researchers recommend that employee gaming platforms should have competitive leaderboards and quick feedback mechanisms.
Gamification in employee training and development is the process of enhancing training and educational exercises with gaming principles, making learning fun, and adding an element of friendly competition to encourage employees to engage with, understand, and retain training content better (Flanagan, 2022). Gamification helps build a learning culture, promoting employee growth and development through fun and engaging training programs (Kaikhosrosh vil i, 2023). It creates a culture that strengthens company culture, builds team spirit, and enhances the training experience. Gamification in training allows employees to see their progress as they learn, which can be very powerful for workplace learning and development. It makes the process more engaging, productive, and enjoyable for employees and improves worker recruitment and retention (Hawley, 2023). Gamification can lead to more engaged, driven, and productive employees. It can also make employees inclined to stay and grow with the company (Flanagan, 2022). Gamification can be incorporated into existing training efforts to make lessons more engaging and successful or build new learning and development initiatives (Hawley, 2023).
Gaonkar et al. (2022) stated that gamification in learning and teaching increases social impact, motivation, and learner engagement. Learners often view gamification as a highly attractive approach to enhance motivation, engagement, and social influence in learning and instruction. Games combine nostalgia, curiosity, visual appeal, and staff involvement to create an emotionally engaging ambience for the player and raise their level of emotional literacy, while inspiring them to explore new avenues and chances. By improving employee engagement and enriching the internal work environment, appropriate gamification makes work enjoyable for staff members. A straightforward example of a game-like tool designed to encourage users to interact with a concept more fully is Linkedln's profile completion tool.
Impact of Gamification on Learning and Development
A study of various research works and journals revealed that the metal and mining industry could revive its attractiveness for young talents with the help of gamification (Kowalski et al., 2001). The benefits of gamification include more adaptive and personalized learning experiences. It provides a clear picture of participants' career growth, increased participation, engagement, and motivation to complete the training through advanced and interesting platforms like VR and online courses. Learners can learn at their own pace, with application-based learning modules at their fingertips and with easy accessibility. Improved retention can help the employees apply the learnings in real-life work scenarios and create a knowledge-sharing environment that provides a platform for interactive peer learning.
Gamification is all about motivating people to achieve their own goals. It is often understood that employees' personal goals are aligned with organizational business goals. If the industries can identify their goals and share them with the employees, then with the help of gamification, employers can encourage employees to achieve their goals, which will eventually help the industries accomplish their targets (Kowalski et al., 2001).
As the global mining industry rebounds from the last downturn, it faces several critical challenges that extend beyond the mining sector. Across various industries, the impending retirement of experienced personnel from the baby boomer generation and the timeintensive nature of developing technical expertise pose significant concerns. This issue is exacerbated by the aging workforce, with alarming statistics revealing that the mining industry's average age is 46.5 years, well above the national average (Ashutosh, 2023).
Furthermore, there is a concerning breakdown in the executive replenishment cycle, with new talent entering the workforce having limited experience compared to the retiring generations of executives. The cyclical nature of boom and bust cycles and traditional cost-saving layoffs during downturns have resulted in a significant loss of middle and lower management, creating a substantial experience gap underneath senior management (Ashutosh, 2023). The industry's struggle to attract young talent further compounds the challenge. Mining engineering enrolments are on a downward trend globally, and the industry's reputation as unstable and its remote work locations make it less appealing to the tech-savvy and convenience-oriented millennial generation (Ashutosh, 2023).
Now, addressing these challenges requires innovative solutions. The impact of gamification on learning and development presents a promising avenue. Studies emphasize that gamification enhances learning experiences and motivates employees to engage actively with training content. Through adaptive and personalized learning modules delivered via advanced platforms like VR and online courses, gamification addresses the slow development of technical expertise by providing accessible and enjoyable training opportunities.
Research Problem: Why is there a skill shortage in the metals and mining industries?
Objective
* To understand the reason behind the skill shortage in the metal and mining industries;
* To know the impact of gamification on learning and development; and
* To examine how gamification can bridge the skill gap and attract young talent to the metal and mining industries.
Data and Methodology
The study adopted thematic analysis as proposed by Barun and Clarke (2006). The objective was to understand skill shortage and the role of gamification in attracting young talent to the metal and mining industry. Thematic analysis helps identify various themes and sub-themes in addressing the research question.
The target population for the study comprised senior officials, HR managers, employees, and job applicants in the metal and mining industry. A purposive sampling technique was adopted to reach out to content-rich participants for the study (Robinson, 2014). Respondents were contacted personally and through snowbowling techniques. All the participants were briefed about the purpose of the study and assured about the confidentiality of their identity. All the respondents signed a consent form to document their personal information and experiences only for research purposes. All the interviews were conducted offline and recorded using audio recording devices. All the recordings were anonymous, and a code was assigned for analysis.
Ten candidates were identified and requested to participate in the present research. The interviewers created 15 open-ended questions (see Appendix). The experts approved the questionnaire. As per experts' feedback, a few sensitive and very personal questions were removed. Some of the questions were reframed for better responses. Respondents were asked to spare 20 to 30 minutes for the interview. The study was conducted in 2023.
Demographic Details of Participants
The average age of the ten respondents was 30.25 years. Reflecting the traditionally maledominated nature of the industry, all respondents were males. 30% of the respondents had a bachelor's degree in engineering or related fields, 40% had a diploma in mining technology, and 20% had advanced degrees in Geology or Metallurgy. Respondents belonged to the following job roles: mining engineer, geologist, equipment operator, safety and environmental officer, and technician. 80% of the respondents had 5-10 years of work experience. All the participants belonged to Jharkhand state. In response to digital literacy, 30% reported having limited digital literacy, 60% of respondents reported moderate digital skills and only 10% reported high tech-savvy.
Data Analysis
For data analysis purposes, Barun and Clarke's (2006) six-step method for thematic analysis was used. The approach is widely accepted and prevalent in thematic analysis (Maguire and Delahunt, 2017). The steps are as follows:
Step 1: Becoming Familiar with the Data: We read and re-read the respondents' transcripts to familiarize ourselves with the data. NVivo 1.5 software was used to create memos.
Step 2: Generating Initial Codes: The data was maintained in two different files: one for the officials, and the other for workers. The data was arranged in Excel files. The Excel files were imported to Nvivo.1.5 software. Each transcription was carefully read, and an initial 31 codes were generated from the data.
Step 3: Searching for Sub-Themes: The next step was to create the sub-themes through the rigorous iterative validation process. In thematic analysis, researchers can identify the themes at two levels: semantic and latent (Boyatzis, 1998). Semantic themes are derived from the explicit and surface meanings of the data. Latent themes aim to capture the underlying ideas, patterns, and assumptions. As our workers were not very knowledgeable and seasoned enough to articulate their motives and experiences in words, the researchers used more interpretative and conceptual orientation towards the data.
Step 4: Reviewing Sub-Themes: All the sub-themes were reviewed through an iterative approach. During the process, similar or overlapping sub-themes were distilled.
Step 5: Defining Themes: Two broad themes emerged, each related to challenges and gamification of L&D. Further, each theme had four sub-themes regarding challenges and the impact of gamification. A brief schema of different themes and sub-themes identified in this process, along with their corresponding representative codes, is shown in Figure 1.
Step 6: Write-Up of Themes: The following section will have a detailed explanation of all the two themes and their sub-themes.
Results
This section elaborates on the two latent themes and their sub-themes, which emerged during the analysis. The first theme is "Issues with the Young Generation" in the metal and mining industry (see Figure 1 ). In today's ever-changing business world, metals and mining industries face a lot of uncertainty and complexity. The industry also deals with the big problem of lack of skilled workers. The first sub-theme that emerged under issues with the young generation is 'Redundant work culture' (Figure 2).
Redundant Work Culture: India's metal and mining industry is regarded as redundant. Many see these jobs as boring, old-fashioned, and environmentally destructive.
"We often get stuck using normal ways of working. When people want to use new technology or make things simpler, they often meet resistance. We often keep methods that may have worked before but might not be the best or long-lasting now" (Participant no. 6).
"Let's think about how we handle data. We still use old software and a lot of hand input. Even though there are fancier tools that could hugely boost work and cut down on mistakes, people do not want to spend the money on these changes" (Participant no. 4).
Redundancy breeds in employees because of fear of job displacement and skepticism of adopting something new. Employees worry that embracing automation or new technologies might lead to job cuts.
Lack of Peer Learning: Although it appears absent in the mining and metals sector, peer learning is essential to professional development. The mining industry employs a diverse workforce of geologists, engineers, and technicians with varying specializations in mining aspects. However, the knowledge exchange between these different roles is minimal. There is a siloed approach where everyone focuses on their tasks without much interaction or collaboration.
"We often work on tight schedule. There is literary no time to discuss anything regarding work. My friends do not want to share much about their work probably because they are also worried about losing their jobs or threat of being replaced" (Participant No. 1).
The traditional hierarchical structure in the industry fosters the culture of information flowfrom the top down, but notas much laterally between peers. Employees have a wealth of knowledge within their workforce, but it is not fully tapped. New employees especially could benefit from the experience of their more seasoned colleagues. It is not just about formal training programs but the informal exchange of insights and lessons learned on the job.
Lack of Career Growth/Opportunity: The industry has a traditional career growth opportunity, and advancement in career follows a predefined path. This can demotivate some employees to diversify their skills or explore different aspects of the industry.
"People with special skills are important, but those who want to grow within the company or do things in new areas do not get the help or encouragement from seniors. Often, it looks like a road that goes just one way" (Participant no. 1).
It can lead to a sense of stagnation. Employees might feel like their professional development is restricted. This not only affects morale but also impacts retention. If individuals do not see a clear path for growth within the organization, they might seek opportunities elsewhere.
Lack of Awareness and Education: The metal and mining sector faces a significant challenge regarding awareness and education. Many employees, especially those in operational roles, might not fully grasp mining activities and the impact of their activities on society and the environment. There is a need for more comprehensive education in the larger context of the industry.
A lack of knowledge and awareness can lead to a disconnect between employees and the broader goals of sustainable and responsible mining. Without a clear understanding of the environmental and social considerations, employees may not be as motivated to adopt practices that align with these goals.
"It is not just about completing the job; it is also about doing so with less carbon footprint. Yes, safety is a very important area. We have safety rules, but we need to keep learning about new ways and tools for staying safe" (Participant no. 10).
Employee activities require improvement in training programs related to new technologies and automation. Many employees might not be fully aware of these advancements' potential benefits and challenges.
The inputs and suggestions from respondents led to the second theme, highlighting the needs and "Advantages of gamification" in learning and development functions (see Figure 3).
Engaging and Real-Time Experiences: Gamification will add an element of excitement. The gamified training programs will instigate active participation among employees in the learning process. This engagement factor is crucial in an industry with high stakes. Gamification offers employees different learning ways that suit their learning styles and preferences. It helps them understand how they can do better in their careers. Using advanced tools like virtual reality (VR) and online courses makes learning more exciting. Gamification also makes things a bit like competition, which makes people want to take part and learn, even if they learn at different speeds.
"Our field is known for being really busy and may be old-fashioned when it comes to learning and growing. Using games can make tasks that might otherwise seem boring more fun and engaging" (Participant no. 7).
A Platform for Interaction: Gamification may turn training and learning into a collaborative experience. Effective communication and teamwork are essential in an industry as collaborative as metal and mining. Gamification may allow employees to practice and enhance these skills dynamically and engagingly. The gamification of learning may create a shared experience for employees across different roles and levels. Employees can navigate these virtual scenarios, overcome challenges, and celebrate successes together.
"Of course. Think about team-building activities as an example. We can work together using games to fix problems, agree on things, and achieve shared goals. Not only is doing well by yourself important, but our ability to team up and talk in a computer-based environment also matters" (Participant no. 7).
Reward Through Badges and Leaderboards: Introducing a system of badges and leaderboards that acknowledges and compensates young workers for their achievements and contributions will be possible with gamification. This element of competition can ignite motivation and positive rivalry, enhancing involvement and skill refinement.
"Of course, the opportunity to receive badges and rewards will take the reward and recognition to a whole new level. It will generate sportsmanship among employees. The badgeswill be considered an obvious symbol of achievement. Leaderboard may clearly state where the employee stands and what he has to do to move upward" (Participant no. 7).
Training Program Through VR: Incorporate virtual reality (VR) training programs that provide immersive and true-to-life encounters. This technology can replicate complex scenarios, creating a secure environment for young workers to cultivate skills and boost self-assurance. Additionally, VR can offer an inventive training approach, capturing the interest of technologically inclined young employees.
"Application of VR in training modules will allow the employees to operate and handle the sophisticated and technical machinery well in advance before they experiment with the real machinery. It will save time, provide on-the-job training and reduce the chance of mishandling or accidents. Employee will receive more than just mere demonstration; he can operate it and learn its functioning as well as troubleshooting" (participant no. 9).
Discussion
The mining industry faces a big problem because there are not enough skilled workers in India. This is causing issues with getting work done and meeting essential goals. Many leaders in the mining industry say that not having enough skilled workers is a big problem. This shortage of skilled workers is terrible in specific areas like planning mines, engineering processes, and working with digital technology. Because there are not enough skilled people, the industry has difficulty developing new ideas and moving forward.
Combining technology and learning is important to deal with the changing skills needed. Changing the way things are done using technology, known as digital transformation, is a big part of making industries more active and competitive. It is crucial to create a culture where learning is encouraged to ensure that employees keep learning and stay in the company. This kind of culture helps to develop new ideas and keeps the company abreast even as technology changes quickly.
One of the strategies that can really change how we learn and grow is gamification. This means adding elements of games to learning situations, making them fun and interactive. The great thing about gamification is that it makes learning enjoyable and motivating. By using things like leaderboards, badges, and other game-like things, employees are encouraged to learn and get better at their skills, which helps solve the problem of not having enough skills. A key part of gamification is that it matches up with what individuals and the company want to achieve. By connecting what employees want with what the company wants, industries can make people want to work harder. Gamification gives a structure for employees to really care about their goals, which can help the industry do well.
In summary, using gamification in learning and development is a good way for the metal and mining industry to deal with the problem of insufficient skilled workers. This approach fixes the skills problem and helps change how people see the industry by making learning interesting, personal, and aligned with big goals. In a changing and uncertain world, gamification is a strong tool to bring in, grow, and keep the talented people needed for the industry to do well and be innovative.
Recommendations: To tackle the issues encountered by the industry in attracting and managing young individuals in the metal mining sectors, here are a few proposals for learning and development programs:
First, provide interactive and immediate learning encounters by developing lively and interactive training modules that provide young workers with engaging and real-time learning experiences. Make use of technology to replicate work situations, enabling them to put their learning into practice. This practical approach helps connect theoretical knowledge with real-world skills.
Second, define transparent career advancement routes by crafting explicit paths for career progression that offer chances for skill enhancement and upward mobility. This framework can give young employees a distinct route for their professional journey, motivating them to dedicate effort to their careers within the field.
Third, provide acknowledgment via badges and leaderboards. Leader boards add an element of healthy competition. Seeing your name on the leaderboard, whether for completing training modules or achieving certain performance metrics, creates a sense of accomplishment. It fosters a bit of friendly rivalry, pushing individuals to strive for excellence, and continuously improves employees' performance.
Finally, implement virtual reality (VR) training. VR gamification transports one to different scenarios, allowing one to experience and respond to challenges as if they were happening in real life. It is an incredibly effective way to prepare for the complexities of employees' work.
Conclusion
The paper focused on the growing practice of gamification, which injects enjoyment and rewards into work to enhance employee loyalty and engagement. By integrating elements of enjoyment and incentives into work routines, gamification can potentially heighten employee engagement and diminish turnover rates. The opportunity for distinctive learning preferences to the younger generation, particularly the millennials, will significantly improve employee engagement.
The proposed model draws from qualitative research methods, outlining how gamification effectively addresses the challenges faced by the metal and mining industry in appealing to the present generation. The model considers the motivating factors for the millennials, like pursuit of immediate rewards, drive for success, and the need for recognition at work. Gamification achieves this by integrating competitive leaderboards, social learning opportunities, and swift feedback mechanisms. These aspects cater to the desire for instant gratification, foster a sense of accomplishment through healthy competition, and offer channels for recognition. By embracing gamification in this manner, the metal and mining industry can reshape itself into an attractive and rewarding workplace for the younger generation.

Abstract: Knowledge transfer from a parent multinational to a foreign subsidiary does not automatically lead to innovation in a host country. To develop from a learner into an innovator, a foreign subsidiary must develop sufficient absorptive capacity. But too much reliance on knowledge transferred from a multinational could hinder local innovation by generating resource constraints and organizational rigidity. We thus predict an inverted U-shaped relationship between knowledge transfer from a parent multinational and local innovation. Moreover, factors which influence the transition from learner to innovator were investigated using data on patent applications by foreign subsidiaries of 75 large multinationals in China between 2008 and 2016. The number of research and development centers the subsidiary maintains was found to be influential, as is hiring a local executive as the subsidiary’s top manager. Greater institutional distance between the parent’s and the subsidiary’s economies was found to promote the transition, as do greater technological richness and more vigorous competition in the host country. The relationship between knowledge transfer from a parent multinational and local innovation is weaker, however, in older subsidiaries.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 7th International Conference on Mechatronics and Computer Technology Engineering (MCTE) Conference Start Date: 2024 Aug. 23 Conference End Date: 2024 Aug. 25 Conference Location: Guangzhou, China Named Entity Recognition (NER) technology is a key technique for resume information extraction, and there are current issues with resume NER algorithms such as poor knowledge transfer ability, large model parameter volume, and long model training time. This paper proposes a new method based on Rora instruction fine-tuning of large language models combined with situation simulation. By introducing low-rank matrices to simulate the effect of full-parameter fine-tuning, and transforming the Resume dataset into a knowledge question-and-answer format that integrates situation simulation, the fine-tuned large language model is more suitable for the application scenarios of resume entity recognition. Experiments show that the F1 score on the Resume dataset that integrates situation simulation reached 95.14%. Compared to several models that perform well in the task of resume named entity recognition, the improvements were 5.72%, 4.38%, and 1.62% respectively, thereby validating that the method can effectively leverage the advantages of NLG (Natural Language Generation) language models in text generation to accomplish the task of named entity recognition.

Abstract: Motivation shapes the actions of individuals, serving as a driving force behind behavior and decision-making. In education, motivation significantly impacts academic achievement, persistence, engagement, and emotional well-being. Motivated students are more likely to set high academic goals, persist despite challenges, and engage deeply in classroom activities, leading to better knowledge retention and satisfaction. Additionally, motivation fosters self-regulated learning strategies, essential for lifelong learning and adapting to new challenges. This Master’s thesis investigates the relationship between students' dominant academic motivation type and their level of career decidedness, grounded in Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985). According to this theory, intrinsic motivation, associated with autonomy, is fundamental to personal self-regulation and effective behavior, showing strong associations with academic motivation and potentially, career clarity. A sample of 458 students from the University of Coimbra, encompassing diverse faculties (STEM, Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences), study cycles, age groups, and genders, was utilized to explore this relationship. The study employed a quantitative methodology, using validated questionnaires to assess academic motivation (Academic Motivation Scale by Vallerand, 1992) and career decidedness (Career Decision Scale by Osipow, 1976). The findings reveal that participants exhibited below-average levels of most types of academic motivation, while the general level of career decidedness among students was above average. Gender differences indicated that female students had slightly higher levels of Extrinsic Motivation - Introjected Regulation compared to male students. Students identifying as a gender “other” than male or female reported higher demotivation, although there were no significant differences in demotivation based on gender overall. Age-related differences showed that younger students (aged 18-25) exhibited lower intrinsic motivation and higher extrinsic motivation, while older students demonstrated the opposite dynamics, with no significant differences in demotivation based on age. Regarding study cycles, Master's and Doctorate level students exhibited higher intrinsic motivation compared to Bachelor's students. Additionally, Bachelor's and Doctorate students exhibited higher levels of demotivation compared to Master's students. In terms of the field of study, intrinsic motivation was higher among students in the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) compared to those in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). STEM students demonstrated higher levels of extrinsic motivation and demotivation compared to HASS students. Finally, the research found no significant correlation between academic motivation types and career decidedness, raising questions for further investigation on the applicability of Self-Determination Theory in the field of education. This study's findings hold potential for practical applications aimed at improving academic methodologies in higher education institutions, thereby fostering positive career outcomes for students. Alternate abstract: A motivação molda as ações dos indivíduos, servindo como uma força motriz por trás do comportamento e da tomada de decisões. Na educação, a motivação impacta significativamente o desempenho académico, a persistência, o envolvimento e o bem-estar emocional. Alunos motivados são mais propensos a estabelecer metas académicas elevadas, persistir apesar dos desafios e envolver-se profundamente nas atividades em sala de aula, levando a uma melhor retenção do conhecimento e satisfação. Além disso, a motivação promove estratégias de aprendizagem autorregulada, essenciais para a aprendizagem ao longo da vida e adaptação a novos desafios. Esta tese de Mestrado investiga a relação entre o tipo dominante de motivação académica dos alunos e o seu nível de decisão de carreira, fundamentada na Teoria da Autodeterminação (Deci & Ryan, 1985). De acordo com esta teoria, a motivação intrínseca, associada à autonomia, é fundamental para a autorregulação pessoal e comportamento eficaz, mostrando fortes associações com a motivação académica e, potencialmente, com a clareza de carreira. Uma amostra de 458 alunos da Universidade de Coimbra, abrangendo diversas faculdades (STEM, Artes e Humanidades, Ciências Sociais), ciclos de estudo, faixas etárias e géneros, foi utilizada para explorar esta relação. O estudo empregou uma metodologia quantitativa, utilizando questionários validados para avaliar a motivação académica (Escala de Motivação Académica de Vallerand, 1992) e a decisão de carreira (Escala de Decisão de Carreira de Osipow, 1976). Os resultados revelam que os participantes exibiram níveis abaixo da média na maioria dos tipos de motivação académica, enquanto o nível geral de decisão de carreira entre os alunos foi acima da média. Diferenças de género indicaram que as alunas apresentaram níveis ligeiramente mais altos de Motivação Extrínseca - Regulação Introjetada em comparação com os alunos. Alunos que se identificam com um género “diferente” de masculino ou feminino relataram maior desmotivação, embora não tenham sido encontradas diferenças significativas na desmotivação com base no género em geral. Diferenças relacionadas à idade mostraram que os alunos mais jovens (com idades entre 18-25 anos) exibiram menor motivação intrínseca e maior motivação extrínseca, enquanto os alunos mais velhos demonstraram a dinâmica oposta, sem diferenças significativas na desmotivação com base na idade. Em relação aos ciclos de estudo, os alunos de Mestrado e Doutoramento exibiram maior motivação intrínseca em comparação com os alunos de Licenciatura. Além disso, os alunos de Licenciatura e Doutoramento exibiram níveis mais altos de desmotivação em comparação com os alunos de Mestrado. Em termos de área de estudo, a motivação intrínseca foi maior entre os alunos de Humanidades, Artes e Ciências Sociais (HASS) em comparação com aqueles de Ciência, Tecnologia, Engenharia e Matemática (STEM). Os alunos de STEM demonstraram níveis mais altos de motivação extrínseca e desmotivação em comparação com os alunos de HASS. Finalmente, a pesquisa não encontrou correlação significativa entre os tipos de motivação académica e a decisão de carreira, levantando questões para investigação futura sobre a aplicabilidade da Teoria da Autodeterminação no campo da educação. As descobertas deste estudo têm potencial para aplicações práticas voltadas para a melhoria das metodologias académicas em instituições de ensino superior, promovendo assim resultados de carreira positivos para os alunos.

Abstract: Culture is a cornerstone of identity, yet many cultures face the risk of fading into obscurity despite efforts to preserve them through various mediums. Leveraging the concept of 3D serious games and basing the research on key learning theories like the maker pedagogy and multiliteracies theory, this research aims to educate children about culture by developing a 3D game maker tool that implements key elements of the researched learning theories. The goal is to empower users aged 12 and older to effortlessly create serious 3D cultural games in a first-person view, enriching the experience with IoT and AI features. Additionally, the tool facilitates gameplay of games crafted using the same platform, fostering social interaction and aligning with effective forms of learning. Methodologically, an iterative design process was employed, starting with the creation of initial prototypes and interviews to discern optimal features and design principles. The tool was refined based on insights gathered from existing literature on serious game design guidelines, prioritizing user-friendly accessibility, and ensuring the learning theories are properly implemented. In the final trial, participants engaged in crafting 3D serious games using the tool, juxtaposed against a control group utilizing a conventional 2D storyboarding tool. Subsequently, participants immersed themselves in a serious game experience exploring Kristang culture, with learning gain, memory, and knowledge retention meticulously evaluated. Despite its focus on Kristang culture, the tool's adaptable nature suggests its potential applicability to diverse cultural contexts. Findings indicate that the tool improved user experience and learning outcomes for Kristang cultural heritage education compared to control methods. However, limitations such as a small sample size and system constraints were encountered. Research implications delve into the potential of the 3D serious game maker tool as an effective educational tool for children to learn about culture, contributing to the broader understanding of utilizing innovative technology for cultural education among younger demographics. Moreover, design guidelines established in the study lay a foundation for future research endeavors seeking to develop effective educational tools with a significant impact on learning outcomes. Practically, integrating the tool into classroom settings holds promise for fostering immersive and interactive cultural education experiences, augmenting traditional instruction, and facilitating collaborative learning. This research introduces an innovative educational tool that combines elements of the maker movement with experiential learning paradigms, addressing the gap of lack in 3D cultural maker educational tools that combine learning theories into their framework. This research aims to implement those learning theories into an engaging 3D game maker tool specifically for the Kristang culture. In conclusion, the development of this innovative 3D serious game maker tool represents a significant stride towards cultural education for younger generations. Embracing the opportunities presented by this tool can pave the way for more inclusive and dynamic approaches to cultural learning, empowering children to explore, create, and celebrate diverse cultural narratives in a digital age.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Conference Start Date: 2024, Oct. 13 Conference End Date: 2024, Oct. 16 Conference Location: Washington, DC, USA This research-to-practice study aims to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) MCQ generation system for engineering students, with a focus on adaptive learning, educational technology, and innovative assessment tools, to enhance personalized learning. Engineering education faces significant academic performance challenges, with first-year retention rates in STEM fields ranging between 27% to 46%, largely due to poor academic achievements. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) identify misconceptions, reinforce knowledge retention, and offer efficient assessment methods for engineering education. This interactive method improves attention and memory retention, reinforces knowledge, and improves comprehension. In this context, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 has marked a significant advancement. Our literature review method employed a systematic approach, analyzing peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, and authoritative reports to uncover the trends and challenges in AI-driven quiz generation. The notable gap identified in our literature review is the lack of LLM-based adaptive quiz generation methods specifically for engineering education. Our methodology involved sourcing relevant structured datasets, data pre-processing, embedding generation, vector database storage, hybrid-search retrieval, LLM query results feed, prompt engineering, and context-based response. In this research, we adopted Vectara as a vector database tool for its automatic data ingestion capabilities and seamless integration with generative AI applications. Prompt engineering involves a dual-prompt approach, where the Contextual Question Prompt formulates questions based on user topics and chat history, while the Answer Question Prompt manages MCQ responses with explanations, ensuring relevant and contextually accurate interactions. Evaluation includes topic relevancy, answer relevancy, and a contextual relevancy score. Preliminary results indicate promising results for the generation of accurate and contextually appropriate questions with minimal hallucinations. The quiz generation system was deployed using Streamlit cloud-based architecture to showcase the functionality. Looking forward, we aim to expand the dataset to include more diverse engineering disciplines and to refine the retrieval algorithms to better handle complex diagrams and mathematical expressions commonly found in engineering texts.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed the emergence of digital solutions in all areas of medicine. Our prior study on the digital health related experiences and opinions of Hungarian physicians highlights the crucial role of age in shaping attitudes towards digital health solutions among medical doctors. Our aim was to examine how under 35-year-old Hungarian physicians relate to digital technologies, the advantages and disadvantages they perceive, and how they would like to incorporate these technologies into their everyday medical practice. Background The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed the emergence of digital solutions in all areas of medicine. Our prior study on the digital health related experiences and opinions of Hungarian physicians highlights the crucial role of age in shaping attitudes towards digital health solutions among medical doctors. Our aim was to examine how under 35-year-old Hungarian physicians relate to digital technologies, the advantages and disadvantages they perceive, and how they would like to incorporate these technologies into their everyday medical practice.As part of the "E-physicians and E-patients in Hungary" study, we conducted an online representative survey among medical practitioners in Hungary between July 2021 and May 2022 ( n  = 1,774). The main target group of our research were physicians under 35 years of age: n  = 399 (25.3%). Besides descriptive statistical analyses, cluster analysis and binary logistic regression were applied to analyse the digital health related attitudes of the young age group. Methods As part of the "E-physicians and E-patients in Hungary" study, we conducted an online representative survey among medical practitioners in Hungary between July 2021 and May 2022 (n = 1,774). The main target group of our research were physicians under 35 years of age: n = 399 (25.3%). Besides descriptive statistical analyses, cluster analysis and binary logistic regression were applied to analyse the digital health related attitudes of the young age group.Our cluster analysis confirmed that younger doctors perceived more advantages (on average 7.07 items vs. 8.52 items) and disadvantages (on average 4.06 vs. 4.42) of digital health solutions. They also demonstrated greater familiarity with (8.27 vs. 9.79) and use of (1.94 vs. 2.66) a broader spectrum of technologies. Proficiency and active utilization of diverse technologies correlates with a more comprehensive understanding of both pros and cons, as well as a more realistic self-assessment of areas of further improvement. Doctors under 35 years express a notable demand for significantly increased incentives, both in terms of knowledge transfer/training and infrastructure incentives. Multivariate analyses revealed that young doctors, compared to their older counterparts, perceived enhanced patient adherence as one of the greatest benefits of digital health solutions. Additionally, young doctors expect that digital health solutions could reduce burnout.

Antiferromagnetic Spin Dynamics and Transport Using Coherent and Incoherent Methods

Author: Rodriguez, Rodolfo, III

Abstract: Recently significant progress has been made in theoretical understanding of spin dynamics and transport in antiferromagnet-based systems. The experimental methodology however cannot be considered as fully developed yet. There is a need for methods to experimentally study spin dynamics and spin transport in both thin-film and bulk AFM’s. In conjunction with the development of measurement techniques, initial experimentation is necessary to identify avenues of interest for future research. In order to answer the pressing questions involving magnetic damping, interfacial spin transport, and multi-magnon processes within antiferromagnets, coherent and incoherent methods can be used. This dissertation examines antiferromagnetic spin dynamics and transport using coherent and incoherent methods. The motivation behind this research stems from the significant progress made in the theoretical understanding of spin dynamics and transport in antiferromagnet-based systems. Despite these advancements, experimental methodologies are not yet fully developed, necessitating new methods to study spin dynamics and transport in thin-film and bulk antiferromagnets (AFMs). The coherent approach employed in this dissertation combines microwave spectroscopy via antiferromagnetic resonance and spin pumping in bulk Cr 2 O 3 . This approach aims to provide insights into magnetic damping within antiferromagnets. On the other hand, the incoherent approach primarily consists of spin Seebeck measurements on high-quality Cr 2 O 3 thin films. This dissertation explores spin injection in antiferromagnetic thin films capped with ferromagnetic detection layers such as Pt, Py, or both. Utilizing the spin Seebeck effect (SSE), which involves driving spin injection by means of a thermal gradient, the research investigates interfacial spin transport in a hybrid antiferromagnet/ferromagnet system composed of Cr 2 O 3 and Permalloy. Notably, the study demonstrates that this spin transport remains robust up to room temperature, a significant finding for potential practical applications of AFM-based devices. The experimental data is analyzed within a spin diffusion model, highlighting the crucial role of interfacial magnon pumping in signal generation. The dissertation also examines coherently driven antiferromagnetic resonance and spin pumping in Cr 2 O 3 . The research delves into the excitation of spin dynamics in antiferromagnets, specifically focusing on the existence of left-handed (LH) and right-handed (RH) magnons in uniaxial antiferromagnets. This approach aims to provide insights into magnetic damping within antiferromagnets. This is achieved by positioning a single crystal of Cr 2 O 3 on a coplanar waveguide and subjecting it to pulse-modulated monochromatic microwave spectroscopy. Through this approach, the research investigates the resonant response from an AFM while simultaneously measuring the spin pumping signal via the inverse spin Hall effect (iSHE). Finally, the dissertation addresses the theoretical framework of precessional auto-oscillations for ferromagnets with spin inertia. It introduces the novel concept of nutational auto-oscillations, suggesting their potential importance for future ultra-high frequency technologies. The research also identifies parallels between spin dynamics in ferrimagnets and inertial ferromagnets, deriving an isomorphism that lays the foundation for synergistic knowledge transfer between these research fields.

Abstract: Society today is struggling with various challenging phenomena. This manuscript aims to analyse two phenomena, ageing and digitalisation, in the context of education. Both phenomena are an important area of research: the complexity of an ageing population and the intersection of technology and education. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the opportunity to improve the educational experiences of older adults. AI-driven tools and educational initiatives can be tailored to the different learning preferences and cognitive abilities of this population, promoting engagement and knowledge retention. The adaptability of AI systems enables personalised learning pathways that address individual challenges and promote lifelong learning and cognitive health in older learners. This research will highlight the critical role of AI in reshaping educational paradigms and its potential to facilitate knowledge acquisition and empower an often-marginalised population. Finally, focusing on the role of international projects will allow us to understand the trends in EU research and funding. Understanding the impact of AI on education in the third age and EU funding invites a broader discussion on inclusivity and innovation in the educational landscape.

Creating a Digital House of Knowledge: Ensuring the Continuation and Integrity of Indigenous Knowledge Transfers in the Digital Era

Author: Cordova, Jacquelyn C.    

Publication info: Cordova, Jacquelyn C. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/creating-digital-house-knowledge-ensuring/docview/3145935491/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Traditional Indigenous knowledge transfer systems have contributed to the sustainability of highly advanced Indigenous societies since time immemorial. These systems have been purposefully targeted since European arrival to the Americas in the late 1400s and early 1500s, consequently creating barriers for Indigenous Peoples as they strive to conduct their traditional knowledge transfer processes within their communities. These barriers, paired with the continual rise and use of global technologies, have created circumstances where many Native Elders and Knowledge Keepers experience difficulty reaching their youth and community members to ensure the successful transfer of Indigenous data and knowledge to current and future generations. This research applies Critical Indigenous Research Methodologies (CIRM), Participant Action Research (PAR), and Grounded Theory (GT), along with data generated from twenty-five project participants, to create a model of an Indigenous-made “Digital House of Knowledge” for those who seek to ensure the continuation and integrity of their distinct Indigenous knowledge transfer systems now and into the future. By discussing critical topics such as the security, privacy, and protection of data, processes for gathering, storing, sharing, accessing, and maintaining data, the design and structural components of digital platforms, and the importance and urgency of the application of traditional Indigenous protocols within the digital realm, this research provides a comprehensive overview of critical key points for the successful gathering, storage, protection, and dissemination of Indigenous data and knowledge within the digital realm.

Abstract: The Secretary of Public Health (SSP) faces a looming skills gap due to retirements and rotations of civil service staff. Critical knowledge retention is crucial across all generational cohorts due to the retirement and turnover of workers. This study develops a protocol that addresses the knowledge retention needs of the four generations (Baby Boomers, X, Y, Z) that coexist in the workforce to ensure the continuity of the Public Health Secretariat. The objective of the study is to develop a protocol for the management, transfer, and retention of critical knowledge. A scoping review is conducted in Scopus and Web of Science to develop the protocol, to identify critical knowledge workers through tool scores. The instrument developed in this research includes two pilots on Baby Boomer and Millennial workers. Both workers had critical and essential knowledge for the continuity of the organisation. The Baby Boomer worker presented a higher amount of tacit, operational, and individually owned knowledge, while the Millennial worker showed a predominance of tacit technological knowledge. This protocol provides a practical and adaptable approach to identifying and prioritising critical knowledge holders, allowing organisations to map and determine the amount of essential knowledge within the workforce. An important limitation of the study is the small sample of workers who participated in the pilot test of the protocol. Further research is therefore recommended in other public administrations and across all generations in employment.

Full text: 1. Introduction The public sector, and in particular, the Secretary of Public Health (SSP), is in a time of change, and integrates employees belonging to different generations (Baby Boomers, Generation X, Generation Millennial, and Generation Z) who coexist in the work environment of the Public Administration [1,2].
With a high turnover of workers in a highly experienced or critical workplace, the risk of critical knowledge loss is very high, as the tacit and explicit knowledge of the worker is affected [3]. The replacement of Baby Boomers is of concern to Public Administrations (PAs) in order to ensure the continuity and survival of the public sector [4]. To this end, it is necessary to plan sufficiently in advance a succession and replacement plan to ensure that qualified candidates for the administration are retained [4,5].
Critical knowledge within an organisation refers to the specific information, skills, experiences, and competencies that are essential to its operations, competitive advantage, and long-term sustainability [6]. This type of knowledge is vital for executing key processes, making strategic decisions, and adapting to environmental changes [7].
Knowledge Management and Retention (KMR) plays a very important and strategic role within organisations, as KMR-based processes are difficult to implement [8]. It is true that public sector organisations are more complex than private companies, which can make it difficult to implement effective KMR strategies [9], a discipline little studied in the public sector [8]. Currently, there is a lack of coherent models for KMR in this sector [8].
In this scenario, retaining and capturing talent and/or knowledge is a priority for generational renewal in the event of retirement and in the event of replacement (when employees change jobs) [3]. The literature suggests investigating which knowledge management models are most effective in contexts of high turnover or accelerated organizational change [3].
Therefore, the aim of the study is to create a protocol that correctly manages retirement and replacement, creating two documents to have a management system for KMR, and using a file for each worker (with scoring variables) and a critical knowledge document (indicating who has the critical knowledge), especially in the middle management category.
After the introduction, the literature review, the objective of the study, the methodology used to meet the objective, the results, the discussion of the results, and the conclusions are presented. This study is intended to be a starting point and inspiration for other public authorities to promote effective management for the generational changeover that different organizations will have to carry out in the short term, due to the large number of employees approaching retirement.
2. Literature Review Public administration, to ensure its survival and continuity, must retain critical knowledge [4,10] as this can be lost in the face of retirements and replacements due to job stress, job dissatisfaction, and/or illness [10]. Therefore, succession and replacement plans should be planned in advance [4].
For this reason, critical knowledge management is decisive in generational handover and replacement processes [5]. When key personnel are lost through retirement, turnover or mobility, critical knowledge about efficient, unique, and difficult-to-change processes can be lost [10]. Therefore, it is crucial to identify critical knowledge and manage it, as the protocol under study aims to do.
Furthermore, it is necessary to store this critical knowledge in a map for each job (especially jobs requiring high expertise) for continuous improvement of management in public administration [11]. It should be noted that a differential of this protocol is to consider the four labour-active generations (Baby Boomers, X, Y, Z) that occupy the jobs [1,12], in addition to seeking the dissemination of knowledge so that it is not lost through the use of this tool, to support the relay and replacement of staff [4,5]. The critical knowledge mapping technique is a tool to identify and manage effective knowledge transition [11,13].
In this protocol, it is essential to include the digital and sustainability competencies demanded by today’s environment [14,15]. Digital competencies are referred to as STARA (smart technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, algorithms, and digitalization) [14]. The literature highlights the need for digital talent retention and sustainability [14]. Moreover, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report highlights the importance of technology skills in public administration [16] and the Public Governance Reviews Skills for a High Performing Civil Service (OECD) report also highlights STARA skills in the workplace [14].
Sustainability-related skills are also key in talent management [17], green creativity [18], individual green development [19], social and ecological sustainability [17], and environmental sustainability [14]. On the other hand, the multigenerational work environment in which four generations [1], with different characteristics and competencies, coexist mixes the pre-digital generation and the digital generation [20], (the Baby Boomer generation and the remaining generations, Generation X, Generation Millennial (Generation Y), and Generation Z) [21].
In relation to the working generation, the Baby Boomer generation (born between 1946 and 1964) prioritizes work and shows great dedication and loyalty to it, valuing economic and financial stability above all else [21]. They are also competitive and prefer face-to-face communication to telematics [22]. As for Generation X (born between 1965 and 1980), they have lived in an environment of social and economic change. They are also characterized by their independence and flexibility at work [23]. They are a more tech-savvy and computer-literate generation [23], and they do not change workplaces frequently and tend to be satisfied with their jobs [24]. On the other hand, Generation Y or Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996), have grown up with technological development [23]. They are a more driven generation, with higher job expectations, and often feel undervalued [25]. They also change workplaces frequently [1] and value work-life balance, although they are more individualistic, narcissistic, and anxious than Baby Boomers [1]. Finally, Generation Z is the generation of digital natives, who value authenticity and instant communication [22], as well as connection in social networks [22]. They also seek social and environmental engagement in the workplace [26], are ambitious, creative, and adaptable, and prefer flexible and inclusive workplaces, although they sometimes feel undervalued like Millennials [27,28].
Because of the multigenerational differences, the protocol includes the first phase differentiating Baby Boomers (Phase 1A) from the rest of the generations in the labour market (Phase 1B) in line with the academic literature [10,22]. In Phase 1A, the scoring items used are competency-based [14,15] and identify the expected date of retirement [29], the characteristics of the person’s knowledge and skills [29,30], the difficulty of the required knowledge [29,30], and existing job categories and years of experience [30], along with technology skills [14,15] and sustainability skills [14,18,19]. These items are supported by the academic literature.
In Phase 1B, the items to be scored are job continuity risk [10], and the remaining items correspond to Phase 1A: the characteristics and difficulty of the type of knowledge required [28,29], existing job categories, and years of experience [29], together with technological skills [14,15] and sustainability skills [14,18,19]. In the exceptional case of technology skills, differentiated according to the academic literature, higher technology skills scores are considered appropriate for workers of other generations because they are born in the ‘digital age’ with preferences for the use of digital tools [20,30]. It is worth noting that since Generation X, people have grown up in technological environments [22], with more language and technology skills [20,30].
The second phase of the protocol is divided into two phases: Phase 2A and Phase 2B. For the development of Phase 2A, a semi-structured interview based on the Cognitive Job Analysis Model was conducted [27,28] The score is determined by four elements: continuous training, congresses and conferences [4,29], documents related to the workplace [5,25], contacts with colleagues and others [30,31,32,33], and critical incidents (CI) [34,35].
Regarding phase 2B, based on a structured interview and knowledge mapping, academic literature identifies four types of knowledge (human knowledge, technological knowledge, relational and leadership knowledge, and operational knowledge) related to the job, to identify critical and tacit knowledge of organizations and store the types of knowledge essential for generational change or replacement [29,36].
The Phase 2B structured interview questions are derived from academic literature [28,29,32,37,38,39,40,41] and are classified according to the four types of knowledge. For human knowledge, personal, social, cultural, and psychological factors are considered [32]; with reference to technological knowledge, it is based on the knowledge associated with the skills to use technologies [32]; Regarding relational and leadership knowledge, it is based on the internal and external links of employees, aspects of leadership, negotiation, and people development [32,37]; and operational knowledge deals with the risks of operations and the functioning of organizations [32]. Furthermore, competencies related to sustainability, the environment, society, and governance, as well as Corporate Social Responsibility, also play an important role in the public sector so as not to compromise future generations and make better decisions [42,43]. The knowledge map is completed during the interview and allows for the classification of individual and social knowledge [32,37,44], the nature of the knowledge [12,39], and the functions and location of the knowledge [37,39]. Other tools to manage critical knowledge can be mentoring [34,39], Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, robotization, and simulation [45], among others. Although the protocol allows organizations to preserve critical knowledge and adapt to generational changes with greater resilience and without negative impact, generating a competitive advantage [4,5].
To evaluate the risk of losing critical knowledge in Phase 2B, the Acric Institute formula is used [10,11], which includes the importance, difficulty, and involvement of workers in relation to the available workforce that has that knowledge [10,11]. Finally, according to academic literature, the order of prioritization of critical knowledge of the job [4] is a critical knowledge score [10,11], which is considered a priority in Baby Boomers [12] and then in the other generations (Generation X, Generation Millennial, Generation Z) [4,10,11,13].
3. Materials and Methods The methodology used for the development of the background related to the protocol was based on an exhaustive review of the literature following the steps of a Scoping Review with the PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines [46]. We selected this type of literature review because its main objective is to map existing evidence, identify gaps in knowledge, and clarify concepts [47]. For the development of the protocol, we previously answered the following study question: How can critical knowledge be retained and transferred in public administrations to plan a good generational succession?
The Web of Science and Scopus databases were used to search for the scientific articles to be included in this literature review. Two of the authors screened the articles by title and abstract according to the eligibility criteria. Subsequently, the selected articles were agreed upon and a final decision on their inclusion was made after a complete reading of the entire text. A third author intervened to resolve any discrepancies in the final decision on the inclusion of each article.
3.1. Eligibility Criteria For this study, specific filters were applied to select the scientific articles for analysis from Scopus, Web of Science, and other databases such as Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria focused on articles published between 2005 and 2024, specifically addressing knowledge and talent management, as well as generational change within both the public and private sectors. Articles detailing techniques for identifying critical knowledge in multigenerational and ageing workforce environments were included, along with those discussing knowledge transfer methods applicable to public administrations.
Excluded from the study were articles published before 2005, conference proceedings, and doctoral theses. Articles were also excluded if they did not explicitly address generational change, dealt exclusively with knowledge management in higher education institutions, or described studies that could not be replicated within a public administration context.
The articles finally included in the literature review were publications that reflect previous experiences of the public sector and public health secretariats in different areas, and explore recent experiences [4,34,36]. In addition, some publications were identified that had used validated surveys to identify the competencies of public sector employees [4,10,11,29,30,48], which served as a starting point and inspiration for the proposal of the protocol presented in the study.
In addition to these studies, other more conceptual and descriptive studies of the different types of knowledge that exist in an organization have been incorporated [32,37], as well as articles related to the description of the different generations in the workplace and different strategies for knowledge retention and transfer [8,9,38,39].
3.2. Search Strategy The search strategy employed for the literature review was as follows: literature review was as follows: ‘Public administration’ OR ‘Public service’ OR ‘Public Health Administration*’ OR ‘Public employment’ OR ‘Generational change*’ OR ‘Generational renewal’ OR ‘Generational relief’ OR ‘Generational differences’ OR ‘Intergenerational workforce’ AND ‘Job description’ AND ‘Job motivation’ AND ‘Public service motivation’ AND ‘Public human resource management’ AND ‘Attract talent’.
3.3. Development of the Protocol This research protocol follows an exploratory methodology, both quantitative and qualitative, designed to detect critical knowledge. A total of three phases have been considered for its design: Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3. The first two phases (Phase 1 and Phase 2) contain a formula of scored items that contain a discriminant cut-off point for considering critical knowledge. The items included are supported by previously reviewed scientific literature. Phase 3 is based on the collection of two documents: an employee record and a critical knowledge document according to the scientific literature.

- - . Phase 1 (Screening phase): identifies those people who present critical knowledge for all their knowledge, learning, and experience, depending on whether they are Baby Boomers (phase 1A) or other generations currently in the labour market (phase 1B) (View Supplementary Material: Tables S1–S6).


The items in Phase 1A include the upcoming retirement date, the characteristics and difficulties of the required knowledge, job categories, years of experience, and technological and sustainability competencies. This phase is based on the methodology of the Nuclear Industry, which highlights two key variables for knowledge retention: the retirement date and the characteristics of the job [29]. The complexity and inherent difficulties of the knowledge are assessed, along with two additional factors: Time to Learn (TTL) and Knowledge Complexity (KC) [30]. These elements are considered risk factors for the loss of critical knowledge (CK). The assessment of technological competencies is also included, as a new approach to these competencies and digitalization has recently been developed, validating a questionnaire to quantify them [14,15].

- Screening formula Phase 1A (Baby Boomers)


[(Expected date of retirement) × (Characteristics and difficulty of knowledge) × (Job category × years of experience) × (Technological competencies) × (Sustainability competencies)]
The final discriminant score to determine whether a worker moves to the next phase 2A is >378 points [(3) × (4) × (3) × (3) × (3) × (3.5) = 378].
The evaluable items in Phase 2B include the risk of continuity in the workplace, the characteristics and difficulties of the required knowledge, and technological and sustainability competencies, all supported by academic literature. Unlike Phase 1A, the item “Risk of Continuity” is incorporated, which is considered significant as it can impact knowledge loss [11]. This is particularly relevant as it is not only retirement that motivates individuals to leave their jobs, workers from generations prior to the Baby Boom may depart due to ambition, frustration, or health issues [10].
Additionally, Phase 2B retains the items concerning knowledge characteristics and technological competencies from Phase 1A. However, a higher score is exceptionally assigned to technological competencies for younger generations (X, Millennial, and Z) as they have grown up in the digital age and demonstrate a preference for using digital tools [20,40]. It is also noteworthy that starting from Generation X, individuals have matured in technological environments, which enhances their linguistic and technological competencies [20,23,40].

- Screening formula Phase 1B (Other generations)


(Continuity Risk) × (Characteristics and Difficulty of Knowledge) × (Job Category × Years of Experience) × (Technological Competencies) × (Sustainability Related Competencies)]
The final discriminant score to determine whether a worker moves to the next phase 2A is >504 points [(3) × (4) × (3) × (4) × (3.5) = 504].
- - . Phase 2 (Critical knowledge identification phase): This phase includes two sub-phases (Phase 2A and Phase 2B). Phase 2A consists of a semi-structured interview, in which a total of four items are assessed: continuous education, congresses and/or workshops, writing workplace documents, internal and external contacts, and IC (Tables S7–S10). On the other hand, phase 2B consists of a structured interview to identify the knowledge that may pose a risk to the continuity of the organisation. To determine the knowledge, 20 questions were asked based on risk derived from human knowledge (5 questions), technological knowledge (5 questions), relational and leadership knowledge (5 questions), and operational knowledge (5 questions) (Table S11). With the completion of the questions, the corresponding Knowledge Mapping document is filled in (Table S12), and finally, each detected knowledge is scored individually with the risk formula (Table S13) to see which of them has the most priority to retain the organisation.



Phase 2A is grounded in the semi-structured interview as a tool for identifying critical knowledge [34,41]. By employing the Cognitive Task Analysis Model [34], it is possible to quantify and qualify critical knowledge to determine whether it is at risk of loss, replacement, misuse, or forgetfulness. This phase focuses on items such as continuous training, conferences, work-related documentation, contacts with peers, and critical incidents occurring in the workplace. Contact with peers is considered a significant risk factor [32,34], while the quality and quantity of critical incidents are also important, as workers must resolve new situations quickly and intuitively [34,35]. This critical knowledge must be retained and transferred to colleagues, in accordance with the established protocol.

- Formula Phase 2A


(Continuing education and No. of conferences/workshops) + (Workplace-related documents) + (Contacts with peers and others) + (No. of Critical Incidents)
The final discriminant score to determine whether a worker passes to the next phase 2B is >12 points [(3) + (3) + (3) + (3) + (3) = 12].

- Formula Phase 2B


In this phase, four types of knowledge (human, technological, relationship and leadership, and operational-rational) are identified through a structured interview together with knowledge mapping. The questions included in this protocol are derived from academic literature and interviews defined in studies on knowledge management within public administrations [29,30,34,36,37,38,48].
As interviews are conducted, the knowledge map is completed, identifying both individual and social knowledge, as outlined in the relevant literature [32,44,49]. The four types of knowledge are organised by their nature [12,39], the functions derived from them, and their location [39,49].
Once the different types of knowledge have been identified, the risk of knowledge loss formula developed by the Acric Institute is applied, as referenced by other authors [10,11]. This formula considers the importance, difficulty, and engagement of workers with the available knowledge [10,11]. Its application allows for the creation of a ranking of critical knowledge [4,10], highlighting priorities among Baby Boomers nearing retirement and workers from other generations (Generation X, Millennials, and Generation Z) [4,10,11]. Risk Formula = [(Importance) + (Difficulty) + (Involvement)]/Staffing available

The critical score for this formula is ≥4 points [(3) + (2) + (3)/(2) = 4].
Once the risk formula has been applied to each individual piece of knowledge, each piece of knowledge that has scored ≥4 points will be considered as a priority risk knowledge, and therefore a critical co-knowledge. Each priority knowledge detected will add 4 to the final formula of Phase 2B in the following section of the final formula (Total knowledge risk formula score). Depending on the number of critical knowledges identified with a score ≥4 points, they will be added to the final formula, which will allow arriving at a risk score (The application of this risk formula is expressed in Tables 5 and 6).

- Final formula (Phase 1A/Phase 1B + Phase 2A + Phase 2B)


[(Expected date of retirement/Continuity Risk) × (Characteristics and Difficulty of Knowledge) × (Job Category × Years of Experience) × (Technological Competencies) × (Sustainability Related Competencies) + (Continuing Education and No. of Conferences/Conferences) + (Workplace-related documents) + (Peer Contact) + (No. of Critical Incidents) + (Total Knowledge Risk Formula Score)]
The final discriminant score by the Baby Boomer generation to determine the risk of loss of each critical knowledge detected is as follows: ≥394 points per priority risk [(378) + (12) + (4) = 394)].
The final discriminant score by the other generations to determine the risk of loss of each critical knowledge detected is as follows: ≥520 points because they are priority risk [(504) + (12) + (4) = 520)].

- - . Phase 3 (Critical knowledge storage phase): This is the last phase in which the two final documents obtained from the execution of all the previous phases are shown: the Worker File and the Critical Knowledge Document. Once the file has been completed, the critical knowledge is mapped for those who present a priority risk. In this phase, the two final documents for storing critical knowledge are obtained: the Worker File (Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3) and the Critical Knowledge Document (Table 4).

Once the protocol was developed and a favourable opinion of the UVic-UCC Ethics Committee (Code CER 335/2024) was obtained, it was piloted on two generations: one worker from the Baby Boomer generation and one worker from the Millennial generation. The Baby Boomer generation is approaching retirement and may contain both expert and tacit knowledge [50], and the Millennial generation at risk of being removed from the workplace by substitution [10].
4. Results The results of the piloting in the two generations reveal that, in the Central Catalonia SSP, the Baby Boomer and Millennial generations have differences and critical knowledge that should not be lost through retirement or replacement. The piloting follows the pattern detailed in Section 3.3.
4.1. Baby Boomer Generation The scores obtained from the different phases of the protocol are shown in Table 5. The two documents: the Worker Worksheet and the Phase 2B Critical Knowledge are presented in Supplementary Material: Tables S14–S16.
Although there are a total of 20 questions derived from the structured interview in Phase 2B (Table S11) that can lead to a total of 20 pieces of knowledge, in the present piloting only half of the knowledge derived from all the questions, i.e., between ten and twelve pieces of knowledge for each employee. Furthermore, this critical knowledge already reflects and is representative of the knowledge at risk that the organisation cannot afford to lose in the process of generational renewal.
From the results, it can be seen that the Baby Boomer generation is critical to the organisation as they possess critical priority knowledge, especially of the implicit or tacit and individual type, which poses a threat of great loss to the organisation when they leave if their knowledge has not been transferred. In phase 1A, the characteristics and difficulty of their knowledge, and the category of the workplace, together with years of experience, in addition to competencies related to sustainability, pose a risk of loss to the organisation.
In contrast, the near-retirement date variable and technological skills did not score high enough to be considered critical (Table 5).
In phase 2A, the worker shows great involvement in different jobs that are scoring variables of phase 2A with a critical score, for her continuous education courses, as well as attendance at congresses and conferences, in addition to having written important documents for the organisation, and experienced CI and, a great deal of contact with her counterparts (Table 5).
In phase 2B, it is found that most of the knowledge is of an operational nature, with six pieces of knowledge of an implicit nature, neither documented nor located (Table S16), and with five of the six pieces of knowledge scored as critical. In the final tally in Table 5 of the 12 pieces of knowledge, 8 are critical.
4.2. Millennial Generation The scores obtained from the different phases of the protocol are shown in Table 6. The two documents: the Worker File and the Critical Knowledge Document obtained in Phase 2B are presented in Supplementary Material: Tables S17–S19).
The Millennial generation worker has critical knowledge that is a priority for the organisation, implicit knowledge that only the worker knows, in addition to their human and relational skills and competencies, which are different from the rest of the workers.
Phase 1B shows that the employee is critical because of the risk of continuity in the organisation, as he/she can move to other workplaces if the opportunity for change arises, and their high levels of ambition, critical knowledge, years of experience within the department, and competencies related to sustainability (Table 6).
In phase 2A, there are not so many critical variables, although the total indicates critical knowledge. He has not attended many conferences or congresses, nor has he produced and developed many internal workplace documents, although he has a critical score for having contacts in the organisation who provide him with information and/or help with problems and CI throughout his professional career (Table 6).
Finally, phase 2B presents 11 pieces of knowledge, with 7 critical pieces of knowledge according to the knowledge risk formula, especially with regard to human knowledge (Table 6 and Table S19). Regarding technological co-knowledge, it is generally identified as critical. Only one operational knowledge has a critical score, and regarding relational knowledge, only two are critical (Table 6 and Table S19).
While this pilot study offers valuable insights into knowledge retention across generational lines, the conclusions should be interpreted with caution. The findings represent the experiences of the two individual workers in the pilot cases and may not fully encapsulate the diversity and variability of knowledge types within entire generational cohorts.
Finally, the results are supported by the gender-balanced pilots. However, further gender-sensitive pilots were conducted in order to support the results of this study.
5. Discussion The results of the study show differences in staff turnover according to the generation to which the workers belong. Moreover, the different generations may have critical knowledge due to retirement or replacement, which implies the need to have a protocol that favours the replacement of staff, saving the loss of critical knowledge of public administrations, according to academic literature [4,10].
Following the protocol and the pilot study carried out, the Baby Boomer generation was the one that presented the most critical knowledge, with implicit and individual knowledge that was difficult to transmit to the rest of the workers [4]. In contrast, for the Millennial generation, although they had considerable critical, implicit knowledge, some of it was social and not individual as in the case of the Baby Boomers. This fact could be explained by the type of tasks and competencies presented by each of the generations.
Continuity in the workplace is critical in Millennials and not in Baby Boomers, according to the academic literature. This literature points out that Millennials leave the workplace because of ambition and career projection or because they want to change jobs [1], and the study showed that Millennial workers wanted to change jobs.
In the case of sustainability-related competencies, Baby Boomers score critically, but Millennials score even more critically, according to literature studies, which point to the Millennial Generation being more environmentally conscious [26]. For Baby Boomers, the fact that they remain in the workplace for many years encourages higher levels of sustainability.
Concerning technological competencies, none of the pilots showed levels of critical technological competencies for management, although the highest scores were for the Millennial generation. These findings are in line with studies published in the academic literature, which indicate that the latter generations show higher skills in the use of new technologies [23]; in addition, the development of technologies in the public sector is still under development, while in the private sector, they have been developed more rapidly and implemented in the workplace [9,51].
The scoring items in phase 2A corresponding to the score for continuing education and/or conference attendance do not show outstanding results, although the Baby Boomers have high scores, especially the top managers.
As for CI and peer contacts, they show similar results between Baby Boomers and Millennials, with critical scores. In this case, the academic literature considers that relational knowledge can pose a risk within the organization when it is lost [32], in line with this study. On the other hand, CI is relevant in both Baby Boomer and Millennial generations, and their critical scores alert to the importance of conducting semi-structured interviews to detect and record these incidents [34].
The results derived from the knowledge mapping, used in other studies [32,44,49], showed that the Baby Boomers stand out in critical operational knowledge and the Millennials in human knowledge. With regard to technological knowledge, the Baby Boomers have less technological knowledge than the Millennials, since, in the case of the Baby Boomers, the low implementation of technology in this sector is due to the low level of implementation of technology in this sector [51], and being a generation close to retirement, they do not apply as much technology in the workplace [22].
On the other hand, the formula of risk of knowledge of the protocol, inspired by Chaisani [52] and Al Suwaidi [4], is useful in the knowledge mapping of Phase 2B and allows discriminating priority risk knowledge from non-priority risk knowledge. Furthermore, according to the literature, tacit and individual knowledge shows higher risk and is critical, as noted in the literature [4].
Finally, the protocol, currently implemented by the Secretariat of Health in Catalonia, has demonstrated its versatility and applicability in a real-world setting, offering structured tools for the identification and retention of knowledge that address the unique needs of a multigenerational workforce in a variety of public entities. Each organization or government department can adjust specific elements of the protocol or introduce new components to best suit their unique operational needs. This flexibility supports the potential transferability of the protocol not only within Catalonia but also to international environments, including V4 countries, where it could serve as a structured approach to retaining critical knowledge across generations cohorts.
Hence, the protocol is a dual tool for detecting and retaining critical knowledge, while storing the knowledge, to plan a replacement or substitution of the workplace, without losing the intangibles that ensure the continuity of the institution. The protocol should continuously improve and adapt the scores over time to be a more versatile tool.
6. Conclusions The generational changeover at the SSP in Catalonia is a challenge and an opportunity to identify and retain the critical knowledge possessed by workers, especially middle managers, who are close to retirement, or in the case of middle managers from other generations who are susceptible to replacement.
As supported by the academic literature, succession and replacement plans must be planned in advance [4] and, in this study, the created tool aims to anticipate succession and replacement in order not to lose the necessary critical knowledge in public administration [5].
The protocol identifies critical knowledge and aims to manage it correctly in the four generations (currently active in the labour market) of public administration (Baby Boomers, X, Y, Z) [1,12]. For this purpose, critical knowledge is collected in a knowledge map supported by the literature [11,13], which allows discrimination at the generational and digital level [10,20,22]. A distinction is made between replacement by retirement [29] and replacement by rotation [10]. (Also) the semi-structured interview follows the Cognitive Job Analysis Model [27,28] and the structured interview identifies the four types of knowledge to be retained [28,49], according to individual and social [13,40,52], according to its nature [50,51] and according to its location [49,50]. In addition, the protocol for determining the risk of critical knowledge loss uses the Acric Institute’s formula, which is supported by the academic literature [10,11].
Different generations have different skill levels and learning outcomes. For workers close to retirement, and workers who want to change jobs, with a risk of substitution such as the Millennial generation, technological and relational skills, along with sustainability are markedly different.
The study shows that different generations have critical and essential knowledge for the continuity of the organization. Specifically, the Baby Boomer worker presented a greater amount of tacit, operational knowledge of individual property, which was not explicit, while the Millennial worker showed a predominance of tacit technological knowledge, which was also not sufficiently explicit. Therefore, both for retirement and for potential replacement, the tool should be used, since it offers a practical and adaptable approach, which can be continuously improved to identify and prioritize the holders of critical knowledge, who keep public administration alive.
The Baby Boomer pilot shows that implicit knowledge derived from experience and operational capacity at the level of leadership and human resource management and its connection to other departments may be at risk. Other implications at the theoretical level are the loss of undocumented knowledge related to real-time problem solving, team coordination, and public policy planning; i.e., there are doubts about the transfer of knowledge between team members. At a practical level, it can reduce the efficiency of operational processes, with reduced emergency response capacity and increased reliance on external partners. At the policy implication level, the loss of tacit human and operational knowledge can undermine regulatory compliance, with more inspections; it can worsen the management and monitoring of public policies and lead to undesirable imbalances.
The Millennial pilot shows that they have human, technological, and relational knowledge that is not documented in the secretariat, is implicit and therefore sensitive to loss, and is information collected in personal documents, which can weaken the capacity of the secretariat, due to high technological and tacit knowledge. At a practical level, managing the loss of implicit technological knowledge, the capacity for conflict resolution, and the lack of access to information on certain portals, such as the Social Security portal, as supported by the pilot, indicates potential problems. At the level of policy implications, the lack of documentation of social security-related processes can complicate internal controls, and the loss of IT knowledge can complicate the management of the secretariat and the organization of essential processes.
The protocol is very necessary to be applied in generations close to retirement, but in the case of later generations (X, Y, Z), they stand out in technological, relational, and sustainability skills, which are necessary today, but have a higher risk of substitution; therefore, the protocol is also necessary for these generations.
The protocol design can be continuously updated and improved to include competencies related to different types of knowledge. On the other hand, knowledge mapping can be one of the most valid tools for identifying, classifying, and storing critical knowledge within the SSP, and using it for talent recruitment and repositioning. Trained HR personnel or area managers must be able to execute all the processes involved in knowledge mapping, along with structured interviews to identify the organization’s knowledge and talent.
Having a protocol in place to enable this process of generational handover, retention, and talent acquisition is key to the survival of organizations. Moreover, it should be applied to different departments and/or areas of work to ensure continuity and improvement of public administrations.
In private sector companies, this problem of generational handover is also managed through family protocols, and in public administrations, it is managed through the protocol that is the subject of this study.
It should be noted that, in the future, organisations will need to have more advanced technological and sustainability competency frameworks, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals and the European Green Pact.
This study covers an important current problem of generational change and replacement in the workplace, which may compromise the future of Public Administrations; therefore, this protocol is a key tool to be used and continuously improved by the economic, social, governance, and legislative changes that are taking place in the Public Administration ecosystem.
The limitations of the study are, first of all, the time period analysed and the number of pilots presented. It is true that the entire piloting could have been carried out over a longer period of time and could have been applied to more SSP workers. In addition, the implementation and use of the protocol could take some time, with prior running-in and constant adaptations. This protocol can be extended to other public administration departments and other institutions to guide the process of knowledge transfer and retention in the generational handover.

Abstract: Aim/Purpose: The study seeks to utilize Augmented Reality (AR) in creating virtual laboratories for engineering education, focusing on enhancing teaching methodologies to facilitate student understanding of intricate and theoretical engineering principles while also assessing engineering students' acceptance of such laboratories. Background: AR, a part of next-generation technology, has enhanced the perception of reality by overlaying virtual elements in the physical environment. The utilization of AR is prevalent across different disciplines, yet its efficacy in facilitating Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is limited. Engineering studies, a part of STEM learning, involves complex and abstract concepts like machine simulation, structural analysis, and design optimization; these things would be easy to grasp with the help of AR. This restriction can be attributed to their innovative characteristics and disparities. Therefore, providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing the acceptance of these technologies by students -- the primary target demographic -- and examining the impact of these factors is essential to maximize the advantages of AR while refining the implementation processes. Methodology: The primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate a tool that enriches the educational experience within engineering laboratories. Utilizing Unity game engine libraries, digital content is meticulously crafted for this tool and subsequently integrated with geo-location functionalities. The tool's user-friendly interface allows both faculty and non-faculty members of the academic institution to establish effortlessly the virtual laboratory. Subsequently, an assessment of the tool is conducted through the application of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model, involving the administration of surveys to university students to gauge their level of adaptability. Contribution: The utilization of interactive augmented learning in laboratory settings enables educational establishments to realize notable savings in time and resources, thereby achieving sustainable educational outcomes. The study is of great importance due to its utilization of student behavioral intentions as the underlying framework for developing an AR tool and illustrating the impact of learner experience on various objectives and the acceptance of AR in Engineering studies. Furthermore, the research results enable educational institutions to implement AR-based virtual laboratories to improve student experiences strategically, align with learner objectives, and ultimately boost the adaptability of AR technologies. Findings: Drawing on practice-based research, the authors showcase work samples and a digital project of AR-based Virtual labs to illustrate the evaluation of the adaptability of AR technology. Adaptability is calculated by conducting a survey of 300 undergraduate university students from different engineering departments and applying an adaptability method to determine the behavioral intentions of students. Recommendations for Practitioners: Engineering institutions could leverage research findings in the implementation of AR to enhance the effectiveness of AR technology in practical education settings. Recommendation for Researchers: The authors implement a pragmatic research framework aimed at integrating AR technology into virtual AR-based labs for engineering education. This study delves into a unique perspective within the realm of engineering studies, considering students' perspectives and discerning their behavioral intentions by drawing upon previous research on technology utilization. The research employs various objectives and learner experiences to assess their influence on students' acceptance of AR technology. Impact on Society: The use of AR in engineering institutions, especially in laboratory practicals, has a significant impact on society, supported by the UTAUT2 model. UTAUT2 model assesses factors like performance, effort expectancy, social influence, and conditions, showing that AR in education is feasible and adaptable. This adaptability helps students and educators incorporate AR tools effectively for better educational results. AR-based labs allow students to interact with complex engineering concepts in immersive settings, enhancing understanding and knowledge retention. This interactive augmented learning for laboratories saves educational institutions significant time and resources, attaining sustainable learning. Future Research: Further research can employ a more comprehensive acceptance model to examine learners' adaptability to AR technology and try comparing different adaptability models to determine which is more effective for engineering students.

Organizational learning support preferences of millennials: An interpretive study

Author: Thompson, Kevin S.11 University of Connecticut, US

Publication info: Thompson, Kevin S. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/organizational-learning-support-preferences/docview/3101971668/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Given that more than $170 Billion is invested annually on employee learning and development in the U.S (American Society for Training and Development, 2011) it is important that training leads to improved job performance. In any organization, workers require new knowledge and skills to become productive and maintain performance over time. Millennials. who comprise the latest employee generation, are age 18-34 (Tyler, 2007) and share the same performance requirements and expectations of the generations that precede them in the workforce. Adult education and human resources development literature indicates that millennials prefer classroom, online, and blended learning experiences (Sandeen, 2008), and respond well to feedback (Gigante, Dell, & Sharkey, 2011) and learning technologies (Gavota, Cattaneo, Arn, Boldrini, Motta, Schneider, & Betrancourt, 2010) when used to support learning. In addition, there are many theoretical articles that propose what organizations should do to support learning for the millennial generation (Kirkland and Sheehan, 2010). b The organizational learning supports to help millennials improve their learning in the workplace remain largely undefined. For the purposes of this research effort, organizational learning supports are the tools and resources provided by an organization to promote knowledge transfer. To efficiently and effectively meet the learning goals set forth for millennials in workplace settings, scholars must research, and learning practitioners must consider the organizational learning supports that millennials prefer for learning. b To address this challenge, I explored the organizational learning support preferences of millennials in the workforce in a for-profit, high-technology corporation. High-technology role complexity requires significant learning for employees which created a fertile research environment. To establish a viable foundation for my research in a corporate environment, 1 identified a conceptual framework that incorporates the learner, learning experiences, and environmental (organizational) factors. One research question guided this study: What are millennials organizational learning support preferences? The study utilized an interpretative qualitative design (Merriam, 2002), that uncovered the experiences millennials had with organizational learning supports to understand which supports they prefer. The sample of ten millennial participants was purposeful and generated from a list of 100 employees participating in a corporation's leadership development program. Data was collected via two semi-structured interviews with eight participants and one semi-structured interview with two participants. Data was analyzed inductively using a constant-comparative method and yielded three themes: (a) millennials appreciate big-picture understanding, new information, and rapid application to help them learn and perform on the job, (b) millennials prefer having the option to learn independently or in small groups to deepen their understanding of new knowledge, and (c) millennials want resources that provide answers to questions that fill knowledge gaps. By gathering participant data regarding millennials' organizational learning support preferences, the body of adult education and human resources development literature can expand and learning practitioners in organizations can propose and offer learning supports that align with millennials preferences to improve learning for this latest generation of workplace employees.

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive domains, such as telecommunications, rely heavily on domain-specific terminology, which might create barriers to effective communication and knowledge transfer. This thesis investigates the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Word2Vec models, to enhance knowledge retrieval and understanding of domain-specific terminology within the context of Ericsson's Cloud Radio Access Network (RAN) technology. The RAG approach modifies a general-purpose Large Language Model (LLM) to answer domain-specific questions by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base. The best-performing RAG-based chatbot was the one that retrieved a single document, achieving a score of 207 out of a maximum of 300. Additionally, the RAG-based chatbot outperformed the general-purpose ChatGPT 3.5 model, which scored 144. Moreover, a Word2Vec model was trained on internal documentation to generate similar terms related to Cloud RAN terminology. The Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) architecture with an embedding size of 300, a window size of 5, and a cosine threshold of 0.9 achieved the best performance, with a precision of 0.71 and a recall of 0.70 in generating relevant similar terms. The thesis also presents an integrated solution combining the RAG-based chatbot and the Word2Vec model with an user interface. The RAG module generates accurate responses based on user queries and retrieved-context, while the Word2Vec module suggests related technical topics, facilitating further exploration and understanding.

Self-Adaptive Evolutionary Multitasking Algorithm for Mobile Edge Computing in Internet of Things

Abstract: With the advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, IoT smart devices (ISDs) are often frequently constrained by their battery capability and computing ability. In mobile edge computing (MEC) scenarios, ISDs increases computing capability while reducing energy consumption by offloading computation-intensive and latency-critical processes to edge servers. But the process of computing offloading (CO) leads to extra transmission time, which is unacceptable for IoT applications. Most current studies regard the CO as a multiobjective optimization (MOO) problem involving application completion time and energy consumption. However, with the increasing number of ISDs and the complexity of ISDs-based applications, it becomes extremely challenging to acquire the best solution through MOO. Evolutionary multitasking optimization (EMTO), as a novel search paradigm in evolutionary computation, utilizes intertask correlation and facilitates the solution of multiple tasks simultaneously. Therefore, we model the CO of ISDs as a multitasking multiobjective CO problem (MMCOP) by constructing an auxiliary task similar to the target task for the first time. In addition, we put forward a multitasking MOO algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RLMTO-CO) to solve MMCOP. Each task has a knowledge transfer probability value adaptively adjusted by reinforcement learning (RL), and the generation of auxiliary tasks is updated adaptively. The performance of RLMTO-CO has been validated in different test cases close to true IoT environments, and the experimental results show the superior competitiveness.

Abstract: This research's purpose is to identify and measure the variables that have an effect towards the actual system usage in the workplace. A questionnaire-based survey was distributed through Microsoft Forms, and it retrieved 177 samples from working people whose daily tasks involved using information systems in their workplace. The participants' answers were used to analyze the effect technological attributes have on the perceived usefulness and how psychological aspects have an effect on the perceived ease of use; also, how both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use positively affect the immersion of the employee. Additionally, the study analyzes the effect of immersion on actual system use. A multivariate analysis was utilized to acquire the measurement. A descriptive analysis was also used to identify the generational cohort, gender, and years of experience of the participants. The results indicate that when the employees immerse themselves in the information systems in the workplace, it has a positive effect that will cause them to use the actual systems. Such immersion is possible through various means, including knowledge transfer between employees and immersive learning by training the employees with the information systems inside the workplace.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/comprehensive-heritage-bim-methodology-digital/docview/3090933371/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Preserving historical architectural structures is crucial for safeguarding cultural heritage. This study explores the application of Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM) to enhance the documentation process of the Ghiqa Historical Market in Saudi Arabia, a monument known for its intricate architecture and cultural significance. Traditional documentation methods often fail to capture detailed features accurately and rely on labour-intensive manual processes. HBIM uses advanced digital technologies to improve precision, efficiency, and preservation efforts. In this study, point cloud data from 3D laser scanning is used to create a detailed digital model of the market, covering structural systems, material attributes, architectural features, and historical context. The research also integrates historical archives and photographs to enrich the model with additional contextual information. This comprehensive approach provides a holistic understanding of the Ghiqa Historical Market, aiding accurate preservation and restoration decisions. HBIM offers several advantages in architectural documentation. The digital model enhances visualization, allowing stakeholders to explore the site from multiple perspectives. It also serves as a tool for analysing structural integrity, identifying potential risks, and planning restoration interventions. Moreover, digital documentation ensures effective knowledge transfer across generations, preserving valuable architectural heritage for future reference and research. Additionally, it promotes interdisciplinary collaboration among architects, historians, conservators, and other stakeholders involved in preservation. Including the Ghiqa Historical Market in the UNESCO World Heritage List would highlight its global significance, attracting international attention and resources for its preservation. This designation would underscore the market’s cultural and historical importance, fostering a sense of pride and responsibility in its maintenance. The implementation of Heritage BIM demonstrates its potential to revolutionize heritage conservation by combining diverse data sources into a single, detailed, and accessible digital resource.

Full text: 1. Introduction
Cultural heritage has enormous and immeasurable importance for communities. Unfortunately, this fact is sometimes not realized until there is a risk of damage or destruction. Several factors, including weather and community awareness, can contribute to these potential dangers. As a result, various studies have been conducted to provide methods that can assist in preserving historical sites [1]. Documenting historical architecture requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes traditional disciplines like architecture, survey methods, art history, and history, as well as digital microelectronics, computer science, and information science. Therefore, to avoid losing focus, it is important to prioritize preserving and reworking monuments in digital media over physical preservation efforts [2]. Architectural documentation is an essential technique for heritage site protection and interpretation. While written reports, sketching, and photos are all useful forms of traditional documentation, they are not always effective in illustrating the finer points and complexities of historical buildings. Moreover, they fall short of utilizing the full potential of cutting-edge technologies to produce thorough and engaging representations [3].
In recent years, the field of architectural documentation has witnessed significant advancements via the integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) technologies. The concept of BIM has revolutionized the way architectural information is generated, stored, and analysed, allowing for more efficient design processes and better project outcomes. Nowadays, virtual 3D models are commonly utilized to document historical places. These models are efficient for reconstruction and restoration, and they provide rich information resources to researchers from numerous fields [4].
BIM is a comprehensive process for the design, representation, construction, and the long-term management of the built environment. BIM packages allow project partners to collaborate on design and facilities management by combining multidimensional visualization with complete, parametric databases [5]. When it comes to integrating different data input, such as laser scanning, photogrammetry, archival research, and expert knowledge, BIM has gained significant traction over the past few years. Commentators, software program vendors, and some professionals have adopted it as the new design and management process for different industries, i.e., the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Moreover, BIM marks a profound revolution in the management of architectural information from initial design to the end of a building’s lifecycle [6].
Using Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM) in cultural heritage management and conservation projects holds tremendous promise for efficiency due to its numerous benefits. To begin with, the concept of interoperability offers an interactive and immersive digital platform that enables the involvement of different experts and facilitates data sharing, thanks to the functionality characteristic of HBIM software programs, for example, Autodesk Revit and Navisworks. While usability refers to how user-friendly and easy to use the software is, interoperability is about the software’s ability to work with other systems and share information effectively. This not only helps improve comprehension but also allows for informed decision-making during restoration and conservation. In addition, HBIM preserves the architectural legacy in digital form, making it a dependable archive tool. This guarantees that even in the event of physical damage or destruction, future generations will be able to access and study the intricate details of historical sites, in our case the Ghiqa historical market. Furthermore, HBIM facilitates the tracking of treatments and the organization of restoration phases, creating a distinct and searchable archive [7].
The purpose of this scientific paper is to investigate the utilization of HBIM as a powerful process for enhancing the architectural documentation process of heritage buildings, with application to the renowned Ghiqa Historical Market in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, it aims to investigate the utilization of Geographic Information System (GIS) as an effective technique to analyse the data of the heritage site. The Ghiqa Historical Market is extremely important culturally and historically, acting as a tribute to the region’s rich history. However, like many historical constructions, it faces various obstacles in terms of preservation, restoration, and correct recording. By adopting HBIM techniques, we can overcome these challenges and generate a comprehensive and accurate digital representation of the Ghiqa Historical Market.
In this scientific study, we will examine the procedure used to create the Ghiqa Historical Market’s HBIM model, emphasizing the methods for acquiring data, strategies for integrating data, and difficulties encountered. Also, this study will examine the future directions and possible uses of HBIM in the context of Saudi Arabia’s historical site preservation and architectural documentation. By using technology and embracing HBIM, we can not only overcome the constraints of traditional documentation methods, but also pave the way for a more sustainable and informed approach to the preservation of our heritage. To establish a stronger link between the past and the future, the Ghiqa Historical Market case study will serve as evidence of the enormous significance that HBIM holds in the documenting and understanding of historical structures.
1.1. Ghiqa Historical Market—Saudi Heritage
Saudi Arabia has a rich cultural legacy, including several historical landmarks that highlight the country’s vibrant past. Among these treasures is the famous Ghaiqa Market, which is located east of Badr Governorate in the Medina region. Dr. Ahmed Al-Numani indicated that the “Ghiqa” site was well-known among historians as a commercial station with a thriving market until 1360 AH, when convoy transportation was cut off due to the appearance of cars [8]. Figure 1 shows an example of Ghaiqa Market’s buildings. The historic Ghaiqa Market holds a significant place in the collective memory of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is the location of the most well-known wells, the Ibn Hasani wells, which are regarded as one of the most famous caravan stations used by pilgrims while traveling between Mecca and Medina. Due to its significance at the time, the road via Ghiqa was known as the Royal Road. Convoys of pilgrims traveling from Mecca to Medina took one of four routes depending on the dependency of the pilgrim; Al-Sultani is the most water-filled and well-travelled path during the migration [9]. Ghiqa was well-known for its enormous commercial market, which contained many stone-built stores with palm leaf roofs, most of which are still intact today. The market sold a wide range of items, attracting a considerable number of people from nearby villages and towns, as well as those traveling through the area [10]. Like many historical sites, the Ghiqa Historical Market must deal with several obstacles that might threaten its long-term existence and preservation. Urbanization, deterioration, and insufficient documentation are some of the factors that seriously threaten its architectural integrity. Thus, it is essential to use advanced architectural documentation strategies that exceed traditional approaches in order to preserve and document the irreplaceable past placed within this historical treasure [11].
1.2. Heritage Sites Challenges in Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia is home to numerous cultural heritage sites that reflect the country’s rich history and different cultural traditions. These sites, which range from ancient archaeological ruins to historical cities and traditional villages, provide physical links to the past while also providing insights into the region’s cultural, architectural, and socioeconomic evolution. However, the documentation of these unique heritage assets poses a multiplicity of issues that must be solved to ensure their preservation and promotion [12]. Documenting heritage places is critical for understanding, conserving, and passing on their significance to future generations. It entails documenting and preserving the physical characteristics, historical context, and cultural values linked with these sites [3]. In Saudi Arabia, balancing urban expansion with the protection of cultural heritage involves numerous trade-offs. The cultural heritage value of a site may be reassessed in light of significant economic pressures as well as changing preservation priorities. The tension between development and heritage preservation poses long-term challenges for Saudi heritage sites and preservation efforts. While a sustainable development method for World Heritage Sites (WHS) is crucial, several factors in Saudi Arabia complicate effective documentation [13]. Saudi Arabia’s rich and varied cultural legacy is one of the main obstacles. The country is made up of an extensive region with several different parts, each having its own special historical landmarks. From the rock art of Jubbah and the Nabatean city of Madain Saleh to the mud-brick architecture of Diriyah and the old town of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia has a rich tapestry of cultural history that necessitates extensive documenting efforts [12]. Furthermore, many heritage sites are located in remote and often inaccessible areas, which complicates documentation. Some sites are in deserts, mountains, or coastal areas, which presents logistical problems for data collecting and analysis. Accessibility problems, limited infrastructure, and harsh environmental conditions can all limit on-site documentation and data collection [14]. Moreover, maintaining the intangible legacy linked with these locations presents its own set of issues. Traditional crafts, performing arts, oral traditions, and social customs are all integral parts of Saudi Arabia’s cultural legacy. Documenting and protecting these intangible features necessitate new methods that extend beyond the documenting of physical structures. Another difficulty is the protection and conservation of heritage sites. Many sites suffer from neglect, urban expansion, natural decay, or a lack of adequate preservation. The lack of detailed documentation reduces conservation planning and restoration efforts, as inaccurate records and data can lead to poor decision-making. Due to the substantial trade-off between conserving heritage sites, accommodating population growth, and the economic drive for urban expansion, the value of heritage sites may be reevaluated amidst the increasing pressures of urbanization, considering the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s economic and cultural preservation aims [15]. Furthermore, the documentation of heritage sites in Saudi Arabia necessitates collaboration and coordination among numerous stakeholders, including government agencies, researchers, local populations, and foreign organizations. Effective communication, knowledge exchange, and the construction of comprehensive databases are critical for achieving a cohesive strategy for documentation and preservation [16].
1.3. The Aim
In this scientific study, we investigate how advanced processes, for example, BIM, terrestrial laser scanning, and photogrammetry can help with the Ghiqa Historical Market’s architectural documentation process. These cutting-edge procedures allow for the production of precise, detailed, and interactive 3D digital models that represent not only the physical characteristics of the market but also its historical and cultural significance. Also, the study emphasizes the significance of architectural documentation in maintaining and promoting Saudi Arabian history by utilizing this advanced method on the Ghiqa Historical Market. Moreover, integrating cutting-edge technology with collaborative efforts would highlight Saudi Arabia’s architectural treasures, such as the Ghiqa Historical Market, which would be valued and honoured for many years to come.
Researchers, architects, and conservationists would use BIM and other new technology to more precisely and efficiently document, analyse, and restore the Ghiqa Historical Market. Digital models would be used in order to present informed decisions about conservation and renovation activities. Furthermore, the virtual representation would serve as an immersive platform for researchers and the general public to study and interact with the market’s architectural and cultural heritage, cultivating a greater understanding of Saudi Arabia’s rich history. Furthermore, the application of architectural recording techniques aids in the preservation of Saudi heritage beyond its physical form. Digital models and databases would be essential archive resources, ensuring that knowledge and understanding of the Ghiqa Historical Market are preserved and shared with future generations. These digital archives provide a strong means of protecting the market’s past, even in the face of potential challenges like natural disasters or urban growth.
In the following sections, the study will explore the methods used to record the Ghiqa Historical Market, going over the methods for gathering data, the difficulties encountered, and the potential uses for the digital models. By adopting architectural documentation, citizens and visitors can respect Saudi Arabia’s rich cultural tradition and advance a deeper comprehension of our shared past.
1.4. The Research Contribution
This paper significantly advances architectural documentation and heritage preservation by employing Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM) to document the Ghiqa Historical Market in Saudi Arabia. The study’s originality lies in its comprehensive methodology, integrating traditional architectural documentation procedures with state-of-the-art digital technologies, for instance, 3D terrestrial laser scanning and photogrammetry. HBIM enhances the accuracy and efficiency of documenting the market while integrating contextual data from historical photos and archives into the digital model.
A notable aspect of this research is its emphasis on utilizing HBIM for precise conservation and interpretation of architectural heritage. By employing advanced digital tools, the study facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration among stakeholders and supports informed decision-making in preservation and restoration projects. Additionally, integrating Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis with the HBIM model provides valuable insights into spatial relationships and structural integrity, further enhancing the understanding and management of the site.
Moreover, the research highlights the importance of leveraging technological advancements to protect Saudi Arabia’s cultural legacy. Focusing on culturally significant landmarks like the Ghiqa Historical Market, the study aims to contribute to the UNESCO World Heritage List nomination process by ensuring meticulous documentation and preservation of these invaluable cultural assets.
2. Literature Review
2.1. 3D Reality Capture Technique in Heritage
The heritage building can be digitally represented using 3D reality capture techniques, which collect detailed 3D data on the structure. Among these methods are laser scanning and photogrammetry. Laser scanning accurately captures the 3D data of a building’s surface geometry, such as walls, roof, windows, and other features, by emitting a laser beam that reflects off these surfaces. The scanner’s sensor detects the reflection and measures the distance between the scanner and each point on the building’s surface [17]. Photogrammetry processes photographs of the site or object taken from several perspectives to generate a 3D model of the object surfaces, using either a ground-based camera or a drone-mounted camera [18]. Moreover, Structure from Motion (SfM) generates a 3D model by combining multiple photos taken from different angles [19].
Furthermore, it is essential to distinguish between photogrammetry and Structure from Motion (SfM). Photogrammetry involves the acquisition of multiple photographs from different angles to generate accurate 2D or 3D representations of objects or spaces. This method relies on precise measurements and the geometric configuration of the camera setup to triangulate points in space. In contrast, SfM is a more flexible and automated technique that generates 3D models from unordered image sets by identifying common features in overlapping photographs and estimating the camera positions and orientations [20].
The utilization of these methods offers complementary advantages. Photogrammetry provides high precision and is particularly effective for capturing detailed textures, making it ideal for applications requiring high-fidelity visual representations. SfM, while slightly less precise, is highly efficient in generating 3D models from large image sets, making it suitable for extensive and complex environments [20]. The integration of both methods can enhance our capability to accurately document and analyse architectural and archaeological sites, offering a comprehensive approach to digital reconstruction and preservation [21].
Once the data is collected, it can produce detailed engineering information, for example, drawings, maps, and other visual aids illustrating the building’s geometry, measurements, and surface properties. Potential issues could be identified through the collected data, for instance, deformations, cracks, or damage, that may not be visible during visual inspection. Additionally, 3D reality capture can simulate various scenarios for decision-making and generate a digital twin of the heritage site for continuous monitoring and analysis [17].
Heritage site preservation and documentation is an essential endeavour that helps us to preserve our cultural heritage for coming generations. Photographs, drawings, and written descriptions—conventional documentation methods—have proven useful in preserving the physical characteristics of heritage monuments. Nevertheless, these techniques frequently fail to capture the rich intricacies and immersive experience of these locations. This is where the use of 3D reality capturing technology has changed the experience for heritage documentation [7].
One of the primary advantages of 3D reality capture is the capacity to generate detailed digital reconstructions of historical sites. Using techniques like photogrammetry and 3D laser scanning, high-resolution images and point cloud data are captured to create accurate 3D models. These models can serve various purposes depending on the project’s scope, including immersive digital reconstructions that allow users to virtually explore and interact with heritage sites as if physically present [22]. However, immersive reality is just one of the many outcomes of 3D reality capture. The comprehensive 3D models also provide a precise and thorough record of heritage sites, which is crucial for preservation and restoration efforts. By analysing these models, architects and conservationists can assess the current condition of a site, identify areas of deterioration, and plan necessary conservation actions. This detailed data enhances the effectiveness of restoration projects and supports well-informed decision-making [23]. Furthermore, 3D reality capture plays a significant role in digital documentation. These digital models serve as repositories of knowledge accessible to scientific researchers, historians, and the public. Digital archiving ensures the long-term conservation of the heritage sites by reducing the risk of physical damage, deterioration, or loss over time [24]. It also enables remote access, expanding research and educational opportunities to a broader audience [22]. The 3D reality capture methods transform our ability to document, preserve, and share cultural heritage. This technology offers unprecedented opportunities for accurate documentation, immersive exploration, and informed conservation planning, thus revolutionizing the preservation of our cultural legacy [23].
2.2. Arial and Close-Range Photogrammetry
Building documentation techniques have shifted from 2D to 3D due to the enormous development of digital technologies in this field. The effectiveness of photogrammetry in terms of time, cost, accuracy, and utility has led to a rise in the use of 3D digital modelling. Close-range photogrammetry is becoming more and more important in today’s world of historical building data collection [25]. Point clouds which are produced by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and close-range photogrammetry (CRP) serve as the foundational stage of data capturing; each of these points has “x, y, and z coordinates” based on the scanned surface. Scan to BIM refers to the process of capturing precise spatial data through laser scanning to create detailed point clouds, which are then converted into BIM. This workflow allows for the analysis and integration of the captured data into comprehensive 3D models, facilitating various stages of design, construction, and development [26]. Recent advancements in sensor technologies have sparked renewed interest in close-range photogrammetry as a method for gathering reality-based 3D information. Furthermore, close-range photogrammetry is now a feasible, low-cost technology for 3D mapping thanks to the significant democratization of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), also known as drones [27].
2.3. Terrestrial Laser Scanning “TLS”
The 3D Terrestrial laser scanning is an automated measurement approach. This approach is used to determine the 3D coordinates of an object’s surface. This approach involves emitting laser beams toward the surface, which then reflect back to the scanner. The resulting data is provided in point cloud format, with each point assigned x, y, and z coordinates from the scanned surface, creating a highly detailed 3D representation [17]. Moreover, several laser scanning technologies are available in the technical industry, primarily utilizing three types of scanner technologies: Time-of-Flight scanners, triangulation, and phase comparison. Time-of-flight scanners gauge distances by measuring the time taken for a laser pulse to travel to the object and return, making them ideal for long-range measurements [18]. Triangulation scanners project a laser beam onto the object and use a camera to capture the reflection, calculating distances based on the angle of return, which is ideal for high-precision, short-range scanning. Phase comparison scanners measure the phase shift between the emitted and reflected laser beam, offering high accuracy over medium distances [28]. These technologies are particularly suitable for metric heritage studies, enabling the capture of detailed geometrical data of heritage structures. This data can be used for various applications, including creating accurate digital models for preservation, restoration planning, and virtual reconstruction [29]. Moreover, the detailed point clouds can help identify structural issues, for instance, cracks as well as deformations, that may not be visible during a visual inspection, and facilitate ongoing monitoring and analysis [30]. Furthermore, the difference between these scanning technologies depends on how the scanner calculates 3D coordinate measurements. In triangulation-based scanning, laser beams are directed onto the surface of an object and captured by one or more cameras [31]. According to [32], “time of flight scanners calculate the range, or distance, from the time taken for a laser pulse to travel from its source to an object and be reflected back to a receiving detector”.
2.4. Terrestrial Laser Scanning Data Processing
The point cloud data is a type of output data that is obtained through 3D laser scanning and represents a range of 3D coordinates. A specialized program is required to handle the massive volume of data pertaining to point cloud data (Figure 2) for example, Leica Cyclone 360 v.2023. Furthermore, while it often only takes a few minutes to capture several millions of precise 3D points, it takes a great deal of labour to convert the laser scanning data into a 3D model that contains useful information [33]. Many software programs on the engineering market can handle point cloud data, such as Polyworks, Leica Cloud-Works, RiScanpro, and Autodesk ReCap. These programs have significantly enhanced the handling, modification, and analysis of vector and image information derived from point clouds. They integrate methods for triangulation and point cloud surfacing [34].
Once the scanner point cloud data has been transmitted, several software programs are available to troubleshoot and remove noise or distortions. These programs are essential for ensuring the accuracy and quality of the 3D model, offering functions such as filtering algorithms to eliminate random noise, techniques to correct systematic errors, and features for aligning and merging multiple scans. Advanced software can also classify and segment point clouds, distinguishing between different materials and surfaces, which is particularly useful in complex environments. By refining the raw data, these programs enhance the precision of measurements and the overall reliability of the digital representation. These laser scanner systems also come with individual software packages. For example, Leica Cyclone ® is the primary software for the laser scanning system produced by the Leica company. The goal of Leica Cyclone 360 ® is to take point cloud data and create an object with the best possible shape. Additionally, users can choose from several object-specific utilities within Leica Cyclone ® based on the topology of the scanned point cloud [35]. Moreover, different software applications are used in place of polygonal 3D models, such as editable feature-based CAD models or NURBS surface models [36].
2.5. Combining Laser Scanning and Digital Images
Most modern laser scanning systems include a built-in camera for capturing image data. Additionally, stacks of multiple photos can be used to colorize 3D point clouds. This involves mapping RGB colour data from images to range data, considering point translation, instrument rotation, and perspective projection [37]. Achieving accurate colour mapping requires precise geometric calibration of both the laser and the camera, including adjustments for camera lens distortion. Aligning and correcting viewpoints captured in images is essential when mapping to a point cloud. Furthermore, with knowledge of the camera’s position and orientation within the geometric model’s coordinate system, a High Dynamic Range (HDR) colour image can be precisely applied to the geometric model represented by the point cloud [28].
2.6. Building Information Modelling (BIM) in Cultural Heritage
Information and communication technology (ICT) was integrated into building industry operations, leading to the creation of BIM. Ever since, the construction industry has recognized it as an engine behind innovation and increased production. It was also created to address issues with cooperation, handling large amounts of information, reducing project duration and expense, and enhancing construction efficiency [38]. The fields of architectural survey, building, conservation, and restoration have benefited greatly from advanced techniques such as BIM in several ways. It is now possible to document the current state of building construction with effective, quick, non-invasive, and most importantly, highly precise techniques. This allows for further thorough research, more precise treatments, and an accurate record of the building in its original condition [39]. HBIM is the process of employing BIM techniques and knowledge to generate a 3D digital model of a heritage building or structure. Data on the architecture, structure, materials, and history of the heritage building, as well as information on its present state and maintenance requirements, can all be included in this representation [35].
Creating an HBIM through scan-to-BIM processes enables seamless integration of buildings into workflows for heritage studies [29]. This approach not only facilitates the preservation and documentation of historical structures but also harnesses the full spectrum of benefits that BIM offers, including enhanced collaboration, accurate visualization, and efficient management throughout the building’s lifecycle [39]. In addition, HBIM is a 3D interactive engineering model that represents an interactive solution. Typically, architectural photogrammetry, as well as terrestrial laser scanning data (TLS) are the foundations of this 3D HBIM (Figure 3) and can be described as level of details (LoD 0) [33]. Furthermore, sections, 3D models, orthographic views, and comprehensive technical drawings are all automatically provided by HBIM. HBIM may assist the heritage preservation and conservation fields in a number of ways, including enhancing knowledge of heritage buildings and their context, understanding heritage building materials and having a solid understanding of construction and structural procedures as well as building pathologies [17]. Furthermore, HBIM facilitates comprehensive assessment of proposed restorations and adjustments before final decisions are appointed. This capability supports the maintenance of heritage buildings by aiding in budgeting for repairs and maintenance. Additionally, it enhances public engagement by enabling remote viewing of models through a free viewer application, thereby offering broader accessibility and interaction with historical building information [29]. Also, by presenting the cultural heritage knowledge of heritage buildings, the chance to obtain data about the object’s building processes and material makeup is also provided. During the HBIM process, the prototypes of parametric libraries are modelled onto the point cloud data and the photogrammetry within the implementation of several software platform management strategies [17].
Several notable projects exemplify the application of HBIM in cultural heritage conservation. For instance, the HBIM pipeline developed for the conservation of the city walls of Pisa demonstrates how large-scale architectural heritage can be documented and preserved with precision. This project utilized advanced laser scanning and photogrammetry techniques to create detailed 3D models of the city walls, which allowed for an accurate assessment of their current condition and the identification of areas requiring restoration. The comprehensive digital documentation enabled conservationists to plan and execute preservation efforts with greater accuracy and efficiency [40].
The “CHARMING PISTOIA” research project integrates HBIM for the preservation and maintenance of heritage structures, showcasing an effective methodology for managing historical buildings. This project involved the creation of an HBIM model for the city of Pistoia, which included detailed information on the architectural and historical significance of the buildings. The integration of HBIM in this project facilitated the development of a structured approach to maintenance and conservation, ensuring that interventions were based on precise data and historical context. The project also highlighted the potential of HBIM to serve as a collaborative platform, bringing together different stakeholders, such as architects, conservators, and local authorities, to work on heritage preservation [41].
Additionally, the collaborative workflow in an HBIM project for the restoration and conservation of cultural heritage highlights the importance of interdisciplinary cooperation and the potential for HBIM to facilitate complex heritage conservation efforts. This approach emphasizes the role of HBIM in fostering communication and collaboration among various experts, including historians, engineers, and conservationists. The project demonstrated how HBIM can be used to integrate diverse types of data, such as historical records, structural analyses, and material studies, into a single coherent model. This integration enables a more comprehensive understanding of heritage buildings and supports informed decision-making in conservation practices. The collaborative nature of HBIM projects also ensures that all relevant perspectives are considered, leading to more holistic and sustainable conservation outcomes [42].
3. Scan to Heritage BIM (The Method)
The use of 3D reality capture methods in legacy documentation will be examined in this scientific study, with an emphasis on the advantages and potential advancements in this field. Ghiqa Market will be used as a case study where these methods have been effectively used to record and preserve historical sites, emphasizing how they affect conservation efforts and public involvement. The method used in this study (as shown in Figure 4) to provide a 3D model and digital database utilized by HBIM into the case study of Ghiqa market has three main steps: data collection, data processing, and 3D HBIM. In this study, the data collection is separated into first the physical and visual site visit, which also includes the preparation for data collection as well as the site analysis. Secondly is the data collected for the site by 3D reality capture, which uses different 3D scanning techniques: TLS and aerial photogrammetry. Furthermore, Cyclone 360, Pix4DCloud, and Agisoft metashape v.2023 are employed in photogrammetry to process data and generate 3D models from captured photographs. These software solutions integrate historical data, including images, sketches, and written documents, into the models to enhance their informational value. This approach transforms HBIM into a preservation and interpretation process for heritage assets. It goes beyond creating digital representations by contextualizing architectural features within their historical and cultural significance, ensuring their legacy for future generations.
3.1. Site Investigation
The Ghigh market is located on the Sultani road between Makkah Al Mukarramah and Medina, 4 kilometres from the village of Badr, about 30 meters from Medina (Figure 5). Through site survey and analysis, the area of the market was estimated 35,100 m 2 (270 m × 130 m). Ghigh Village, like many other historical sites in Saudi Arabia, requires documentation in order to be preserved. There is no digital documentation to help conserve historic buildings, no credible reference data for the restoration process, and no digital data to allow remote viewing of the village. Moreover, 51 of Ghigh village buildings are in fair condition, 36 buildings are in bad condition, while 17 are in good condition (Figure 6). This was based on the initial assessment, which included a number of criteria. These criteria include visual inspections and basic assessments of structural integrity, material condition, and environmental impacts.
The height of the store buildings is 2.80 m, 3 m for the mosque, while the palace is the highest with 4.5 m (Figure 7). The palace has the biggest space area of the other buildings, while the stores have the smallest (Figure 8).
The architectural observations of the market show the different materials that are used in Ghigh village buildings such as rocks, wood, clay, and palm branches (Figure 9). A store in the market is divided into two parts: a section for displaying goods and the back for storing. Also, there are 3 drainage holes in the side of the mosque courtyard that can be seen. Moreover, the size ratio of the windows and doors of the palace compared to its walls is notable (Figure 10).
3.2. Aerial and Close-Range Photogrammetry
The image survey of the historic Ghaiqa Market, aimed at capturing its unique architectural features, spanned two weeks: one for capturing images using a Canon EOS 60D camera and another using drones. The Canon EOS 60D utilized a CMOS sensor with a sensor size of 22.3 × 14.9 mm (APS-C format), capturing images at a resolution of 5184 × 3456 pixels. The maximum resolution is 5184 × 3456 pixels (4.3 μm pixel size) and (18.1 effective megapixels). In addition, the film speed is 100–6400 (expandable to H: 12,800). Figure 11 shows the use of close-range photogrammetry in Ghiqa Market.
For aerial photogrammetry, the DJI PHANTOM 4 was used (Figure 12), with entry-level professional drone and powerful obstacle avoidance. The weight with the battery and propellers included is 1388 g. The maximum flight time is approximately 30 minutes with forward, backward, and downward Vision Systems. The camera sensor is 1″ CMOS with 20 M″ effective pixels and a maximum video recording resolution of 4K 60P. Some of the drone photos before integrating them with the laser scanning data are seen in Figure 13 and Figure 14.
3.3. 3D Laser Scanning Phase
Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was implemented in order to scan the facades of Ghiqa’s market from the exterior to the interior (Figure 15 shows the use of Leica RTC 360 laser scanner). This process spanned approximately 7 working days and resulted in a comprehensive 3D point cloud representation of the entire building. Subsequent processing of the 3D point cloud data required approximately 3 weeks. The operation commenced with the precise positioning of scan stations using a Leica total station, employing a back-sight approach to establish coordinates for these locations. This method generated precise points both inside and outside Ghiqa’s market, thereby creating a detailed coordinate map for each scanned position. After site visit analysis, there were 55 stations selected (Figure 16) depending on the coverage of all the areas; there should be overlapping between them. The selection of stations depended on visibility of the site and overlapping. The data collection utilized the Leica RTC360 equipped with a Visual Inertial System (VIS) for laser scanning. Laser scanning, a widely adopted method in land surveying, excels in accurate measurement and data collection from various objects, surfaces, buildings, and landscapes. It captures data in the form of point clouds, comprising millions of 3D coordinates (x, y, and z) (see Figure 17 and Figure 18). The Leica RTC360 represents a cutting-edge 3D reality capture solution that allows users to document and capture their built environments in 3D. Its capabilities enhance efficiency and productivity both in the fieldwork and in the office work, offering fast, user-friendly, accurate, and portable hardware and software solutions. VIS is a sensor fusion technology that combines data from both visual and inertial sensors to estimate the position, orientation, and motion. The initial step involves integrating the registered point cloud data into Leica Cyclone (for TLS applications) and employing heuristic methods to segment the point cloud into distinct building components, facilitating detailed sector analysis. Subsequently, the TLS point sets are imported into Recap for data cleaning and refinement. Additionally, in this project, measurements are derived from aerial images captured by drones, which are processed to transform 2D images into precise 3D models. This process involves depth perception through the amalgamation, correction, and presentation of imagery, enabling users to visualize and measure objects in three dimensions with accuracy (Figure 19).
3.4. The Integration of the Laser Scanning and Photogrammetry Point Cloud Data
The project concluded with the integration of laser scanner and drone data using different software to export the data in a suitable format to be integrated into one complete 3D point cloud model. This involved aligning photos, normal detail, and texturing the model. The laser data of the stores and the palace were linked with the drone data, resulting in the final output. Additionally, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was created to provide a detailed representation of the terrain and topography surrounding the Ghiqa Historical Market. This comprehensive approach ensured that both the architectural and geographical aspects of the site were accurately documented, contributing to a holistic understanding of the heritage site (Figure 20 and Figure 21).
3.5. The Heritage BIM of Ghiqa Historical Market
The method used in the implementation of Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM) for the recording and conservation of the Ghiqa Historical Market involves several methodological procedures. First, a thorough evaluation of the market’s cultural significance is conducted to identify heritage value. Subsequently, advanced data collection approaches, for instance, photogrammetry and 3D laser scanning, are utilized to thoroughly record the market’s historical background and architectural features. HBIM software processes and integrates this data to produce a comprehensive digital model of the market that includes contextual information, historical archives, and point cloud data [29]. The resultant HBIM is a comprehensive tool for structural evaluations, spatial analysis, and well-informed decision-making about conservation and restoration initiatives. The approach encourages stakeholder engagement and interdisciplinary collaboration to enable community participation in heritage conservation. By using this method, the Ghiqa Historical Market is recognized as a representation of Saudi Arabia’s rich cultural legacy and is digitally conserved. Before modelling the structure with BIM software, it’s important to undertake point cloud techniques including noise reduction, removing erroneous points, and removing unnecessary scene pieces. TLS results were then integrated into the BIM stage. In this stage, Autodesk Revit version 2024 and the HBIM method were used. Additionally, the 3D orthographic images were inserted in their correct location for façade elevations, plans, sections, and ground points (Figure 22). Furthermore, the primary phase involved the building’s walls based on the plan data. Illustrations were provided for all building elements, including doors and windows. Prior to modelling the data into the survey, TLS data were used to measure library parameters and apply them to specific areas of the library. The eBIM plugin adds this feature to complete the building model and then compare between laser scanner and Revit (Figure 23 and Figure 24).
Moreover, to integrate historical data information (text) into the BIM model in Revit, the following methodology is employed. Initially, historical data, including archival documents, descriptive narratives, and other textual information, are digitized and systematically organized. This digitized information is then imported into the Revit environment as text annotations linked to specific architectural elements such as walls, windows, and doors. Revit’s text annotation tools facilitate the placement of these notes directly within the model, thereby embedding historical context into the BIM. The process involves creating callouts, which are detailed view references that highlight specific parts of the model and incorporate the text annotations. These callouts serve to enhance the clarity and contextual understanding of the historical data within the model (Figure 25 and Figure 26). To export the annotated model as a PDF file, Revit’s sheet creation feature is utilized. Sheets are designed to include all relevant views, sections, and callouts, thereby compiling a comprehensive representation of both visual and textual historical information. The “Print” or “Export” functions in Revit are then used to generate PDF files from these sheets, ensuring that the integrated historical data and annotations are preserved in a portable document format.
This methodology not only enhances the documentation and presentation of historical information within the BIM model but also ensures that the heritage value is comprehensively recorded and accessible. By facilitating the export of annotated models as PDF files, the approach supports the dissemination and communication of heritage data among stakeholders, thereby contributing to informed decision-making in conservation and restoration initiatives. The final output from the HBIM process included 3D rendered shots of the Ghiqa Historical Market, providing visually detailed representations that further aid in preservation and educational efforts (Figure 27, Figure 28 and Figure 29).
3.6. Geospatial Analysis
The Ghiqa Historical Market undergoes comprehensive geospatial analysis using 3D laser scanning and photogrammetry techniques, facilitated by GIS software. Point cloud data and high-resolution images capture the market’s intricate architectural elements and spatial characteristics with unprecedented accuracy. The 3D laser scanning procedure precisely measures the market’s physical structure, while photogrammetry enhances visualization with detailed textured representations. These datasets are seamlessly integrated into ArcGIS pro software to enable spatial analysis of the market’s layout, structural integrity, and historical relevance.
Integrating datasets from 3D laser scanning and photogrammetry into GIS software begins with capturing precise XYZ coordinates of the Ghiqa Historical Market’s structure through laser scanning and creating textured 3D models from high-resolution images. After processing to align and register the data, it is imported into GIS platforms like ArcGIS pro or QGIS. This integration facilitates spatial analysis, including assessing the market’s layout, overlaying GIS layers to evaluate structural integrity, and analysing historical changes in architecture and land use. Visualization tools within GIS aid in presenting findings for informed decision-making in conservation, urban planning, and historical preservation efforts.
Geospatial analysis techniques such as spatial interpolation, proximity analysis, and overlay analysis (Figure 30) are employed to detect spatial patterns, identify potential threats, and assess the cultural heritage value of the market in relation to its surroundings. These analyses can be used as “proof of concept”, and more advanced analysis will be in the future work of this project. The total area of the market is 35,100 square meters, with 10,500 square meters of solid areas and 24,600 square meters of void areas (Figure 31). By leveraging new data-capturing methods and GIS technology, researchers and conservationists gain valuable insights into the spatial dynamics of the Ghiqa Historical Market, enhancing preservation and management decisions. This interdisciplinary approach fosters collaboration among architects, historians, archaeologists, and urban planners, contributing to the protection of Saudi Arabia’s architectural heritage.
4. Discussion
In this section, the detailed findings of the study are presented, including the development and analysis of 3D BIM models, structural assessments, and condition classifications of the buildings in the Ghiqa Historical Market. The integration of historical data and its implications for preservation and restoration planning are also discussed. Using point cloud data from 3D laser scanning, detailed digital models of the Ghiqa Historical Market were created. These models accurately capture the architectural features, structural systems, and material attributes of the buildings. The accuracy of these models was validated against manual measurements and historical records, ensuring a high level of precision. The 3D BIM models were utilized to conduct comprehensive structural analyses. Structural loads and stress distributions were simulated to identify potential weaknesses and areas requiring reinforcement. For example, the stress distribution maps derived from the analyses indicated high-stress regions that may be susceptible to structural failure, highlighting critical areas needing immediate attention to prevent further deterioration.
A condition assessment of the buildings was performed, classifying them into “fair”, “bad”, and “good” categories based on preliminary criteria including structural integrity, material condition, and environmental exposure. The detailed visual and structural data provided by the 3D models supported this classification. The assessment found that 51 buildings were in fair condition, 36 in bad condition, and 17 in good condition. Examples of buildings in each condition category were documented with corresponding 3D model snapshots, providing visual evidence to support the findings.
Furthermore, historical archives and photographs were integrated into the 3D models to enrich the contextual information. This integration added a comprehensive historical narrative, illustrating changes over time and the original state of the structures. The enriched models provided a holistic understanding of the Ghiqa Historical Market, aiding accurate preservation and restoration decisions.
The results of the study demonstrate that HBIM significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of architectural documentation. The detailed digital models not only support condition assessments but also facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge transfer. By including the Ghiqa Historical Market in the UNESCO World Heritage List, international attention and resources for its preservation can be attracted. This designation would underscore the market’s cultural and historical importance, fostering a sense of pride and responsibility in its maintenance.
5. The Conclusions and Final Remarks

Abstract: Anatomists are facing a new generation of learners who will study and work in a technology‐rich environment. Indeed, digital technologies are tremendously changing how information and knowledge are communicated and retrieved. However, it remains unclear whether an anatomy assessment can be designed to promote contextual learning through integrating a digital communication strategy. To investigate this, assessment methods were diversified in the first‐year neuroanatomy and third‐year regional anatomy curricula through implementing a multimedia human anatomy group assignment integrating digital literacies and scientific communication. Through completing this multimedia assignment, students demonstrated their anatomy knowledge transfer using a range of approaches. The main mode of presentations chosen in the two anatomy units were non‐animated video presentations (~50%), animated video presentations (~30%), storyboards (~10%), podcasts (~3%), and filmed videos (~3%). A 5‐point Likert scale learning and teaching survey was conducted for a total of 195 undergraduate health science students to evaluate students' perception of this group assignment. The majority of students (70–80%) strongly agreed or agreed that the multimedia group assignment helped their teamwork skills. Students who produced animated videos significantly outperformed those who adopted the non‐animated presentations during the end‐of‐semester theory examination ( p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that an anatomy group assignment integrating digital literacy and scientific communication is an effective assessment strategy associated with a positive learning experience and outcome. This inquiry‐based assignment promotes learning through assessment, allowing students to not only consolidate and extend anatomy knowledge but also developing effective digital communication skills, providing new insights into non‐didactic anatomy assessments.

Abstract: Objective To date, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is considered as the most advanced metal additive manufacturing technology. It has been widely adopted for the production of critical metal components in aerospace and healthcare industries. However, realizing quality stability and consistency is challenging because of the coupled effects of various factors during LPBF. The powder-spreading quality is a crucial characteristic of LPBF process monitoring. Defects during powder spreading can introduce defects into the formed components. In recent years, the application of computer vision in powder-spreading defect detection has shown promising results. However, the limited availability of annotated data constrains its performance. Large vision models, such as the segment anything model (SAM), exhibit remarkable generalization capabilities owing to pre-training on an extremely large dataset. This allows its transfer to various downstream tasks with minimal training data. However, owing to the lack of defect knowledge, absence of category information, and dependence on manual prompts, SAM cannot be directly applied to powder-spreading defect segmentation. This study addresses the requirements for powder-spreading defect segmentation by improving SAM, achieving excellent defect segmentation performance with minimal training samples, and exploring the potential application of large vision models in monitoring the additive manufacturing process. Methods In this study, the powder-spreading defect segment anything model (PSAM), based on SAM, was introduced. The overall structure of PSAM was similar to that of SAM, which consisted of an image encoder, an auto-prompt generator, and a mask decoder. Compared to the original SAM, PSAM incorporated the following improvements: To address the issue of knowledge transfer concerning SAM's pre-trained parameters, four Adapter modules were introduced into the SAM image encoder structure. These Adapter modules enabled efficient adjustment of image feature encoding. They were inserted behind the multi-head attention layer in the transformer module and comprised linear and convolutional layers. To satisfy the requirements for category information in the powder-spreading segmentation task, PSAM utilized an improved mask decoder. This decoder outputted segmentation masks that were equal to the number of categories in a single pass. Each output corresponded to a specific category-segmentation result. These outputs were then integrated to obtain a classification output. To overcome the challenges of manual prompting in industrial settings, an autoprompt generator was designed. This generator is a fully convolutional neural network with residual connections that extracts features from input images and generates prompt embeddings that can be used by a mask decoder. A combination of cross-entropy loss, focal loss, and Dice loss was used as the final loss function. Specifically, mean intersection over union (mIoU) was employed as the evaluation metric. Results and Discussions This study utilizes an off-axis industrial camera to acquire powder-spreading images during the formation of several components. A subset of these images is selected for pixel-level annotation and is categorized into six classes: background, super-elevation, incomplete, hopping, streaking, and lattice. The images and their corresponding labels are organized into a dataset and are divided according to certain proportions. The model is trained using the training set, and even with only 50 training images, PSAM exhibits excellent segmentation performance. The evaluation of PSAM using the test set yields an mIoU of 65.02%, representing an improvement of 8.51 percentage points over Deeplab v3 and 5.31 percentage points over U-Net (Table 1). The limited amount of data restricts the ability of the model to perform deeper feature learning, thus hindering its capacity for richer feature representation. However, the pretrained SAM possesses strong image-feature extraction capabilities. Therefore, excellent defect segmentation performance can be realized without extensive data training. Ablation experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed improvements. The results indicate that the introduction of the Adapter module successfully transfers feature representation capabilities, and the automatic prompting effectively guides the mask decoder's output. Compared with the original SAM, PSAM realizes an mIoU improvement of 11.33 percentage points (Table 2). Conclusions The design of PSAM based on SAM realizes excellent segmentation performance even with a small amount of training data. Firstly, the model achieves transferring image encoder feature extraction capabilities from natural images to powder- spreading images by introducing the Adapter modules. Second, the mask decoder is modified to output the category masks. Finally, by incorporating an auto-prompt generator to encode the input images, automatic generation of visual prompt embeddings is achieved. Large artificial intelligence (AI) models are rapidly advancing. However, owing to the unique characteristics and complex operating conditions of industrial settings, these models still face challenges in practical applications in industrial scenarios. This study provides a preliminary exploration of the application of large vision models for powder-spreading defect detection in additive manufacturing. However, the full potential of large vision models has yet to be fully realized. The outstanding feature extraction, zero-shot generalization, and multimodal knowledge fusion capabilities of these large models can provide new solutions and approaches for additive manufacturing process monitoring, which are worth further exploration in future research.

Full text: 1. Introduction
We believe that in an era defined by rapid technological advancement and a growing awareness of sustainability, the intersection of innovation and responsibility has never been more crucial. Technology, with its ever-expanding capabilities, has woven itself intricately into every aspect of modern life, revolutionizing industries, shaping economies, and altering social dynamics. At the forefront of this technological revolution stands Artificial Intelligence (AI), a field characterized by its ability to analyze vast amounts of data, derive insights, and even make autonomous decisions. Among the several manifestations of AI, GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models represent a peak of natural language processing, a very useful tool even in the educational context [1]. Therefore, in today’s landscape, fostering AI literacy among students is not only about preparing them for the digital future but also about equipping them with the tools to navigate complex ethical issues and contribute to sustainable development goals.
Delving into existing studies, Ng et al. [2] conducted an exploratory review to establish a theoretical underpinning for defining, teaching, and assessing AI literacy. Through meticulous analysis of 18 peer-reviewed articles, their work identified four foundational pillars for nurturing AI literacy: knowledge and comprehension of AI, practical utilization of AI, critical evaluation of AI, and ethical engagement with AI. This seminal research underscores the imperative of integrating AI literacy into educational curricula, ensuring that students possess the competencies essential for navigating an increasingly AI-driven world.
Complementary to Ng et al.’s exploration, Kasinidou [3] underscored the universality of AI literacy, advocating for its dissemination across diverse demographic cohorts through participatory design paradigms. Kasinidou’s emphasis on understanding public perceptions of AI and fostering effective educational initiatives resonates with the broader imperative of democratizing access to AI literacy.
Further enriching our understanding, studies on AI literacy assessment instruments provide invaluable insights into the multidimensional nature of AI literacy among students. In another research conducted by Ng. et. al. [4], the authors utilized both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to delineate the underlying dimensions of AI literacy, emphasizing affective, behavioral, cognitive, and ethical facets in assessing students’ proficiency in AI technologies. Similarly, the work of Laupichler et al. [5] elucidated key factors influencing non-experts’ AI literacy, underscoring the significance of technical comprehension and ethical awareness. Augmenting these insights are empirical investigations into the efficacy of AI literacy interventions within educational contexts [6]. S. Kong et al. [7] demonstrated notable enhancements in university students’ conceptual grasp of Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts following participation in AI literacy courses. Such endeavors not only bolster students’ self-perceived AI literacy but also underscore the centrality of conceptual scaffolding in facilitating comprehension. Cetindamar et. al. [8] explored the dimensions of AI literacy and identifies key capabilities essential for employees. The study highlighted technology-related, work-related, human-machine-related, and learning-related capabilities crucial for fostering AI literacy among non-technical professionals.
The study by Celik [9] highlighted the significant impact of computational thinking on enhancing AI literacy among higher education students. By investigating the relationships between AI literacy, digital divide, computational thinking, and cognitive absorption, the research emphasizes the importance of integrating computational thinking skills in educational programs to foster AI literacy among students.
Moreover, the integration of AI concepts into interdisciplinary educational frameworks, as advocated by Relmasira et al. [10], underscores the feasibility of AI literacy attainment across diverse educational paradigms. Similarly, the successful infusion of AI principles into maker education, as demonstrated by Ng et al. [11], underscores the transformative potential of experiential learning modalities in nurturing AI literacy. Lin et al. [12] revealed that AI literacy positively influences secondary school students’ computational thinking efficacy in learning AI.
The study by Wang et al. [13] enhanced the understanding of AI literacy and developed a 12-item scale to measure user competence in using Artificial Intelligence. Their research highlights the positive correlation between AI literacy and users’ attitudes, daily usage, and proficiency in AI technology. Domínguez Figaredo et al. [14] emphasized the importance of a stakeholder-first approach in AI education, highlighting the need to prioritize understanding and reflection on the societal impact of AI. By focusing on contextualized knowledge and adapting learning strategies, the study aimed to enhance AI literacy among diverse audiences. Long [15] provided a comprehensive exploration of AI literacy competencies and design considerations, offering valuable insights for educating non-technical learners about AI.
The systematic literature review on AI education interventions in K-12 settings [16,17] revealed a growing body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of teaching AI concepts to students. The review highlighted the importance of a learner-centered approach, context-aware pedagogical practices, and the measurement of AI learning outcomes for future research and practice in K-12 AI education.
The comparative analysis with other AI education methodologies sheds light on the distinctive advantages of the theoretical-experiential binomial approach proposed in this study. While purely theoretical approaches may offer a strong foundational understanding of AI concepts, they often lack practical application and hands-on experience. Conversely, purely practical approaches may focus on immediate application but overlook the critical thinking and problem-solving skills developed through theoretical understanding. By integrating theoretical knowledge with experiential learning, our framework strikes a balance that equips students with both a solid theoretical foundation and practical skills essential for navigating real-world AI challenges. This approach aims to promote creativity, innovation, and critical thinking among students, preparing the students for successful careers in the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence.
The research question of this study revolves around exploring the effectiveness of an educational framework that combines theoretical understanding with practical experimentation to enhance AI literacy among students. The study aims to investigate how this theoretical-experiential approach can foster creativity, innovation, critical thinking, and practical skills essential for successful careers in the field of AI.
The paper is structured into four main sections. Section 1 presents similar studies and covers the introduction of the educational framework. The second section describes the proposed framework together with two practical experiments using Internet of Things (IoT) devices, while Section 3 illustrates the results of our study and feedback on the framework’s effectiveness. The last section presents the final conclusions of this research.
2. Materials and Methods
Experiential learning holds significant importance in education due to its ability to actively engage students in the learning process, leading to the enhanced understanding, retention, and application of knowledge [18]. By involving students in hands-on experiences, simulations, and real-world applications, experiential learning goes beyond traditional passive learning methods, such as lectures and readings. This approach allows students to connect theoretical concepts to practical situations, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity. Additionally, experiential learning promotes a deeper level of understanding and long-term retention of information by immersing students in meaningful learning experiences. Experiential learning plays a vital role in preparing students for real-world challenges, equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in their academic and professional endeavors. Morris [19] conducted a thorough examination of Kolb’s experiential learning model [20], highlighting the need for empirical testing and potential revisions to enhance its applicability.
The current study employs a structured approach delineated into five main sections to elucidate the process of fostering AI literacy among students, encapsulated within the theoretical-experiential binomial framework. The process for this complete learning cycle is illustrated in Figure 1.
As the diagram shows, the educational framework proposed herein delineates a structured approach comprising five sequential stages to facilitate comprehensive learning and skill acquisition in Artificial Intelligence (AI):
- Theoretical fundamentals: This initial stage acquaints students with foundational concepts in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). Through theoretical instruction, students develop a solid understanding of ML algorithms and DL neural networks, laying the groundwork for subsequent practical applications.

- AI experiments: Building upon the theoretical foundation established in Stage 1, students’ progress to engaging in a series of AI experiments (from Experiment 1 to Experiment n). These experiments serve as experiential learning modules, enabling students to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios and tasks.

- Critical thinking: As students advance through the experimental phase, critical thinking skills are cultivated. They learn to analyze data, challenge assumptions, pose insightful questions, and reflect on their thought processes. This critical thinking capacity enhances their ability to discern patterns, evaluate outcomes, and make informed decisions in AI experimentation.

- Experimentation and introspective analysis: In this stage, students delve deeper into experimentation, conducting iterative analyses and fostering introspection. Through hands-on exploration and reflection, they cultivate wisdom in navigating the intricacies of AI systems. This introspective analysis aids in refining experimental methodologies and optimizing AI solutions.

- Creativity and implementation: The final stage emphasizes the development of creativity and innovation in AI implementation. Equipped with a comprehensive understanding of theoretical principles, critical thinking skills, and practical experimentation experience, students are empowered to conceptualize novel solutions and think innovatively. They gain proficiency in designing and implementing experiments tailored to specific objectives, demonstrating versatility and adaptability in addressing diverse AI challenges.



In our view, this structured progression through five distinct stages ensures a holistic educational experience, equipping students with the requisite knowledge, skills, and mindset to navigate the complexities of AI applications effectively. By integrating theoretical instruction with hands-on experimentation and fostering critical thinking and creativity, this educational framework promotes AI literacy and empowers students to become adept practitioners in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
As described previously, in the second stage of the educational framework, several AI experiments were conducted, culminating in the development of various applications. Among these, two pivotal experiments are highlighted in this paper for their significance in AI literacy. The first experiment focuses on the detection and classification of musical notes, speech, and background noise, showcasing the capability of AI algorithms to discern auditory signals in real-time environments. The second experiment centers on human activity recognition, wherein AI models are trained to recognize and categorize diverse human movements and behaviors with high accuracy. These experiments exemplify the practical application of theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios, providing valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of AI technology in addressing multifaceted challenges across different domains.
2.1. Detecting Musical Notes, Speech, and Background Noise
The technology for extracting musical information, still under development, is an important component of music technology, with increasingly integrated methods of Artificial Intelligence in this field. Note detection and recognition represent a branch of musical information extraction and constitute a significant research theme in the domain of audio signal analysis and processing [21]. While recurrent neural networks are typically preferred for time series, fully connected neural networks are often favored for Edge devices, such as PSoC 6 (Programmable System on a Chip), due to their parallelism energy and computational efficiency [22].
In this context, the developed experiment proposes automatic real-time detection of musical notes, speech, and background noise using a Deep Learning model based on a fully connected neural network. The experiment utilized the SensiML plugin, which aids in collecting data from PSoC 6 through attached sensors, also providing methods for labeling the captured data. The experiment consists of the following steps:
- audio data acquisition and annotation,

- applying signal pre-processing techniques to the acquired data,

- designing and training a classification algorithm, and

- implementing an intelligent model optimized for the IoT device.



The development of real-world Edge AI applications requires high-quality annotated data. The SensiML data capture application facilitates the collection, annotation, and exploration of sensor time series data, proving to be valuable even for students [23].
2.1.1. Data Acquisition and Annotation
The data were acquired using the microphone on the CY8KIT-028-TFT shield. It contains a digital microphone with a Pulse-Width Modulation (PDM) output on a single bit, allowing the conversion of any acquired sound into a digital signal. The PSoC 6 device converts this digital signal into a quantized 16-bit Pulse-Core Modulation (PCM) value. An interrupt is triggered when there are sufficient data to be processed, specifically at least 128 samples.
Furthermore, the students were instructed that to avoid bias, it is important for the acquired audio data to be as clean as possible and to ensure a wide diversity (musical notes from various instruments, different voices in speech, etc.).
After programming the data acquisition application on the PSoC 6 device, data were acquired at a sampling rate of 16,000 Hz. Numerous segments were saved for each of the following musical notes: D, E, F, G, A, B. Upon completion of data acquisition, students were instructed on how to label the data in the Data Capture Lab (Figure 2).
In addition to musical notes, multiple files containing speech and ambient noise audio data were acquired and labeled. Furthermore, after acquisition, the data were automatically uploaded to the Cloud. Through the Cloud portal, the data could be visualized, and all labels, as well as their distribution, could be analyzed. To ensure that students gained the necessary skills to build an appropriate dataset, a similar number of segments were created for each note, while for speech and noise, more segments were generated, considering their greater variety and more complex characteristics.
2.1.2. Machine Learning Model Design and Training
To build a classification Deep Learning model, a Tensorflow Lite pipeline for Microcontrollers was implemented.
The next step involves adding a filter and configuring the entire Pipeline. In this stage, the following elements were configured, with students assimilating the meaning and role of each parameter (Figure 3):
- Windowing: Segmentator of size 400—takes input from the sensor transformation/filter step.

- Frequency domain feature generator—a collection of feature generators that process the data segment to extract meaningful information.

- Data balancing: Undersample Majority Classes—creates a balanced dataset by undersampling the majority classes using random sampling without replacement.

- Feature quantization: Min-max scaler—normalizes and scales the data to integer values between min_bound and max_bound.

- Outlier filter: Z-score filter—filters feature vectors that have values outside of a limit threshold (threshold set at 3).

- Classifier: TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers—takes a feature vector as input and returns a classification based on a predefined model.

- Training algorithm: Fully connected neural network, which includes the following features:
- Dense layers of sizes (number of neurons) 128, 64, 32, 16, 8.

- Learning rate of 0.01.

- Softmax activation for the final layer.

- Number of epochs: 4.

- Threshold of 0.8.




- Categorical cross-entropy loss function.

- Validation: Stratified Shuffle Split—the validation scheme splits the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets with similar label distributions.

- Validation parameters—accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity.



After optimization, a model was generated whose characteristics were graphically displayed. As demonstrated by Table 1, the model achieved very good performance indicators, both in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score, as well as the size of the classifier.
2.1.3. Model Testing and Validation
For students to better understand and analyze the cases where the classifier predicted correctly or incorrectly, both the confusion matrix on the training set and one on the validation set were determined (Figure 4).
From Figure 4 and Figure 5, it can be inferred that the model achieved very good and similar performances both on the training dataset (data that the model has previously seen and provided during the training phase) and on the validation dataset, which the network has not seen before. The only erroneous predictions, also observed by the students, were regarding speech and only in specific cases—when the sound intensity was too low and there was background noise as well.
Multiple values were tested for the number of epochs, and through graphical analysis, it was concluded that the optimal number in terms of both training and prediction time, as well as accuracy, was 4. Figure 6 displays the accuracy obtained at each training and validation epoch. This analysis revealed that after 4 epochs, both accuracy and loss did not significantly improve further.
Considering that the model performed very well on the test and validation data, it can be run by students in real time to validate its functionality on the PSoC 6 device.
Before deploying the Machine Learning model on the IoT device, predictions can be visualized in real-time in the Data Capture Lab. The application will run the model on the data captured in real time by the microphone connected to the PSoC 6 device. The classification results generated by the model are added to the history and can be graphically visualized in real-time, along with the latest prediction made (Figure 6).
The application program on the PSoC 6 sends real-time predictions via UART, which can be visualized by students either through Putty or Open Gateway or on the TFT screen connected to the PSoC6 (Figure 7). Through Open Gateway, a serial connection can be established to the COM port allocated to the IoT device. After establishing the connection, in the testing mode, the current prediction is displayed along with the history of previous predictions.
The performances in this stage have proven to be as good as in the validation stage. The exploration of musical note recognition within the context of AI literacy serves as a hands-on application of theoretical concepts, providing students with a tangible and engaging learning experience. This experiment encourages students to explore the interdisciplinary nature of AI literacy, bridging the gap between technology and creative arts. By engaging in such hands-on activities, they can develop a holistic understanding of AI’s potential applications across various fields, preparing them for the multidimensional challenges of the digital age.
Furthermore, it not only reinforces students’ comprehension of AI concepts but also fosters critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. Through this exercise, students learn how AI algorithms can be utilized in diverse scenarios, developing their ability to analyze data, make informed decisions, and innovate solutions.
2.2. Classification of Human Activities by Edge Techniques
The field of human activity recognition has become one of the current research topics due to the availability of sensors and accelerometers, low energy consumption, real-time data transmission, and advancements in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and IoT. Through this, various human activities can be recognized, such as walking, running, sleeping, standing, driving, abnormal activities, etc. Students can further develop the experiment for widespread use in medical diagnosis, monitoring the elderly, and creating a smart home. Additionally, driving activity can also be recognized, enhancing traffic safety. The experiment was programmed and run on the PSoC 6 microcontroller, developed by Infineon.
As a general rule, the process of developing a model for recognizing human activities consists of four main stages (Figure 8):
- Acceleration signal acquisition.

- Data preprocessing.

- Activity recognition (based on Deep Learning techniques).

- User interface for transmitting and displaying the prediction.



This experiment accomplishes the classification of human activities based on motion sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope). A model program on the IoT device was pre-trained on a computer using Keras and classifies a few common activities: stationary, walking, and running.
The operation of the application was described and explained to the students through a block diagram (Figure 9). In an infinite loop, the IoT device reads data from a motion sensor (BMX160, Bosch Sensortec, Reutlingen, Germany) attached to the PSoC 6 to detect activities. The dataset consists of orientation data on 3 axes from both accelerometer and gyroscope. A timer is configured to interrupt at 128 Hz. The interrupt handler reads all 6 axes via SPI and signals a data processing task when the internal buffer has 128 new samples. It applies an IIR filter and min-max normalization to 128 samples simultaneously. These processed data are then transmitted to the inference processor. The inference processor determines and returns the prediction confidence for each activity class. If the confidence exceeds an 80% threshold, the predicted activity is displayed on the UART terminal. This application utilizes FreeRTOS. Within it, a system task—the activity task—was defined and executed, which processes received data and forwards it to the ML model.
2.2.1. Data Acquisition
The data for training the Machine Learning model were collected from multiple users during various activities, using the BMX160 sensor attached to the PSoC 6, then labeled according to activity and saved in a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file. Prior consent was obtained from the users through an IRB agreement, and the acquired and stored data comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). When saving new data or gestures, a Python script can be used, which takes parameters such as the activity name and the person collecting the data.
The collected data were graphically displayed for analysis and cleaning purposes (Figure 10). To ensure the relevance of the data, students need to be aware that it should come from multiple individuals of diverse ages and anatomies.
2.2.2. AI Model Development
After data collection, a model was developed using that data—a step that included both training and calibrating the model. For this problem, a neural network model was built in Python (version 3.12) using the Keras library. Before the training stage, the entire process was presented to the students: data preprocessing, cleaning, and random splitting of the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Following this, the data were converted into a standardized format, activities that the model could classify were generated, and the final calibration of the model was performed.
The model was then trained using the collected data, employing the following features:
- Adam optimizer.

- Learning rate of 0.0001.

- Metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix.

- 20 epochs and 1000 steps for each epoch.



The confusion matrix was displayed graphically so that students could visualize the classification performance of the model (Figure 11).
The weights and structure of the model were then saved in a file to be used by students for programming the IoT device, and its validation and calibration data were saved in a separate file. Performance indicators of the model are illustrated in Table 2, and Figure 12 presents the characteristics of the final model. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model consists of two convolutional blocks and two fully connected layers.
Each convolutional block includes convolutional operations, including Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation and the dropout layer, with the addition of a flattened layer after the first block. The convolutional layers act as feature extractors and provide abstract representations of input sensor data in the feature map. They capture short-term dependencies (spatial relationships) in the data. In the developed network, features are extracted and then used as inputs to a fully connected network, using Softmax activation for classification.
Following this, the generated model was programmed by students onto the device for testing. The ML Configurator also shows the resources consumed by the model, which are suitable for any microcontroller. The model was validated on PC, yielding very good results for both 8 × 8 and floating-point quantization. Before being programmed onto the PSoC 6 device, the model needs to be checked to validate if it is optimized for the available hardware on that device. Following the validation performed in the ML Configurator, a 100% accuracy, and 0.01 prediction error were achieved (Figure 13).
After programming the device, through the serial connection to the computer, it displays on the UART terminal the prediction in real-time, together with the confidence percentage for each class (Figure 14).
This experiment showcases the potential of AI models to analyze complex data patterns and make informed decisions based on input signals. By engaging in this hands-on activity, students enhance their skills in data analysis, model training, and result interpretation, contributing to their overall proficiency in AI technology. Furthermore, the experiment highlights the importance of data quality and feature selection in training AI models for human activity recognition. By optimizing the input data and refining the model architecture, students can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the AI system, demonstrating the critical role of data preprocessing in enhancing model performance. Therefore, students are not only able to deepen their understanding of AI concepts, but they can also develop essential skills in model development, data analysis, and problem-solving, preparing them for future challenges in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
3. Results and Discussion
This section summarizes the specific conclusions of this article and suggests opportunities and recommendations for further research. The research was conducted with the assistance of the Center for Valorization and Skills Transfer (CVTC) at Transilvania University of Brașov, Romania, in partnership with the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The participants in our study consisted of 93 Romanian students ranging in age from 21 to 23 years old, both male and female. These students were predominantly from IT study fields, forming a homogeneous demographic group for our research.
Following the implementation of the structured experimental learning process in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) according to the theoretical-experiential binomial, promising results were obtained in promoting literacy among students. The well-defined stages of this process represent an important step in enhancing students’ understanding, practical skills, and critical thinking in the field of AI.
By implementing the proposed educational framework, the structured process in five distinct stages ensures a holistic educational experience. In the first stage, learning the theoretical fundamentals of AI provided students with a solid knowledge base in the realm of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This allowed them to progress to the next stage, engaging in practical experiments in AI.
As they progressed through experiments, students developed critical thinking skills, analyzing data, questioning assumptions, and evaluating results. Experimentation and introspective analysis allowed students to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of AI systems and identify ways to optimize them.
The final stage emphasized the development of creativity and innovation in implementing AI algorithms. Students were encouraged to conceptualize new solutions and approach challenges in the field of AI innovatively. They gained competencies in designing and implementing experiments tailored to specific objectives.
The two practical experiments presented in this study highlighted the direct application of theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios.
The first experiment had a significant educational impact, with students gaining a profound understanding of:
- Data acquisition and annotation process: The importance of a diverse collection of high-quality and correctly labeled data was highlighted through practical exercises.

- Signal pre-processing techniques: Filtering, normalization, and other techniques were implemented and analyzed, strengthening the theoretical knowledge.

- Neural network design and training: Network architecture, training parameters, and model optimization were studied and tuned, providing valuable practical experience.

- Implementing models on IoT devices: Hardware limitations and resource optimization were considered, preparing students for real-world challenges.



The second experiment facilitated the following aspects:
- Principles of activity recognition: Students grasped the steps of data acquisition, preprocessing, classification, and user interface.

- Development of Convolutional Neural Network models: Specific architecture, model optimization, and validation were studied in a practical context.

- Utilization of sensors and IoT devices: Direct experimentation with motion sensors, chip programming, and data interpretation was conducted.

- Ethics and responsibility in AI: Considerations regarding data collection, privacy, and bias were successfully integrated into the learning process.



Through the analysis of AI models’ performance on the PSoC 6 device, it has been demonstrated that these models can be efficiently implemented and provide reliable real-time results. The performance of the human activity classification model achieved very high accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed technologies in training students in the field of AI.
Despite the significant benefits brought by the experimental learning process in the field of Artificial Intelligence, certain limitations need to be addressed to enhance its efficiency and accuracy. One of the main limitations is the availability and quality of the datasets used in experiments. The quality of the data can significantly influence the model’s performance and its ability to generalize to new scenarios. Moreover, access to adequate equipment and computational resources can be challenging for certain institutions or students.
Another important limitation is related to the complexity and abstraction of some theoretical concepts in the field of AI, which may be difficult for some students to grasp without proper educational support. Additionally, there may be difficulties in adapting theory to the practical requirements of different applications or areas of interest. To overcome these limitations, some improvements and adjustments to the experimental learning process in the field of AI are necessary. Firstly, it is important to pay increased attention to data collection and processing, ensuring that they are representative and of high quality. It is also essential to provide students with adequate resources and tools to conduct experiments efficiently.
Moreover, it is necessary to develop educational materials and teaching methods that facilitate the understanding of complex theoretical concepts in a more accessible and interactive manner. Integrating case studies and practical projects into the curriculum can provide students with additional opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge in relevant contexts and acquire practical skills in solving real-world problems in the field of AI. By adopting a balanced approach between theory and practice and providing adequate resources and support, the experimental learning process in the field of AI can be significantly improved, thereby preparing students for future challenges and opportunities in this continuously evolving domain.
We believe that closer integration of collaboration and teamwork in the learning process could significantly enhance students’ experience. Teamwork can facilitate the exchange of ideas and experiences among students, encouraging collaboration and creativity. This could better prepare students for the professional environment, where AI projects are often developed in multidisciplinary teams.
Thus, from a sustainability perspective, developing practical skills in the field of AI prepares students for successful careers in rapidly expanding fields. The use of IoT devices contributes to interactive learning, making the educational framework more flexible and adaptable to future needs.
Students participating in the theoretical-experiential binomial approach to AI education immersed themselves in a range of engaging experiential learning activities aimed at bridging theoretical knowledge with practical application. They collaborated in teams to preprocess the sensor data, train predictive models, and deploy the system on IoT devices to monitor equipment health in real-time. During these activities, students encountered diverse challenges that tested their problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities. One notable challenge involved the integration of complex AI algorithms into IoT devices, requiring students to navigate compatibility issues and optimize code for efficient performance. Additionally, students faced data quality challenges, such as incomplete datasets and noisy inputs, which necessitated robust preprocessing techniques to ensure accurate model training. To overcome these hurdles, students engaged in collaborative problem-solving sessions, leveraging peer feedback and mentor guidance to refine their approaches. Through iterative experimentation, meticulous data analysis, and innovative algorithmic adjustments, students successfully tackled these challenges, demonstrating resilience, adaptability, and a deepening understanding of AI concepts in real-world applications.
For assessing the proposed framework, a comprehensive approach to measure the competencies acquired by students was employed. The assessment methodology encompassed both quantitative and qualitative measures to ensure a nuanced understanding of the students’ skill development. Quantitatively, standardized assessments and surveys tailored to evaluate specific competencies related to AI literacy were utilized, such as knowledge retention, critical thinking abilities, and practical application skills, which are very important according to the AI Competency Framework [24]. These quantitative measures provided numerical data that allowed for statistical analysis and comparison of pre- and post-intervention competencies. In addition to quantitative measures, qualitative methods were employed, as well such as interviews, focus groups, and reflective journals to capture the nuanced aspects of students’ learning experiences, including their perceptions, attitudes, and deeper insights gained from the educational intervention. By incorporating both quantitative and qualitative measures, the aim was to provide a comprehensive assessment of the impact of our educational intervention on students’ competencies in navigating AI applications effectively.
To evaluate the proposed approach, a questionnaire consisting of 10 questions has been developed, addressing aspects such as the usefulness of educational materials, the relevance of practical experiments, student satisfaction, and the impact on the development of specific AI domain competencies. The questions and response options of this questionnaire are presented in Table 3.

- Offering opportunities for peer collaboration or discussion forums.

- Providing additional resources or Supplementary Materials.

- The pace of the course could be adjusted to the needs of each student.

- Including more interactive activities or practical exercises.


Student feedback was collected through an online anonymous survey on Google Forms ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkXBucogpGud5ceaS7ptIiwNPBMZ3U-YWk0dDRZfoQuHTPdQ/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0 , accessed on 10 May 2024). Students expressed positive responses so far, appreciating the proposed approach, finding the practical experiments helpful for better understanding theoretical concepts and rating the experience with a high grade (Figure 15). Most of the respondents were overall satisfied with this learning experience, but they identified few aspects of the educational framework that could be improved, which will be included for the further development of this framework:
The qualitative evaluation of our educational framework was conducted through a triangulation of methods: interviews, focus groups, and reflective journals. Each method contributed equally to the overall assessment of AI literacy competencies.
Interviews were structured to probe deeper into students’ understanding of AI concepts. The data collected from these interviews were subjected to thematic analysis, where responses were coded and categorized into themes related to knowledge retention, critical thinking, and practical application. This process allowed us to identify patterns and draw correlations between the educational intervention and the development of specific AI competencies. From the individual interviews conducted with a subset of 30 students, we gathered rich qualitative data. Students reported a heightened awareness of AI’s ethical implications, while the thematic analysis revealed a recurring theme of increased confidence in discussing and propose AI implementations, suggesting that the intervention successfully improved their creativity and critical thinking competencies.
Focus groups were facilitated to encourage peer-to-peer interaction and collective reflection. The discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Subsequently, a content analysis was performed to quantify the frequency of specific competencies mentioned by the participants. This quantitative approach within a qualitative method provides a nuanced understanding of the group’s perception of the educational framework’s effectiveness. The focus group discussions, involving six groups of approximately 15 students each, provided a collaborative platform for students to share their learning experiences. The content analysis indicated a significant emphasis on the practical application of AI, with students actively discussing their projects and the challenges they faced. This highlights the framework’s effectiveness in engaging students with real-world AI problems.
Reflective journals offer a longitudinal perspective on individual learning progressions. Students’ entries were analyzed using a narrative analysis technique, which involves constructing a chronological narrative that illustrates the evolution of their competencies over time. This method highlights personal growth and the acquisition of AI-related skills throughout the intervention. Analysis of the reflective journals, maintained by all 93 students over the course of the intervention, offered longitudinal insights into their learning trajectories. Narrative analysis showed a clear progression in students’ ability to integrate AI knowledge into their existing skill sets. Many journals reflected a journey from theoretical understanding to practical application, with students documenting their personal growth and increased AI literacy.
Together, these qualitative methods form a comprehensive evaluation strategy. The data derived from these methods are integrated to present a holistic view of the educational intervention’s impact. The triangulation of data ensures reliability and validity, providing a robust foundation for conclusions about the framework’s effectiveness in fostering AI literacy.
Compared to similar studies, our research has some important advantages. In contrast to the study conducted by Ng et al. [4], which emphasized the affective, behavioral, cognitive, and ethical facets of AI literacy, our research places a stronger emphasis on the role of experiential learning in enhancing students’ proficiency in AI technologies. While Laupichler et al. [5,6] highlighted the importance of technical comprehension and ethical awareness in non-experts’ AI literacy, our study extends this understanding by demonstrating the effectiveness of hands-on experiences and real-world applications in fostering these competencies. Furthermore, our results echo the findings of [7,8], who reported improvements in students’ understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts following AI literacy courses. However, our study further contributes to this body of literature by demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed educational framework, which combines theoretical understanding with practical experimentation.
4. Conclusions
In contrast to prior literature, our framework stands out for its integration of theoretical understanding and hands-on experience. According to the results of the survey, a balance that empowers students with a robust theoretical grounding alongside vital practical skills crucial for tackling real-world AI obstacles was achieved. The aim of this study is to validate this approach and to demonstrate its effectiveness in nurturing AI literacy and fostering creativity, innovation, and critical thinking among students. Moreover, our analysis identifies both predictable and unpredictable outcomes, further solidifying the reliability and adaptability of our framework in preparing students for dynamic careers within the ever-evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence.
Taking into consideration the collected results on the conducted survey, the theoretical-experimental binomial shows promising results for educating students in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The practical implementation of models on IoT devices reinforces students’ understanding and allows them to experiment with theoretical concepts directly. The educational framework presented can be easily adapted to various application domains of Artificial Intelligence, contributing to preparing students for successful careers in rapidly expanding fields.
This approach brings significant contribution for students in the following aspects:
- Development of practical skills: Programming skills, data analysis, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities have been cultivated through concrete experiments.

- Consolidation of theoretical understanding: Practical implementation has reinforced theoretical concepts, providing a holistic perspective on AI.

- Stimulating creativity and innovation: Practical experiments have allowed students to explore innovative solutions and personalize their projects.

- Preparation for careers in AI: The acquired skills are essential for a successful career in the field of Artificial Intelligence.



The proposed educational framework offers a range of sustainable benefits, from access to interactive and industry-relevant learning experiences to the development of transferable skills adaptable to various AI application domains. The experimental approach fosters creativity and innovation, while the flexibility of the framework allows adaptation to diverse needs and available resources. Implementing this educational framework will provide students with quality preparation, turning them into competent and innovative professionals capable of contributing to societal progress.
In light of the study’s findings, several possibilities for further research emerge. First and foremost, exploring the scalability and adaptability of the proposed framework across different educational contexts warrants attention. Investigating its effectiveness in diverse settings, such as K-12 schools, universities, and vocational training programs, would provide valuable insights. Additionally, longitudinal studies tracking students’ AI literacy development over extended periods could shed light on the long-term impact of this educational approach.
Furthermore, delving into specific pedagogical strategies within the theoretical-experiential binomial framework is essential. For instance, understanding the optimal balance between theoretical lectures and hands-on projects would enhance instructional design. Additionally, incorporating collaborative learning experiences—where students work in multidisciplinary teams—could foster problem-solving skills in real-world applicability. Considering the rapid evolution of AI technologies, continuous updates to the curriculum are crucial. Integrating emerging topics such as ethical AI, interpretability, and bias mitigation would ensure that students remain well prepared for the dynamic AI landscape.

Abstract: Introduction: Education of patients prior to an invasive procedure is pivotal for good cooperation and knowledge retention. Virtual reality (VR) is a fast-developing technology that helps educate both medical professionals and patients. Objective: To prove non-inferiority of VR education compared to conventional education in patients prior to the implantation of a permanent pacemaker (PPM). Methods: 150 participants scheduled for an elective implantation of a PPM were enrolled in this prospective study and randomized into two groups: the VR group ( n = 75) watched a 360° video about the procedure using the VR headset Oculus Meta Quest 2, while the conventional group ( n = 75) was educated by a physician. Both groups filled out a questionnaire to assess the quality of education pre- and in-hospital, their knowledge of the procedure, and their subjective satisfaction. Results: There was no significant difference in the quality of education. There was a non-significant trend towards higher educational scores in the VR group. The subgroup with worse scores was older than the groups with higher scores (82 vs. 76 years, p = 0.025). Anxiety was reduced in 92% of participants. Conclusion: VR proved to be non-inferior to conventional education. It helped to reduce anxiety and showed no adverse effects.

Full text: 1. Introduction
Patient education is a key factor in ensuring good cooperation and adherence to a recommended treatment plan. A well-educated patient is more likely to be satisfied with their care and will be more compliant [1]. However, it may be difficult for them to retain the message if the information is too sophisticated or elaborate. This was highlighted in a review proving that around half of patients (40–60%) cannot correctly recall the information given by their physician within 10–80 min from their session [1]. There was also a high percentage of misunderstanding (up to 60%) of the information provided directly after the session [2].
Education plays an important role in reducing patients’ anxiety about their condition and/or the planned intervention. The fear of unfamiliar environments, staff, and procedures may be debilitating. Anxiety related to cardiac procedures is well described in the medical literature as an excessive fear with a sense of imminent jeopardy, and can occur before and/or during the procedure [2]. Studies suggest that up to half of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention suffer from significant anxiety [2]. A lack of knowledge of the procedure and insufficient anesthesia are the main reasons for periprocedural anxiety [2]. Anxiety causes cardiac autonomic dysfunction, leading to raised blood pressure and heart rate and reduced heart rate variability [3]. It can also mimic cardiac symptoms like chest tightness, breathlessness, and palpitations, which can mislead the operator during the procedure. Anxiety was found to be an independent predictor for postoperative cardiovascular outcomes and 4-year mortality after cardiac procedures [4]. It is also linked to higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality after cardiac procedures [4].
Virtual reality (VR) offers several advantages for patients’ education: it immerses patients directly in a real-time simulation, it is interactive, and it is entertaining; all of this contributes to enhanced information retention. This innovative technology can be used in rehabilitation as part of an exercise program [5], and in pediatric care to reduce anxiety by providing information about the procedure or by serving as a distraction [6]. Virtual reality is well established in the field of educating health care professionals [7]. It is also an emerging tool for the education of patients, either prior to invasive procedures or as part of a treatment plan for specific conditions [8,9,10,11,12].
Within cardiology, reports were given on the use of VR prior to a percutaneous coronary angiography [13], atrial septal closure [14], or ablation of atrial fibrillation [15]. To our knowledge, no study was performed to educate patients prior to an implantation of a permanent pacemaker (PPM). This procedure is predominantly performed as a day case in the non-acute setting; patients are frequently insufficiently educated by their primary care physicians and undergoing the procedure requires certain post-operative precautions. The PPM implantation is often performed only with the use of local anesthetics; sedation can be used as well. It is therefore crucial for the patient to understand the procedure well to remain calm during the surgery and to reduce their anxiety levels for the best outcomes. The population requiring this procedure is generally older and there are limited data on use of VR in an older population [16,17]. There are reports where VR was used to help with mobility and balance [18] or with mood [19].
We aim to prove the feasibility and non-inferiority of patients’ education with the use of VR prior to the implantation of a PPM and its beneficial effects on anxiety.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Participants
This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05695534). It is a prospective, randomized control study with two parallel groups. In total, 150 patients were included in the study. This includes all the patients who underwent an elective permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation as a one-day procedure via our cardiac Suite from January to December 2023. Exclusion criteria were significant visual impairment or significant cognitive impairment that would prevent the patient from filling out the questionnaire.
2.2. Randomization and Blinding
The participants were randomized into two groups: One group received the education about the procedure provided by the hospital staff and signed a standard informed consent form (a conventional group). The other group watched a video in virtual reality, instead of receiving the standard education, and then signed the consent form (a VR group). The randomization was done using an envelope method, with blocks of 30 patients. Sealed opaque envelopes were randomly selected by cardiac Suite staff. The hospital staff and the participants were not blinded to the results of randomization.
2.3. Interventions
A team of physicians created a screenplay containing all the necessary information about the procedure. The 360° video was recorded at our hospital premises, with our staff cast, using camera Insta X2 (Shenzen, China) in 5,6K resolution with 30 FPS. The movie was finalized in Adobe Premiere and presented in standalone wireless VR headset Oculus Meta Quest 2 (Reality Labs, Meta Platforms, MenloPark, CA, USA). The six-minute-long movie presents the hospital with its admission suite, cardiac suite, and electrophysiology theatre that features equipment designed to reduce anxiety in patients unfamiliar with the environment. The procedure, including its complications, is explained with the use of animations and pictures in the background to enhance understanding. The conventional and VR educations of participants were both performed in the cardiac suite in a quiet and safe environment. Both groups of patients had the opportunity to ask questions whenever they needed for better understanding. All the educational materials were provided in the Czech language to ensure the best understanding of the participants. To ensure the highest video quality and the most accurate educational content, a group of physicians involved in the procedure reviewed the VR content. We tested several different headsets to find the best combination of quality, comfort for the participants, battery life, software stability, and user friendliness for the operating staff.
Both groups of patients had the opportunity to ask questions after receiving the education. They subsequently filled out a questionnaire composed of questions about their pre-hospital education, their understanding after our education, and their experience with the VR.
2.4. Outcomes
The questionnaire assessed the quality of both pre-hospital and in-hospital education using a five-point Likert scale, where 1 indicated “very satisfied” and 5 indicated “very dissatisfied.” The scale was designed to mirror the grading system used in the Czech education system, making it more intuitive for the participants.
The questionnaire also included four multiple-choice questions to evaluate the participants’ understanding of the procedure. These questions focused on key aspects of the pacemaker implantation process, such as:
- Type of anesthesia used during the procedure (local anesthesia, general anesthesia, or sedation)

- Location of the pacemaker pocket (left or right side of the chest)

- Potential complications associated with the procedure (infection, bleeding, lead dislocation, or pneumothorax)

- Whom to contact in case of complications after the procedure (general practitioner, cardiologist, or hospital emergency department)



An Educational Impact Score was calculated based on the number of correct answers to these four questions, with a maximum possible score of 4 points.
Additionally, the subjective experience of the VR video was examined using two closed-ended questions:
- “Did the video help you to reduce your anxiety levels before the procedure?” (Yes/No)

- “Was watching the VR video a positive experience?” (Yes/No)



These questions aimed to assess the potential benefits of VR education in reducing pre-procedural anxiety and improving patient satisfaction.
2.5. Adverse Effects
Participants were educated about potential adverse effects of the VR (dizziness/vertigo, disorientation, and falls) and signed the consent form. They were seated in a quiet area to watch the video and were advised not to stand up either during the educational video or shortly after its finish to prevent falls.
2.6. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 29.0 (Armonk, NY, USA: IBM Corp.). The primary outcome was the quality of education, with secondary outcomes including knowledge retention, anxiety reduction, and patient satisfaction. These outcomes were pre-specified in the study protocol. Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test, which was chosen for its non-parametric nature suitable for our data distribution. Categorical variables were assessed using Chi-square tests to determine the association between them. Fisher’s exact test was utilized for educational-impact scores, where small sample sizes may affect the accuracy of the Chi-square test.
Baseline characteristics of the study population were presented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables and as counts (N) and percentages (%) for categorical variables. The quality of pre-hospital and in-hospital education was evaluated using a five-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating the highest quality and 5 the lowest. Knowledge retention was assessed using four multiple-choice questions, and an Educational Impact Score (ranging from 0 to 4) was calculated based on the number of correct answers.
To further analyze the factors influencing educational outcomes, patients were divided into two subgroups based on their Educational Impact Scores: a limited-comprehension group (scores 1–2) and a higher-impact group (scores 3–4). Differences in age, gender, and education type between these subgroups were investigated using the Mann–Whitney U test for age and Chi-square tests for gender and education type. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a p -value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Baseline Characteristics
One hundred and fifty participants were enrolled into the study; all of them were Caucasian. They were randomly selected to receive the conventional education ( n = 75) or the VR education ( n = 75). All the enrolled patients completed the education prior to their procedure. None of the patients from the VR group had previous experience with this technology. The baseline characteristics of our cohort (age and sex) were balanced after randomization and can be found in the Table 1. The median age was 76 (IQR 70–83), with no significant age difference between the two subgroups. The cohort was 57.3% male. The VR group and the conventional group consisted of 41 men and 34 women and 45 men and 30 women, respectively.
3.2. Quality of Pre-Hospital Education
Formal education by a referring physician prior to an admission was satisfactory in both groups; most patients reported either Mark 1, as the best score (63.3%), or Mark 2 (31.3%). There was only one patient who reported Mark 5, as the worst score or if no education was given. There were no statistical differences between the two groups, as per the Table 1.
3.3. Quality of In-Hospital Education
A majority of patients reported better understanding after being educated in the hospital (97.3%), with no significant difference between the two groups (96% vs. 98.7% in the VR and conventional group, respectively). The quality of hospital education was evaluated; 85.3% of patients rated it as the best, Mark 1, and the rest of the results can be found in Table 2. From the VR group, 86.7% of participants reported the quality of education (VR video) as the best. In the conventional group, 84% of patients rated the education as the best. There was no significant difference in the evaluation of education between the two groups.
3.4. Subjective Experience
Ninety two percent of patients ( n = 69) reported reduced levels of anxiety after watching the VR video and seeing where the procedure was going to take a place. The rest of the patients stated they were not anxious in the first place. All the patients reported that watching the VR video was a positive experience. None of the patients complained of vertigo or other intolerance of the VR, and no adverse effects were reported. Four patients mentioned they had problems hearing some parts of the audio content.
3.5. Assessment of Knowledge
Successful answers to the knowledge-based questions were examined by calculating the Educational Impact Score, as shown in Table 3. There was no significant difference between the two groups of patients. Sixty-five patients had all four questions answered correctly (43.3%), with 33 (44%) and 32 (42.7%) patients in the VR group and the conventional group, respectively. Three correct answers were given by 36 patients in the VR group (48%) and by 33 patients in the conventional group (44%). A score of zero was achieved by only one patient in the conventional group.
A subsequent analysis was made by dividing the patients into two subgroups based on their achieved score: a limited-comprehension group (score 1–2) and a higher-impact group (score 3–4). There was a significant difference in age between these groups, with a median of 82 years of age in the limited-comprehension group, and a median of 76 years of age in the higher-impact group (see Table 4). No significant difference was found in the distribution of gender or the type of education received (conventional vs. VR enhanced). Out of the four questions, patients most frequently failed to answer the question about whom to contact in case of complications; only 48.7% of patients answered correctly (52% in the VR group and 45.3% in the conventional). With the other answers, the results were more balanced, as shown in Table 5. There appears to be a trend towards higher percentages of correct answers in the VR-enhanced group; however, the results did not reach statistical significance.
4. Discussion
Patient education plays a key role in peri- and post-procedural cooperation, adherence to recommendations, recovery, and overall experience of the procedure [20,21]. Pre-procedural education was linked to better managing the actual procedure [20,21]. Printed brochures with pictures and diagrams, educational videos, and information booklets have been used over the last years to facilitate understanding and help with education [20]. The retention of information by patients is, however, unsatisfactory [1]. Virtual reality is proving to be a good way to increase patients’ interest, engagement, and retention of information [11].
Our study aimed to assess both subjective experience and knowledge retention in patients undergoing implantation of a permanent pacemaker as an elective day case. These patients are typically older, as conduction system disorders requiring pacing are more frequent at higher ages [22]. Our population, therefore, is much older compared to other VR studies, where the mean age ranged from 40 to 65 years [11]. Despite this, no adverse effects were reported within our participants. Patients generally reported a positive experience of the VR, consistent with the results of Huygelier et al. [17], who assessed the attitudes of older populations towards novelty technologies. Unfortunately, there are no studies focusing on educating an older population with the use of VR. The only available studies focus on mood improvement [19] or improvement of patients’ mobility and balance [18]. A majority of patients from our cohort stated that VR helped them to understand the procedure better. The scores for perceived quality of education did not differ between the VR and the conventional group. As stated before, VR should enhance knowledge retention [11], and better results should be, therefore, expected in the VR group when assessing the results of the knowledge-based questions. This was confirmed in studies using VR education before cancer treatment [23], cardiothoracic surgery [24], or atrial fibrillation ablation [15]. This was, however, not the case of our study; additionally, although there was a trend towards a higher educational score in the VR group, the results were not statistically significantly different. It is possible that, with a higher number of participants, this difference would reach statistical significance. One explanation for failure in reaching significant difference could be the fact that the older population, in general, can have problems retaining given information and understanding [25]. This theory is supported by the fact that patients with lower scores (the limited-comprehension group) were generally older than patient with higher scores, the difference was statistically significant. The other explanation could be that the questionnaire, with multiple choice answers, was not comprehensible enough for the older population. Impaired hearing might be another explanation why patients’ comprehension was not better, as four patients in our cohort reported they had difficulties hearing the audio properly. Gender did not significantly influence the results and no further reports were found where the influence of gender on VR education was studied.
As the results suggest, there was one question that was problematic: Whom should you contact in case of complications? Even though the importance of contact information is highlighted in our educational materials, and was specifically emphasized in the VR video, almost half of our participants answered incorrectly. The fact that this information is given at the very end of the video, where attention of participants could be fading, might be one of the explanations. This analysis provides valuable feedback for our practice, suggesting we need to stress this information even more.
It is reassuring that a majority of patients received good education by the referring physician, as we sometimes experience patients who claim to have received no or very little education in the pre-hospital setting. The VR group’s perception of in-hospital education quality was not statistically different from that of the conventional group, supporting the non-inferiority of VR education.
VR has been used to reduce anxiety for a long time, especially in pediatric patients [6]. We believed that even adults experience anxiety when coming into a new hospital for an unknown procedure. We therefore filmed our 360° video in the hospital setting (admission suite, cardiac suite, and theatres) to enable patients to get to know the hospital better prior to the procedure. Real doctors and nurses star in the video to make the experience as authentic as possible. This is to help patients overcome their fear of unknown. By explaining the procedure in detail, with the use of animations and pictures, we target the fear of the procedure that stems from a lack of knowledge. As anxiety might be one of the factors contributing to poorer outcomes, and one of the factors complicating the surgery for the operator [2,4,26], we tried to reduce it with the VR video. As 92% of participants reported reduced anxiety after watching the video (with the rest stating they were not anxious), the results suggest that this might be a promising modality for future.
Finally, a physician-led education is time consuming and, therefore, expensive. VR may offer an alternative way to educate patients not only prior to procedures, but also about different treatment plans [8,10,12]. VR education has the potential to save significant costs and free up valuable physician time. Further studies designed to assess the non-inferiority of VR education in larger groups of patients are, however, necessary to enable widespread use of this modality.
Based on our study’s results and the experience gained during the implementation of VR-based patient education, we offer the following recommendations for healthcare providers considering the use of VR in educating older adults:
- (a) . Duration of VR sessions: Our study used a 6-min video, which was well-tolerated by the participants. We recommend keeping VR sessions concise, preferably under 10 min, to maintain patient comfort and minimize the risk of adverse effects such as disorientation or fatigue.

- (b) . Age-appropriate content and delivery: When creating VR content for older adults, it is crucial to use clear, easily understandable language and age-appropriate visual elements. We found that a combination of narration, simple text, and engaging graphics helped in effectively conveying the educational message. Moreover, we suggest using a 360° video format, as it provides an immersive experience without the need for complex interaction, which may be more suitable for older individuals.

- (c) . Minimizing adverse effects: To prevent potential side effects, such as motion sickness or disorientation, we advise ensuring that patients are seated comfortably and securely during the VR session. Continuously monitor patients for any signs of discomfort and be prepared to pause or terminate the session if necessary. Designing the VR environment with minimal rapid movements and transitions can also help reduce the risk of adverse effects.

- (d) . Ongoing patient engagement and feedback: Regularly seek feedback from older patients regarding their VR education experience. Encourage them to share any difficulties, concerns, or suggestions for improvement. Use this valuable input to refine and optimize the VR content and delivery methods iteratively, ensuring that the educational intervention remains tailored to the specific needs of older adults.

- (e) . Future studies should explore the adaptation of VR content for various languages and cultural contexts to increase the generalizability of the findings. In our study, the VR content was tailored to our hospital setting, featuring our staff, theatres, and cardiac suite, which may have helped patients feel more familiar and comfortable. However, we acknowledge that our participant population was predominantly Czech-speaking, and the content was not designed to cater to a diversity of linguistic or cultural backgrounds. Adapting the VR content to include multiple language options and culturally relevant elements could broaden its applicability and effectiveness in diverse patient populations.



This single-center study has several limitations. One of them is a small sample size, as many patients requiring PPM implantation come in as acute cases and, therefore, cannot be included in the study. This can increase the risk of a Type 2 error. We have not studied the effect of participants’ education on the results; this could have an impact on patients’ understanding of the educational information and the questions, and knowledge retention might also be better with prolonged education [25]. Only immediate follow-up was performed as a part of this study, and the lack of further long-term follow-up to assess potential complications is another limitation. The study could not be blinded due to the character of the intervention. With the questionnaire assessing subjective experience and comprising unvalidated knowledge-based questions, this study could be subject to inherent bias. Due to the tertiary nature of our center, with patients coming from a broad area, it would be challenging to conduct a longitudinal follow-up.
VR education proves to be feasible even in the older population, but attention needs to be given to ensuring adequate audio so that even patients with hearing loss can understand. We had a good experience with the 360° video format, which seemed to cause none of the significant side effects that watching 3D videos can sometimes have. However, even in the setting of virtual reality, important information needs to be emphasized to ensure its retention. VR appears to be a valuable tool to reduce procedure-related anxiety. At the current level, the widespread use might be challenging; however, as the technology evolves very quickly, VR education might replace standard education in the coming years. But, finally, while we believe that VR education may have limited direct influence on peri-procedural complications, it could potentially impact wound healing and lead dislocation.
5. Conclusions
Education, prior to the implantation of a PPM, with the use of VR was shown to be non-inferior to conventional education led by a physician. It is feasible even in an older population without frequent adverse effects. VR education relieves patients’ anxiety and improves their understanding of the procedure. There was a trend towards higher educational scores in the VR education group. The results suggest that age was the major determinant of knowledge retention in the older population undergoing implantation of a PPM. Regardless of the type of education, older patients achieved lower scores when their knowledge was assessed after education. Important information needs to be stressed to ensure its remembering, even in the setting of virtual reality.

Note: The table delineates the distribution of Educational Impact Scores, which range from 0 (no impact) to 4 (highest impact), for patients in both the VR and conventional education groups following the pacemaker procedure study. The counts (N) and percentages (%) illustrate the proportion of patients achieving each score level. The p -value reported is based on Fisher’s exact test, which is utilized here due to the small sample size in some score categories. A p -value of 0.873 indicates there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of educational impact at the 0.05 significance level.

Note: This table contrasts the baseline characteristics of patients grouped by their level of educational outcome after pacemaker education: those with limited comprehension (scores of 0–2) and those with a higher impact (scores of 3–4). The median age and interquartile range (IQR) are reported. A significant difference in median age was observed between the two groups ( p = 0.025), indicating that older patients tended to have lower educational-impact scores. No significant differences were found in the distribution of gender ( p = 0.245) or the type of education received (VR vs. conventional, p = 0.29), suggesting these factors did not influence the likelihood of being in the limited-comprehension group vs. the higher-impact group within this sample. These results highlight the importance of age as a potential factor in the effectiveness of educational interventions and suggest that further research may be needed to tailor pacemaker education to older patients.

Abstract: Following the 2015 adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the United Nations, ‘sustainability’ has become an increasingly powerful term for justifying development interventions. Based on two years of a pre-existing collaborative relationship with a community in semi-rural Nepal, ethnographic observations, focus group discussions, and in-person and virtual interviews during the Covid-19 pandemic, I provide an understanding of what ‘sustainability’ means and entails to grassroots development actors in this context, reclaiming and reshaping the meaning of ‘sustainability’ and providing shared lessons with other communities in the Global South. I argue that discourses about sustainability have become localized and rooted in people’s historical, cultural, and intersectional experiences and transnational ideas and discourses. People creatively leverage these experiences and discourses in understanding and critiquing ‘development’, expressing collective discontent, and mobilizing for change. For example, people whom I work with understand ‘sustainability’ as the sociocultural reproduction of agricultural work in the context of mass out-migration. I also argue that sustainability efforts entail translocal learning and resources. Translocality comprises both rootedness in localities, and mobilities/social connections across multiple geographical scales. On the one hand, there are emerging challenges following regional and global processes, which require translocal resources to address. On the other hand, there are emerging forms of transnational connections, such as diasporic connections, circular or returning migration, transnational NGO networks, and international friendships, which provide additional avenues for mobilizing resources for community development efforts. In addition, I argue that ‘sustainability’ entails not ‘status quo’, but ‘transformations’ underpinned by intergenerational learning and knowledge about the local environment. Youth out-migration and decontextualized school education often disrupt intergenerational knowledge transfer. ‘Sustainability’ efforts can be supported by various sharing and learning opportunities among multi-generational, diverse actors within communities, to help promote inspiration, meaning-making, and knowledge adaption for change-making. Lastly, I argue that sustainability efforts entail mobilizing resources toward local development. ‘Sustainability’ efforts depend on the resources available, existing constraints and opportunities, and the effectiveness of their mobilization. Community actors strategically develop local resources, including human, material, financial and natural resources to achieve self-sufficiency, without rejecting external resources, including funding, technologies, ideas, and market participation.

Abstract: Anatomists are facing a new generation of learners who will study and work in a technology-rich environment. Indeed, digital technologies are tremendously changing how information and knowledge are communicated and retrieved. However, it remains unclear whether an anatomy assessment can be designed to promote contextual learning through integrating a digital communication strategy. To investigate this, assessment methods were diversified in the first-year neuroanatomy and third-year regional anatomy curricula through implementing a multimedia human anatomy group assignment integrating digital literacies and scientific communication. Through completing this multimedia assignment, students demonstrated their anatomy knowledge transfer using a range of approaches. The main mode of presentations chosen in the two anatomy units were non-animated video presentations ([approximately] 50%), animated video presentations ([approximately] 30%), storyboards ([approximately] 10%), podcasts ([approximately] 3%), and filmed videos ([approximately] 3%). A 5-point Likert scale learning and teaching survey was conducted for a total of 195 undergraduate health science students to evaluate students' perception of this group assignment. The majority of students (70-80%) strongly agreed or agreed that the multimedia group assignment helped their teamwork skills. Students who produced animated videos significantly outperformed those who adopted the non-animated presentations during the end-of-semester theory examination (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that an anatomy group assignment integrating digital literacy and scientific communication is an effective assessment strategy associated with a positive learning experience and outcome. This inquiry-based assignment promotes learning through assessment, allowing students to not only consolidate and extend anatomy knowledge but also developing effective digital communication skills, providing new insights into non-didactic anatomy assessments.

Abstract: The sustainable development of products is of great interest to both industry and consumers due to various factors, such as anthropogenic climate change and the scarcity of resources and materials. In response to this, the simul + Living Lab Sustainable Additive Manufacturing in Saxony (SAMSax) has been established as a physical experimental space aimed at improving the sustainability of products. This includes selecting resource-efficient manufacturing processes, using renewable materials, reducing energy consumption during use, and designing for recyclability. The innovative approach of the lab also integrates an open innovation process, involving present and potential stakeholders. Collaborating closely with stakeholders from industry, academia, and government fosters idea generation, provides solution approaches, and enhances acceptance and practical implementation. Methodologically, SAMSax focuses on upcycling organic and inorganic residues as well as by-products from industry and agriculture, reintegrating them as innovative components in industrial production using additive manufacturing (“3D printing”). The Living Lab provides a space for networking and active knowledge transfer through digital technologies, analyses, and collaborative developments, enabling the testing and evaluation of innovations in a real-world environment. Several potential waste materials suitable for additive manufacturing and new products have already been identified. In addition to industrial residues, materials, such as paper and wood dust; industrial by-products, such as sand; and agricultural residues, like harvest residues, are being analyzed, processed, and tested using additive manufacturing in the laboratory. In this way, SAMSax can contribute to an integrated and consistent circular economy. The research aims to demonstrate that the SAMSax Living Lab is a crucial driver of innovation in the field of additive manufacturing. Furthermore, this study contributes by presenting the Living Lab as an application-oriented research environment, focusing on innovative implementation in small- and medium-sized enterprises.

Full text: 1. Introduction
Contemporary challenges, such as resource scarcity and environmental impacts, re-quire a paradigm shift in material production and utilization [1,2]. Sustainable product development, gaining significant interest from both industries and consumers [3], employs various approaches to enhance product sustainability. These include resource-efficient manufacturing processes, low energy consumption during the usage phase [4], and design-for-recycling principles [5,6]. These approaches emphasize the need for disseminating new knowledge through real-world laboratories (Living Labs), to create a substantial impact [7,8]. Living labs serve as open and collaborative innovation networks, providing diverse research opportunities for stakeholders in research, government, business, and society [9,10] by including novel approaches to sustainable development [11].
This article introduces the simul + Living Lab SAMSax (Sustainable Additive Manufacturing in Saxony), addressing challenges in sustainable additive manufacturing in Saxony. Additive manufacturing is seen as a technological innovation for recycling-oriented circular business models [3,5]. With the rising importance of resource-efficient production and waste minimization, the SAMSax Living Lab pioneers research and implementation of sustainable additive manufacturing principles. The joint pilot project involving three technical universities in Saxony (Technical University (TU) Bergakademie Freiberg, Chemnitz University of Technology, and Dresden University of Technology) aims to facilitate networking and knowledge transfer through digital technologies, establishing a Living Lab as a physical experimentation field.
SAMSax Living Lab aims to establish a low-threshold access to expertise and infrastructure for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Saxony that are engaged in digitally integrated manufacturing. In the region of Saxony, the business landscape is predominantly composed of small- and medium-sized enterprises, which lack the innovation capacity (both in terms of manpower and financial resources) often seen in larger corporations. According to data from the Saxon State Agency for Civic Education, in 2017, there were 147,736 businesses with fewer than 10 employees, accounting for 89.5% of the total, and only 618 companies with more than 250 employees, constituting just 0.4% [12]. This places the proportion of large enterprises in Saxony at 4% in comparison to the national average [12]. The relative scarcity of larger firms, with their well-funded research departments, translates into limited capacities in both financial and human resources for the development of use cases. Furthermore, Saxony faces specific challenges in the field of sustainable additive manufacturing, as there is a lack of a global solution for material optimization to minimize energy consumption and waste [13]. To address these challenges, the SAMSax Living Lab aims to leverage the experimental spirit of Saxon entrepreneurs, offering them a low-threshold access platform through the Living Lab to benefit from the scientific insights available from Saxony’s technical universities in the field of future technologies. In this context, the term “low-threshold access” in SAMSax primarily refers to the provision of an easily accessible and user-friendly resource for all stakeholders, enabling them to acquire relevant information and knowledge without significant barriers at any time. This is achieved, among other things, by developing and providing easy-to-understand materials on the topics of the Living Lab using a knowledge management platform. A detailed discussion of this platform is provided in the subsequent sections of the paper.
SAMSax involves diverse SME partner groups and an extensive network of local authorities and societal actors. The lab generates value and sustainability by combining digital technologies, additive manufacturing, and materials produced sustainably and regionally from residues. By charting, educating, and connecting local Saxonian material providers, technology providers, and end users, unused material (waste) streams can be utilized for high-margin parts in a local industrial environment. Value is generated by both creating a market for residue material and upcycling the lower-cost material into high-value parts. Reducing waste and replacing “fresh” or fossil-sourced by “upcycled” or bio-based material contributes to sustainability and helps to progress towards a circular economy. The laboratory also addresses critical issues of digitization, circular economy, and climate change, providing impetus for attractive, future-proof work. One of the challenges lies in identifying and addressing the management of waste materials. One focus is on the reuse and recycling of waste substances instead of their energetic use (burning it). This keeps them in the cycle longer, thus supporting ecological change. Such a transformation necessitates a comprehensive approach to effectively contribute to environmental protection. Another challenge involves lowering the carbon footprint by recycling and using bio-based instead of fossil-based materials. Integrating these sustainable materials into industrial processes can lead to significant progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, digitalization plays a crucial role in managing knowledge transfer and networking among involved stakeholders. The integration of digital technologies is crucial to fully exploit the potential of the SAMSax Living Lab. Optimizing processes, communication, and collaboration not only enhances efficiency but also lays the foundation for sustainable development. Overall, these challenges are closely interconnected and require an integrated approach. The holistic consideration of reuse, recycling, the use of sustainable materials, and digitalization within the framework of SAMSax offers a promising perspective for sustainable development in various industrial contexts. In relation to additive manufacturing technologies and future work, this implies, for example, aligning the properties of residual materials with suitable part properties/demands. Additionally, additive manufacturing technologies can be further developed to process residual materials, e.g., with varying/fluctuating properties. Binder/matrix combinations can be developed and processed for the production of high-strength parts that are either biologically degradable or bio-based.
The SAMSax Living Lab’s approach is based on recycling locally generated bio-based, natural, and industrial residues, such as paper dust or wood dust, and by-products, like textile and agricultural residues (e.g., coffee husks) from both industry and agriculture. These materials are reintegrated into industrial manufacturing using additive manufacturing processes. While traditional additive manufacturing relies on plastics, resins, ceramics, and specially processed metals [14,15], SAMSax explicitly integrates natural or industrial residues. The insights from in-depth material analyses serve as the foundation for developing and realizing new applications and products or prototypes as well as small series. This innovative and sustainable approach aligns with the concept of a comprehensive and consistent circular economy, contributing to a necessary shift toward sustainability and ecological transformation in Saxony’s industry and beyond.
To connect potential residue suppliers, users, and multipliers, digital technologies serve as enablers. Some manufacturers specialized in certain products often exhibit a knowledge gap in the realm of potential materials. They frequently lack awareness of available bio-based material alternatives and the constructive or mechanical adaptations necessary for their efficient use. At the same time, Saxony has many potential material providers of renewable raw materials, which often occur as by-products and could in principle serve as raw materials for production. However, a problem in this supply chain is that many of these suppliers are unaware that their previously disposed of by-products could be economically and ecologically valuable. As there has been little communication between the manufacturers and suppliers, the potential for synergies between the two groups remains largely untapped. A key element in unlocking this potential is the digital networking of suppliers and users. For this reason, the SAMSax Living Lab utilizes digital technology in the form of an online platform, which in this context serves not only as a source of education and information but also facilitates networking and exchange among the various stakeholders. Furthermore, multipliers support the project by linking their own networks with that of SAMSax and utilizing the online platform. Thus, a systematic exchange of information and knowledge is to be established, enabling the optimal use of existing resources and promoting new, sustainable production methods in Saxony.
The SAMSax Living Lab is methodically embedded in an open innovation process involving current and future stakeholders. This ensures an optimal representation of industrial needs and solutions from the planning stage. With careful guidance, the establishment of an innovation community comprising providers, manufacturers, and researchers becomes possible and is supported by the tailored presentations of scientific requirement analyses from the participating universities.
In summary, the overarching goal of the project is to establish the SAMSax Living Lab for the future testing of regional value creation from locally available, renewable resources (ideally residue materials) for additive and digital manufacturing technologies. Within the scope of regional value creation, the utilization of locally available residual materials in Saxony represents a key approach for generating added economic value. This is achieved through the reuse, processing, or transformation of materials that would otherwise be classified as waste. Such an approach not only supports and strengthens companies in the region, such as the theatre in Chemnitz, through their projects and initiatives in the Living Lab, but also contributes to the promotion of a circular economy. This manifests in a reduction in the need for new raw materials and a minimization of waste. Moreover, this strategy offers the potential to develop new business models, especially in small- and medium-sized enterprises, which in turn can contribute to the economic diversification of the region in Saxony. As previously emphasized, this process also enhances innovative capabilities. This is achieved through the development and implementation of suitable technologies for the utilization of residual materials, which offer not only ecological but also economic benefits. This also involves building a digital knowledge base and networking capability to simultaneously promote circular economy and regional economic growth.
This article clarifies the conceptual framework and aims of the SAMSax Living Lab. It delves into the preliminary outcomes of the project, such as the analysis of residual materials. Additionally, it includes a case study derived from a theatrical context. The article is structured as follows. After the introduction, the Section 2 discusses additive manufacturing, Living Labs, and the digitalization of the circular economy. Subsequently, the Section 3 details the individual steps of the innovation process concerning the SAMSax Living Lab. The Section 4 highlights the current research status and achieved milestones in the Living Lab’s innovation process. Finally, the paper concludes with an outlook on planned activities in the SAMSax Living Lab.
2. Additive Manufacturing, Living Labs, and Digitalization of the Circular Economy
Additive manufacturing processes, also known as 3D printing, have undergone significant development in industrial production in recent years. This innovative technology allows for the layer-by-layer construction of three-dimensional objects, enabling not only the realization of complex structures but also the efficient production of customized products [16,17]. In the context of the challenges posed by sustainable development, concepts, such as Living Labs and the digitalization of the circular economy, are increasingly coming into focus. Living Labs serve as test environments for the practical testing of new technologies and concepts, providing the opportunity to experiment with innovative ideas in the real world and analyze their impact on the environment, economy, and society [18]. In the context of additive manufacturing, Living Labs can contribute to optimizing the integration of this technology into existing production processes and understanding its implications for the circular economy [19]. The digitalization of the circular economy involves the use of digital technologies to efficiently utilize resources, reduce waste, and promote a closed-loop system of products and materials [20,21]. Specifically, 3D printing plays a crucial role in this context as it enables the production of customized products, minimizing resource waste [13,22,23,24]. In this evolving landscape of production technologies, additive manufacturing processes, Living Labs, and the digitalization of the circular economy offer new perspectives for a sustainable and efficient industrial future. However, it is important to note that there are also some disadvantages associated with additive manufacturing technologies. In accordance with [25], the disadvantages are listed as follows. The layered structure of additively manufactured components introduces several complexities, such as anisotropy, where the properties of the material can vary depending on its orientation. Additionally, the surface quality of the finished product is highly dependent on the alignment of these layers, often resulting in a stair-step effect that can affect the aesthetic and functional aspects of the component. One significant drawback of this method is its time-consuming nature, which often renders it uneconomical for producing large batch sizes. A further issue in the field of additive manufacturing is the lack of standardized methods for testing these uniquely produced components. In terms of cost, additive manufacturing typically incurs comparatively high material costs, especially for common AM materials. This contrasts with the use of residues, which can be more cost-effective. Moreover, the machinery involved in additive manufacturing is not only expensive but also requires skilled labor to operate, which is still in limited supply. The high machine costs add a significant barrier to entry for many companies, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises. Additionally, the scarcity of skilled labor capable of operating these machines and optimizing the manufacturing process further limits the growth and adoption of additive manufacturing technology [25].
2.1. Additive Manufacturing
According to [26], additive manufacturing (AM) is a process that produces components from 3D model data by binding material together, usually layer by layer, in contrast to subtractive and forming manufacturing methods. AM therefore belongs to the main group of manufacturing processes known as primary shaping [27].
Additive manufacturing processes are an integral part of the product creation process. They are used in industry to manufacture prototypes, tools, and, to a growing extent, end products. AM offers several benefits, including the ability to produce complex geometric shapes, develop prototypes quickly and cost-effectively, enable customization and reduce production times. In addition, additive manufacturing technologies are also used as a cross-sectional technology in many industries, including aerospace, healthcare, automotive, architecture and more, due to its versatility and innovation possibilities [26].
Additive Manufacturing with Sustainable Materials Based on Residues
Additive manufacturing using sustainable materials based on residues represents an innovative approach that translates the fundamental principles of the circular economy into the realm of AM technologies. The concept of the circular economy is based on key principles, such as waste prevention, the development of circular products and materials, and the regeneration of natural systems [28]. In this context, the use of sustainable residual materials plays a crucial role. Such materials, for example, agricultural by-products or waste from production processes, can be reintegrated into the production cycle instead of being discarded. This enhances resource efficiency, as resources are maximized before being considered waste. The circular economy also emphasizes the importance of closed loops, in which products and materials are kept in circulation longer through reuse, refurbishment, reprocessing, and recycling [28]. Sustainable residuals can be incorporated into these loops, thereby reducing the need for new raw materials and minimizing environmental impacts. Utilizing residuals in various applications helps to decrease overall waste generation and move away from the conventional linear economic model of take, use, and dispose. The use of sustainable residuals, often as by-products of other processes, reduces the need for natural resources. This supports the preservation of ecosystems, protects biodiversity, and lessens the environmental impacts associated with resource extraction.
Due to its additive nature, AM has thus far offered a relatively underexplored potential in research for utilizing, e.g., biogenic residues existing in particle or fibred form, presenting opportunities to save fossil resources and reduce CO 2 emissions. Materials, such as grass, wood, or (fruit) kernel flour, represent a promising and addressable resource group. TU Bergakademie Freiberg and the Dresden University of Technology are working towards transforming these residues, conventionally destined for disposal or, at best, energetic utilization (combustion), into high-quality, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective products and components, with extensive trials already conducted on bio-based materials [29,30,31,32].
For instance, investigations on Miscanthus grass show values such as 1.5 g/cm 3 solid density, 0.12 g/cm 3 bulk density, and 0.16 g/cm 3 component density after 3D printing, with strengths comparable to polystyrene. These are material properties that could not previously be achieved in the field of AM with standard materials and processes. In combination with AM, these sustainable materials therefore offer material properties with which completely new applications can be conceived (acoustic and thermal insulation and mechanical damping applications). Similar results are expected for straw and flax. Crucial to this process is a particle size distribution suitable for manufacturing/build-up, which must be adjusted, along with an appropriate powder-binder system. Research interest in this field is expanding [33], with literature reviews indicating the suitability of new materials derived from biomass waste or by-products for extrusion-based additive manufacturing processes [34], and agricultural bio-wastes, such as wood, fish, and algae cultivation residues [35], being deployable in additive manufacturing processes. Additionally, wood residues from conventional wood processing can be used as material for 3D printing, upgrading low-value residues often used as fuel or even disposed of in landfills [36]. The described residues generated during the process are utilized for both assessing printability and material characterization [34], as well as for prototype manufacturing. On the other hand, these materials find applications in various sectors, including “[…] “buildings and architecture”, “furniture”, “equipment”, “accessories”, “prosthetics and medical”, “packaging, and “bioengineering” […]” [34]. Based on the existing literature overview [34], the application domains of “building and architecture”, “furniture”, and “equipment” are particularly prevalent. Within these domains, diverse products are manufactured as a proof-of-concept through 3D printing. Furthermore, efforts are made to develop sustainable, recyclable, and biodegradable 3D printing filaments from the generated bio-waste [35]. These residues also find utility in various industries, including the production of bone tissue [37], food packaging [38], construction [39], wastewater treatment plants [40], the electrical industry, the manufacture of pharmaceutical components [41], the furniture industry [42,43], and the automotive industry [44].
The concept of using renewable resources in the SAMSax Living Lab extends not only to the actual powdered building materials but also includes the necessary binders. Currently, polymeric materials, like polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), are used in the lab. Furthermore, alternative substances, such as gelatin or binders based on tree resin/rosin, are being used and developed. By using bio-based binders, renewable raw materials can be utilized to create fully bio-based and most often biodegradable parts. In addition, the binders mentioned are recyclable and can be recycled as well. SAMSax is committed to advancing and executing tailored machine concepts designed for the utilization of natural raw materials. These concepts are engineered to withstand and adjust to the diverse array of properties inherent in such materials. Operating at the intersection of material science, machinery, and technology, SAMSax particularly focuses on applications demanding good biodegradability and, consequently, a short service life.
This promising approach of the SAMSax Living Lab has the potential to offer both ecological and economic benefits. On one hand, materials that are usually considered waste can be utilized as valuable resources. By reusing and reintegrating these residues into industrial production, the living lab demonstrates that waste quantities can be reduced, and limited resources can contribute to efficient utilization. Consequently, the ecological footprint of small- and medium-sized enterprises can be minimized. Additionally, the reuse of residues in additive manufacturing can also provide economic advantages by minimizing waste disposal costs, while simultaneously creating new business models through the production of sustainable products. A further advantage of additive manufacturing with sustainable residues is the reduction in costs for AM materials. Another advantage is the potential for local use of AM technologies. This local application translates into lower transportation costs and shorter delivery times, making it a more responsive and agile manufacturing method. Additionally, the local use of AM reduces dependency on international markets. Moreover, additive manufacturing can provide a competitive advantage by producing sustainable products. In today’s environmentally conscious market, the ability to manufacture goods that are sustainable, both in terms of the materials used and the manufacturing process, can differentiate a company from its competitors. Additive manufacturing with sustainable residues fosters innovation in material science and manufacturing technology. The search for suitable residues, their analyses, and transformation necessitate solutions, contributing to the development of new materials and manufacturing processes. SAMSax Living Lab’s objective is to strengthen the circular economy, where materials are not only used from extraction to disposal but circulate in a closed loop. Depending on the material used and its associated binder, the customized products can be recycled and reprinted after fulfilling their purpose.
2.2. Living Labs
In recent years, Living Labs have gained increasing importance as an innovative research methodology [9,11,45]. These interdisciplinary experimental spaces enable the practical exploration of complex societal challenges and the development of solutions in real-world environments [11,46]. Living Labs are particularly well-suited for addressing and understanding challenges in innovation development by directly involving stakeholders in experimentation [18]. These labs are conceived as platforms for collaboration among various participants from research, government, industry, as well as citizens working together to seek solutions and innovations for specific problems or questions [9,10,11,18,47]. The concept of the Living Lab was first documented by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a methodology capturing, validating, refining, and creating prototypes for complex solutions in different and evolving real-life contexts [48]. Over time, various definitions of Living Labs have been proposed [49]. According to [47,50], a Living Lab encompasses four key activities: (1) analysis of context and user behavior as well as identification of cultural, legal, technical, and market-specific conditions; (2) collaborative development of innovations by bringing together users and developers; (3) conducting experiments within real usage scenarios; and (4) evaluating products and services in actual environments [47,50]. Living Labs for sustainable development aim to promote environmentally friendly innovations in production and consumer systems by involving users and stakeholders [47]. They are viewed as instruments to support the transition to a society based on the principles of the circular economy, bio-based approaches, and environmentally friendly practices [11]. While sustainability has gained global significance, many Living Labs do not have this topic in their focus [9]. This is surprising as they could address sustainability issues by prioritizing the use of environmentally friendly processes and materials to minimize social and economic impacts [51].
The SAMSax Living Lab (see Figure 1) is designed to pursue and implement this approach. In this context, SAMSax is a lab made accessible to the general population by science. Experimental work takes center stage, with a particular focus on extending into the digital realm. The goal is to collaboratively test and analyze residues that can be transformed into new applications using additive manufacturing processes.
As mentioned earlier, the SAMSax Living Lab aims to facilitate a sustainable and ecological shift in the industry of Saxony. The lab focuses on the recycling of biobased, natural, and industrial residues and by-products from both industrial and agricultural sources, reintegrating them into industrial manufacturing through additive manufacturing processes. This innovative and sustainable approach enables a comprehensive and consistent circular economy. The innovation of the Living Lab lies in the development and expansion of additive manufacturing processes specifically for printing with residues as well as the general analysis of the feasibility of using residues as potential materials for various applications.
Another aspect, the circular economy, is considered in the SAMSax Living Lab from both a machinery and material perspective to foster progress. The use of renewable resources as alternatives to established conventional materials offers relevant approaches that could actively reduce waste and CO 2 -emissions, supporting climate protection (sustainability). However, the different properties of these materials require adjustments in manufacturing and processing techniques as well as components. This presents a significant knowledge gap that is also addressed in the Living Lab.
Furthermore, many waste emitters are unaware of the potential of their residues. This gap can be bridged by digital technologies that connect, educate, and support stakeholders. Digital technologies can also add value to new products, ensuring complete traceability or facilitating recycling. In the SAMSax Living Lab, all interested stakeholders can initially test their own best practice example at SAMSax free of charge before establishing the expertise within their own companies.
In summary, it can be said that SAMSax is contributing to climate goals by showing options for climate- and resource-friendly industrial production. Since it simultaneously addresses key manufacturing technologies, it is of great importance for the state of Saxony, which is defined by small- and medium-sized enterprises. The topic of sustainable AM is not only to be implemented in prototypes and lighthouse projects, but broad educational and further training programs will be performed. As one expected outcome, sustainable AM will be applied in SME and industry both for ecologic and economic benefit. In addition to the implemented and published individual projects, a further education and networking platform is to be developed, which will enable easy uptake of the results by industrial users.
2.3. Digitalization of the Circular Economy
The convergence of digital technologies and sustainability has initiated a transformation that not only improves the efficiency and accuracy of resource utilization but also opens up new possibilities for waste stream management and the promotion of a circular economy [52,53]. Digitalization plays a crucial role as a driver of the circular economy by increasing the transparency and intelligence of products and resources. It enables, for example, monitoring of locations, conditions, and availability of assets [20]. The term “digitalization” describes the connection between people and objects as well as the merging of the physical and digital worlds through information and communication technologies [54]. Digitalization will be a key driver of innovation in the coming decades, enabling not only new, intelligent market services but also revolutionizing entire value systems [55]. The focus is particularly on the importance of digital innovations, i.e., products or services that arise or are supported by digital technologies [56].
Digital technologies are important for improving circular economy practices by providing solutions for resource optimization [57]. The use of digital technologies, such as intelligent devices, big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI), allows companies to implement the principles of the circular economy more effectively. These technologies facilitate the maximization of product reuse, reduction of energy waste, and conservation of capital [57,58]. A critical aspect of this is the capacity of digital technologies to monitor and manage the entire lifecycle of a product, leading to more efficient restoration and recycling of products, components, and materials.
The deployment of smart manufacturing systems, supported by digital innovations, not only optimizes business resources but also promotes necessary changes in corporate governance and legislation to realize an effective circular economy [57]. Additionally, a framework for intelligent circular economy aids in translating circular economy strategies into specific digital technology requirements. This enhances resource efficiency and productivity in manufacturing companies, contributing to a more sustainable mode of operation [58]. Overall, digital technologies enable a more precise and efficient implementation of the circular economy, offering both ecological and economic benefits.
For the SAMSax Living Lab, the comprehensive establishment of a circular economy based on local residues is considered a crucial aspect to increase regional value creation through extensive digitalization. However, to ensure the sustainable implementation of a circular economy, it is important to consider specific requirements such as minimizing waste and pollution and maximizing the lifespan of products and materials. One challenge lies in the increased coordination of material and information flows as well as the networking of suppliers and users. Furthermore, it is crucial to effectively generate, collect, process, and provide relevant information about the material composition of products, their usage behavior, and their fate in the waste system. Digital applications, such as product passports, resource mappings, and consumer information, can help to close these gaps and make the paths of products and materials traceable [59]. One such example from a very different domain is the introduction of blockchain-based tracking systems for different food groups, pioneered by Carrefour and Nestlé to enable consumers to trace origins and ingredients of products like mashed potatoes, milk and baby formula [60]. In the research by [61], which examines the role of blockchain technology (BCT) in the context of circular economy practices and its impact on the organizational performance of companies, the results indicate that BCT has a significant and positive influence on circular economy practices. Specifically, the study supports the notion that the integration of BCT into business processes enhances circular economy practices, thereby contributing to the promotion of sustainability. BCT makes a substantial contribution by providing a high level of security, ensuring transparency, and improving traceability throughout the entire product lifecycle, which positively affects the efficiency and effectiveness of circular economy initiatives [61].
Within the Living Lab framework, the networking of manufacturers and suppliers, as well as cross-sector collaboration within Saxony, is intended to serve as the basis for numerous regional economic cooperation. This is to illustrate that even smaller companies can actively shape future manufacturing. The digital core components in the SAMSax Living Lab include a knowledge management platform on topics such as residue processing, circular economy, sustainability, and additive manufacturing processes; a database for material and application information; and an integrated networking option among the involved stakeholders.
3. Innovation Process
The initiative of the SAMSax Living Lab to promote regional value creation through innovations faces significant challenges. A central task is to distill complex scientific concepts of the circular economy into formats that can be effectively conveyed to businesses in Saxony. This transfer is intended to be realized through an open innovation process. Traditionally, the innovation process has been viewed as a predefined sequence of stages encompassing idea generation, selection, development, introduction, dissemination, and distribution [62]. According to [63], the concept of open innovation is defined as an approach that promotes targeted knowledge exchange within and outside an organization, aimed at enhancing the internal innovation process and simultaneously expanding the markets for externally applied innovations. This process is founded on the principle that companies, in their pursuit of technological advancement, should and can rely on both external and internal ideas as well as market strategies within and outside the organization. Specifically, within the framework of the SAMSax Living Lab, the open innovation process is employed to place a stronger emphasis on collaboration and networking among stakeholders. The primary goal is to develop, evaluate, and translate ideas into innovative applications within the Living Lab, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. This approach underscores the importance of cooperative development and implementation of solutions in a practical, experimental environment. Following the framework proposed by [64] (p. 9) and the early phases of the innovation process based on [65], the innovation process for the SAMSax Living Lab (see Figure 2) is defined as follows:
Step 1–Idea Generation and Evaluation: In the first step, fundamental approaches for processing and utilizing residues are developed in collaboration with representatives from science, politics, business, and society. This is achieved through moderated events in the Living Lab, as well as local engagement in the region with multipliers and businesses. The initial idea generation took place during the project’s kick-off event. This event aimed to introduce the project and its concept. An interactive workshop was conducted to extract the participants’ expectations for the SAMSax Living Lab, intending to implement them throughout the project. Three central questions were the focus of the workshop and were addressed from various perspectives. The first question delved into the expectations of the associated project stakeholders. Participants were encouraged to discuss benefits, opportunities, challenges, expectations, and ideas. The second question was about the attitude of the stakeholders towards sustainability. Topics of discussion were the importance of sustainability, the need for action, risks and concerns, and available resources. The third question targeted collaboration with SAMSax. Responses were documented, categorized, and summarized based on [66].
In a subsequent user workshop, specific ideas, such as sustainable lightweight panels or custom art, were developed for potential applications using the Six Thinking Hats method [67]. The generated ideas were discussed by participants from various perspectives. Currently, these ideas are being examined in the SAMSax Living Lab for implementation and feasibility using suitable residues and the corresponding additive manufacturing processes.
Simultaneously, a knowledge management platform is established to facilitate long-term networking of business groups beyond the project duration. The promotion of the SAMSax community concept and moderation aims to maximize the potential of this online offering and actively foster collaboration among different companies. The results from the idea generation phase are prepared for knowledge transfer, enabling continued discussion and utilization within a broad network.
Step 2–Concept Design: In the second step, concrete concepts for the processing and utilization of various types of residues are developed in collaboration with knowledge holders in additive manufacturing and the circular economy. Expert focus groups identify specific use cases that demonstrate potentials and application areas for the circular economy community. These use cases are also made accessible to the network through knowledge transfer. Additionally, specific criteria are defined in expert focus groups to assess the success of a concept or prototype. These criteria contribute to defining and evaluating the effectiveness of the developed concepts in the context of the circular economy. This involves evaluating economic factors, such as quantity, cost, and transportation (proof of market), as well as technological aspects, including feasibility and potential for the circular economy (proof of technology). The developed concepts or use cases are then prototypically implemented in Step 3.
Step 3–Prototype: In the third step, a promising use case is prototypically implemented. This circular economy process is experimentally tested in the Living Lab under real conditions without being integrated into a company’s production workflow. The flagship project aims to demonstrate an idealized process in terms of manufacturing, processing, and utilization to all involved SAMSax stakeholders, serving as a model for additional use cases. The innovative nature of the SAMSax Living Lab initiative suggests that it should achieve high visibility, serving as a best practice example for future similar projects or initiatives. SAMSax is initiated through the established online platform, with SAMSax project partners providing proactive support to answer questions and overcome challenges. The results of the Living Lab are published in project profiles on the knowledge management platform to make them accessible to a broad audience of businesses. Through this documentation, other companies recognize the possibility of easily repurposing residues, helping to break down barriers and highlighting that participating companies can derive economic benefits from the circular economy by actively contributing to the value chain.
Step 4–Testing to Product: Subsequently, the identified use cases undergo a comprehensive testing phase and are iteratively developed both in terms of material and process aspects. After successful testing, standardization and normalization are sought to facilitate seamless integration into real production environments. Each step of the process is reviewed and assessed according to pre-defined criteria (see Step 2) using guideline interviews and checklists based on the Stage-Gate process with the following stages: scoping, build business case, development, testing and validation, and launch [68]. This approach enables ongoing assurance of goal achievement and supports continuous improvement of the identified process steps.
4. Research Status of the SAMSax Living Lab
The following section describes the research status achieved in the SAMSax Living Lab based on the predefined steps in the innovation process. It highlights significant developments and insights achieved within the experimental space over one year (1 September 2022 to the present).
4.1. Residues for Additive Manufacturing
4.1.1. Differentiation of the Term “Residual Material” from the Term “Waste”
The European Waste Framework Directive defines waste as “any substance or object which the holder disposes of, intends to dispose of or is required to dispose of ” [69]. On this legal basis, a distinction is made between waste for recovery and waste for disposal. The term “waste for recovery” includes residual materials [69]. Residuals are substances or materials that are generated or left over from treatment and processing operations. Residues are therefore not the primary objective of the production process. In this context, they are often referred to as production residues. Residues can come from a variety of sources, including industrial and agricultural processes. They can therefore be of both organic and inorganic origin.
4.1.2. Technological Analysis of Residual Materials
As part of the project, regionally produced organic and inorganic residues are being technologically analyzed for use in AM processes. To date, the SAMSax Living Lab has received and recorded more than 30 different residual materials from small- and medium-sized enterprises. To date, the following materials have been analyzed for possible use in AM processes:
- ABS regenerate;

- Beech and birch wood;

- Carpet residues;

- Chaff straw;

- Coffee husks and coffee grounds;

- Cotton fluff;

- Folding chips;

- Fermentation residues;

- Glass fibers;

- Jeans dust;

- Leather dust;

- Mineral-wood mixtures;

- Miscanthus grass;

- Paper dust;

- Sanding dust;

- Stone residues (mineral chippings, high-grade chippings);

- Waste from grain cleaning;

- Wood from spruce and poplar;

- Wood shavings.



Information about the residual materials is collected by means of a residual accompanying note. This documentation is crucial for the prototypical construction of the SAMSax database (SAMSaxDB). This includes information on availability, the residual value of the material, disposal costs, and the toxicity and flammability of the materials. Coffee husks represent a type of analyzed residual material, arising as a by-product during the roasting process of coffee beans. The relevant data collected for this material are presented in Table 1.
The technological analysis of the residues focuses on the potential use of the residues in various additive manufacturing processes. Promising AM processes include material extrusion (MEX), fused filament fabrication (FFF), and binder jetting (BJT). Relevant property tests are performed prior to the actual processing. In this context, particle size distribution, residual moisture determination, and image analysis of residual materials are of particular importance for additive manufacturing processes.
4.1.3. Determination of Residual Material Moisture
A moisture analyzer is used to determine the moisture content of the residue. A small quantity of 10 g of the residue to be tested is first weighed on the crucible in the measuring chamber. The chamber is then heated to 105 °C, and the loss of weight due to evaporation of the residual moisture is recorded in parallel. The measurement is stopped when equilibrium is reached or the weight loss falls below a critical threshold. The moisture content can be determined to within 0.01%.
For use in binder jetting or fused filament fabrication, residual moisture levels of less than 10% are generally intended. If the residual moisture content is above 10%, the particles must be pre-dried before application-oriented processing. In the case of the coffee husks already mentioned (see Figure 3), the residual moisture content is 8.33%. This means that the coffee husks are generally suitable for use in binder jetting or fused filament fabrication. The residual moisture content of the other materials analyzed is also below 10%. This means that these residual materials are generally suitable for AM processes.
4.1.4. Determination of the Particle Size Distribution
The sieve fractionation method according to DIN EN 933-1 [70] is used to determine the particle size distribution of residual materials. Depending on the material to be analyzed, a sieve tower is composed of 12 sieve stages, the fineness of which increases from top to bottom. The gradation is 5.6 mm, 4.0 mm, 2.8 mm, 2 mm, 1.4 mm, 1 mm, 0.71 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.355 mm, 0.25 mm, 0.18 mm, and 0.125 mm. Approximately 160 g of the air-dried residue to be analyzed is placed on the top sieve of the sieve tower and agitated for 15 min on a vibrating sieve (amplitude: 0.6 mm). The residue in each sieve insert is then weighed and documented so that the sieve passage can be read and a particle size distribution corresponding to the different sieve fineness can be obtained. The sieving is performed twice for each material to obtain a representative result.
The particle size distribution of the coffee husks (see Figure 4) shows a clear increase in the cumulative particle size distribution from a diameter of 0.71 mm. Only about 8% of the coffee husks are smaller than 0.355 mm. Therefore, only a small proportion of the particles would be suitable for binder jetting, where particle sizes below 300 µm are required. However, crushing (here: grinding) and subsequent sieving of the particle fractions is an option to make these residues accessible for binder jetting. Due to the nature of the coffee husks, grinding was performed using a granulator. Given their brittle nature, only a small amount of energy was required for grinding. Regarding an application in the FFF process or material extrusion, it depends on the nozzle characteristics of the 3D printer and the application. Both coarser and finer particles can be used.
All analyzed screen fractions and their usability in AM processes are systematically recorded in a residue database. The database is being continuously expanded, particularly with regard to the general printability of the materials and their mechanical properties (compressive strength, tensile modulus of elasticity, tensile strength) after printing in the various additive manufacturing processes.
4.2. Production-Related Development of Additive Manufacturing
In order to effectively utilize additive manufacturing for processing residual materials, it is crucial to identify suitable processes or process categories. Certain processes are specifically tailored to handle distinct material groups. For instance, material extrusion using a thermal reaction (MEX-TRB) is particularly well-suited for pure or filled plastic filaments. However, the use of filled filaments presents a challenge, as end-of-life parts manufactured from these materials typically cannot be directed towards traditional recycling. Instead, they must be directed towards energy recovery. In the SAMSax Living Lab, a concerted effort is made to mitigate this scenario. The primary objective is to maintain materials within sustainable cycles, prioritizing alternatives, such as composting, and only resorting to energy recovery in the final stages. When referring to cycles, we encompass existing waste streams (such as paper or glass) or the internal cycles specific to the respective company.
The binder jetting and material extrusion methods using pasty materials share a significant advantage concerning residual materials. Generally, any material can be employed as long as particle properties, including particle size distribution, moisture content, particle shape distribution, etc., meet the necessary criteria. While there are alternative additive manufacturing processes that, in theory, could also accommodate residual materials, the selection of compatible material groups is restricted. Currently, in the SAMSax Living Lab, these other processes are not under consideration, and the focus is solely on the two mentioned processes.
The SAMSax Living Lab has machines for almost all process categories according to ISO 52900 [26] in order to be able to produce the desired prototypes for every SME in Saxony.
Basically, two approaches are pursued in the Living Lab from an AM perspective:
- Preliminary tests with the processed residual materials.

- Prototype parts for partner companies (use case).



The preliminary tests are designed to assess the basic processability and printability. For this purpose, the same binders are used for both processes to produce identical test specimens. Machine parameters may need to be adjusted to suit the materials. For the binder jetting process, 15 wt.% polyvinyl alcohol is used as the powder binder, and 15 wt.% alginate is used for MEX with pasty materials. Five cylinders of 20 mm diameter and height are first produced as test specimens. The specimens are used to determine the density, shrinkage, and compressive strength of the material. The aim is to make the properties of the test specimens comparable.
If a residual material is judged to be highly suitable and its use for prototypes seems reasonable, further tests are performed for shrinkage in the x, y, and z directions, and tensile strength is also determined using shortened tensile test specimens.
Below is a list of residual materials that have already been successfully printed in the SAMSax Living Lab. The residual materials are assigned to the processes that are suitable for printing with the following residual materials:
Binder Jetting (BJT)

- Chaff straw;

- Miscanthus grass.


Material Extrusion (MEX)

- Coffee husks;

- Cotton fluff;

- Glass fibers;

- Jeans dust;

- Leather dust;

- Wood from spruce and poplar;


Binder Jetting (BJT) and Material Extrusion (MEX)

- Beech and birch wood;

- Coffee grounds;

- Paper dust.


As an illustration, the procedure and outcomes of an initial test are outlined, utilizing residual wood dust from spruce and poplar, along with 15 test specimens. Material extrusion (MEX) with pasty material was employed as the process, and a binder of 15 wt.% alginate was added. Water was then introduced to form a pasty mass with approximately 80% moisture content by kneading the powder. The experiments were conducted using a self-modified Ender S3 with a Zmorph extruder. The design closely resembled that of Rosenthal (2023) [71], with the exception of the optimization of die geometry for improved flow properties of the test specimens. Parameters for production included a nozzle diameter of 4 mm, a layer height of 1.5 mm (initially 1.3 mm), extrusion width of 4.2 mm, a speed of 5 mm/s, and a concentric infill of 100%. Slicing was performed using PrusaSlicer 2.7.0 software.
After the production of the test specimens, identical to all other residues, the specimens are dried at 60 °C with 100% air circulation. Once mass stability is achieved (no later than 24 h), the samples are analyzed, as shown in Figure 5. The measured values are presented in Table 2.
Compared to grown solid spruce, which has compressive strengths of 38.7 N/mm 2 parallel to the grain and 4.0 perpendicular to the grain, the values for AM-produced samples are 10% lower than solid timber loaded perpendicular to the grain [72]. The reason for this lies in the nature of the material, i.e., grown fibers always have a higher strength than an artificially produced material made from short fibers. The density of spruce varies greatly and is 0.4–0.62 g/cm 3 depending on the location [73]. The density of printed parts is approximately 50% lower.
The properties attained in the initial tests, coupled with the favorable processability of the residual material and the achieved print quality, pave the way for the continued utilization of the residual material in prototype production.
The SAMSax Living Lab has the potential to scale up manufacturing processes. Next to small test rigs for material development, large additive manufacturing machines are in procurement to enable demonstration of scaled-up applications. Binder jetting is then possible up to more than one cubic meter in volume. Another very promising process to date is material extrusion with pasty materials, as is already being used industrially in building construction with concrete. Currently, paste extrusion is possible to 0.4 m 3 at one-meter height.
To realize prototypes for companies, the initial step involves defining the product requirements. The second step is to identify the suitable material, additive manufacturing process, and post-treatment to attain the necessary properties. Only in the third step is the prototype produced. An illustrative example of prototype realization involves the use of wood dust derived from spruce and poplar.
One specific application in mind is the creation of props for the theater. Historically, props were manually crafted by stage sculptors based on specific concepts, often employing materials such as polystyrene foams and epoxy resins. The theater industry is now seeking more sustainable materials that ideally can be recycled after their operational life (often lasting only one season) and repurposed into new props. Another crucial consideration is that some theaters frequently utilize digital stage sets, have the capability to generate computer-aided design (CAD) drawings in-house, and possess access to 3D scanners. The availability of 3D data is essential for 3D printing, as it serves as a prerequisite for generating machine codes (g-codes) from these 3D objects.
The implementation of the use case is underway for theater workshops in Chemnitz, Saxony. The chosen prop is the Karl Marx monument, situated in Chemnitz and standing at a height of 7.1 m. The 3D data are captured using the “Polycam” 3D scanner app (version 3.2.12) and converted into machine code at a scale 1:50 using PrusaSlicer 2.7.0. The printing is done on a WASP 40,100 clay, employing an 8 mm nozzle diameter, 3 mm layer height (initially 2.5 mm), and an 8 mm extrusion width. After printing, the prototype is dried for two days at 60 °C with 100% circulating air.
The completed printed Karl Marx monument Is depicted In Figure 6, with a total mass of 128 g. Subsequently, the theater takes over the prototype for further refinement and design. The printed material allows for intriguing processing possibilities, and the pasty material (similar to that used for 3D printers) serves for levelling. The light-colored and suitably rough surface provides an opportunity for fine-tuning the color. If the prop is no longer required in the future, it can be transformed back into a new printable paste by dissolving it in water. The initial test prints have already been reproduced with the same characteristics, and the theater expresses great satisfaction. Future work includes optimizing the material and process as well as establishing the process directly within the theater.
4.3. Digitalization
To achieve the goal of reusing bio-based natural and industrial residues as well as by-products from industry and agriculture, SAMSax has prototypically implemented a central information database named “SAMSaxDB”. The software architecture is divided into a backend system that allows SAMSax staff to manage residue data and a frontend system that presents information to interested parties on various platforms (e.g., web browser or mobile phone) and makes it searchable. The SAMSaxDB backend is based on the open-source software PocketBase (version 0.20.7), which enables both the management of residue information and the fine-grained regulation of roles and rights concerning the display, modification, and deletion of residue information. Data storage is achieved through an integrated relational database. For the SAMSaxDB, the functionality has been extended so that a QR code is created for each analyzed residue, directly linking to detailed information that can be scanned, for example, from a mobile phone.
Furthermore, the web-based frontend is provided by the same server, simplifying deployment and software maintenance. An interesting aspect of this approach is that the extensibility of the base platform allows for the implementation of additional processes, such as a marketplace for residues. The primary goal of the SAMSaxDB frontend is to enable easy access to the data in the SAMSaxDB backend. Therefore, the frontend was primarily developed as a web application that accesses data in the backend via a REST API and presents it on the user’s device. The presentation of information is adapted to the respective device, meaning there are specific layouts for use in the browser on a computer or on a mobile phone. In the simplest form of interaction, the interested party only needs to scan the barcode on a residue container to receive all relevant information directly from the database (see Figure 7).
The frontend also allows residue database searches, either through free-text input or by setting category filters. The corresponding logic for processing search queries lies in the backend. This not only prevents unnecessary data transfer, e.g., to mobile devices, but also allows for capturing and scientifically evaluating interest trajectories in the SAMSax community over their search histories and using them for future functions, such as an algorithm for pricing residues.
In addition to the prototypical implementation of the SAMSaxDB, a knowledge management platform has been established that is accessible directly from the project website. The SAMSax Living Lab also serves as an innovation platform for the circular economy and has prepared a series of courses and videos covering crucial aspects of additive manufacturing and beyond. Currently, various 3D printing processes are in focus: binder jetting, fused filament fabrication, laser sintering, paste extrusion, and bath-based photopolymerization. The courses provide a brief introduction to the topic, describe the functioning of the AM process, and showcase different materials and binders as well as the processing and post-processing steps in the process. Additionally, the advantages and disadvantages of the process are explained. Videos are available for some additive manufacturing processes to better illustrate the concepts. The courses and accompanying videos offer a foundation and insights into different processes used within the SAMSax Living Lab. The knowledge management platform also plays a significant role in providing this knowledge to interested parties and involved stakeholders, contributing to the dissemination and application of this innovative technology. Furthermore, there is an opportunity to exchange and network with participants through the platform. Stakeholders can identify participants on the platform using the provided contact information and engage with them directly for any concerns. If individuals have specific questions or are uncertain, they can send a contact request to the SAMSax team. The staff of the SAMSax Living Lab will either respond to these inquiries directly or forward them to the appropriate companies within the network. The platform’s easy accessibility and online exchange not only save time but also reduce the need for personal meetings. This leads to a more efficient and faster coordination and networking among the participants.
5. Summary and Outlook
The current need to address resource scarcity and environmental impacts requires a shift in the approach to material production and usage. Therefore, there is a strong interest in sustainable product development. Various approaches, such as resource-efficient processes and material selection as well as low energy consumption, are in focus. These require the dissemination and development of new knowledge for effective implementation. The concept of a Living Lab provides a testing environment for resource-efficient systems where various actors can cooperate.
The SAMSax Living Lab presents an approach that deals with sustainable additive manufacturing in Saxony. This includes the recycling of organic and inorganic residues in industrial manufacturing, particularly using additive manufacturing processes for new applications. The Living Lab also aims to provide an easily accessible entry point for knowledge and infrastructure for SMEs in Saxony, combining digital technologies with additive manufacturing processes and transferring knowledge to all stakeholders through a platform.
Within the framework of the SAMSax Living Lab, over 30 different residual materials from regional small- and medium-sized enterprises have been collected and examined for their suitability for additive manufacturing processes. The central focus in the lab is the application of two additive manufacturing methods, binder jetting and material extrusion, to process the analyzed residual materials. This work presents initial findings on which residual materials are best suited for which process and demonstrates how they can be utilized in practical applications. A notable example is the use of residual materials at the Chemnitz Theatre for stage props, highlighting the diversity of potential applications. To facilitate effective exchange and networking among stakeholders, such as residual material suppliers, users, multipliers, and research institutions, a knowledge management platform has been established. This platform serves for information and knowledge exchange and is continuously being expanded. In addition, the SAMSax Database (SAMSaxDB) has been prototypically developed to provide stakeholders with detailed information about the analyzed residual materials and their specific properties. These integrated approaches contribute to fully exploiting the potential of residual materials in additive manufacturing processes, thus promoting sustainable and resource-efficient manufacturing practices.
Future steps in the concept of the SAMSax Living Lab involve expanding available residues through close collaboration with small- and medium-sized enterprises. Simultaneously, machines and binders in the SAMSax Living Lab are further developed to broaden the range of application possibilities with residues. Planned workshops and analyses in cooperation with involved stakeholders are expected to yield additional innovative ideas for applications, prototypes, and small series in various industries. The prototypical implementation of the SAMSaxDB will be expanded with new residues and detailed information and tested in practice. Additionally, new courses will be introduced, including other additive manufacturing processes, 3D printing with sustainable materials, the circular economy, recycling, and non-fossil-based filament materials. A primary goal is to expand collaborations with SMEs and institutions to promote comprehensive circular economies and support regional economic growth. The next phase of the established SAMSax Living Lab focuses on broad testing and implementation of the developed concepts in the economy of Saxony.
The SAMSax Living Lab makes a significant contribution to climate protection goals by demonstrating innovative paths for ecological and resource-efficient industrial production. Its relevance is especially high in the Free State of Saxony, a region heavily influenced by small- and medium-sized enterprises. In addition to developing prototypes and flagship projects, the project also encompasses comprehensive education and training programs. It is anticipated that the adoption of sustainable additive manufacturing technologies in small- and medium-sized enterprises, as well as in the broader industry, will bring not only ecological but also economic benefits. The future focus is on integrating the knowledge and expertise gathered in the Living Lab into the industrial landscape of Saxony. Companies are to be empowered to independently realize their projects using existing residual materials. The continuous development of the educational and networking platform as well as the database will make it easier for industrial users to adapt and practically implement the research findings.

Abstract: Anatomists are facing a new generation of learners who will study and work in a technology-rich environment. Indeed, digital technologies are tremendously changing how information and knowledge are communicated and retrieved. However, it remains unclear whether an anatomy assessment can be designed to promote contextual learning through integrating a digital communication strategy. To investigate this, assessment methods were diversified in the first-year neuroanatomy and third-year regional anatomy curricula through implementing a multimedia human anatomy group assignment integrating digital literacies and scientific communication. Through completing this multimedia assignment, students demonstrated their anatomy knowledge transfer using a range of approaches. The main mode of presentations chosen in the two anatomy units were non-animated video presentations (~50%), animated video presentations (~30%), storyboards (~10%), podcasts (~3%), and filmed videos (~3%). A 5-point Likert scale learning and teaching survey was conducted for a total of 195 undergraduate health science students to evaluate students' perception of this group assignment. The majority of students (70-80%) strongly agreed or agreed that the multimedia group assignment helped their teamwork skills. Students who produced animated videos significantly outperformed those who adopted the non-animated presentations during the end-of-semester theory examination (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that an anatomy group assignment integrating digital literacy and scientific communication is an effective assessment strategy associated with a positive learning experience and outcome. This inquiry-based assignment promotes learning through assessment, allowing students to not only consolidate and extend anatomy knowledge but also developing effective digital communication skills, providing new insights into non-didactic anatomy assessments.Anatomists are facing a new generation of learners who will study and work in a technology-rich environment.

Abstract: In 2016, the Canada-International HIV and Rehabilitation Research Collaborative established a framework of research priorities in HIV, aging and rehabilitation. Our aim was to review and identify any new emerging priorities from the perspectives of people living with HIV, clinicians, researchers, and representatives from community organizations. BACKGROUND In 2016, the Canada-International HIV and Rehabilitation Research Collaborative established a framework of research priorities in HIV, aging and rehabilitation. Our aim was to review and identify any new emerging priorities from the perspectives of people living with HIV, clinicians, researchers, and representatives from community organizations.We conducted a multi-stakeholder international consultation with people living with HIV, researchers, clinicians and representatives of community-based organizations. Stakeholders convened for a one-day Forum in Manchester, United Kingdom (UK) to discuss research priorities via a web-based questionnaire and facilitated discussions. We analyzed data using conventional content analytical techniques and mapped emerging priorities onto the foundational framework. METHODS We conducted a multi-stakeholder international consultation with people living with HIV, researchers, clinicians and representatives of community-based organizations. Stakeholders convened for a one-day Forum in Manchester, United Kingdom (UK) to discuss research priorities via a web-based questionnaire and facilitated discussions. We analyzed data using conventional content analytical techniques and mapped emerging priorities onto the foundational framework.Thirty-five stakeholders from the UK(n = 29), Canada(n = 5) and Ireland(n = 1) attended the Forum, representing persons living with HIV or representatives from community-based organizations(n = 12;34%), researchers or academics(n = 10;28%), service providers(n = 6;17%), clinicians(n = 4;11%); and trainees(n = 4;11%). Five priorities mapped onto the Framework of Research Priorities across three content areas: A-Episodic Health and Disability Aging with HIV (disability, frailty, social participation), B-Rehabilitation Interventions for Healthy Aging across the Lifespan (role, implementation and impact of digital and web-based rehabilitation interventions) and C-Outcome Measurement in HIV and Aging (digital and web-based rehabilitation health technology to measure physical activity). Stakeholders indicated methodological considerations for implementing digital and web-based rehabilitation interventions into research and practice and the importance of knowledge transfer and exchange among the broader community.

Abstract: Answer to the Call is an installation created by artist Taloi Havini as part of her exhibition The Soul Expanding Ocean #1. Commissioned by the TBA21 Academy, Havini joined a scientific expedition aboard the research vessel Falkor to map the Great Barrier Reef using sonar technology. The installation, consisting of a twenty-two-channel sonic landscape, explores the symbiotic relationship between sound and its surroundings. Havini draws on traditional knowledge from her birthplace, Buka Island, to create a dialogue between different ways of knowing. The installation features hydrophone recordings, traditional marine chants, words spoken in Havini's first language, and an original score by composer Ben Hakalitz. The work reflects on the intergenerational loss of knowledge about the ocean and highlights the importance of deep listening. The installation immerses visitors in a sonic environment that evokes the interconnectedness of ocean and life systems.

Full text: When the composer and music theorist Pauline Oliveros wrote her book Deep Listening: A Composer's Sound Practice (2005), she sought to bring to our attention the symbiotic relationship between sound and its surroundings. "As you listen, the particles of sound decide to be heard,"1 as she poetically put it. She defined "deep listening" as the heightened state of awareness that connects to all there is-the act of listening to more than one reality simultaneously.2
In 2021, the Brisbane-based artist Taloi Havini (Nakas Tribe, Hakö people) was commissioned by the TBA21-Academy, a contemporary art organization and ocean-focused research centre, to create an installation based on her experience aboard a research vessel called RV Falkor, as part of the Schmidt Ocean Institute's Artist-at-Sea program. Havini joined this scientific expedition, which was mapping the Great Barrier Reef off the Australian coast with state-of-the-art sonar technology. The resulting artwork, Answer to the Call (2021), was part of Havini's exhibition The Soul Expanding Ocean #1 at Open Space, TBA21 Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary's venue in Venice.
Attuned to Oliveros's notion of deep listening, Havini's twenty-two-channel sonic installation juxtaposes the varied temporalities and scales of the seas. Like much of her practice, Answer to the Call is deeply informed by the traditional knowledges of her birthplace, Buka Island, part of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea. For the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Islands, the ocean is a fact of life. As I-Kiribati and American poet Teresia Teaiwa points out, "We sweat and cry salt water, so we know that the ocean is really in our blood."3 Yet, for many from a younger generation, the "ability to read, connect, and treat the Moana (Ocean) are now minimally understood and mostly mediated through the use of modern instruments and western science."4 Reflecting this intergenerational loss of knowledge about the ocean, Havini's Answer to the Ce/Zdraws parallels between the use of sound to disseminate scientific information and the role of oral tradition, storytelling, and music in creating, sharing, and mapping Indigenous knowledges.
Hydrophone recordings collected aboard RV Falkor, traditional marine chants, words spoken in Havini's first language, Hakö, and an original score by the Bougainville composer Ben Hakalitz are collaged through an enveloping acoustic landscape. Envisaged as "a dialogue between these different ways of knowing,"5 Havini's work moves beyond Western empirical cartographic projects to delve into the layers of Indigenous traditions that intimately populate the seas with memory, tradition, and songlines. Her sonic environment submerged visitors in a constellation of pan flute, drums, and the humming sound of sea, wind, and waves. At Ocean Space, the soundscape was presented in a room filled with all-encompassing hues of indigo and cobalt, with a central aquamarine platform that mirrored the geological shape of Havini's native Buka Island.
"Within the sonic installation are textures of all kinds of sounds that relate to activities that take you on a journey across the oceans and below sea-level, right down to the twilight zone, and then back up into the atmosphere," Havini explains, "it's all about the interconnectedness of ocean/life systems."6 In Answer to the Call, she invokes forms of knowledge that inform our understanding of the world ocean and its ecosystems. In the spirit of Oliveros's endeavours, the work is a call to pay attention and listen to the harmonies and dissonance, and at times to the disorienting stories and histories that are intrinsically connected to the seas.
Seeing Havini's installation in Venice, I am reminded of my own experiences with the ocean. I have been scuba diving recreationally for a number of years, and it is a passion that always seems to hover between fear and fascination. I am equally mesmerized by the eeriness of underwater creatures and by the loss of control and enhanced awareness of my own body in water. Immersed in the three-dimensional liquidity of space, my body seems free from gravity, experiencing sometimes sensory overload and at other times a form of sensory deprivation. These experiences have not only been profoundly enriching, helping me reach a more nuanced and empathetic relationship with the ocean; they have also had a tremendous impact on the ways I engage with artists' practices. The profoundly disorienting effect of diving has also been a productive point of departure for the Santa Barbara-based English professor Melody Jue. In Wild Blue Media: Thinking Through Seawater (2020), Jue posits that diving has the potential to help us emancipate ourselves from what she calls "terrestrial bias,"7 which she describes as a tendency to prioritize a land-based perspective, often at the expense of a more nuanced and "liquid" understanding of the world. In this sense, "liquidity" is understood as an immersive experience of beingin-the-world; a horizontal way of knowing, in opposition to a vertical (or hierarchical) way of encountering our surroundings.8
This immersive and transformative potential of water has been of interest for many artists, notably Oliveros's work as a composer. Throughout her career, she developed a musical vocabulary rooted in the liquid qualities of sound. Water was not only an inspiration, but also became one of her mediums. Her 20-minute-long composition, Time Perspectives (1961), is one of her most important pieces from the 1960s and an early example of her acute interest in the sonic properties of water. Sporadically dispersed throughout the piece are the sounds of single droplets of water, sped up and slowed down. The presence of water, bubbles, droplets, and steam is palpable throughout the composition, for which Oliveros used a bathtub as a resonant recording device.9
Most famously, in 1988, Oliveros travelled to a disused water cistern north of Seattle, along with trombonist Stuart Dempster and singer Panaiotis (Peter Ward). The trio recorded music in the two-million gallon water tank employing trombone, didgeridoo, accordion, conch shells, voice, and pieces of metal. The watery echo of the cistern became the medium of their improvisation, whose resonant tones seem to slowly surface like waves. Oliveros titled the track "Deep Listening," a term that ended up becoming central to her practice for the following decades. She was passionate about the relationship between sound and space, and how sound travels through different mediums. In her own words, "we locate ourselves through detecting echoes and reflections, but we don't have it at a very conscious level... like a dolphin or a whale sounding in the ocean, sounding the spaces."10 From the early 90s, she started organizing her "Deep Listening Retreats" in New Mexico. Participants were invited to immerse themselves in the sounds of ecosystems through meditation, tai chi, and sonic collaboration.11 She later went on to collaborate with the nature-inspired musician, composer, and philosopher David Rothenberg. In August 2013, Oliveros, Rothenberg, and the singer Timothy Hill formed the Cicada Dream Band to record tracks that combined the vocalizations of a humpback whale, frogs, and birds, alongside Oliveros's live improvisation on accordion, Rothenberg's on clarinet, and chants by Hill.12
Reflecting on Oliveros's and Havini's practices, I am compelled to engage with underwater sonic landscapes that I encounter while scuba diving. To my human ears, the underwater soundscape feels blurry, or even womb-like. It is clear that the bodily disorientation that Jue reflected upon is also rooted in a potent sonic disorientation. What feels particularly poignant is the blasting sound of bubbles bursting and the mechanical frequencies of my regulator expelling air. The loudness of such sounds feels at odds with the subdued nature of movement underwater. A diving instructor once told me that my air bubbles are so loud as they burst at the surface that it disturbs sea creatures, leading many of them to avoid scuba divers. Perhaps surprisingly to our human ears, sound travels almost five times faster underwater than through the atmosphere. Many aquatic species rely on sound to find prey, avoid predators, guide their navigation, locate mates and offspring, and socialize with each other.13 However, ocean noise, or underwater noise pollution, derived from human activities, hinders the ability of marine animals to hear natural sounds in the ocean.
The complexity of underwater soundscapes has been the focus of the Norwegian sound artist Jana Winderen's practice. In February 2022, she presented her exhibition The Art of Listening: Under Water at the Lenfest Center for the Arts at Columbia University, New York. Conceived as a site-specific 360-degree spatial audio installation, the composition underscores how the vulnerabilities of ecosystems are compounded by the constant invasion of human-generated sounds in the underwater environment. A juxtaposition of recordings from various locations around the world, (including the Arctic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Indian Ocean), the sound piece was edited to highlight anthropogenic sounds. With a background in mathematics, chemistry, and fish ecology, Winderen is concerned with the constant disturbance of oceans and bodies of water by human activities-from industrial undertakings to military sonar, cargo and cruise ships, seismic air guns, personal watercraft, tankers, and fishing vessels-which cause underwater noise pollution that negatively impacts aquatic life.14
In an earlier work titled Energy Field (2010), Winderen's focuses on the Barents Sea, in a composition that incorporates the sounds of glaciers, crustaceans and fish. The Barents Sea, which is part of the Arctic Ocean, holds some of the world's largest populations of cod, herring and sea birds, but because of climate change, the region is opening itself up for further petroleum production. In the last decades, the oceans have become increasingly noisy due to human activities such as shipping, oil and gas exploration, and military sonar.15 This sound pollution affects the behaviour and communication of marine mammals and fish, and may cause longterm damage to their hearing.16 Yet, most of it remains largely unregulated. The anthropogenic sonic saturation of oceans was also a concern for Oliveros, whose foundation, the Deep Listening Institute, hoped to foreground Occupy Oceans, "a movement to demand protection for all ocean creatures, especially whales and dolphins, from man-made ocean roar."17 Attuned with the spiritual thinking underpinning her practice, she called for a "heightened awareness of the interconnectedness and respect for all things, from boson to black hole, from microbe to macrobe."18
Although Winderen's practice is more didactic than Havini's, they share an undeniable love for the bodies of water that are intrinsically part of human life, and a desire to draw attention to sonic landscapes that are inaudible to human ears. They both use sound, and field recordings, to conjure different modes of knowledge-making and to address the different scales of human impact on ocean worlds. By foregrounding the practice of deep listening, their acoustic compositions follow the pioneering path laid by Oliveros, as they attend to the entanglements of ecologies, stories, and histories that are essential for a nuanced understanding of the world's marine ecosystems. *

L'écoute en profondeurs
Marie-Charlotte Carrier
En écrivant le livre Deep Listening : A Composer's Sound Practice (2005), la compositrice et théoricienne de la musique Pauline Oliveros cherchait à attirer notre attention sur la relation symbiotique entre le son et son environnement. Elle l'a poétiquement énoncé ainsi : « Lorsque vous écoutez, les particules de son décident d'être entendues1. » Elle a défini l'«écoute profonde» comme un état de conscience accrue qui nous connecte à tout ce qui existe - l'écoute simultanée de plus d'une réalité2.
En 2021, l'artiste Taloi Havini (tribu Nakas, peuple hakö), basée à Brisbane, en Australie, a été mandatée par la TBA21-Academy, organisme d'art contemporain et centre de recherche sur les océans, pour créer une installation reposant sur son expérience à bord du navire de recherche océanographique Falkor dans le cadre du programme Artist-at-Sea du Schmidt Ocean Institute. Havini s'est jointe à l'expédition scientifique, qui cartographiait la Grande Barrière de corail au large de la côte australienne à l'aide d'un sonar à la fine pointe de la technologie. L'oeuvre qui en a résulté, Answer to the Call (2021), a fait partie de son exposition The Soul Expanding Ocean #1, présentée à Ocean Space, lieu de diffusion de TBA21 Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary, à Venise.
En harmonie avec la notion d'écoute profonde d'Oliveros, l'installation sonore à 22 canaux de Havini juxtapose les différentes temporalités et échelles des mers. Tout comme dans la majorité de ses oeuvres, Answer to the Call est profondément influencée par les savoirs tradi tionnels de son lieu de naissance, l'ile Buka, située dans la région autonome de Bougainville, en Papouasie- Nouvelle-Guinée. Pour les peuples autochtones des iles du Pacifique, l'océan fait partie de la vie. Comme la poète kiribato-américaine Teresia Teaiwa le fait remarquer, « nous transpirons et pleurons de l'eau salée, nous savons donc que nous avons réellement l'océan dans le sang3 ». Pourtant, pour de nombreuses personnes issues d'une génération plus jeune, « la capacité à lire Moana (l'océan), à entrer en relation avec lui et à le soigner est désormais très peu comprise et passe presque toujours par les instruments modernes et la science occidentale4 ». L'oeuvre de Havini reflète cette perte intergénérationnelle des savoirs à propos de l'océan en dressant des parallèles entre l'usage du son dans la diffusion d'informations scientifiques et le rôle de la tradition orale, des récits et de la musique dans la création, la transmission et la cartographie des savoirs autochtones.
Des enregistrements réalisés à l'aide d'un hydrophone à bord du Falkor, des chants de marins traditionnels, des paroles prononcées en hakö (langue maternelle de Havini) et une partition originale créée par le compositeur bougainvillais Ben Hakalitz sont assemblés dans un paysage acoustique enveloppant. Imaginée comme « un dialogue entre ces différents modes de connaissance5 », l'oeuvre de Havini va au-delà des projets cartographiques empiriques occidentaux pour plonger dans les strates de traditions autochtones qui habitent intimement les mers avec la mémoire, la tradition et les lignes de chanson. Son environnement sonore submerge les visiteurs et visiteuses dans une constellation de flute de pan, de tambours et de fredonnements de la mer, du vent et des vagues. À Ocean Space, le paysage sonore était présenté dans une pièce baignée par différentes teintes d'indigo et de cobalt. Disposée en plein centre, une plateforme bleu vert reprenait la forme géologique de l'ile Buka, d'où Havini est originaire.
« Dans l'installation, il y a toutes sortes de textures sonores qui se rapportent à des activités qui vous font voyager à travers les océans et sous le niveau de la mer, directement dans la zone crépusculaire, puis de nouveau dans l'atmos phère, explique Havini. C'est une question d'interrelation entre les systèmes océanique et vivant6. » Dans Answer to the call, elle évoque des formes de connaissance qui éclairent notre compréhension du monde océanique et de ses écosystèmes. Dans l'esprit des efforts menés par Oliveros, l'oeuvre est une invitation à prêter attention, à écouter les harmonies, les dissonances et, par moments, les histoires et les récits désorientants qui sont intrinsèquement liés aux mers.
En voyant l'installation de Havini à Venise, je me suis souvenue de mes propres expériences avec l'océan. Depuis plusieurs années, je fais de la plongée sous-marine de manière récréative ; c'est une passion qui semble toujours osciller entre peur et fascination. Je suis tout autant envoutée par l'étrangeté des créatures sous-marines que par la perte de contrôle et la conscience amplifiée de mon corps dans l'eau. Immergé dans la fluidité tridimensionnelle de l'espace, mon corps, qui semble libéré de la gravité, expérimente parfois une surcharge de sensations et à d'autres moments une forme de privation sensorielle. Ces expériences sont non seulement enrichissantes en m'aidant à développer une relation plus nuancée et empathique avec l'océan, elles ont également un impact considérable sur la façon dont j'aborde les pratiques artistiques. L'effet profondément désorientant de la plongée a aussi été un point de départ fécond pour Melody Jue, professeure d'anglais basée à Santa Barbara, aux États- Unis. Dans Wild Blue Media : Thinking Through Seawater (2020), Jue postule que la plongée a le potentiel de nous aider à nous émanciper de ce qu'elle nomme le « biais terrestre7 », qu'elle décrit comme une tendance à prioriser une perspective terrestre, souvent au détriment d'une compréhension plus nuancée et plus « liquide » du monde. En ce sens, la « fluidité » se comprend comme une expérience immersive d'être au monde ; une forme d'apprentissage horizontal, en opposition à une manière verticale (ou hiérarchique) d'aller à la rencontre de notre environnement8.
Ce potentiel d'immersion et de transformation de l'eau revêt un intérêt pour un grand nombre d'artistes, particulièrement Oliveros dans son travail de composition. Tout au long de sa carrière, elle a élaboré un vocabulaire musical ancré dans les caractéristiques liquides du son. L'eau n'a pas été qu'une inspiration, elle est aussi devenue un matériau. Time Perspective (1961), une composition de 20 minutes, est une de ses pièces les plus importantes des années 1960 et un des premiers exemples de son intérêt marqué pour les propriétés sonores de l'eau. Des sons de gouttelettes, accélérés et ralentis, sont dispersés sporadiquement tout au long du morceau. La présence de l'eau, des bulles, des gouttelettes et de la vapeur est palpable dans l'ensemble de la composition, pour laquelle Oliveros a utilisé une baignoire comme dispositif d'enregistrement résonant9.
En 1988, Oliveros s'est rendue au nord de Seattle avec le tromboniste Stuart Dempster et le chanteur Panaiotis (Peter Ward) afin de réaliser un enregistrement dans une citerne désaffectée. Le trio a joué de la musique dans la cuve d'une capacité de 7,5 millions de litres d'eau en utilisant un trombone, un didgéridou, un accordéon, des conques, leurs voix et des pièces de métal. L'écho aqueux de la citerne est devenu la matière de leur célèbre improvisation, dont les tonalités résonantes semblent faire doucement surface telles des vagues. Oliveros a intitulé la pièce « Deep Listening », un terme qui s'est retrouvé au coeur de sa pratique durant les décennies suivantes. Elle était passionnée par la relation entre le son et l'espace et par la façon dont le son se propage à travers différents matériaux. Elle l'évoque ainsi : « Nous nous situons en détectant des échos et des réflexions, mais nous ne le faisons pas avec un très grand niveau de conscience [...] comme un dauphin ou une baleine qui sonde l'océan, qui sonde les espaces10. » À partir du début des années 1990, Oliveros a commencé à organiser des « retraites d'écoute profonde » au Nouveau- Mexique. Les participant.es étaient invité.es à s'immerger dans les sons des écosystèmes grâce à la méditation, au taïchi et à la collaboration sonore11. Elle s'est plus tard associée au musicien, compositeur et philosophe inspiré par la nature David Rothenberg. En aout 2013, Oliveros, Rothenberg et le chanteur Timothy Hill ont formé le Cicada Dream Band pour enregistrer des pistes qui combinent des vocalises de baleines à bosse, de grenouilles et d'oiseaux à une improvisation en direct d'Oliveros à l'accordéon, de Rothenberg à la clarinette et de Hill au chant12.
En réfléchissant aux pratiques d'Oliveros et de Havini, je me vois obligée d'entrer en relation avec les paysages sonores sous-marins que je rencontre quand je fais de la plongée. Pour mes oreilles humaines, ceux-ci semblent flous, voire intra-utérins. Il est évident que la désorientation corporelle à laquelle Jue réfléchit est également ancrée dans une désorientation sonore puissante. Le bruit des bulles qui éclatent et les fréquences mécaniques de mon régulateur qui expulse l'air sont particulièrement poignants. L'intensité de ces sons semble contraire à la nature ténue du mouvement sous l'eau. Un instructeur de plongée m'a un jour dit que mes bulles d'air étaient si bruyantes, lorsqu'elles atteignaient la surface, qu'elles perturbaient les créatures marines, ce qui incitait nombre d'entre elles à éviter les plongeurs et les plongeuses. Pour nos oreilles humaines, il peut être surprenant d'apprendre que le son voyage presque cinq fois plus rapidement sous l'eau que dans l'atmosphère. De nombreuses espèces aquatiques s'appuient sur les sons afin de trouver des proies, d'échapper aux prédateurs, de s'orienter, de localiser des partenaires ou leur progéniture et de socialiser entre elles. Cependant, le bruit dans l'océan, ou la pollution sonore sousmarine qui découle de l'activité humaine, entrave la capacité des animaux marins à entendre les sons naturels de l'océan13.
La complexité des paysages sonores sous-marins est au coeur de la pratique de l'artiste du son norvégienne Jana Winderen. En février 2022, elle a présenté l'exposition The Art of Listening: Under Water au Lenfest Center for the Art de la Columbia University, à New York. Conçue comme une installation sonore spatiale 360 degrés réalisée in situ, la composition souligne la façon dont la vulnérabilité des écosystèmes est aggravée par l'invasion constante des sons générés par les êtres humains dans l'environnement sous-marin. Juxtaposition d'enregistrements réalisés à différents endroits dans le monde (notamment l'océan Arctique, la mer des Caraïbes et l'océan Indien), la pièce a été montée afin de mettre de l'avant les sons anthropiques. Avec une formation en mathématiques, en chimie et en écologie des poissons, Winderen est préoc cupée par le dérangement constant des océans et des étendues d'eau par l'activité humaine - des entreprises industrielles aux sonars militaires en passant par la marine marchande, les navires de croisière, les canons à air servant aux levés sismiques, les motomarines, les pétroliers et les bateaux de pêche -, source de pollution sonore sous-marine ayant des répercussions négatives sur la vie aquatique14.
Dans une composition antérieure intitulée Energy Field (2010), Winderen se concentre sur la mer de Barents, dans l'océan Arctique. Elle y incorpore des sons de glaciers, de crustacés et de poissons. La mer de Barents abrite certaines des plus grandes populations de morues, de harengs et d'oiseaux marins au monde. Cependant, les changements climatiques aidant, la région s'ouvre encore plus à l'exploitation pétrolière. Dans les dernières décennies, les océans sont devenus de plus en plus bruyants en raison des activités humaines telles que le transport, l'exploration pétrolière et gazière et les sonars militaires15. Cette pollution sonore affecte les comportements et la communication des mammifères marins et des poissons et peut causer des dommages à long terme à leur ouïe16. Pourtant, elle demeure en grande partie non règlementée. La saturation des océans en bruit d'origine anthropique était aussi une préoccupation pour Oliveros, qui, avec la fondation du Deep Listening Institute, souhaitait mettre à l'avant-plan Occupy Oceans, « un mouvement visant à exiger la protection de toutes les créatures océaniques, particulièrement les baleines et les dauphins, contre le grondement anthropique dans l'océan17 ». En accord avec la pensée spirituelle qui sous-tend sa pratique, elle appelait à une « conscience accrue de l'interrelation entre toutes les choses et à leur respect : du boson au trou noir, du microbe au macrobe18 ».
Bien que la pratique de Winderen soit plus didactique que celle de Havini, les deux artistes partagent un amour indéniable pour les étendues d'eau qui font partie intégrante de la vie humaine, ainsi qu'un désir d'attirer l'attention sur les paysages sonores inaudibles à l'oreille humaine. Elles utilisent le son et des enregistrements réalisés sur le terrain afin d'évoquer différents modes d'acquisition de connaissances et de prendre en compte, à diverses échelles, l'impact humain sur les mondes océaniques. En mettant de l'avant la pratique de l'écoute profonde, leurs compositions acoustiques suivent la voie pionnière d'Oliveros en ce qu'elles traitent des enchevêtrements des écologies, des récits et des histoires qui sont essentiels pour une compréhension nuancée des écosystèmes marins de la planète.

Abstract: ENG English ENG The transport sector is responsible for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions, mainly carbon dioxide (CO₂). Its emissions are the main driver of the worsening global climate change scenario. Finding feasible options to sequester this greenhouse gas is a great challenge for scientists, governments, and industry. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) are technologies that capture CO₂ directly or indirectly by transforming it into other products of interest. In this context, biological CO₂ conversion can be performed by photosynthetic microorganisms, such as microalgae and cyanobacteria, producing a wide variety of bio-based added-value products, such as third-generation (3G) bioethanol. However, the main obstacle to the spread of 3G bioethanol is economical, as it is still a recent and little-explored technology, lacking technical and scientific development for its production to become economically viable. Within this perspective, this work presents a patent-based mapping of current technological trends in 3G bioethanol production, which revealed that it is an emerging field with 171 patent deposits since 1979, with a tendency of at least 10 patents published per year in the last 15 years. The main drawbacks industries are focused on remain those from 2G bioethanol production, such as biomass hydrolysis. Therefore, with extensive cooperation between governments, scientists, and industries, it may be a matter of time before 3G bioethanol production becomes a reality. The presented data are expected to contribute to technical knowledge of 3G ethanol production, including the knowledge transfer from the academy to the industrial sector.

Abstract: ENG English ENG The abandonment of agricultural activity has multiple negative economic, environmental and social impacts in rural areas. As a consequence of different socioeconomic, political, environmental and technical drivers, this phenomenon shows an increasing trend in olive groves in disadvantaged and sloping areas. This paper analyses, for the case of sloping olive groves in Andalusia, the main olive-growing region in the world, the explanatory factors (abandonment factors) and alternatives to this abandonment, such as organic and conventional olive growing, as well as the explanatory factors of the adoption (adoption factors) of the best of these alternatives.The aim is to provide insights for the development of public policies to avoid or mitigate the negative effects of abandonment and to promote the adoption of the best alternative to abandonment. The results indicate that, as an alternative to abandonment, organic farming is a better option than conventional farming, from an economic, environmental and agronomic point of view. The surface area of olive grove fields is the main structural variable to be increased in order to reduce the risk of abandonment and to promote conversion to organic farming. This can be done through land consolidation, tax exemption measures for the purchase/sale of olive groves and the promotion of cooperatives. It is also important to promote the professionalisation of the sector, following the philosophy of the active/genuine farmer of the CAP, and to develop awareness programmes for olive grove managers focusing not only on the economic advantages of organic farming but also on the generation of public goods. Knowledge transfer is needed through traditional sources such as agricultural associations, and through more institutional and less used sources of information such as universities, public research bodies and technology centres, because of their public service vocation.

Abstract: Using the case study of a smart green blue roof pilot project in Greater Manchester, the authors have coded and analysed a series of semi structured interviews. We present our findings which are specifically focused on how 'smart' was understood by the multiple stakeholders involved in the project and how product complexity is managed when digital technologies are integrated into nature based solutions that are becoming more popularised in the construction sector. This integration of digital twin and sensor technologies with physical drainage products to create the next generation of smart green blue infrastructure, presents numerous challenges for organisations in the construction sector. We conclude that the need for smart systems of systems in this sector necessitates organisational change and new methods of knowledge transfer across organisations who work together to deliver the holistic physical and digital services to the client.

Abstract: The International Conference of Sustainable Blue Economy (ICSBE) 2022 was part of a series of conferences started in 2020 that stress more in small islands issue, this time with the topic of “Promoting Sustainable Blue Economy by Protection – Production Strategy”. This kind of conference is vital in increasing the awareness of researcher and decision makers to answer the dependency of economy and ecosystem, including climate change. This conference allows us to discuss methods in creating a sustainable blue economy that harnesses the potential of our oceans and seas to improve the lives of all, and leverages the most recent innovations, scientific advances, and best practices to build prosperity while conserving our waters for future generations. Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Science of Pattimura University has successfully organized ICSBE 2022 conducted online on 27 October 2022 in Ambon Indonesia; consider that the offline conference will need to have more financial support. Furthermore, we are grateful particularly to our Rector of Pattimura University, Prof. Dr. M. J. Saptenno, our Dean, Dr. Yoisye Lopulalan, the staff members of Fisheries and Marine Science Faculty for their contribution and support to make this conference happened. The objective of this conference was to provide mean to have lectures, researches, government and other stakeholders to present and publish their work. As many as 152 participants from different institution in Indonesia and few from abroad attended the event virtually through a zoom scheme. The invited speakers came from different parts of the world, two from Indonesia, one each from United States, Japan, United Kingdom and Australia. The keynote speaker, Leonardo A. A. Teguh Sambodo, Ph.D., is the Director of Industry, Tourism, and Creative Economy, Ministry of National Development Planning/Development Planning Agency of Indonesia. He was given 25 minutes for his presentation with the title Indonesia’s Blue Economy Development Framework and 20 minutes for discussion. The rundown meeting continued into two plenary sessions for the invited speakers includes discussion (Q&A) for 95 and 80 minutes respectively. There were 30 papers presented in five parallel sessions, each presenter was having in average 10 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for discussion. There was seven main topics in this meeting; namely fisheries and aquaculture, fishing technology, marine biodiversity and conservation, aquatic resource management, marine pollution and ocean health, fisheries socio economics, fisheries processing technology and ecotourism. We would like to thank all the participants for sharing their knowledge and experience, which we believe, will benefit as a catalyst for strengthening international cooperation on knowledge transfer. We also thank those who participate and help with the success of this conference. We look forward to meeting you at the next seminar. List of Organizing Committee are available in this pdf.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Family farmers are important actors to sustain food security and job generation in Brazilian rural areas. The National Program for Strengthening Family Farming (PRONAF) is the main public program offering microcredits to family farmers to foster sustainable production and reduce the poverty gap. While poverty and income inequality prevail in the Amazon, credits seem to target wealthier livestock farmers, and neglect smallholders engaged in crop production. This paper assesses the factors influencing the monetary amount of credit received at the regional level and argues that stable production systems and strong credit mechanisms could facilitate market access, knowledge transfer, and technology adoption. A spatial Durbin error model is utilized to analyze the factors determining the credit received while controlling for spatial correlations in livestock and agricultural systems in 103 microregions, composing the Brazilian Legal Amazon. To complement the quantitative estimations, we conducted 35 semi-structured interviews with key informants from technical assistance, scholars, and banks managers. Results suggest a geographical interdependence of PRONAF microcredit allocation, where wealthier farmers steadily access markets and credits. Microregions where commercial banks are present and with higher production values receive higher microcredits, strengthening the economic advantages of wealthier farmers located in those regions. Therefore, in order to improve credit allocation, political actions should focus on targeting poor and vulnerable farmers lacking social networks, stable markets and financial investments.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Research on the plant growth promoting microorganisms (PGPM) is increasing strongly due to the biotechnological potential for the agricultural, forestry, and food industry. The benefits of using PGPM in crop production are well proven; however, their incorporation in agricultural management is still limited. Therefore, we wanted to explore the gaps and challenges for the transfer of biotechnological innovations based on PGPM to the agricultural sector. Our systematic review of the state of the art of PGPM research and knowledge transfer takes Chile as an example. Several transfer limiting aspects are identified and discussed. Our two main conclusions are: neither academia nor industry can meet unfounded expectations during technology transfer, but mutually clarifying their needs, capabilities, and limitations is the starting point for successful collaborations; the generation of a collaborative innovation environment, where academia as well as public and private stakeholders (including the local community) take part, is crucial to enhance the acceptance and integration of PGPM on the way to sustainable agriculture.

How Machine Understands you and me: Naturally Learn and Generalize in Task-Oriented Dialogues

Author: Wu, Ting-Wei

Publication info: Wu, Ting-Wei. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/how-machine-understands-you-me-naturally-learn/docview/3275495135/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: With the recent progress of technological advances, research on conversation systems has exploded within computational linguistics, as seen by the rise of practical applications like Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, and Amazon Alexa. Unlike monological discourses, conversation systems explore how dialogue participants take turns to achieve mutual understanding and uphold coherence in a metacommunicative interaction pattern. This may include fragments that are less organized and disfluent, which can make regular methods which deal with independent sentences and examine the syntactic expressions for intention challenging. Modeling such dialogue is particularly challenging in task-oriented customer service settings, where dialogues require a higher level of abstraction to distinguish deterministic goals and acts that drive the conversation, as well as to maintain information states. These dialogue systems are required to maintain coherence and track the extent of information shared, which can be very different from written texts or chatbots used for amusement purposes. This is in contrast to chit-chat or search systems that have more casual and free-form interactions, which are generally less constrained by conversational goals and information states. Most Task-oriented Dialog Systems (ToD) systems rely on a sophisticated Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) process, which has seen significant progress in recent years due to the application of symbolic or statistical methods such as Deep Learning [1]. However, it is important to consider how a machine understands and responds to user intentions. Is the machine truly comprehending the meaning behind our words, or is it simply memorizing and regurgitating query-answer mappings from annotated corpora? This situation is a reminder of Searle’s Chinese Room argument [1]. Early ToD systems that relied on pre-structured and stylized interactions quickly revealed the inadequacy of relying solely on linguistic phenomena to capture high-level semantic artifacts beyond simple question-answer pairs. These systems were prone to missing subtle contextual nuances and subject to covariate drifts. Dialogue involving complex user intentions that are multipronged, subject to spontaneous changes, and difficult to track without considering previous contexts exacerbates the challenge of creating robust and accurate ToD systems. Furthermore, task-oriented modules trained on a limited single-domain dataset with spurious correlations are not robust enough to generalize to new low-frequency intents or critical domains without external knowledge or multi-turn dynamics. Finally, machines may also produce incomplete and ill-formed responses when presented with new, unseen circumstances, such as tail domains or foreign languages. In this thesis, we aim to address the limitations of the conventional dialogue systems that are trained with limited data availability and propose to design a conversational agent that is more natural to approach the sense of ‘intelligent spontaneity’. Intelligence reveals the machine reasoning capability of understanding interlocutor intentions and associating involved entities. Spontaneity requires further efforts to spontaneously react and accommodate various scenarios beyond just memorizing. We propose several neural-based methods to improve ToD system naturalness, i.e. the accuracy and fluency to which extent the machine understands the underlying user implicatures and generalizes over miscellaneous scenarios. By leveraging dialogue dynamics, knowledge base, and transfer learning, such a system can represent information and reflect behaviors beyond just the linguistic legitimacy and have the potential to tap into human’s natural tendencies to cope with unseen intents or rare situations in new domains. The thesis is organized in three axes: Surface Understanding, Pertinence Linking and Robust Representation Learning , each approaching an aspect of how a machine learns a task-oriented dialogue. We propose to improve the naturalness of the dialogue learning procedure by first intrinsically enhancing machine’s ability to tackle irregularities from user utterances, extrinsically enriching machine’s awareness of harnessing contexts and knowledge, and subsequently escalating machine’s generalizability over several downstream applications. In tackling user intent variability, we learn the idea of “intent embeddings” explicitly (constructing feature vectors) from intent labels or “intent clusters” implicitly (forming probability distribution) from user utterances, which both represent the semantic signals we wish to discover from the data. The model is enabled to address multiple and zero-shot intents, and cluster in-scope and out-of-scope utterances. In addressing user expression and domain variation, we propose a listwise reranking approach to optimize the process of selecting the optimal spoken hypothesis and propose a standardized measure in measuring domain dialogue similarity that could facilitate knowledge transfer within domains. In modeling multi-turn dynamics, we propose a unified deep learning framework that integrates both dialogue contexts and knowledge to more robustly identify user intents and fill semantic slots. We also propose a knowledge extraction approach to construct causal graphs for better customer service dialogue reference. After learning user intention well, we propose a data augmentation scheme and a cross-lingual dialogue framework that could learn the robust representation for two important downstream use cases: skill routing and response generation. Empirical results show that our proposed methods can tackle a wide variety of dialogue problems resulting from low-resource availability. Overall, this thesis makes attempts to minimize the gap between human and machine cognitive differences by learning more robust representations for dialogue understanding and providing more convenient and natural solutions for services and user experiences without much effort in designing manual rules in different domains.

Abstract: Konuşma dili, insanlar arasındaki iletişimin kurulmasında tarihsel yapı ile beraber kültürel birikimlerin aktarılmasını sağlamaktadır. Gelecek nesillere bir kurallar bütününün aktarılması böylelikle mümkün hale gelmektedir. Aynı dili konuşan kişilerden ziyade farklı dili konuşan kişiler arasında da kültürel ve bilgi aktarımı bulunmaktadır. Ülkelerin kendi aralarında kurdukları etkileşim ve iletişim arttıkça yeni bir dil öğrenmeye ilişkin ihtiyaç da ortaya çıkmaktadır. Giderek küreselleşen dünyamızda yaygın olarak yabancı bir dilin konuşulması, ülkeler içerisindeki teknoloji, turizm ve sanayi gibi faaliyetlerin gerçekleşmesini etkilemektedir. Bu nedenle, ülkelerin sürekli olarak başka bir yabancı dili öğrenme ihtiyacı oluşmuş ve böylece yabancı dili öğrenmeye ilişkin farklı ders kitapları yayınlanmıştır. Bu araştırmada, Rusya’da Rus araştırmacılarının hazırladığı eserler üzerine araştırma yapılmış ve bu eserler arasında dil bilgisi odaklı eserler incelenmiştir. Söz konusu olan bu eserler içerisinde en kapsamlı olan Şçeka’nın “Интенсивный курс турецкого языка” (Yoğun Türkçe Kursu) adlı eseri örneklem olarak alınıp bu ders kitabındaki dil bilgisi konuları öğretim yöntem ve yaklaşımları, konuları, konuların sıralanması, niteliği, ADP’ye uygunluğu, ölçütleri, alıştırmalar açısından irdelenmiştir. Alternate abstract: Spoken language enables the establishment of communication between people and the transfer of cultural accumulations along with historical structures. Thus, it becomes possible to transmit a set of rules to future generations. Cultural and knowledge transfer can occur not only among people who speak the same language but also among those who speak different languages. As interaction and communication between countries increase, there arises a need to learn a new language. The widespread use of a foreign language in our increasingly globalized world affects activities such as technology, tourism, and industry within countries. Therefore, countries have a constant need to learn another foreign language, and various textbooks for learning foreign languages have been published as a result. This study examines research on works prepared by Russian researchers in Russia and focuses on grammar-focused works. Among these works, the most comprehensive is the course book of Sheka, “Интенсивный курс турецкого языка” (Intensive Course in Turkish Language), which is taken as a sample. The grammar topics in this textbook, teaching methods and approaches, the sequence and quality of the topics, their conformity to ELP (European Language Portfolio) standards, and exercises are analyzed.

Abstract: This study examines knowledge-sharing practices within a community of practice (CoP) through a case study of the Fresh Produce and Floral Council (FPFC). The study sought to investigate how the FPFC promoted agricultural knowledge and expertise, impacted its members' social relationships and knowledge-sharing practices, communicated clear roles and expectations, and provided valuable and accessible resources. A mixed-methods approach was employed to investigate the research questions, which involved conducting a survey and utilizing descriptive statistics, frequencies, and Spearman correlations to analyze both the Likert scale and open-ended responses. The findings suggested that the FPFC has a knowledge-sharing culture promoting active participation and collaboration among members, with room for improvement in knowledge-sharing practices. Additionally, FPFC positively impacts members' social relationships and prioritizes knowledge-sharing, with a need for further education and promotion of these benefits. Also, clear communication of roles and expectations is essential in any CoP. There may be a need to further clarify the community's goals and purpose to ensure member engagement and alignment. Finally, members perceived FPFC's resources as valuable and relevant, but there is a need for improvement in their accessibility and availability. Overall, the study provided valuable insights for developing new methods of knowledge-sharing and onboarding within the agriculture industry to address the aging crisis and ensure the industry's future. Thus, it was essential to explore the value of knowledge-sharing practices and technology for communication within the community to contribute to developing virtual CoPs enabling knowledge transfer and relationship building for agriculture professionals.

Abstract: El conocimiento se ha convertido en un elemento central que contribuye en buena medida, al bienestar de las sociedades modernas (Cabrero et al., 2020). Cuando se gestiona, es una estrategia que busca generar un plan de acción que potencializa el conocimiento organizacional. Sin embargo, han sido las organizaciones privadas quienes han liderado el diseño y uso de mecanismos de gestión del conocimiento, mientras que las públicas han estado restringidas a un proceso vertical de transferencia y generación de conocimiento, usualmente del nivel federal al local. Así, esta investigación responde: ¿Cómo una organización de la administración pública municipal se enfrenta a la gestión del conocimiento? Utiliza el estudio de caso exploratorio como un tipo de estrategia cualitativa y analiza de forma deductiva la información recabada mediante entrevistas semi estructuradas a personas de nivel directivo. La autoría propone cuatro factores explicativos que potencializan u obstaculizan la gestión de conocimiento, a saber: el capital humano, infraestructura tecnológica, procesos estandarizados e incentivos. Como resultado, obtiene que las cuatro variables inciden de manera diferenciada en la gestión de conocimiento. En específico, el Gobierno Municipal de San Luis Potosí presenta fortalezas en el capital humano y los recursos tecnológicos. Sin embargo, las inercias en los procesos de la organización y los bajos incentivos económicos obstaculizan el aprovechamiento del conocimiento. Así, con base en la información recabada y desde el enfoque de la teoría de juegos, se emiten recomendaciones orientadas principalmente a la creación de incentivos en las actividades de preservación y socialización de conocimiento. Finalmente, se proponen y describen diferentes tipologías de gestión de conocimiento, estos son: inercial, estructural, normativo, contextual e institucional. Alternate abstract: Knowledge has become a key element to the social wellbeing of modern societies (Cabrero et al., 2020). When managed, it becomes a strategy that seeks to generate an action plan that enhances organizational knowledge. However, it has been private organizations who have led the design and use of knowledge management mechanisms, while public organizations have been mainly restricted to vertical processes of knowledge transfer and generation, usually from federal to local levels. Therefore, this research answers: how does an organization from the municipal public administration deal with knowledge management? The dissertation is supported on a qualitative approach employing an exploratory case study based on semi structured interviews to municipal managers. Subsequently, it analyzes deductively the information collected. The author proposes four explanatory factors that potentiate or hinder knowledge management, those being: human capital, technological resources, standardized processes, and incentives. The findings will show how each of those four factors influence knowledge management in a differentiated way. Specifically, the municipal administration of San Luis Potosí points to strengths in its human capital and technological resources, while organizational path dependency and low economic incentives weaken knowledge management and use. Thus, based on our findings and supported on the game theory approach, some recommendations are offered mainly around the creation of incentives for the preservation and socialization of knowledge. Lastly, a typology of knowledge management is proposed, in which five types of knowledge management are described: Inertial, Structural, Normative, Contextual, and Institutional.

Exploring the Feasibility of Virtual Reality to Support Falls Awareness Education in Care Homes

Author: Ford, Claire R.

Publication info: Ford, Claire R. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploring-feasibility-virtual-reality-support/docview/2956839470/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Background: Older adults are at risk of falls, which increases further in care home environments. Due to the complexity of care home residents’ conditions and an increasing ageing population, it is important for care staff to have knowledge and understanding in falls awareness, prevention, and management in order to support their residents. Literature searches identified that barriers to care staff implementing falls prevention strategies included the limited knowledge of staff and insufficient resources (including lack of staff training). There is scarce research regarding methods to deliver training to care staff, however emerging research in Virtual Reality (VR) as a training method had promise due to increased knowledge retention, and application into practice. No VR research in care home staff had been conducted at the time of commencing this project. Stakeholder patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) determined that VR as a training method had potential value. Aim: To develop and test the feasibility of a proof-of-concept Virtual Reality (VR) training programme for care home staff in falls awareness and prevention. Methods: A multi-phase project, including two research phases and one technology development phase, based on the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions (Skivington et al., 2021). An initial exploratory qualitative research phase (Phase I) was undertaken to guide the design and content of the training. A development phase followed this to create the falls awareness experience (FAE) proof-of-concept, utilising user-centred design with iCASE collaborator Sentireal. Following the development phase, a second research study was conducted (Phase II) - a mixed methods study exploring the feasibility of the proof-of-concept, obtaining additional feedback for further development of the VR training programme. Findings: Engagement, immersion and enjoyment were key factors for acceptability of a training method. The FAE suited the learning styles of care staff, and VR was accepted as a training method. Utilisation of a case study resident increased empathy to the resident experience. Feedback for development included additional locations, scenarios, and interactable items. Barriers and facilitators of acceptability and adoption were identified. Conclusions: Identifying a potentially effective method of training for a complex intervention may influence the creation of future training programmes for care homes: to assist in increasing care staff knowledge, retention of information, and application of knowledge into practice. This in turn may improve the quality of care delivered and resident outcomes. Additional research is required to develop the proof-of-concept into a minimum viable prototype, and feasibility tested further.

Abstract: Bu araştırma, tasarımla ilgili ulusal strateji ve politikalar ekseninde, farklı özelliklerde tasarım merkezlerinin incelenmesiyle etkili ve verimli, sürdürülebilir yapıların sağlanmasına yönelik etki faktörlerini, Türkiye örneği üzerinden ele almaktadır. Son yıllarda öne çıkan Tasarım Merkezi (TM) tanımlamasının yurtdışında ve Türkiye’de nasıl karşılık bulduğu, ne tür çeşitlilik gösterdiği, ulusal politikaların nasıl yansımaları olduğu ile ilgili gelişmeler, araştırmanın temel çıkış noktalarını oluşturmaktadır. TR’de ulusal tasarım politikaları kapsamında ne tür organizasyonel yapıların desteklendiği ile ilgili güncel gelişmelere bakıldığında; yenilik üreticisi kurumsal yapıların tasarım birimlerinde belirli koşulların sağlanması doğrultusunda, bu tür yapılara TM unvanı verilerek birtakım muafiyetler sağlanması, dikkat çekici gelişmeler içinde yer almıştır. Bu araştırmada, Türkiye’de Ulusal İnovasyon Sisteminin (UİS) bileşenleri olarak farklı altyapıda, farklı hedefler doğrultusunda şekillenen ve bu doğrultuda faaliyet ve hizmet alanı, faydalanıcı kitle ve etki alanı çeşitlenen tasarım merkezlerinin yapılarının açığa çıkarılması esastır. Yaratıcı ekonomi ve yenilik ekosisteminin gelişimi doğrultusunda TM’lerin verimliliğine ve sürdürülebilirliğine yönelik strateji ve politikaların etkilerini sebep-sonuç ilişkisi içinde ele alıp, TM ekosistemi ile paydaşları açığa çıkaran ve ilişkilere işaret eden teorik model önerisi sunmak, tezin temel hedefidir. Öncelikle, tasarım merkezlerinin yurtdışında ne tür organizasyonel yapılanmalar için tanımlandığı, ayırt edici temel özelliklerinin neler olduğu, Ulusal Tasarım Sistemi (UTS) içinde rollerinin nasıl tanımlandığı mercek altına alınmaktadır. Daha sonra Türkiye (TR) ölçeğinde ne tür TM yapılanmalarının olduğu incelenmekte, TM faaliyetlerinin verimliliği ve sürdürülebilirliği hususunda temel sorunlar ve etki faktörlerinin neler olduğu, gerekliliklerin nasıl tanımlanabileceği üzerinde durulmaktadır. TR’de TM teşvikleri kapsamında devletin rolünün ne olduğu, ilgili politikaların UTS’ye yansımalarında ne tür sistem hatalarının etki ettiği ile ilgili konular araştırmanın odağındadır. Nitel veri analizinin ön planda olduğu bu durum çalışmasında, mevcut literatürde TM ile ilgili verilerin ele alınmasının yanı sıra, yurtdışındaki TM’lerin kurumsal internet sayfalarından edinilen bilgilerin satır analizi ile açığa çıkarılan temel özellikler de TR odaklı alan çalışmasının kavramsal çerçevesini şekillendirmiştir. TR’de belirlenmiş TM’leri kapsayan alan çalışmasında imalatçıkurumsal yapılanma altında TM’lerin yanı sıra, bölgesel ölçekte veya tematik alanlarda faaliyet gösteren TM’ler, üniversite bünyesindeki araştırma ve uygulama merkezleri, iş birliği ve promosyonel faaliyetleri ile ön planda olan TM’ler, araştırma evrenine dahil edilen temel kategoriler olarak belirlenmiştir. Tanımlanmış bu kümeler dahilinde TM’lerle yarı yapılandırılmış mülakatlar yapılmış olup, kodlama yöntemi ile tematik analiz gerçekleştirilmiştir. Saha çalışmasından elde edilen veriler doğrultusunda TR’de TM ekosisteminde yer alan farklı yapılar, ortaklık ve farklılıklarıyla bir arada değerlendirilmiştir; faaliyet ve hizmet alanlarının, UTS içerisindeki rollerin nasıl çeşitlendiği, faaliyetlerin etkililiği ve sürdürülebilirliği hususunda ne tür etkilerin söz konusu olduğu ortaya konulmuştur. Literatür verileri ve alan çalışması bulgularının bir arada değerlendirilmesi sonucunda ortaya çıkan temel kritik tespit, TR’de UTS içerisindeki tasarım politikalarına ilişkin tanım ve uygulamalarla ilgili sistem hatalarının TM ekosisteminde yapısal bozukluklara sebep olarak, verimlilik ve sürdürülebilirlik hususunda olumsuz etki yaratmasıdır. TR’de ‘Yaratıcı Ekonomi ve Yenilik’ ekosisteminin parçası olarak TM’lerin etkili katma değer yaratabilmeleri için nasıl yapılanması gerektiği, ne tür arka plan ile desteklenmesi gerektiği, elverişli koşulların neler olduğu hususunda tespitler ve öneriler sunulmuştur. TR’de Ar-Ge ile ilgili politikalardan türetilerek hazırlanmış olan tasarım destek politikalarının, tasarımın sunduğu birçok ayırt edici katkı alanının göz ardı edilmesine sebep olduğu ve yeni nesil inovasyon modellerinin gerektirdiği açık inovasyon yaklaşımlarının, iş birliği ve ağ yapılarının gücünün geri planda kaldığı tespit edilmiştir. Bulgular doğrultusunda, TR’de TM olarak tanımlanan ve desteklenen, ürün/hizmet tasarımı gerçekleştiren ve ticari faaliyetleri ile ulusal kalkınmaya katkı sağlayan yapıların yanı sıra, promosyonel faaliyetler gerçekleştiren, araştırma odaklı çalışan, bölgesel ölçekte veya tematik alanlarda faaliyet gösteren, farklı ölçeklerde ve farklı organizasyonel yapılanma biçimlerinde merkezlerin de UİS bileşeni olarak katkı sağlayıcı olduklarına işaret edilmekte; TM tanımlamasının ve destek kriterlerinin ise UTS’nin gelişimi ile ilgili bu açıdan yeterince kapsayıcı ve hedefe yönelik olmayışı tartışılmaktadır. Zira, TM tanımlaması ile ilgili literatüre ve yurtdışındaki uygulama örneklerine bakıldığında, bilgi ve inovasyon üretiminin yanı sıra, paylaşımın, yayılımın ve bilgi transferinin özendirildiği, laboratuvar yapılanmalarının ön planda olduğu, deneysel yöntemlerin uygulandığı, hedef faydalanıcı kitle dahil farklı paydaşların süreçlere katılımının teşvik edildiği, insanın merkeze alındığı ve toplumsal faydanın gözetildiği, açık inovasyon prensiplerinin uygulandığı, dışa dönük, şeffaf, paylaşımcı ve birleştirici rol üstlenilen yapılar ön plana çıkmaktadır. TR’de TM politikaları ile ilgili altyapıya bakıldığında ise bu gelişmelerin göz ardı edilmiş olduğu, desteklerinin çerçevesinin, belirli nicel şartları sağlayan işletmelerin ticari faaliyetleri ekseninde şekillendiği tespit edilmiştir. Sonuç olarak, TM ekosistemindeki paydaşlar ve etki dinamikleri haritalandırılmış; ekosistem üzerine etki eden dinamikleri açığa çıkaran tanımlayıcı bir teorik model önerisi tanımlanmıştır. Bu model kapsamında, yaratıcı ekonomi ve yenilik ekosisteminin gelişimine katkı sağlayan TM faaliyetlerinin gerçekleşebilmesi için, destekleyici koşullar, etki-tepki ilişkisi vurgulanarak tanımlanmıştır. Stratejik gereksinimler, yenilik gelişimini destekleyici altyapı, iş birlikleri ve etkileşimleri destekleyici altyapı başlıkları altında, kısa/orta/uzun vade için sonuç önerileri sunulmuştur. Alternate abstract: The main focus of this research is the investigation of design centers with different characteristics in Turkiye (TR) in the axis of national strategies and policies to discover the impact factors for effective and efficient sustainable infrastructures. The main starting points are how the definition of the Design Center (DC), which has come to the forefront in recent years, is met abroad and in TR; what kind of diversity DCs point out, and how they are affected by national policies. Considering the recent developments regarding what type of organizational structures are supported within the scope of national design policies in TR, it is noteworthy that the design departments of innovative corporate systems are given the official title of DC, and some exemptions are provided for them if they meet certain conditions. In this research, it is considered essential to reveal different types of DCs in TR, with different goals and various infrastructures, whose area of activity and service, beneficiary group, and impact area are diversified in this direction, as components of the National Innovation System (NIS). In line with the development of the creative economy and innovation ecosystem, the main objective of the thesis is to present a theoretical model proposal for the DC ecosystem by considering the effects of strategies and policies on the efficiency and sustainability level in a cause & effect relationship. NIS includes components at different scales and focuses on generation, dissemination, commercialization, use, and impact value of innovation. Educational and promotional activities related to innovation, research and development (R&D), production and supply chains, strategy and policy-making, and implementing mechanisms are different elements of this system. For the system to work harmoniously and correctly, these different elements must work effectively and efficiently among themselves, as well as the requirements of solid interrelationships, ease and frequency of information flow. The National Design System (NDS), which is sometimes considered equivalent and sometimes as a subset of the NIS, also points to different components on a national scale by putting ‘design’ in the center. It focuses on the roles and relationships between various stakeholders to identify and repair malfunctions and failures within the system. The activities of different components to operate in multiple ways, such as creation, distribution, transfer, and transformation of innovation, are also at the center of design-related strategies and policies. Because the primary goal of design policies is to develop the design from different perspectives on a regional and national scale, to create mechanisms that ensure the implementation of rules and objectives that positively affect national and social development, and increase the beneficiary group. This research, which focuses on DCs in the axis of strategies and policies, considers the different roles of different components in the NIS and a vast network that emerges with the diversification in their contribution areas with a systemic approach. It examines what kind of characteristic features and types of design centers exist as a NIS component and how they contribute to design-related development. It relates to how design policies and strategies offer a background in influencing the structural features of DCs and contributing, guiding, supporting, or restricting their beneficiaries. When it comes to the content structure of the thesis, first of all, the triggering climate, value-added economic development, and design relations in the background related to handling design policies on a national scale are mentioned. How strategies and procedures are developed and implemented, the extent to which they affect the design sector and its network, and how they are effective in design-related incentive and support systems are examined through examples from different countries. Current approaches that emphasize the transition from policies focusing on design as a factor of national development and economic competitiveness to human-centered policies are highlighted. Innovation and design policies, the intersection of sectoral and regional development policies, trade policies, science and technology policies, and social innovation policies are emphasized. In this direction, the roles of design centers as a component of NIS are highlighted. In line with the changing dynamics and paradigms, the expanding and changing scope of the design has been expressed, and its reflections on the DCs have been determined. It is examined what kind of organizational structures DCs are defined for abroad, what their distinctive basic features are, and how their roles are defined within the NDS. Then, what kind of DC structures exist in the TR scale is investigated, the main problems and impact factors regarding the efficiency and sustainability of DC activities and how the requirements can be defined are emphasized. The focus of the research is on the role of the state within the scope of DC incentives in TR and what kind of systemic failures affect the reflection of the relevant policies on the NDS. In this qualitative situational study, the main features revealed by the information obtained from the corporate web pages of DCs abroad and the data about DCs in the existing literature shaped the conceptual framework of the TR-focused field study. In the field study covering the DCs determined in TR, in addition to the centers in the manufacturer-institutional structures, centers operating on a regional scale or in thematic areas, research and application centers within universities, centers for cooperation and promotional activities are also included in the research universe, considered as main four categories. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the centers within these defined clusters, and thematic analysis was carried out with the coding method. As a result of synthesizing the data, conclusions about the characteristics of DCs in TR, their service areas, their position in the NDS, how the strategies and policies they are related to, and what kind of effects are in question on the effectiveness and sustainability of the activities are revealed. In this direction, a theoretical model proposal for the DC ecosystem and conclusion suggestions for future development are presented. In line with the data obtained from the fieldwork, different structures in the DC ecosystem in TR were evaluated together with their similarities and differences. The main critical finding that emerged as a result of the evaluation of the literature data and field study findings together is that systemic failures related to the definition and applications of design policies in the NDS in TR cause structural defects in the DC ecosystem and have a negative impact on efficiency and sustainability. As a part of the creative economy and innovation ecosystem in TR, determinations and suggestions are made on how the 'Design Centers' should be structured to create practical added value, what kind of background they should be supported, and what the favorable conditions would be. It is emphasized that the design support policies, which were prepared by deriving from the policies related to R&D in TR, caused many distinctive contribution areas offered by design to be ignored, that the power of open innovation approaches, collaboration, and network structures required by new generation innovation models remained in the background. The findings obtained from the research show that; in addition to the structures defined and supported as DC in TR that carry out product/service design and contribute to national development with their commercial activities, there are also DCs that are effective in promotional activities, research facilities, regional scale or thematic areas, at different scales and in other organizational infrastructures. These centers are also contributors as components of the NIS. It is criticized that the definition of DC and support criterias in design policies are not inclusive and target-oriented enough, regarding the development of NDS. Because when we look at the literature on the scope of DCs and the application examples abroad; collaboration, dissemination, and knowledge transfer are also encouraged, laboratory structures are at the forefront, experimental methods are applied, the participation of different stakeholders, including the target beneficiary group in the processes is encouraged, as well as the production of knowledge and innovation. Besides, the centers that focus on social benefit are taken into consideration, open innovation principles are applied, and outward-looking, transparent, sharing, and unifying roles come to the fore. When we look at the infrastructure related to DC policies in TR, it has been determined that these features have been ignored, and the framework of the support is shaped in the axis of the commercial activities of the enterprises that meet certain quantitative conditions. In the conclusion part of the thesis, as a part of the 'Creative Economy and Innovation Ecosystem' in TR, final statements, and suggestions are presented on how the 'Design Centers' should be structured to create added value, what kind of background they should be supported with, and what would be the favorable conditions to achieve desired situations. Stakeholders and impact dynamics in the DC ecosystem have been mapped, and the ‘Vortex model for the DC ecosystem' has been defined as a new theoretical model proposal. Within the scope of this model, supporting conditions have been defined by emphasizing the effect-response relationship so that DC activities that contribute to the development of the creative economy and innovation ecosystem can be realized. Final recommendations are prescribed for short/medium/long term under strategic requirements, the infrastructure supporting innovation development, and the infrastructure supporting collaborations and interactions.

Preservation of knowledge by an organization is critical for ongoing success. The knowledge transfer between retirees and their entity's remaining employees offers a unique opportunity to retain knowledge. Employers that engage with employees prior to their retirement can allow for a longer and more productive knowledge transfer process. The aim of our research has been to learn how to make knowledge exchanges successful by considering methods. Managers should consider new efforts for knowledge-continuity management. Multiple surveys were designed to determine the extent of knowledge-loss risk associated with retirees, the prevalence of informal and formal knowledge-transfer practices and the effectiveness of knowledge transfer for knowledge continuity. Results showed that organizations perceive significant knowledge-loss risk with the impending wave of retirements from an aging workforce and that many are not proactively approaching this opportunity. Organizations are leveraging only a few knowledge-transfer approaches and not leveraging technology for tacit knowledge transfers to occur. The data indicate that there is considerable room for improvement in knowledge-transfer practices - and our research offers practical implications for effective knowledge-transfer activities.
INTRODUCTION AND CHALLENGE
Most entities have a relatively large group of older workers who are eligible to retire. In the past, many organizations have encouraged older workers to retire to promote upward mobility and allow for the continued introduction of new skills. However, in recent years, given the aging of the global labor force, many organizations are finding it more difficult to recruit and retain enough young and middle-age workers to offset the loss of older workers. The share of the population age 60 and older is projected to increase in nearly every country from 2005 through 2050. Population aging will tend to lower labor-force participation. (Bloom et al. 2010). Add the impacts of the COVID pandemic to that employment dynamic, and organizations could be confronting a substantial loss of knowledge. Each time an employee leaves, an organization risks losing essential knowledge. Without some proactive measures and focus by management, considerable knowledge will continue to leave organizations, eroding their competitive positions. Our research and this paper explore knowledge-continuity management to understand the effectiveness of current institutional knowledge-sharing programs. We study the types and prevalence of knowledge-transfer practices being utilized. We then propose that proactive work, specifically with future retirees, offers a meaningful chance to reduce an organization's knowledge loss. In addition to sharing research, we will offer insights from recent retirees' perspectives and practical advice to minimize the departure of knowledge and experience associated with retirements.
LITERATURE REVIEW OF KNOWLEDGE CONTINUITY
Knowledge management is about finding and developing the right body of knowledge and about using the knowledge to an advantage. According to Durst and Zieba (2019), knowledge loss is a consequence that occurs when an organization loses all or parts of its crucial knowledge from an employee leaving. It can also be from a technical failure, such as a computer breakdown, but our focus will be on departing employees. Knowledge continuity is the efficient and effective transfer of information and knowledge from departing employees to their replacements. Beazley, Boenisch, and Harden (2003) provided a summary of the origins of knowledge management and declared knowledge continuity to be a new management function in their work in 2003. So, managers have been building, and must continue to build, a competency in ensuring knowledge continuity within their departments. Management invests resources to do this because knowledge is a source of competitive advantage for organizations (Beazley, Boenisch, and Harden 2003).
Research indicates two types of knowledge - tacit and explicit. Tacit knowledge is difficult to express, formalize or share, but provides competitive advantage. This is the knowledge that you want to retain and share within your organization, but you do not want it to be shared externally. Roy Lubrit in "Organizational Dynamics" (2001) said that tacit knowledge is the know-how or skills, the ways of solving problems, the mental models or the organizational routines and the knowledge that is embedded in individuals. Alavi and Leidner (2001) summarized more descriptions of knowledge as the "know why," the "know when," and the "know with" knowledge, because it is the ability for one to know why something has or has not happened and what to do at the right time and with whom. Explicit knowledge is documented or codified knowledge, such as job aids and workflows. But one might need the tacit knowledge to interpret the explicit knowledge. Unit performance can depend on the ability to turn knowledge into the right actions.
Effective knowledge sharing or transfer can reduce the learning curve for new hires and internal employees and preserve the knowledge that the organization has invested to develop. This successful transfer of knowledge results in better decision making or fewer operational mistakes for the organization and its customers (Beazley, Boenisch, and Harden, 2003). The two-party process includes those who convey knowledge and those who receive knowledge. Since the process involves people, it can be hampered by motivation, trust, relational competence, common language, culture and the type of knowledge itself (Tangaraja et al. 2016; Alavi and Leidner 2001). We advocate that leaders should be working to create an environment for the effective transfer of knowledge for knowledge continuity and that their support of this effort will be an enabler for it.
DATA AND METHODS
In a series of surveys, we have developed a research methodology that provides an understanding of how both risk managers and recent retirees are thinking about knowledge transfer as a risk - a risk that is increasing with the increase in retirements. We partnered with two organizations to understand perceptions of risk, which tactics or knowledge-transfer approaches are in use in organizations, and what attempts at transferring knowledge between retirees and remaining employees are happening. Because knowledge loss is a risk to organizations, we partnered with the Enterprise Risk Management Initiative at North Carolina State University to survey risk managers about the current knowledge-transfer practices of organizations. The survey had 119 responses, with 34% of respondents coming from private for-profit entities, 31% from publicly traded firms, 19% from nonprofit entities and 16% from government agencies. Our respondents were almost evenly split between international and U.S. entities. Fifty-one percent of respondents were from organizations headquartered in the United States with only U.S. employees. The international perspective is represented by 49% of respondents. Twenty-seven percent of respondents were employed by U.S.-headquartered multinational entities with both global and U.S.-based employees, 13% were employed by internationally headquartered multinational entities with no U.S.-based employees, while 9% were employed by internationally headquartered multinational entities with U.S.-based employees. From a size perspective, 31% percent of respondents employed more than 5,000 employees, while 20% employed from 1,000 to 5,000 employees.
To further confirm or test our findings, we also partnered with Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes (OLLI) to access recent retirees to learn the knowledge-transfer practices they utilized as they attempted to share knowledge. Via survey, we were able to reach a group of 200 OLLI members who retired in the past five years. Osher Institutes deliver non-credit courses and educational activities specifically designed for people who are 50 or older. Nine sites throughout the United States agreed to share the survey with their members, and 205 people responded to the survey request, with only five reporting that they retired outside our five-year timeframe. The breakdown of numbers and percentages of the 200 respondents that met our criteria is evenly distributed with retirees from each of the years from 2016 to 2021. The breakdown by year of retirement was: 2016, 53 respondents or 26.5% of respondents; 2017, 33 or 16.5%; 2018, 43 or 21.5%; 2019, 32 or 16.0%; 2020, 27 or 13.5%; and 2021,12 or 6.0%.
In our surveys, we asked about the extent of knowledge-loss risk perceived with impending retirements, the effectiveness of knowledge-transfer practices, and the approaches used for knowledge transfer with retirees. We also asked retirees for their advice to improve the knowledge-transfer process. Respondents wrote in response to the question, "What, if anything, could the company have done to improve this process?"
RESEARCH RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Our first finding is that risk managers identify the potential knowledge loss associated with retirees to be a risk in the next three to five years, but the extent of risk varied. Survey respondents were asked "To what extent does your organization face a risk of significant loss of knowledge due to an aging workforce who may leave the organization in the next 3-5 years?" While 43.7% of the overall group found the knowledge-loss risk to be somewhat significant, risk managers from governmental entities indicated this risk as more significant, with 73.7% identifying the risk as "extensive" or "mostly extensive" (see Table 1).
Next, we sought to learn about which methods or approaches entities were using in their efforts to minimize loss of knowledge. We identified 11 potential knowledge-transfer practices that organizations may be using to enable the knowledge-transfer process. We separately asked the risk managers as well as the recent retirees which methods were utilized. The retirees' perspectives confirmed the results. Our findings from both groups are summarized in Table 2, where we list the 11 potential knowledge-transfer practices and how prevalent they were in organizations as ranked by risk managers and recent retirees. Respondents of the surveys were instructed to indicate as many activities as necessary to represent the entirety of activities occurring in their organization to share knowledge between sender and receiver. One interesting finding is that both groups' rankings reinforce that on-the-job training with shadowing and one-to-one mentoring are the most often used approaches.
Another observation is that technology-based knowledge-sharing practices were some of the least utilized by respondents and retirees. For example, collaborative software solutions such as wikis or blogs ranked low in usage on both lists. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems ranked the least used by both groups.
It is important to determine how effective these knowledge-sharing approaches were perceived to be. Responses were quite telling when asked to determine "How effective your organization's processes are for helping transfer critical knowledge from employees as they retire to others in the workforce who will remain." Thirty-seven percent of responding risk managers indicated the processes were "minimally effective," while 42% indicated "somewhat effective."
To continue to learn about current practices, one can consider the number of different activities in use within an entity. Once again, we see consistency in our separate survey responses, where one to four practices were most indicated, and rarely were seven or more different approaches used in one organization. Figure 1 illustrates the data and the decrease in number of methods used after the combined use of three or four knowledge-transfer methods.
To round out this research, we asked how well organizations effectively transfer knowledge. Four out of five (79%) surveyed professionals said their organization's knowledge-transfer efforts are either "somewhat effective" or "minimally effective." This implies that there is room for improvement in the knowledge sharing in most organizations. The other finding is that 25% to 28% of organizations are using just one knowledge-transfer approach. This suggests that improvements to the knowledge-transfer process may occur simply by increasing the number of approaches. Another consideration for improving the transfer would be to consider new approaches. Those approaches that use technology and those that involve groups were some of the least used by all respondents.
Last, when checking this data by retirement year, we found two interesting patterns of responses. First, the use of collaborative software only began in 2018. Second, knowledge transfer appeared to become more formal in 2020, as there were no formal knowledge-transfer processes for retirees.
After considering the knowledge-transfer methods being used by organizations, managers should consider how a unit develops knowledge-transfer policies and programs that will be successful and allow for an orderly knowledge transfer. We offer the following considerations for managers and leverage the open responses of retirees as well as outline further research in our recommendations.
PRACTICAL PROGRAMS AND APPROACHES
First, identify critical knowledge and the knowledge holders
In their work on knowledge-continuity management, Bidian and Evans (2019) suggested that managers should conduct a knowledge audit to identify critical or valuable knowledge and use strategic plans to determine a time horizon for how long this knowledge is needed. Once critical knowledge is identified, then one must consider who holds that knowledge. A manager may know this for their immediate area, but if one is working at an enterprise level, an organization chart or job description database may be the first sources to identify knowledge by role. Another approach is to access HR metrics to predict individuals at risk of leaving and compare that list of employees to the lists of critical knowledge. The metrics can be as simple as the ages of the workforce or could be voluntary turnover rates. In this paper, we advocate that leaders focus efforts to support the knowledge transfer of retirees and that they prioritize this over the knowledge transfer of other departing employees, for two reasons. The first is that under the right conditions, when the retiree feels secure in a job and valued, that employee is more likely to give a longer notice than an employee resigning will provide. Our research confirmed that notice period for retirees to be a mechanism to support effective knowledge transfer. The second reason is that impending retirement is more predictable than other voluntary turnover scenarios and that predictability lends itself to planning and effectiveness. This effort and focus allow an entity to make an assessment for each potential retiree. One can imagine a question similar to this: "Is there critical knowledge that needs to be retained by the organization before this individual retires, and can we begin this process well before they retire?"
Next, make the ask
Once critical knowledge is identified and it is determined that a retiree may be the holder of that information, a leader needs to manage the knowledge-sharing process. Only one-third of retirees we surveyed were asked to share knowledge with others inside the organization. Even acknowledging that some work may not have been worthy of knowledge transfer, it seems that increasing the number of people asked to knowledge-share might help to improve the effectiveness. We propose having a supportive and assuring conversation with the individual who holds the key knowledge to learn about their retirement plans and ask for their advice on a good transfer strategy.
Consider this real-life example. A function leader in an organization was approached by her manager, a person she trusted, and was asked if others knew what she knew. They discussed if there were internal employees who might know the same information. They agreed there was not really anyone who shared her knowledge. This is more than a conversation about successors. It is about learning if others in the entity know the explicit or tacit knowledge that she knew. The manager then asked what her desired retirement date was, indicating that she hoped it was not soon. The employee felt comfortable to share that she was about five years away from retirement. The two then created a formal plan for her to begin a process to share her knowledge with a colleague. The subject-matter expert was to begin knowledge sharing with the other person, and boundaries were set that she should not exceed 50% of the receiver's time. The person was not necessarily her successor. The interviewee shared she may not have revealed her retirement plans to her new leader if there was no trust between them. The new leader expressed the person's value and the organization's vulnerability if she were to leave. Kudos to the manager who first identified critical knowledge the organization needed that was held by one source and then conducted a productive conversation to get the knowledge-transfer process started. A fiveyear plan like the one described may not be workable for most critical knowledge holders, but the model of iterative conversations to identify receivers and a plan is attractive.
Remember, time is of the essence
Our research of open responses from recent retirees tells us that time is often not factored into the knowledge-sharing scenario. Speaking with senior employees early about their timing preferences for retirement allows for a longer time for knowledge transfer compared to the short time that a voluntary resignation and a two-week notice provides. It may mean that work is restructured for both the knowledge conveyer and the knowledge receiver(s) to allow extra time for this activity. There may be an extra expense to having several people learning and observing, but the redundancy may increase the chances of successful knowledge transfer, specifically for tacit knowledge. One retiree's advice was to "start (the) transfer of knowledge and building of relationships early in (the) process" and allocate time up front "instead of working in crisis mode up till the last minute."
Open your mind to potential knowledge receivers
Next, work to identify potential knowledge receivers. Think more broadly than finding a perfect "ready now" successor from the succession charts. Often terms such as "ready now" and "ready in 1-3 years" are used to classify internal employees for succession. One might argue that your "ready-now candidate" has already left or is interviewing, so an organization may be best served to invest in knowledge transfer with more than one person and with those who may seem less ready than you'd like. The advice we learned from recent retirees even highlighted the need for a solid plan for knowledge management when outsourcing. An outsourced activity requires monitoring and management and the knowledge to do that. Consider a knowledge transfer from the retiree to whichever department will become the outsource vendor manager as effective knowledge continuity management of outsourced activities. Also, think about how the knowledge can be shared with more than one person to improve your odds of retaining the knowledge and how that knowledge transfer can be positioned as career enhancing for those who are less experienced.
Research by Fasbender, Gerpott, and Unger (2021) indicated that receivers who are motivated to grow, increase competence and master new skills and knowledge are better receivers. Being an insider, someone who knows the entity, adds an advantage to the successful knowledge transfer. If you must go externally for a candidate, allow for longer-than-expected times to fill the role and expect more of a learning curve as the person learns both the company and the knowledge. A recent retiree said that to improve the knowledge sharing, the organization could have "hired a replacement with some level of institutional and program knowledge - at least a foundation to build upon." If that is not possible, having several employees within the organization who already have some knowledge because of previous successful knowledge-sharing efforts can support new hires more effectively.
Now, consider the type of knowledge and which transfer practices are best suited
As described earlier, organizations are most often using on-the-job training, job shadowing and one-to-one mentoring to attempt their knowledge transfers but are not always satisfied with the effectiveness of the transfers. Research indicates that working with a coach or expert to learn tacit knowledge is most effective when the receiver of the knowledge can problem-solve with the expert or learn their decision-making process experientially. This takes time. In his work on tacit knowledge transfer, Lubrit (2001) offered the idea that structured group discussions are a way to increase the numbers of people who have access to the expert and their expertise. As you consider the list of 11 knowledge-transfer tactics (see Table 2) and the idea that structured group activities may increase access to knowledge, two moderately used options stand out as options to make knowledge transfers more efficient and effective.
Consider the use of communities of practice and after-action reviews. Communities of practice, also called centers of excellence, are groups that regularly convene and share information. They often cross traditional organizational structures, allowing all levels of the entity to participate and learn from others outside their formal departments. These are often set up for a specific discipline or process. If a manager were to direct the center of excellence to focus on critical knowledge that was identified in a knowledge audit, group members can begin the sharing process earlier and add time to what has historically been rushed knowledge-transfer activities. They can also improve the format for the knowledge transfer by allowing topics to be more problem solving in nature and less like forced explicit knowledge exchanges. Greene offered an interesting example in his work on knowledge management (Greene 2020). He told of Xerox repair technicians who created an informal breakfast club where they shared solutions to difficult problems that did not appear in repair manuals. This form of applied learning benefited the company. It would also be beneficial to encourage them to document what they learn.
Next, consider after-action reviews. These have a heritage in the Army, but the concept may also be a way to pivot your current knowledge-transfer approaches to become more effective. A large construction business shared its approach to after-action reviews using the following questions after a planned activity:
| What was supposed to happen? What happened?
| What went well? Why?
| What could be improved? How?
A manager can strategically choose which activities are worth this deliberate expense of time by using the knowledge audit of critical knowledge. The structure of the questions allows experts to unpack their knowledge in a way that shares their logic, which is more effective for tacit knowledge sharing and receiving.
Knowledge-management systems provide another opportunity for knowledge transfer identified from the utilization data in Table 2. Technology or systems are not highly leveraged. Systems can be enablers of knowledge sharing, but we saw collaborative software was not often used and retirees in our survey only reported its use starting in 2018. One might speculate that COVID-related experiences with technology may have increased the usage of these tools, but our data for 2020 and 2021 retirees do not indicate an increase in the use of collaborative tools in the knowledge-transfer process. Collaborative software can facilitate global, remote and other distributed organization interaction. Center of excellence exchanges and after-action reviews can become an even more significant resource for knowledge sharing with many when enabled by collaborative technology.
Consider adding new tricks to your current knowledge-continuity goals to increase the number of approaches your organization utilizes. Once you have identified the critical knowledge, the person who holds that knowledge and the potential receivers, then consider increasing the types of knowledge-transfer approaches. Our research with both organizations and retirees indicates 53% to 56% of organizations are using only one or two approaches. Building a competency for knowledge transfer may involve learning about alternative methods that are available for this work and then expanding the types of approaches. Managers should leverage more critical knowledge-focused group approaches such as communities of practice or centers of excellence. They should implement strategic after-action reviews and support those activities with collaborative software to amplify the reach of these actions to more people. The biggest mind shift for managers may be thinking less about one successor and more about ongoing knowledge sharing to larger groups.
PROVIDE STRUCTURE AND CLARITY TO THE PROCESS
Recent retirees indicate clarity of purpose, documentation and role specification is needed from managers to support effective transfer. Twenty percent of those who wrote comments in our survey discussed these types of topics in their advice to improve knowledge transfers. Hofer-Alfeis (2008) offered a detailed process that can be considered. We highlight a few of the questions from that paper here as ideas in your efforts for more clarity. For example, what are business-critical relationships and knowledge networks that need to be created by the retiree and the unit? What are the knowledge assets needed, the documentation and where will it be stored and by whom and when?
LASTLY, CONSIDER CULTURE
Building a competency for knowledge transfer in an organization will also require a culture that values this work. Measurements, rewards, policies and practices reinforce company values. One way to demonstrate the importance is to measure the completion and effectiveness of this work. One could measure if there is a formal and specific plan with content and knowledge-transfer goals for each critical-knowledge category identified in your audit and for each departing retiree who holds that information. Then ultimately measure and give visibility to whether those goals are achieved. Another way to reinforce a culture of knowledge sharing is to implement new policies or programs that support the effort.
The U.S. government's phased-retirement program is an interesting example. Named the Moving Ahead Program, it allows future retirees to shift to a parttime status where they work reduced hours as they begin retirement. The work schedule shifts to one that is half work and half retirement, but with an important stipulation. The program includes a requirement that 20% of hours worked need to be focused on knowledge-sharing activities. That 20% focus and formalization is the critical knowledge-transfer enabler (Clark and Ritter 2020a). Our surveys and workshops from 2018 to 2020 indicated that most companies were not pursuing phased-retirement plans because of management and cost issues (Clark et al. 2019, Clark and Ritter 2020b). Recent Mercer research findings indicate a shift has occurred and offerings of these programs have doubled since before the pandemic (Tergesen and Weber 2022).
Last, you may also want to consider ending a policy or activity. The use of earlyretirement programs that accelerate the rate of retirements has been a practice for workforce reduction for many years. This practice may no longer be prudent. In fact, we found that 60% of risk managers indicated early-retirement packages were not offered in the past year at their organization. An early-retirement incentive could be sending the signal that there is no knowledge to capture from this group and could be accelerating knowledge loss. Leaders must consider all ways to build a knowledge culture and indicate their support of knowledgesharing activities.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGERS
So, what do these findings mean for managers? How can one focus efforts to increase effectiveness of knowledge transfer and minimize knowledge loss? Future retirees can be a potential significant knowledge loss for organizations and, accordingly, this loss is a knowledge-continuity management issue. Our previous research found that orderly retirement of employees is important to business strategy, with 83% of respondents indicating knowledge transfer as a key concern (Clark et al. 2019). We propose that managers focus efforts and resources on future retirees. This offers a more predictable knowledge loss that can be better managed than knowledge loss from other types of employee turnover. We offer practical approaches to be taken to transfer knowledge before it leaves with those retirees.
Recent retiree feedback allows for a view into the knowledge-exchange attempts in the past five years. Their feedback indicates that most efforts were rushed, informal and did not consider the best receivers of the knowledge. Managers hoping for knowledge continuity should conduct a knowledge audit to determine critical information and then consider if potential retirees hold that critical knowledge. They should engage knowledge holders who are potential retirees in a conversation about knowledge sharing of the critical information and develop formal plans with longer time horizons. Those plans should consider knowledge-transfer practices that are problem solving in nature and enable sharing with many instead of with only one person. Efforts should be shifted away from one-to-one, role-based knowledge sharing and succession to efforts that support a culture of knowledge transfer to many people in approaches that better support tacit knowledge transfer and with technology to enable knowledge continuity.
LIMITATIONS AND POTENTIAL AVENUES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
While our research was novel with the identification of 11 methods for knowledge transfer and the inclusion of recent retirees to learn about recent knowledgetransfer activities, it did not collect demographic data on either the retiree or the knowledge receiver. Future research into the ages and genders of the participants in the knowledge-transfer process should include this data to determine if there is any bias that could inhibit the effective knowledge transfer that may need to be mitigated. While our research indicates a need for more time to support effective knowledge transfer, we did not survey to learn about the ideal time for the knowledge transfer. Future research should explore the time needed for a range of activities from complex to the least complex transfers.

One captivating approach is hosting a virtual quiz without relying on keyboards and a mouse but solely utilizing webcams, active internet, and hand gestures. The virtual quiz utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect and track hand gestures through participants' webcams. By mapping specific gestures to different quiz actions, participants can select answers and interact with the quiz interface without the need for traditional input devices. Participants are presented with a series of questions displayed on the screen, and they can indicate their chosen answer by making specific hand gestures. Monitor the participants' webcam feeds attentively to identify their hand gestures. Provide immediate feedback on the accuracy of their responses, indicating whether they are correct or incorrect. This feedback mechanism ensures that the quiz serves as an educational tool, promoting a continuous learning experience. The use of AI in virtual quizzes can enhance the experience by providing personalized learning time-saving quiz generation, instant feedback, and adaptable difficulty. By leveraging webcam technology and hand gestures, this virtual quiz offers a novel and immersive approach to quiz participation. The virtual quiz employs computer vision algorithms to identify and monitor hand movements using participants' webcams. This innovative concept aims to create a fun and engaging experience for participants, encouraging active participation and knowledge retention through gesture-based interactions.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 IEEE International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT) Conference Start Date: 2023, Oct. 26 Conference End Date: 2023, Oct. 29 Conference Location: Venice, Italy In the field of graph-generated text, one of the core issues commonly explored is how to maintain the structural information of the graph to the maximum extent and reduce the problem of knowledge loss during training. Current research has mainly focused on exploring the ability of models to learn graph structures by increasing model size and refining the graph representation. In contrast, our work emphasizes the importance of perceiving and exploring edges in the graph itself. Edges provide a wide variety of structures to the graph structure, offering it freedom and diversity. Therefore, improving the model's ability to perceive edges could potentially enhance the task metrics of graph generation for text. To address this, we propose a graph-generated text model MKGS that maintains the original structure of the knowledge graph, effectively reducing knowledge loss during the learning process. Our approach achieves this at three levels: reorganizing the knowledge sequence as input to the model, enhancing edge perception during processing, and incorporating a graph rational activation function at the output. We validate our method using the Kg-to-text benchmark dataset WebNLG, where MKGS achieves a score of 66.22%. Additionally, the model exhibits fewer syntactic errors and produces smoother expressions in the generated text.

Abstract: Background In 2016, the Canada-International HIV and Rehabilitation Research Collaborative established a framework of research priorities in HIV, aging and rehabilitation. Our aim was to review and identify any new emerging priorities from the perspectives of people living with HIV, clinicians, researchers, and representatives from community organizations. Methods We conducted a multi-stakeholder international consultation with people living with HIV, researchers, clinicians and representatives of community-based organizations. Stakeholders convened for a one-day Forum in Manchester, United Kingdom (UK) to discuss research priorities via a web-based questionnaire and facilitated discussions. We analyzed data using conventional content analytical techniques and mapped emerging priorities onto the foundational framework. Results Thirty-five stakeholders from the UK(n = 29), Canada(n = 5) and Ireland(n = 1) attended the Forum, representing persons living with HIV or representatives from community-based organizations(n = 12;34%), researchers or academics(n = 10;28%), service providers(n = 6;17%), clinicians(n = 4;11%); and trainees(n = 4;11%).

Full text: Introduction
People with HIV are living longer and aging with increased physical, mental and social health-related challenges [1]. COVID-19, alongside associated years of quarantine measures and shifts towards telemedicine, has increased health complexities and social isolation among adults living with HIV, highlighting the need for innovative interventions [2,3,4]. Rehabilitation interventions focused on physical and mental health have an important role in preventing and reducing disability for adults aging with HIV [5,6,7].
The World Health Organization defines ‘healthy aging’ as “the process of redeveloping and maintaining functional ability that enables well-being in older age”, recognizing the interaction between personal and environmental factors that influence health [8] Lazarus and colleagues (2016) proposed a fourth “90”, to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) global target of “90–90-90” stating that 90% of people living with HIV with undetectable viral load should report good health-related quality of life [9], which can be extrapolated to the updated 95-95-95 target [10]. Lazarus et al. (2023) went on to establish a Long Term Success Framework living with HIV, that highlighted optimizing health related quality of life as a key goal for persons living with HIV [11]. Achieving this success would require an integrated person-centered approach to care that goes beyond viral suppression to consider multimorbidity, and include comprehensive person-centred approaches to care that optimize self-perceived quality of life for persons living with HIV [9, 11,12,13,14]. Rehabilitation is well positioned to achieve long term success aging with HIV as it involves the dynamic process of prevention or treatment activities and services that address symptoms, functional limitations and social participation restrictions.
The Canada-International (originally Canada-UK) HIV and Rehabilitation Research Collaborative (CIHRRC) is a network of researchers, clinicians, people living with HIV, representatives from community organizations and policy stakeholders formed in 2009 with an aim to translate knowledge and identify emerging priorities in HIV and rehabilitation research [15]. In 2016, members of this collaborative convened in Canada to develop the Framework of Research Priorities in HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation comprised of seven research priorities: (i) nature, extent and impact of disability, concurrent health conditions and chronic inflammation with HIV; (ii) prevalence, severity and impact of frailty; (iii) community and social participation aging with HIV; (iv) strategies for chronic disease management and healthy aging with HIV; (v) facilitators and barriers to access and engagement in, rehabilitation; (vi) effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for healthy aging with HIV; and (vii) advancing development and use of patient reported outcome measures in HIV and aging [16]. These seven priorities spanned three content areas: A–Episodic Health and Disability Aging with HIV; B-Rehabilitation Interventions for Healthy Aging across the Lifespan and C–Outcome Measurement in HIV and Aging. Since the development of this Framework, web-based interventions, digital health technology, and tele-health and rehabilitation models of care delivery have increasingly emerged in the context of HIV and aging [17,18,19,20,21]. As such, it is critical to revisit these research priorities seven years after the original development of the Framework, to consider their sustained relevance, identify new priorities, and establish a coordinated research response to address disability, and promote health outcomes among people aging with HIV.
Our aim was to review and build upon the previously published Framework of Research Priorities in HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation [16] to identify emerging research priorities from the perspectives of people living with HIV, clinicians, researchers, representatives from community organizations.
Methods
We conducted a multi-stakeholder in-person international consultation with people living with HIV, researchers, clinicians and representatives of community-based organizations to identify priorities related to HIV, aging and rehabilitation. Stakeholders convened for a one-day in-person International Forum on HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation Research: Aging in an Uncertain World, held in collaboration with the Canada-International HIV and Rehabilitation Research Collaborative (CIHRRC), at the University of Manchester, UK on May 20, 2023. The objectives of the Forum were aimed at: (1) facilitating knowledge transfer and exchange on HIV and rehabilitation interventions (including online/tele-rehabilitation) to promote HIV and aging research and clinical practice; (2) establishing new research and clinical partnerships in HIV and aging internationally; (3) fostering mentorship and training in HIV and aging research; and (4) identifying emerging issues and research priorities in rehabilitation interventions for people aging with HIV. Our focus in this report is on the research priorities that emerged from this consultation in the context of HIV, aging and rehabilitation.
Ethics
We reviewed the need for ethics approval with the University of Toronto Health Sciences Research Ethics Board and the University of Manchester Institutional Review Board who confirmed that given the consultative nature of the Forum, this work did not require ethics approval.
Stakeholders
We invited people living with HIV, clinicians, academics, representatives from community-based organizations, community members, and members of the CIHRRC with interest and expertise in aging, HIV and rehabilitation. We promoted the Forum through email and website communications to members of CIHRRC, the University of Manchester, and community-based local organizations in Manchester, UK. Forum speakers further promoted the Forum via targeted invitations and word-of-mouth among stakeholders with an interest in HIV, aging and rehabilitation.
Forum program
Fourteen invited speakers from the UK, Canada and Ireland presented on research and models of community and clinical practice delivery among adults aging with HIV. The Forum included one keynote speaker, two research evidence sessions comprised of nine presentations, and one panel discussion with facilitated discussion throughout. The keynote presentation focused on an overview of 30 Years of HIV and Rehabilitation Research and how the past may inform future research. The first research evidence session included five speaker presentations focused on the Role of Mental Health in HIV and Aging and Rehabilitation. The second research evidence session included four speaker presentations focused on Frailty and Rehabilitation Interventions Aging with HIV. The panel discussion session with five speakers focused on Technology-Based Interventions for Enhancing Physical and Mental Health Outcomes for People Aging with HIV. The Forum concluded with a large group discussion focused on identifying emerging issues, priority areas and next steps for future research. See Additional File 1 for the Forum Program. Videos and speaker slides of the Forum presentations are accessible here: https://cihrrc.ca/forums/2023-manchester-forum/.
Data pertaining to stakeholder perspectives on research priorities were collected using the following four strategies:
*
Prior to the Forum, attendees were asked to submit responses to the following questions, ‘In your opinion, what have been key achievements in HIV, aging and rehabilitation research?’ and ‘In your opinion, what are 2–3 key research priorities in the area of HIV, aging and rehabilitation that are essential for moving the field forward?’ [strategy 1];
*
During the Forum, two graduate trainee rapporteurs documented discussion during presentations and group discussion [strategy 2];
*
During the Forum, attendees documented their ideas related to emerging research priorities on chart paper [strategy 3]; and
*
After the Forum, attendees were asked to complete an evaluation form that included the following questions: ‘What are the three most important “take-home messages” that you heard at the Forum?’, and ‘In your opinion, what are 1 or 2 new and emerging issues related to HIV, aging and rehabilitation interventions that were not covered in the Forum?’ [strategy 4]
We used the collective responses, discussion, and feedback derived from these sources as the foundation for identifying the priorities. We collated and analyzed the data using conventional content analytical techniques [22]. We mapped the priorities onto the existing Framework of Research Priorities in HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation [16].
A core team (FIC, KKO, KB, GD) reviewed all sources of data, coded and clustered codes into categories to represent research priorities in HIV, aging and rehabilitation. These same members of the Core Team (KKO, FIC, KB, GD), met to review the data, identify research priority areas derived from the coding process, cluster the priority areas into broader content areas, and map them onto the original Framework of Research Priorities for HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation [16]. The priorities were circulated once to speakers and rapporteurs of the Forum for their review and refinement, and reviewed and finalized by members of the authorship team.
Results
Of the 54 stakeholders who registered for the International Forum on HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation Research (19 speakers; 2 rapporteurs; 33 attendees), 35 (65%) attended the event from the UK (n = 29), Canada (n = 5) and Ireland (n = 1). The majority of stakeholders represented persons living with HIV or representatives from community-based organizations (n = 12; 34%) and/or researchers or academics (n = 10; 28%), service providers (n = 6; 17%), clinicians (n = 4; 11%); and trainees (n = 4; 11%). Researchers and clinicians were primarily rehabilitation professionals (physiotherapists or occupational therapists), physicians (infectious diseases), and nurses. Stakeholders worked in community-based organizations (n = 15; 43%), academic institutions (n = 12; 34%); hospital or community healthcare organizations (n = 6; 17%), or in non-governmental or private organization (n = 2; 6%). Of the 35 stakeholders, 19 (54%) were speakers at the Forum.
Research priorities in HIV, aging and rehabilitation
Evidence presented at the Forum aligned with the Framework of Research Priorities in HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation by addressing the following areas: disability, frailty, social participation, access to and impact of rehabilitation, and patient-reported outcome measures in HIV and aging. The focus on rehabilitation interventions and strategies for healthy aging with HIV included digital health and web-based interventions and supportive networks.
Five priorities emerged from the Forum, all of which aligned with the original priorities, and three component content areas of the original 2016 Framework [16]: A–Episodic Health, Multimorbidity and Disability Aging with HIV (i) episodic disability and uncertainty, ii) frailty, iii) social participation); B–Rehabilitation Interventions for Healthy Aging across the Lifespan (iv) examining the role, implementation and impact of digital and web-based rehabilitation interventions with adults aging with HIV) and C–Outcome Measurement in HIV and Aging (v) using digital health technology to measure physical activity). Stakeholders highlighted the importance of learning from the broader aging and rehabilitation field, and the importance of knowledge transfer and exchange among researchers, clinicians, people living with HIV, trainees, and the broader community (Table 1). The research priorities related to web-based and digital health interventions build on the priorities in the original Framework, strengthening the scaffold for collaborations on research related to rehabilitation interventions to promote healthy aging with HIV. We describe more detail in each of the priorities areas below.
[IMAGE OMITTED: SEE PDF]
Component A – Episodic health, multimorbidity and disability aging with HIV
Stakeholders emphasized the importance of addressing i) episodic disability and uncertainty, ii) frailty, and iii) social participation among adults aging with HIV across the lifespan (which align with Priorities 1–3 in the original Framework) (Table 1).
1. i.
Episodic disability & uncertainty
Stakeholders highlighted the importance of examining the nature and severity of episodic disability (physical, cognitive, mental-emotional, daily activities, social inclusion), and specifically the uncertainty that may be experienced among adults aging with HIV across the lifespan. This included examining episodic disability in the context of longstanding and historic HIV pharmacological interventions among older adults with HIV.
2. ii.
Frailty and other concurrent health conditions
Stakeholders identified the importance of examining disability associated with frailty in combination with other health conditions across the life span, including but not limited to, osteoporosis, menopause, chronic pain, cardiovascular disease. Considerations of biological age versus time since HIV diagnosis was highlighted by stakeholders and the importance of considering the life course of adults aging with HIV (regardless of time of HIV diagnosis) and distinguishing between different phenotypic forms of frailty: weakness, slowness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and unintentional weight loss. Stakeholders highlighted an evidence to practice gap on frailty, aging and HIV and the need for a better understanding among researchers and clinicians on how to prevent, detect and address frailty in adults aging with HIV.
3. iii.
Social participation, engagement and relationships among adults aging with HIV
Stakeholders highlighted the importance for researchers to consider the social and interpersonal needs of adults aging with HIV and the emotional, sexual health, intimacy and connectedness associated with relationships among adults aging with HIV. While stakeholders acknowledged this priority in the original Framework, they emphasized the relevance of social connectedness due to a lack of in-person interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stakeholders discussed how the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated changes in how people interacted socially and maximized the use of digital resources where possible. While stakeholders acknowledged positively enhancements to social interactions with digital technology, others cautioned the digital divide, lack of access and digital literacy that could limit social engagement among adults aging with HIV.
Component B—Rehabilitation interventions for healthy aging across the lifespan
Stakeholders highlighted the need to examine the role, implementation and impact of digital health and web-based rehabilitation technologies, which aligned with Priority 6 in the original Framework. This examines the role of technology (wireless physical activity monitors, online apps, websites, social media, online tele-coaching) in augmenting engagement in rehabilitation interventions among adults aging with HIV (Table 1).
1. iv.
Role, implementation and impact of digital and web-based rehabilitation interventions and health technologies
Stakeholders discussed the need to examine the uptake and usage of digital health technologies among adults aging with HIV and health and rehabilitation providers, and evidence-based person-centred approaches to digital technology and web-based rehabilitation interventions. Stakeholders also raised the potential role and impact of artificial intelligence for rehabilitation (adaptation, implementation, trust) among adults aging with HIV. Stakeholders highlighted the importance of considering the costs associated with implementation of digital health interventions, and financial barriers to accessing online interventions, which may be limited by financial, policy, or programmatic barriers. Future research should examine different models of implementation of digital health technology, their cost and accessibility in the context of aging with HIV.
Component C – Outcome measurement in HIV and aging research
Stakeholders identified the potential role for digital health technology to measure engagement in physical activity among adults aging with HIV, which aligned with Priority 7 in the original Framework (advancing the development and use of patients reported outcome measures in HIV, aging and rehabilitation) (Table 1).
1. v.
Using digital and web-based rehabilitation health technology to measure physical activity
Stakeholders identified the potential for evaluating the impact of rehabilitation interventions including web-based interventions and digital health tools (such as wearables, wireless physical activity monitors, apps, gamification) on engagement in social connectedness interventions, and physical activity and the potential impact on disability and health outcomes among adults aging with HIV.
Collectively, stakeholders acknowledged that digital health technology in HIV and aging was not a one-size fits all approach, nor a replacement for in-person health and rehabilitation services or HIV care. There still exists a role and importance and need for in-person models of delivery, and while basic forms of technology (e.g. telephone for fostering peer-support) may be simple, they can be effective. While technology may serve as a potential tool to facilitate engagement and mitigate fragmentation of health, social and rehabilitation services for persons aging with HIV, there is a need to balance technology interventions with individual need, access, literacy and comfort.
Methodological considerations, knowledge translation and exchange
Methodological considerations for addressing these research priorities also emerged from the consultation that complemented the original Framework of Research Priorities. Stakeholders recommended that researchers consider barriers to engaging in research, such as stigma, and the need for culturally safe, anti-oppressive and age-sensitive approaches to research on rehabilitation to better engage adults aging with HIV. For example, strategies for better engaging women, Indigenous and Métis adults aging with HIV in colonized countries such as Canada, persons who use drugs, racialized groups, individuals in rural geographical regions as well as those who may be experiencing stigma and fear of disclosure. Community-engaged approaches, involving people living with HIV in all aspects of the rehabilitation research is critical for ensuring the research is meaningful and relevant to the community.
Given the focus on rehabilitation interventions, attendees highlighted the importance of implementation science approaches for assessing how interventions are taken up and their impact in the ‘real world’ setting, and how interventions might be adopted in the broader context of policy and programs for adults aging with HIV [23, 24]. Attendees highlighted the need to examine public health policies and the importance of linking research to practice and programs that improve health outcomes for adults aging with HIV. Specific methodological considerations raised by stakeholders pertained to digital health technology, including the importance of implementing digital and web-based rehabilitation interventions into research and practice. Technology was highlighted as a potential catalyst or channel to facilitate communication among patients and providers (not the end goal or intervention itself).
Some final considerations, recommendations or key messages from the Forum included: recognizing that old and new technologies are both important for enhancing rehabilitation among adults aging with HIV, including engaging in physical activity, and fostering personal connections with other peers, health or rehabilitation providers, or fitness personnel. Stakeholders described technology as a vehicle of communication, and the importance of clear communication to wide audiences pertaining to terms in areas of physical rehabilitation and aging such as frailty, vulnerability, susceptibility and social vulnerability. Of note, the concept, and the very mention, of aging can yield different conceptualizations for different people and is important to consider in approaching research.
Discussion
The five priorities raised by stakeholders align with and build upon the original Framework of Research Priorities in HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation in all areas of disability, rehabilitation interventions, and outcomes focusing on the role, implementation and impact of digital health technology in HIV, aging and rehabilitation. Stakeholders outlined the overlapping importance of examining episodic disability in the context of rehabilitation interventions; and the use of digital health technology dually as an intervention and outcome measure of physical activity.
Digital health technology emerged from the Forum as a potential mechanism for rehabilitation, HIV assessment and interventions among adults aging with HIV. This was a reflection of the Forum program, which comprised of research evidence presentations on online forms of rehabilitation and HIV care delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic changed the course of health care delivery and thrust online models of HIV and rehabilitation care delivery into the forefront of care (3, 25). The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the complexity of health challenges (e.g. social isolation, mental health) and disrupted models of rehabilitation care delivery. Technology has been used widely for education, accessing health and rehabilitation services, and implementing interventions in the context of HIV; this includes smartphone and app technology to facilitate engagement in care, medication adherence, neurocognitive assessment, and exercise [26,27,28,29], virtual driving test platforms to assess the ability to drive among persons with HIV and neurocognitive impairment [30], and tele-health exercise interventions with adults aging with HIV [20, 31, 32]. Artificial intelligence also is used with older adults for remote patient monitoring and smart home technology [33,34,35], assessment of mobility with mobility disorders [36, 37] or dementia [38], as well as facilitating rehabilitation assessment and treatment in order adults [39]. Nevertheless, stakeholders in this consultation highlighted that online forms of rehabilitation were not a one-size-fits-all, and not always a replacement for in-person interventions. This was supported by evidence reporting variable uptake and declining use of wireless physical activity monitors (WPAMs) among adults living with HIV engaged in a community-based exercise intervention [21] and barriers and facilitators to uptake of WPAMs in the context of HIV [40]. Similarly, the priorities from this Forum are supported by variability in digital health literacy documented among older adult populations during the COVID-19 pandemic [41, 42]. Stakeholders also highlighted the limitations of technology, balancing online and in-person approaches, and taking individualized approaches for weaving digital health technology into rehabilitation HIV care. They identified the need for evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of online rehabilitation interventions. Considerations implementing rehabilitation interventions using online or digital forms of technology should consider person-specific approaches taking into account accessibility, digital literacy, and delivery in the context of HIV [43].
The role, implementation and impact of digital health technology was closely interwoven with the priority of examining social connectedness and participation among adults aging with HIV. This was not surprising given the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on increases in disability, specifically uncertainty and mental health and social connectedness among persons living with HIV [4]. Furthermore, adults aging with HIV can face barriers of stigma, lack of education or a supportive or supervised environment to engage in rehabilitation interventions such as physical activity or exercise [44]. Rehabilitation interventions focused on enhancing social connections online is a potential intervention but may be difficult for some, and may not occur naturally in online settings. Future work should consider online rehabilitation interventions that allocate dedicated time for users to interact with each other and establish a comfort and rapport in an online setting [43].
The original Framework of Research Priorities for HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation [16] still resonated with stakeholders who suggested important updates, refinements and emerging issues. While encouraging to see that research in this field will continue to align with community need, it is also disheartening to see how little progress is felt by people living with HIV and other stakeholders regarding these priorities. This may be attributed to the pace and extent to which HIV and rehabilitation research is funded, implemented, and translated to practice. Furthermore, while these priorities appear to recognize the complexity of mental health and social connectedness faced by adults aging with HIV following the COVID-19 pandemic, this work highlights the ongoing relevance and importance of these priorities given the increasing proportion of older adults aging with HIV [4, 45]. Furthermore, these priorities align with, and complement the Long Term Success Framework by Lazarus and colleagues (2023) which outlines a holistic approach to the care of people aging with HIV spanning sustained undetectable viral load, minimal impact of treatment and clinical monitoring, optimizing health-related quality of life, lifelong integration of care, and freedom of discrimination [11]. Within the health-related quality of life pillar, authors highlight the role of patient-reported outcome measures in identifying and addressing needs of persons aging with HIV, empowering them to actively engage in their healthcare plan, which specifically aligns with Component C -Outcome Measurement in HIV and Aging Research in our Framework. Overall, results provide a focus on priorities related to disability, and digital health technology and highlight ongoing issues of implementation, methodological considerations and knowledge translation in the field for those aging with HIV.
These research priorities were developed from the perspectives of a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders with longstanding clinical, research and lived experiential expertise in HIV, aging and rehabilitation. We used a community-engaged approach involving people living with HIV in the consultation and development of the priorities. We built on the foundational Framework of Research Priorities in HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation [16] which subsequently was built on preceding research priorities [46], ensuring we identified current pertinent issues. Our team has strong history of research practice and lived expertise in HIV rehabilitation and aging.
Limitations
This study has numerous limitations. We did not use a formal Delphi or nominal group technique to identify the priorities. Nevertheless we used multiple strategies to elicit perspectives on priorities such as web-based and in-person discussions. Our consultation was focused to stakeholders within Canada and the UK, and lacked representation of stakeholders from other high-income countries as well as low to middle-income countries conducting work in HIV, aging and disability. While these priorities were developed through a rehabilitation lens, addressing them will require collaborative and interprofessional and community-engaged approaches involving HIV, primary and geriatric care teams, social work, and psychology, in addition to rehabilitation to move the field forward. We acknowledge the field is continually evolving and new priorities will emerge as the course of HIV progresses and the role for rehabilitation in the context of HIV continues to grow.
Conclusions
Results from the stakeholder consultation indicated the sustained relevance and importance of the original Framework of Research Priorities in HIV, Aging and Rehabilitation [16], while highlighting further depth and areas of inquiry related to digital and web-based rehabilitation interventions and technology in the context of aging with HIV. Findings offer a foundation for collaboration in future research and practice. Specific considerations to foster timely, appropriate and effective rehabilitation involving web-based digital rehabilitation interventions and models of delivery are needed.

Abstract: Konuşma dili, insanlar arasındaki iletişimin kurulmasında tarihsel yapı ile beraber kültürel birikimlerin aktarılmasını sağlamaktadır. Gelecek nesillere bir kurallar bütününün aktarılması böylelikle mümkün hale gelmektedir. Aynı dili konuşan kişilerden ziyade farklı dili konuşan kişiler arasında da kültürel ve bilgi aktarımı bulunmaktadır. Ülkelerin kendi aralarında kurdukları etkileşim ve iletişim arttıkça yeni bir dil öğrenmeye ilişkin ihtiyaç da ortaya çıkmaktadır. Giderek küreselleşen dünyamızda yaygın olarak yabancı bir dilin konuşulması, ülkeler içerisindeki teknoloji, turizm ve sanayi gibi faaliyetlerin gerçekleşmesini etkilemektedir. Bu nedenle, ülkelerin sürekli olarak başka bir yabancı dili öğrenme ihtiyacı oluşmuş ve böylece yabancı dili öğrenmeye ilişkin farklı ders kitapları yayınlanmıştır. Bu araştırmada, Rusya’da Rus araştırmacılarının hazırladığı eserler üzerine araştırma yapılmış ve bu eserler arasında dil bilgisi odaklı eserler incelenmiştir. Söz konusu olan bu eserler içerisinde en kapsamlı olan Şçeka’nın “Интенсивный курс турецкого языка” (Yoğun Türkçe Kursu) adlı eseri örneklem olarak alınıp bu ders kitabındaki dil bilgisi konuları öğretim yöntem ve yaklaşımları, konuları, konuların sıralanması, niteliği, ADP’ye uygunluğu, ölçütleri, alıştırmalar açısından irdelenmiştir. Alternate abstract: Spoken language enables the establishment of communication between people and the transfer of cultural accumulations along with historical structures. Thus, it becomes possible to transmit a set of rules to future generations. Cultural and knowledge transfer can occur not only among people who speak the same language but also among those who speak different languages. As interaction and communication between countries increase, there arises a need to learn a new language. The widespread use of a foreign language in our increasingly globalized world affects activities such as technology, tourism, and industry within countries. Therefore, countries have a constant need to learn another foreign language, and various textbooks for learning foreign languages have been published as a result. This study examines research on works prepared by Russian researchers in Russia and focuses on grammar-focused works. Among these works, the most comprehensive is the course book of Sheka, “Интенсивный курс турецкого языка” (Intensive Course in Turkish Language), which is taken as a sample. The grammar topics in this textbook, teaching methods and approaches, the sequence and quality of the topics, their conformity to ELP (European Language Portfolio) standards, and exercises are analyzed.

Abstract: Construction projects are facing an increase in requirements since the projects are getting larger, more technology is integrated into the buildings, and new sustainability and CO 2 equivalent emissions requirements are introduced. As a result, requirement management quickly gets overwhelming, and instead of having systematic requirement management, the construction industry tends to trust craftsmanship. One method for a more systematic requirement management approach successful in other industries is the systems engineering approach, focusing on requirement decomposition and linking proper verifications and validations. This research project explores if a systems engineering approach, supported by natural language processing techniques, can enable more systematic requirement management in construction projects and facilitate knowledge transfer from completed projects to new tendering projects. The first part of the project explores how project requirements can be extracted, digitised, and analysed in an automated way and how this can benefit the tendering specialists. The study is conducted by first developing a work support tool targeting tendering specialists and then evaluating the challenges and benefits of such a tool through a workshop and surveys. The second part of the project explores inspection data generated in production software as a requirement and quality verification method. First, a dataset containing over 95000 production issues is examined to understand the data quality level of standardisation. Second, a survey addressing production specialists evaluates the current benefits of digital inspection reporting. Third, future benefits of using inspection data for knowledge transfers are explored by applying the Knowledge Discovery in Databases method and clustering techniques. The results show that applying natural language processing techniques can be a helpful tool for analysing construction project requirements, facilitating the identification of essential requirements, and enabling benchmarking between projects. The results from the clustering process suggested in this thesis show that inspection data can be used as a knowledge base for future projects and quality improvement within a project-based organisation. However, higher data quality and standardisation would benefit the knowledge-generation process. This research project provides insights into how artificial intelligence can facilitate knowledge transfer, enable data-informed design choices in tendering projects, and automate the requirements analysis in construction projects as a possible step towards more systematic requirements management.

Full text: 1. Introduction
Technological advancements have significantly influenced the education landscape, propelling traditional teaching methodologies into immersive and interactive learning experiences [1]. Transformative technologies like Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are at the forefront, indicating a new epoch in the realm of education [2].
AR is the fusion of digital information with the physical environment, allowing users to interact with virtual elements effortlessly without concentrating on a device’s screen [3]. Consequently, AR distinguishes itself from alternative interaction paradigms by facilitating users to sustain an uninterrupted connection with their environment, thus keeping their attention fixed on the real world. The absence of contextual isolation leads to the creation of an augmented real world. AR capitalizes on a user’s visual and spatial abilities. AR increases the real world by layering extra information rather than engrossing the user into an isolated virtual world confined to the computer [4,5]. In an educational context, Virtual Reality (VR) refers to the use of immersive digital environments and simulations to enhance teaching and learning experiences. It allows students to engage with educational content in a more interactive and experiential way, often going beyond traditional methods of instruction. Unlike AR, VR exists in an entirely artificial environment, where participants are either immersive or non-immersive members of the simulated world. In VR, users can interact with and manipulate computer-generated objects through haptic interfaces while fully engaged in the virtual environment [6].
In the education context, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) diverge in their approaches to enhancing learning experiences. VR engulfs students in a fully immersive digital world, facilitated by headsets that transport them entirely into computer-generated environments. With VR, students can explore simulated realms, interact with objects, and navigate through intricate scenarios. This technology is often harnessed for immersive simulations, historical recreations, and intricate scientific explorations, providing an unmatched level of engagement and enabling students to vividly comprehend complex concepts.
Conversely, Augmented Reality (AR) seamlessly overlays digital elements onto the real world, allowing students to simultaneously perceive both their physical surroundings and digitally added components through devices like screens or mobile devices. AR amplifies real-world experiences by supplementing them with contextual information. Students can interact with physical objects enriched with digital annotations or access 3D models that pop up within their actual environment. AR serves as an informative layer that enhances tangible experiences, making it particularly useful for guided tours, interactive visualizations, and real-time data integration. Unlike VR, AR maintains a bridge to the real world, fostering a blend of physical and digital interactions that offer a unique way to augment education.
The application of AR and VR in educational settings has the potential to revolutionize how knowledge is acquired and applied, providing students with unparalleled opportunities to engage with content, explore complex concepts, and interact with virtual environments. Consequently, this has culminated in the emergence of the metaverse in the education landscape. The gradual transformation of the metaverse concept from mere science fiction to a tangible reality has revolutionized the perception and interaction with the digital world. The idea of the Metaverse, a shared virtual space that blends augmented reality, virtual reality, and the internet, was introduced by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel Snow Crash [7]. In recent years, technological advancements have propelled the metaverse concept from speculative fiction to a concrete possibility with substantial implications for various industries, including education. Researchers have extensively discussed the metaverse concept and have presented diverse viewpoints on its definition [8]. Lee et al. [9] depict the metaverse as a blend of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persisted virtual space. Ning et al. [10] consider it a modern category of internet applications and social structure that merges several advanced technologies. In education, the metaverse is perceived as a new space where people can socially interact, requiring proactive measures from higher educational institutions to assimilate it into the teaching and instructional experiences [11]. Likewise, Schlemmer and Backles [12] highlight that the metaverse provides immersive possibilities of 3D digital virtual worlds, which rely on avatars for communication and interaction to generate a sense of presence.
Nevertheless, because of technological progress and its increasing impact, researchers contend that the metaverse has developed beyond its prior definition, necessitating a new outlook. Among new definitions, a recent study emphasizes the classification of the metaverse into four distinct scenarios, comprising augmented reality, lifelogging, presence of virtual worlds, and mirror worlds as integral components of the metaverse setup [13]. Park and Kim [14] argue that integrating mobile technology and deep learning has enabled ubiquitous access to the metaverse, resulting in a more immersive environment than its predecessors. In light of these dynamic shifts, researchers claim that one of the most consequential applications of the metaverse is in the field of education. This conviction originates from the concept that the metaverse can function as a pioneering education setting, blending metaverse-related technologies with elements from both the virtual and real education spheres [15,16]. The advent of new technologies, such as wearable devices, allows learners to effortlessly access this educational environment anytime, anywhere, and participate in live interactions, using digital personas with various entities such as avatars, chatbots, and virtual learning tools. This learning environment provides learners with a profound sense of presence while being physically present in the real-world educational context. From this perspective, integrating the metaverse in education promises to unlock many extraordinary learning experiences for students [17].
Creating a learning environment that centers around the learners is a crucial benefit of these educational innovations. This approach fosters the uptake of novel pedagogical techniques and the assimilation of innovative and instructional methodologies into the educational process [18]. Given the surging interest among researchers in AR and VR technologies, various reviews and systematic mappings have explored these technologies in the educational context. However, it has been noted that many studies emphasize specific aspects of education or solely focus on AR or VR technologies. Prior research is often specific to particular target audiences. It fails to encompass the diverse educational context ranging from K-12 education, higher education, job training, distance education, medical education, and vocational training. Moreover, several aspects remain unexplored, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of implementing AR and VR applications in education.
To bridge this research gap, this study concentrated on the following fundamental questions:
- What are the research trends and feasibility of AR/VR in education?

- How does integrating AR and VR in classroom instructions influence students’ academic performance and learning outcomes?

- What are the effects of utilizing AR and VR technologies on student engagement, motivation, and interest in the learning process compared to traditional instructional methods?

- How do AR and VR simulations enhance students’ understanding and retention of complex concepts?

- What are the perceptions and attitudes of educators and students toward implementing AR and VR in educational settings, and how do these perceptions impact the successful integration of these technologies?

- How do various factors such as technical accessibility, training for educators, and content design influence AR and VR’s effective adoption and sustainability in different educational contexts?

- What is the overall impact of incorporating AR and VR technologies in educational settings and the learning experience?



By addressing these questions, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits and challenges associated with implementing AR and VR technologies in education, ultimately paving the way for more informed and effective integration of these transformative technologies in diverse educational settings.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Strategy
To facilitate a comprehensive review with a broad scope, we adopted a flexible framework for this narrative review, as recommended in the literature [19,20]. A narrative review is helpful in presenting extensive coverage of existing literature and allowing for flexibility in incorporating evidence to evolving concepts, knowledge, outcomes, historical perspectives, and critical areas that require greater attention for further development in the area of interest [21]. The purpose of including a narrative literature review is because of its reliability in exploring specific areas of the subject domain, allowing for the critical assessment and summarization of existing theories and concepts. Adopting such an approach is beneficial in identifying recurring patterns and emerging trends within the literature, while also pinpointing gaps within the existing body of literature. This study adopted a narrative systematic review that employed certain strengths of systematic reviews, such as a structured search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study selection, and data extraction. The established narrative review methodology for this study was shaped by recommendations from prevailing narrative review frameworks and drew inspiration from numerous studies that have effectively employed this approach, resulting in favorable outcomes in their conducted reviews [22,23,24,25,26,27,28].
A complete literature review was undertaken by exhaustively investigating primary databases, such as Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, ACM Digital Library, IEEE, Google Scholar, Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), and the National Library of Medicine NIH, which were searched from the past ten years up to the date of the search, and manual searching of the reference lists was conducted. A literature review that delves into research conducted a decade ago serves as a significant academic endeavor with multifaceted benefits. By collating studies spanning this substantial timeframe, such analyses offer a panoramic synthesis of the evolution of knowledge on a specific subject.
The search terms used were a combination of keywords and terms related to “Augmented Reality”, “Virtual Reality”, “AR/VR in Education”, “Augmented Technology in STEM”, “K-12 Education Using VR and AR”, “Metaverse in Education”, “AR/VR Platforms for Distance Education”, “Medical Education with AR and VR”, “Professional Training with Augmented Technologies”, and other related concepts. Additionally, the references in the relevant studies were searched manually using interrelated concepts, such as ICT in education, AR/VR gamification for education, reviews on AR and VR in higher education, virtual and augmented reality in primary education, recent developments in AR and VR for education, and mobile augmented reality application for teaching and learning.
2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The review was conducted according to specific inclusion criteria. Studies were included if they focused on AR and VR technologies within educational contexts and reported empirical findings concerning learning outcomes, educational experiences, or learner attitudes toward AR/VR technologies in education. Studies reporting student or teacher participation across different age groups in education were included. The review also considered studies that underwent a peer-review process and conference proceedings or book chapters written in English.
2.3. Study Selection
The study selection process involved two stages: (1) title and abstract screening and (2) full-text review. Two independent reviewers conducted the initial screening based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In cases where the abstract lacked sufficient information for the area of interest, the reviewers would thoroughly examine the entire article to ensure accuracy and relevance. Any discrepancies were solved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer if necessary. The studies selected for the review require a case study, an experimental or a quasi-experimental design focusing on examining the learning outcomes of using AR/VR in an educational setting. The review included studies that presented interventions of AR/VR with participants divided into either the treatment or control group. Figure 1 shows a flowchart of literature inclusion.
A total of 789 literature sources from the past ten years (2014–2023) were initially screened, focusing on AR/VR implementation from a broader perspective. The literature sources have been primarily identified from Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, and IEEE and Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC). After reviewing the abstracts and availability, 400 studies were considered for further assessment. This subset identified studies specifically addressing AR/VR implementation in education, with distinct focus areas such as K-12 education, distance education, medical education, higher education, professional training, and language learning, resulting in 237 studies for further consideration. Subsequently, the subset underwent a thorough quality assessment to identify peer-review studies, excluding preprints or papers with only abstract availability.
Additionally, literature in languages other than English was excluded. The rigorous screening process led to the exclusion of a total of 155 articles, comprising non-peer-reviewed articles (52), non-English articles (75), and articles that did not meet the required quality criteria (28). For the final selection, the review included 82 articles that met the inclusion criteria and were meticulously analyzed to extract valuable insights.

2.5. Data Synthesis
Due to expected heterogeneity in study designs and outcomes, a narrative approach was adopted. This involved qualitatively summarizing data from included studies to identify trends, common themes, and patterns related to the effectiveness of AR and VR technologies in education.
2.6. Bias Evaluation
A clear and well-defined approach was established to eliminate bias in the review, encompassing the research question, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and data extraction method. This approach ensures to maintain transparency and reduces selective reporting risks. An extensive and unbiased search was conducted across multiple databases and supplemented by hand-searching techniques to minimize publication bias and ensure comprehensive inclusion of studies. To address conflicts and discrepancies during the review process, an additional reviewer facilitated open discussions and resolved any issues. This collaborative approach enhanced the robustness and objectivity of the review. The review prioritized transparency in presenting its findings.
3. Findings
Researchers and educators have shown significant interest in integrating AR and VR technologies across various educational contexts. This study comprehensively reviews the literature on AR/VR in different educational settings while exploring its effects on learning outcomes, student engagement, and instructional practices. Each section delves into distinct educational contexts, examining the effectiveness and outcomes of the studies that have employed AR and VR in their respective domain. The findings analyze the research question and present various distributions of the studies identified during the review.
3.1. Distribution According to Educational Levels
Figure 3 showcases the distribution of studies utilizing AR/VR technologies in education across different educational settings. Upon analyzing Figure 3, it becomes evident that over the past ten years (2014–2023), most AR and VR interventions have been implemented in higher education. Following closely behind are postsecondary, secondary, and elementary education settings. However, as the educational level decreases to the junior levels, the research focusing on immersive technologies for education at these levels notably declines. These findings suggest that immersive technologies are more suitable for mature learners who better understand technology applications. At junior levels, the effectiveness of such technologies might not be as pronounced, and they could be perceived more as recreational interventions rather than educational tools.
Over the past five years, from 2019 to the present, there have been notable fluctuations in the number of studies focusing on AR and VR technologies. However, the analysis demonstrated a consistent and sustained interest in applying these technologies in higher education and postsecondary settings. On the other hand, other relevant areas have remained similar, with limited variations in the published studies. Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize that some of the fluctuations observed in the published studies can be attributed to the impact of the pandemic during the period under evaluation. In addition, the use of AR and VR for junior learners, including kindergarten, preschool, and specialized areas like adult education, remains relatively sparse. Figure 4 illustrates the number of studies in the past five years and the education levels.
3.2. Distribution of Study According to Publication Year
Upon analysis, it becomes evident that there has been a steady number of studies conducted during the past decade.
The period from 2014 onwards for the past ten years shows a broader perspective considering the use of immersive technologies in education, resulting in more published studies. However, in 2019, there was a significant drop in the number of studies due to the impact of pandemic. In the subsequent years of 2022 and the current year, 2023, a satisfactory number of peer-reviewed articles have been published, although it is comparatively lower than in previous years. This downward trend is due to technological advancements that has led to shifted focus from AR/VR in education alone toward hybrid approaches that can include the advantages of modern technologies with the benefits of AR/VR and address different problem areas of using technology in education.
This information is depicted in Figure 5.
3.3. AR/VR for Distance Education
The recent pandemic and the rapid evolution of immersive technologies have amplified the demand for online distance education, allowing students and teachers to engage in educational learning from the comfort of their homes. However, online education has faced criticism due to specific limitations related to practical courses, where traditional teaching methods are challenging to replicate. Distance learning requires students to rely heavily on their imagination for certain aspects of the learning process, and the absence of in-person guidance and real-time feedback from teachers can hinder the quality of knowledge transfer. Furthermore, technological issues such as screen size, camera angles or clarity, and volume or delayed feedback impeded learners’ ability to grasp knowledge and concepts. This situation underscores the significance of AR and VR technologies in distance education to overcome time constraints and face-to-face interactions, enabling teachers and students to engage in interactive learning experiences without physical presence limitations [29]. To gain a better understanding of the impact, Table 1 highlights the studies that have utilized AR/VR for distance education and assesses their overall influence on learning outcomes and student engagement.
3.4. AR/VR for K-12 Education
The adoption of AR/VR in K-12 education has gained momentum. Nevertheless, emerging challenges require attention and resolution before widespread implementation can be fully realized. AR and VR have been found to promote active learning, leading to increased engagement and motivation. Moreover, AR and VR empower students to learn independently and engage with subjects through interactive activities, facilitating a deeper understanding and retention of knowledge [36].
MacDowell et al. [37] presented a case study with panel discussions focused on AR/VR integration in K-12 and higher education. The findings emphasized the need for immersive learning experiences aligned with education goals. Practical recommendations included tangible curriculum resources and innovative instructional strategies and considering the availability of the technology at a viable cost. Despite challenges, an implementation was performed for implementing AR/VR in a Grade 8 science class. The results demonstrated enhanced engagement, knowledge retention, and understanding of abstract concepts. The research also highlighted AR/VR’s effectiveness in childhood learning environments, fostering open-ended play and collaboration to deepen understanding of real-world topics. Lindgren et al. [38] conducted a study with 113 seventh-grade students randomly assigned to experimental ( N = 58) and control ( N = 55) groups. Using various levels, an interactive simulation game was employed to teach students about object movement in space. The experimental group showed significant cognitive and motivational improvements in learning, higher engagement levels, and a positive attitude toward science learning when using immersive technology. Ewais and Troyer [39] studied the impact of AR technology on female seventh-grade students’ attitudes toward science and technology. The study involved seventh-grade students from a Palestinian primary school, and a mobile AR application was used in the experiment. The results indicated that all participants ( N = 50) developed a positive attitude toward using AR technology in their learning process. The findings suggest that AR has the potential to positively influence students’ perceptions and attitudes, even those who may initially show less interest in science and technology. Additional research indicates that disengaged middle and high school students experienced increased engagement and motivation when mobile AR simulation was integrated into their learning process [40]. Similarly, elementary students reported greater attention, self-confidence, and satisfaction when using AR concept map applications compared to AR alone [41].
A study was conducted in Hong Kong with a class of four to five-year-old children ( N = 30), their class teacher, and two parent volunteers. This study investigated the impact of AR on early art education for children. Evaluations were performed through semi-structured interviews with parents, teachers, and the principal, while children’s responses were collected using a survey. The findings indicate that children have control over the AR application’s design and interaction elements and objects, and stakeholders supported technical intervention. However, the principal, teachers, and parents raised concerns about the potential side effects of using AR technology in early childhood education [42]. In the context of junior high school students, comprehending complex concepts related to microstructures in chemistry is challenging due to their limited imaginative abilities. A study implemented AR as an intervention tool for junior high school chemistry students in Shenzhen, China. The results demonstrated a significant impact as a learning tool, particularly for low-achieving students. Overall, students exhibited a positive attitude toward learning using the AR-enabled application [43]. The most notable advantage of immersive technologies is creating immersive hybrid learning environments that integrate digital and physical objects. This approach allows students to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills through interdependent collaborative activities [44]. A mixed-method study assessed ninth-grade students’ perception of AR technology, motivation, and its impact on vocabulary development. The sample comprised 130 students, divided into experimental ( N = 64) and control ( N = 66) groups. Pre- and post-test instruments were utilized to analyze performance. The findings revealed significant interest in AR integration among students. However, no significant differences were observed in vocabulary learning performance between the experimental and control groups [45].
Experimental studies with control groups have revealed that students exhibit a positive attitude and have developed a strong preference for haptic-based AR devices and AR-based games as a preferred learning tool over traditional classroom lessons [46]. Additionally, compared to conventional teaching methodologies, AR tools fostered greater motivation and learning interest. Moreover, haptic AR devices effectively teach complex physics concepts in a virtual environment [47]. AR-based gamified learning and storytelling are effective for intrinsic motivation and linking abstract concepts to real-world applications. Laine et al. [48] developed the Geometry game to teach geometry to fifth-grade students in a virtual environment at a Korean elementary school. The study introduced the Android-based Science Spots AR (SSAR) platform for story-driven learning games in this mixed-method approach. Results showed strong positive responses, particularly in problem-solving eagerness and communication among friends. The study recommends Incorporating multiple difficulty levels to maintain interest and encourage long-term use. Another experimental research study investigated the impact of AR-based applications on a science course focusing on electric vehicles involving 15 third-grade students. The application consists of 15 h of pre- and post-tests. The collected results indicated a significant increase in student success rates, attitudes, and achievements [49].
Limited studies have investigated the impact of VR in K-12 education, resulting in limited information about the benefits and challenges in such educational settings. To address this, a mixed-method quasi-experimental approach implemented VR (Oculus Quest) and non-immersive VR (3D Website) for ninth-grade social studies classroom teaching. The qualitative data analysis did not reveal a statistically significant improvement in knowledge development and classroom engagement upon using VR. However, qualitative data indicated positive learning benefits and increased classroom engagement. Notably, the improvement was observed to have developed due to historical empathy through VR [50]. In recent times, the implementation of AR/VR has been extended to K-12 teachers for their professional development programs. A study investigated the use of AR/VR for online personal development courses in a European nation. The research amalgamates pedagogically informed approaches such as inquiry-based learning and digital storytelling. Results derived from the mixed-method research highlighted that AR/VR can be seamlessly integrated into regular teaching practices. However, the authors contend that further development programs utilizing such technology are essential, as only a limited number of adept teachers can quickly excel without facing any difficulties and substantial support [51,52].
Similarly, in academic settings, using AR and VR for training and mentoring is perceived as a method to enhance the instructional proficiency of educators and foster competency-based skills while promoting cognitive development. Concurrently, this strategy holds the potential to curtail the time and financial investments associated with instructor training and mentoring. As a result, a multitude of institutions are adopting AR and VR technologies to establish more immersive learning for training instructors [53]. Some of the key findings are summarized in Figure 6.
The findings underscore the immense potential of integrating AR/VR technologies in K-12 education. Prominent areas identified from the AR/VRs impact analysis include greater participant satisfaction, particularly among students. Teachers and parents also exhibited a positive attitude, but concerns about potential side effects were expressed. Notably, self-confidence was significantly improved, especially for low-achieving students, while strong academic performers did not consistently demonstrate significant changes in comprehension abilities. Immersive virtual environments proved beneficial for children in different grades of K-12 education, fostering improved communication and teamwork skills. Literature also highlighted the effectiveness of immersive technologies in teaching abstract science and technology concepts, resulting in heightened attention, engagement, and knowledge retention. However, in existing studies, limited focus was given to effectiveness, knowledge retention, and skill development. Challenges such as hardware requirements, complex environments, and the need for innovative instructional strategies have been common challenges in adopting virtual learning. Other notable areas of impact included the development of a positive attitude toward learning with technology, increased learner motivation, and higher levels of engagement. Overall, the findings emphasize AR/VR technologies’ promising opportunities for enhancing K-12 education while acknowledging the need to address the challenges to explore further research avenues. The findings on feasibility in this area of AR/VR in K-12 education are discussed in Table 2.
3.5. AR/VR for Higher Education
AR and VR technologies significantly impact higher education, revolutionizing the traditional learning experience. These immersive tools provide students with engaging and interactive learning environments to intuitively explore complex concepts. A recent study examined university-level chemistry students’ motivation and technology acceptance using AR/VR environments. The study includes pre- and post-test designs with the control group. Students in the experimental group used an AR application, while the control group used 2D pictures to develop models of carbon bonds. Academic achievement increased for those using the AR application, while no motivation scores showed significant differences between the groups [54]. AR environments are also preferred in higher education as they allow students to modify elements in their surroundings and promote active engagement [55]. Higher education students show a positive attitude toward AR and VR because of the their experimental learning (learn by doing) approach, which enhances the understanding and retention of complex concepts compared with traditional teaching methods [56].
Furthermore, AR demonstrated a positive emotional impact on students, improving their cognitive processes and overall performance [57]. Additionally, virtual environment students experience a lower cognitive load than with traditional methods [58]. A recent study utilized a quasi-experimental research design to assess the effectiveness of three distinct learning methods: traditional, wearable AR, and wearable hybrid AR/VR. The participants consisted of 105 students distributed randomly into three groups. The findings revealed that the wearable hybrid AR/VR group displayed notably elevated situational interest and learning performance compared to the traditional learning group. Additionally, the same group exhibited significantly higher engagement levels when contrasted with other approaches. The study’s findings highlight that wearable hybrid AR/VR is more effective in enhancing situational awareness and interests, engagement, and overall learning experience in the context of physical laboratory courses [59].
The utilization of AR/VR has the potential to motivate and engage advanced learners in essential fieldwork practices and techniques. These interactive environments foster critical visual literacy skills and enhance employability prospects for students [60]. Another recent study examined the potential of VR for pedagogical applications in geography for postgraduate courses. The study involved implementing a VR field trip to the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum using the high-immersive Inside Auschwitz guided documentary. The performance was evaluated from the surveys and interviews, which revealed VR technology acting as an inhibitor and facilitator, offering a sense of social and temporal freedom. This VR experience was identified to have generated curiosity and is an effective spatial prompt mechanism, inspiring new questions for students already engaged in developing geographical understandings and imagination of different sites [61]. An experimental study demonstrated that VR technology led to a better understanding of complex concepts and provided practical experience for third-year students in geo-education from Abai Kazakh National Pedagogical University. The experimental research involving sixty students revealed that VR could form the basis for effective and high-quality training with a focus on practice and productivity. The students’ subjective assessment of the educational process changed from the desired quality of education to the expected quality after the AR training experience [62]. The researchers conducted a study to examine the impact of a 3D VR reality game on English and foreign language students’ development of vocabulary and cultural knowledge. Twenty-five students participated in the VR-gamed-based language learning experiment, while a control group of twenty-four students followed the regular curriculum of the university. The feedback was collected through a questionnaire and an online survey to assess student perception and attitude. The findings suggest that VR-gamed-based learning is promising and effective in enhancing students’ vocabulary and cultural knowledge [63]. A qualitative case study was conducted with 23 high school teachers to explore their perceptions of AR and VR in English language teaching and learning activities. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews. The findings include positive and negative themes related to integrating AR and VR in English education. Some positive perceptions include effective language learning, student engagement, and active learning, whereas the negative themes include time-consuming and health-related concerns [64].
A free-to-use AR-based mobile application called Nucleophile’s Point of View (NuPOV) has been developed to address the limitations of using two-dimensional media to represent chemistry-based concepts in a particular manner that is easy to comprehend. With NuPOV, users can view chemistry concepts in AR and interact with them through hands-on activities. This individualized and self-directed learning experience enables users to understand the subject matter better. The findings suggest increased confidence in solving difficult questions and developing a positive attitude and interest in studying challenging courses [65]. Another experimental study employed a VR program to teach introductory computer hardware courses to first-year students from two universities in China. The program covered critical concepts on the history of computers, computer components, computer assembly, and hardware workflow. The student’s behavior was analyzed to understand differences among various groups. The results showed increased students’ curiosity and improved understanding of the concepts. On average, the students who engaged in the VR environment scored 27.2% higher than those in the traditional teaching group [66]. A recent study investigated the application and evaluation of VR in civil engineering education for infrastructure management. The study focused on a bridge inspection module for the study using the Projection VR system at NED University. The effectiveness of VR was assessed through the performance and feedback of 69 senior-year undergraduates. The structured rubrics-assessments revealed that the participants demonstrated heightened concentration levels in the VR environment and enhanced learning experience with increased exposure to practice using VR technology. However, a notable limitation is the absence of structural components that represent real-world scenarios concerning the appropriate representation of damages in the bridge inspection module [67].
Xiao investigated the implementation of digital multimedia VR courses in classrooms and analyzed the roles of students’ and teachers’ feedback that influence the implementation. The study reported a correlation between the execution of such courses and various influencing factors. Despite progress in digital multimedia, VR-enabled teaching has shortcomings, such as insufficient art digital multimedia curriculum focusing on VR, limitations of contemporary requirements in the course, gaps between implementation and the developmental stages of teaching methods, and limited teacher proficiency in digital multimedia using VR [68]. A similar study assessed students’ experience with VR tool and their comprehension of 3D vectors in a university physics course. The experimental research design included experimental and control groups to gauge pre-post-test performance. The experimental group was also evaluated based on their perception of VR uses, learning objectives, and experiences of VR as a learning tool. The findings indicate that the experimental group outperformed the control group concerning items that required visualization. Additionally, the students had a positive attitude toward the VR-based learning tool, as it was identified as being able to enhance their learning experience, particularly in categories of course content involving visualization, 3D visualization, identification, and understanding [69]. The focal point of most of the immersive technology intervention studies was centered on learning achievement, motivation, and attitude, but there is a dearth of qualitative investigations in the domain [70]. The prevalent research trend involves contrasting student learning outcomes between VR and alternative methodologies such as AR, hands-on experiences, and conventional education. Emerging findings suggest that VR demonstrates enhanced efficacy for visual educational content, while AR exhibits superiority for auditory learning [71]. The key findings of this section are depicted in Figure 7.
Among the various factors identified and evaluated in the studies, acceptance stands out as the most crucial element, with a significant weight of 94.11%. This highlights the paramount importance of students and educators embracing the integration of AR and VR technologies in higher educational settings. Conversely, certain factors have not received adequate emphasis. While motivation (64.7%) and positive attitude (64.7%) have been recognized, academic achievement (29.4%) and visualization experience (29.4%) are areas that may warrant greater attention. Additionally, dynamic environment (41.1%), productivity (35.2%), and enhanced practical skills (23.5%) demonstrate notable relevance, factors like active engagement and learning by doing, which are curriculum issues, were lacking elements in the virtual environment, and with the subject in consideration for teaching are areas that could potentially benefit from enhanced consideration in the context of AR/VR integration. The feasibility aspects are outlined in Table 3.
3.6. AR/VR for Medical Education
AR and VR technologies have significantly transformed medical education by offering innovative and immersive learning experiences. Medical students and professionals benefit from these technologies in various ways, such as anatomy visualization, telementoring of new medical professionals, surgical training, diagnostic simulations for reasoning and making accurate diagnoses, and remote learning to enable students and professionals to participate in virtual surgeries and other medical procedures conducted elsewhere, and facilitating collaborative learning environments to discuss cases and share experiences from different locations. A study at the University of Dundee was conducted with medical students who had different experience levels. The study involved the assessment of preliminary VR anatomy resources. Students were introduced to the 3D anatomical models in a VR environment to gauge the potential and acceptance of the technology for anatomy education. The findings indicate promising results in the effectiveness of the technology, particularly for better visualization of annotations. However, students reported technical issues regarding bugs, which disrupted the procedure [72]. Similar research delved into the impact of digital anatomy learning tools, encompassing an intricate tablet-based depiction of anatomical systems using AR-based applications. The application superimposes 3D anatomical structures onto the digital mirror image of students. This study involved 236 students pursuing healthcare courses, where their performances were evaluated against traditional methods. The findings revealed that AR-based anatomical educational tools enhanced the learning experience, especially considering the enjoyment, motivation, and inclination to recommend. However, the study emphasized that male participants exhibited more positive learning experience scores than female participants. Additionally, no significant differences were observed in performance and knowledge retention [73]. In anatomical education within immersive environments, Moro et al. [74] propose that VR and AR can serve as effective methods in medical education without negatively affecting student performance. The research highlights these technologies as having a favorable influence on students’ spatial comprehension abilities and a deeper understanding of 3D-based anatomical structures.
Conversely, contrasting findings from another study suggest a different perspective. This study indicates that while VR might enhance learners’ anatomy knowledge, AR may have a detrimental impact on performance compared to traditional 2D anatomy teaching methods [75,76]. An experimental study was developed to create and assess a prototype tool for medical education in human anatomy, using AR technology and a tangible 3D printed model. The primary objective was to facilitate 3D and topographical learning experiences. The tool named Anatomical Education and Augmented Reality (AEduCAR) was integrated and subsequently evaluated with 62 second-year medical students from the University of Bologna’s School of Medicine and Surgery. The experimental and control group test results indicated no significant distinction between the two learning methods. Conversely, the questionnaire responses highlighted tremendous enthusiasm and interest in students. The AR tool was considered to boost student motivation, enhance long-term retention, and foster better 3D comprehension of anatomical structures [77].
An investigation was conducted to assess the usability of a VR application for training practical skills among dental students. The authors validated the VR application’s effectiveness using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and analyzed the data collected on participants’ perceptions. Overall, the VR training in dental education yielded positive outcomes, with participants finding the learning experience enjoyable and repeatable without extra costs [78]. A randomized trial was recently conducted at Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The study included 60 sixth-year dental students, randomly assigned to experimental ( N = 25) and control ( N = 25) groups. The performance was evaluated based on the usability of the VR technology, and student satisfaction was assessed via a questionnaire. Results indicated that all faculty members found VR usable in dental education. Most students (76%) expressed higher satisfaction with the VR integration into their learning. The mean score for students in the experimental group was higher than in the control group [79].
A randomized controlled multicenter trial assessed VR’s effectiveness in teaching students about surgical site infection and its preventive measures. This study included third-year medical students at Grenoble Alpes University, Imperial College London, and the University of Heidelberg. Students were randomly assigned VR teaching or control groups, and the measure was the difference in scores achieved in the IPC exam at the end of the year. This intervention highlights critical areas where VR could be implemented for better medical education outcomes [80]. A mobile app, NitLabEduca, incorporating AR technology, was developed to study the spinal cord. The app offers an interactive exploration of 3D rotating models, theoretical content, animations, and simulations related to its physiology. To assess the impact, 80 participants with and without neuroanatomy knowledge were divided into control and experimental groups. SUS was implemented for usability checks. Notably, both groups showed better test results ( p > 0.001) when combining the app usage with text. The SUS results indicated promising usability and learning outcomes. The authors suggest that the AR environment enhances learning compared to printed material [81]. Similarly, another research study underscores the versatility of immersive VR tools in health sciences. These tools are lauded for their customizability and hands-on capabilities. Notably, VR is experiencing growing traction in health sciences due to adequate visualization provisions for procedural simulation, surgical skill refinement, surgical planning, and in-depth gross anatomy education [82]. Bifulco et al. [83] examined AR’s effectiveness as an educational aid for untrained individuals lacking medical expertise. The researchers devised an AR system that enabled individuals to perform ECG assessments using a head-mounted display with pointers, text boxes, and audio. Following the simulation on a mannequin, participants were capable of executing an authentic ECG on a volunteer. The authors suggested that the average electrode positioning errors were acceptably comparable to the placement errors of trained medical professionals. Additionally, the researchers highlighted that the application could be implemented to support other medical equipment and perform telemedicine tasks using a tablet or a smartphone. Tai et al. [84] proposed an all-encompassing AR lobectomy in a training system for thoracoscope surgery, incorporating visual and haptic modeling to investigate the possible advantages of the technology. The content comprised an immersive AR visual rendering constructed using the cluster-based extended position-based dynamics algorithm for soft tissue physics. AR haptic rendering systems were also integrated with a model architecture consisting of multitouch interaction points, including kinesthetic and pressure-sensitive points. The authors developed an AR interactive VATS surgical training platform based on the theoretical framework. Twenty-four volunteers evaluated the proposed system based on tactile sense, visual sense, scene authenticity, and simulator performance. The results demonstrated that the simulator effectively enhances surgical skills for novices and can be retrained after a specific time. Huang et al. [85] employed a method for cannulating the internal jugular (IJ) vein by utilizing AR glasses on a manikin. The AR group performed the Central Venous Catheter (CVC) insertion procedure, while an instructional simulation was projected onto their glasses. Despite the identical procedure time for both the control and AR groups, the AR group exhibited greater compliance with the procedure checklist ( p = 0.003).
Dias et al. [86] implemented an AR-aided video laryngoscopy, wherein they contrasted the endotracheal intubation process of ICY nurses using direct and indirect video laryngoscopy. A comparison of intubation success rates revealed that the direct group achieved a rate of 32%, whereas the indirect group and the AR-based groups achieved 72% and 71%, respectively ( p < 0.001). Likewise, the direct group had an esophageal intubation rate of 27%, while the indirect and the AR group had no instances of esophageal intubation. AR can aid healthcare providers in critical care procedures such as central line placement and intubation. The results were evident in the study conducted by Alismail et al. [87] consisting of 32 ICU trainees of whom 15 were assigned to the AR group. This group utilized AR glasses while performing endotracheal intubation on a training doll. The remaining participants were assigned to the interventional group. The necessary measures for the process were exhibited in the head-mounted display. Considering the results, the AR group was more time-efficient than the interventional group, as the latter required more intubation time despite having greater compliance with evidence-based intubation. Most recently, a study conducted by Kok et al. [88] emphasizes the implementation of AR in radiation oncology education. The authors reveal that commercial AR environments for radiotherapy training are unavailable. However, software prototypes have been developed to insert a fully 3D version of a radiotherapy linear accelerator into a real-life environment, such as the radiotherapy clinic or a patient’s living room. As such, this integration would hypothetically facilitate a learning experience for expert personnel and patients who are unfamiliar with a radiotherapy machine to familiarize themselves with it. Chen et al. [89] presented a study that explores the utilization of AR in localizing supratentorial lesions imperative for preoperative planning. The evaluation of AR’s effectiveness involved the implementation of a 3D slicer to retrieve lesion information. Additionally, registration was accomplished utilizing the anatomical landmarks and fiducial markers. The central areas of the lesion on the scalp were pinpointed using the proposed mobile AR system and the conventional neuron avigation system, respectively. The authors assert that the mobile AR system may provide a cost-efficient option for image-guided neurosurgery planning. The key findings on AR/VR for medical education are summarized in Figure 8.
An essential factor highlighted in the studies is the “Acceptance” of AR/VR technology, with 14 studies focusing on this aspect. Better visualization and effectiveness also garnered significant attention, with studies exploring their impact. On the other hand, certain factors seem to be underemphasized, such as spatial comprehension, hardware issues, and technical issues being addressed by limited studies. At the same time, several aspects like motivation, enjoyable experience, positive impact on performance, and positive learning experience received moderate attention across the literature. Factors such as the negative impact on performance, long-term retention, and 3D comprehension have been explored in a limited number of studies. Other aspects, such as practical skills, higher satisfaction, time efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, were examined from two to seven studies, indicating a varying degree of emphasis in these areas. Critical responses and findings from the studies contribute essential insights into the feasibility aspect, as outlined in Table 4.
4. Discussion
Integrating AR and VR in education underscores immersive technologies’ transformative potential for learning environments [90,91]. The literature on AR and VR applications in education spans a broad spectrum, encompassing various educational contexts. In the K-12 educational context, AR technologies have garnered more attention, and implementations are higher than VR technologies [92]. Conversely, literature on VR applications in higher education often lacks explicit reference to foundational learning theories. Experimental studies have predominantly focused on measuring learner attitudes, engagement levels, and usability [93]. Additionally, AR and VR application development assessment has primarily revolved around gauging learners’ perception of specific application features. As a result, there is shortage of empirical research regarding the comparative analysis of the educational outcomes stemming from the implementation of AR and VR technologies [72].
The current landscape of teaching and learning is undergoing dynamic transformations, propelled by the rapid development and widespread adoption of information technology. As a result, pedagogical practices are continuously evolving, with a notable trend being the exploration of immersive virtual technologies. Yet, amidst this surge, ascertaining the precise impacts of Virtual Reality (VR) remains an intricate challenge [94]. Nevertheless, a dearth of comprehensive insights into application design elements and architecture and the absence of underlying theories remain noticeable. This can be primarily attributed to the cost of developing such technologies, leading to some studies adopting existing solutions like AR mobile applications or VR head-mounted devices [95].
In STEM education, the bulk of exploration resides within K-12 educational settings, where studies have spanned across science, technology, language, art, and music domains [70]. While the adoption and application of AR/VR in STEM education show promising potential, several challenges and considerations highlighted in various studies underscore the need for further development, refinement, and a more comprehensive approach to addressing user needs such as personalized learning materials, cost of hardware and software, usability, interaction and kinesthetic learning, and educational theories [96]. Similarly, the studies on professional development programs using AR/VR exhibited limitations in their scope. Insufficient attention was directed toward intervention attributes, evaluation metrics and learning outcomes [97]. Within K-12 education, a predominant focus was directed toward customized curricula for educators to cater to student requirements, assessment methods to address transfer of performance skills, and elevated cognitive processes. Additionally, inadequate provisions were observed for educators and administrators at the district and state tiers to cultivate knowledge foundation and attitudes that is essential to improve the quality of teaching [98]. Similarly, health considerations pertaining to children using AR/VR technologies were observed from the feedback of parents and educators [65].
The integration of practical and versatile development software, including prominent platforms, such as Unity, Blender, and Houdini SideFX, plays an indispensable and multifaceted role in the domain of animation. These software applications transcend their conventional usage as tools solely for interactive engagement, assuming a foundational and transformative role in the comprehensive process of animation creation. Unity, distinguished for its adaptability beyond gaming contexts, emerges as a dynamic platform enabling creators to orchestrate immersive visual narratives. Its capabilities extend to real-time rendering, fostering interactive environments that imbue animations with experiential depth. On a parallel note, Blender, a comprehensive open-source 3D creation suite, spans the gamut of animation production. Its diverse toolset facilitates not only modeling and texturing but also intricate animation processes, rendering, and simulation, engendering a comprehensive ecosystem for seamless visual development. Furthermore, the inclusion of Houdini SideFX amplifies the array of software choices, offering an advanced framework for procedural animation and intricate visual effects. This software’s procedural paradigm empowers animators to meticulously craft intricate visual sequences that bear a profound semblance to real-world dynamics. Collectively, these software platforms transcend their conventional utility, evolving into fundamental instruments that enable the transformation of creative concepts into captivating, multisensory animations. Their integration ushers in a new era of dynamic interactivity, effectively bridging the gap between static visual content and immersive animated experiences.
There is a more advanced landscape in medical education, with applications utilized for surgical and anatomy education, yielding positive outcomes. Nevertheless, a substantial number of these studies remain within experimental phase or are limited to prototype designs primarily intended for training. Consequently, the genuine influence of immersive technologies in medical education is frequently left unexplored [99]. Furthermore, a study has brought to light that students participating in e-learning platforms that incorporate a range of technological integrations for medical education, especially in distance learning settings, have conveyed discomfort with the platform and demonstrated reluctance in accepting its integration. Moreover, students have faced difficulties related to understanding medical instruction and learning materials. Consequently, the study suggests that students need to be effectively acquainted with this new teaching environment before adopting new technologies for medical education [100].
Delving into VR applications across various educational settings, two significant areas come to the forefront: user interaction within the immersive environment and interactions with the hardware. Within these domains, notable concerns emerge, as learners have reported issues related to communication, object manipulation, and interruptions within the virtual environment. Technical glitches, such as bugs and crashes, have also hindered a seamless learning experience [92,101].
Moreover, critical aspects like potential side effects on users and image resolution, including the need for blur-free images and zoom-in and out features, demand more substantial consideration to enhance user comfort. In educational settings, the principles of reusability and scalability are essential for ensuring the long-term sustainability of technological implementations [102]. Focusing on these critical factors is increasingly important as we integrate innovative tools like Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). Reusability means designing educational content and applications in a way that allows them to be adapted and reused in different contexts, courses, and learning objectives [103]. This optimizes resources and ensures consistency in delivering compelling learning experiences. Scalability is equally essential and involves developing solutions that can accommodate a growing number of users without compromising quality or functionality. Scalable AR and VR applications can meet the evolving needs of education, expanding student populations, and dynamic curriculum changes. By paying more attention to reusability and scalability, educators and technologists can ensure that the benefits of AR and VR are not limited to isolated cases but are woven into the fabric of education, promoting lasting innovation and improved learning outcomes.
While few studies have reported a lower cognitive load, there is no in-depth information on cognitive load theory. Research outcomes have yielded a blend of results, with some investigations offering overreaching assertions regarding reduced cognitive load. One particular study has underscored the hurdle linked to AR applications, particularly concerning lower-order cognitive aptitudes, potentially impeding cognitive advancement through AR-based learning [104]. In a distinct examination, it has been emphasized that the recurrent utilization of immersive environments might lead to cognitive overload owing to the substantial time and attention required to grasp the educational content [105,106]. In general, cognitive load can differ based on the inherent complexity of a task or concept. In contrast, other load forms involve cognitive demands imposed by a presentation of content and often stemming from suboptimal instructional materials [107].
Similarly, limited information has been presented considering the participants’ ability for long-term retention. Therefore, the simplistic assumption of lower cognitive load based on an enjoyable and unique immersive experience is insufficient. Past literature has indicated that immersive VR burdens working memory, leading to cyber sickness [108,109]. Additionally, design deficiencies may also have a substantial impact on the surge of cognitive load. Likewise, cybersickness is a widely discussed limitation of VR environments [110]. However, this issue has been probed through several hypotheses with no potential remedies for this concern. Spatial understanding is another context that has limited focus. In this context, it is crucial to understand the participants’ spatial associations with objects in the environment, as varying levels of spatial ability can determine the participants’ performances in the virtual environment.
Furthermore, divergent information exists regarding the optimal duration of these studies. While most studies have centered around shorter durations, emerging evidence suggests that a learner’s impact is more comprehensively discerned through extended sessions. Simultaneously, it has been reported that shorter sessions with breaks can effectively mitigate fatigue and the potential onset of motion sickness [111]. These findings underscore the imperative for further comprehensive assessments before integrating technology into education.
Recommendations for Practical Implications
The advent of AR and VR promises to transform the education landscape, ushering in immersive and captivating learning platforms and experiences for students. The implications of these technologies are multifaceted and can be expounded upon as follows:
- A tangible curriculum with practical instructional strategies for educators is critical as it can heighten interest in students by delivering the subject matter in a way that creates sustained student engagement.

- Integrating AR/VR developmental training for educators is imperative, accompanied by thorough research that underscores teachers’ learning experiences and compares them with students’ learning experiences in the same environment. Doing so can effectively identify and address any disparities or challenges, ensuring a well-rounded and optimized learning environment for educators and students.

- Captivating visuals and interactive platforms with auditory cues must be incorporated to foster long-term interest and prevent confusion on how to engage within the virtual environment and its objects.

- Educational content must be designed to suit diverse environments, educators, and students with a user-friendly interface to enable a comprehensive grasp of the materials being taught.

- Equitable access to AR and VR is critical for ensuring that all learners can benefit from the innovative tools. As these tools are considered for educational settings, addressing potential disparities in access is essential. Equitable access ensures that students with diverse backgrounds, including those with disabilities and varying economic circumstances, have an equal opportunity to engage with AR/VR experiences. Achieving this goal can involve various strategies, such as making AR/VR experiences accessible in public institutions, schools, and libraries and ensuring the availability of suitable assistive technologies for students with disabilities under the required guidance of specialists.

- Collaboration among educational institutions, technology providers, and other community organizations is pivotal in extending AR/VR resources to marginalized communities.

- Educators and policymakers can collaborate to leverage the capabilities of AR/VR for every learner.

- Cost-effective hardware and software are critical in adopting these technologies in an educational setting.

- The results have indicated that these technologies favored the confidence and retention of low-achieving students over high achievers. Therefore, AR/VR must be tailored for students, as they have varying levels of comprehension.



5. Conclusions
AR and VR technologies are poised to reshape the educational landscape, offering students more engaging, dynamic, and immersive experiences. While the potential benefits of AR and VR are evident across various educational levels, key aspects warrant attention as these technologies become more integrated into learning environments. Despite significant strides taken sto explore the benefits of AR and VR, challenges remain, such as cognitive load, cybersickness, cost, equitable access, curriculum challenges, and instructional strategies. The literature lacks a strong foundation in learning theories, with many studies focusing on usability without establishing a robust theoretical framework. Bridging this gap by infusing pedagogical theories can enhance the effectiveness of these applications in addressing specific learning objectives. As the field evolves, it is crucial to foster dialogue, share best practices, and develop guidelines that prioritize an inclusive learning environment with features specifically designed to address the educational needs of different students. AR and VR technologies continue to evolve, and educators, researchers, and policymakers have an exciting opportunity to shape the future of education by addressing various gaps, challenges, and limitations, such as theoretical foundations, application design, impact on learning, side effects, and the full potential of AR/VR technologies to create transformative learning experiences that prepare students for the challenges and opportunities of the modern world.
6. Limitations
While this study contributes new insights and recommendations for future research, it is not exempt from several limitations. Given the expeditious advancement of AR/VR technologies, the evaluation may not cover the most recent improvements or applications, potentially leading to inadequate comprehension of current educational potential. The heterogeneity in interventions, lack of architectural designs, different study designs, lack of foundational learning theories, and varying methodologies add complexity to cross-study comparisons, which may reduce the generalizability of findings. Furthermore, selecting studies only in English may present a publication bias resulting in skewed findings. The review’s scope can be further constrained by factors such as the primary focus on usability, varying measurement approaches, the lack of long-term studies, limited research reporting negative findings or limitations of their research concerning the AR/VR intervention, or emphasis on unfavorable outcomes. The effectiveness of AR/VR is context dependent, and geographical and cultural variations compound its complexity. Therefore, such reviews provide perspectives, but their limitations must be recognized to ensure a nuanced interpretation of the findings.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 12th International Conference on Advanced Computing (ICoAC) Conference Start Date: 2023, Aug. 17 Conference End Date: 2023, Aug. 19 Conference Location: Chennai, India CNNs and Edge computing have proliferated in the last decade. While these technologies are stupendous in their own right, new horizons can be opened up if they were to be combined. Deep and complex CNNs, which are ones that produce groundbreaking accuracies, are not feasible for deployment in a resource constraint environment. The vanguard in model compression is an innovative technique known as Knowledge Distillation. This paper proposes a way to perform knowledge distillation by means of Attention Maps. The generation of attention maps from features is achieved through the use of ATCam. Not only does this method effectively distills knowledge it also nullifies another flaw of CNNs-black-boxiness. This may lead to leapfrogs in Mobile Machine Aided Medical Diagnosis by deploying interpretable complex CNN in small devices. Three ways to combine the feature maps were experimented with in this research work, which are Feature Map Accumulation(FMA), Maximum Intensity Projection(MIPs) and Saliency Maps. The performance of the proposed approaches are tested on PADUFES-20 dataset and all the three approaches provided significant boost in the performance over the traditional transfer learning methods. The best of these methods - saliency maps - gains a accuracy boost of 9.56% over the generic methods of knowledge transfer. Moreover, to one’s surprise, the resultant model not only matches the teacher model in accuracy, it exceeds it by 1.52% while being only 43.2% of original teacher model’s size.

Growing the Future of Agriculture: An Examination of Knowledge-Sharing and Community Building in the Fresh Produce and Floral Council

Author: Guzman, Oscar

Publication info: Guzman, Oscar. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/growing-future-agriculture-examination-knowledge/docview/2840946322/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: This study examines knowledge-sharing practices within a community of practice (CoP) through a case study of the Fresh Produce and Floral Council (FPFC). The study sought to investigate how the FPFC promoted agricultural knowledge and expertise, impacted its members' social relationships and knowledge-sharing practices, communicated clear roles and expectations, and provided valuable and accessible resources. A mixed-methods approach was employed to investigate the research questions, which involved conducting a survey and utilizing descriptive statistics, frequencies, and Spearman correlations to analyze both the Likert scale and open-ended responses. The findings suggested that the FPFC has a knowledge-sharing culture promoting active participation and collaboration among members, with room for improvement in knowledge-sharing practices. Additionally, FPFC positively impacts members' social relationships and prioritizes knowledge-sharing, with a need for further education and promotion of these benefits. Also, clear communication of roles and expectations is essential in any CoP. There may be a need to further clarify the community's goals and purpose to ensure member engagement and alignment. Finally, members perceived FPFC's resources as valuable and relevant, but there is a need for improvement in their accessibility and availability. Overall, the study provided valuable insights for developing new methods of knowledge-sharing and onboarding within the agriculture industry to address the aging crisis and ensure the industry's future. Thus, it was essential to explore the value of knowledge-sharing practices and technology for communication within the community to contribute to developing virtual CoPs enabling knowledge transfer and relationship building for agriculture professionals.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 32nd Annual Conference of the European Association for Education in Electrical and Information Engineering (EAEEIE) Conference Start Date: 2023, June 14 Conference End Date: 2023, June 16 Conference Location: Eindhoven, Netherlands The emergence of powerful new technologies driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution is challenging engineering graduates. In recent decades, engineering education methods have evolved to keep pace with advanced technologies. However, the education system does not always adapt to the needs and requirements of the new generation. To achieve the best educational performance and learning outcomes, Generation Z should adapt to existing educational models. Young people growing up in an information world, with constant access to technologies such as the Internet, social networks, distance communication, etc., have developed several distinctive characteristics. These include the development of soft skills, a global understanding of the world and a different approach to knowledge, which is always at hand in the virtual world. It is therefore necessary to find new ways of teaching and knowledge transfer to meet the needs of the young people who belong to the Generation Z (and soon Generation Alpha). Moreover, adapting teaching methods to new trends should not imply disregarding previous experience. Rather, it should seek a state of balance between the new approach and the general requirements of an education system in a particular country, bearing in mind that the factors motivating Generations X and Y to study may not apply to Generation Z. This article presents students' perceptions of the current education system, the factors that motivate young people to study technical subjects and the perceived difficulties and disadvantages in these countries. The results of surveys conducted among groups of students from two universities were used: Technical University of Denmark, Ballerup Campus, and the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice, Poland.

Advancement of an Inhouse Aerospace Vehicle Design Synthesis System Through the Introduction of a Novel Database-Knowledgebase System and by Improving the Geometry and Aerothermodynamic Disciplinary Processes

Author: Atchison, Samuel

Publication info: Atchison, Samuel. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/advancement-inhouse-aerospace-vehicle-design/docview/2828633821/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Throughout the years of aerospace vehicle design, the process in which a vehicle is designed has drastically improved from being primarily developed through trial and error, to using sophisticated synthesis systems. While the trial-and-error process had its uses with providing the fundamental knowledge of how aircraft behave and can be designed, the increase in knowledge and technology allowed the possibility of more vehicle configurations to be explored without the need to build each one. This increase should have led to a revolution of vehicle designs, and while there have been some novel ones, it seems that the general design of aerospace vehicles has begun to stagnate. In short, as our knowledge of aerospace vehicle design has increased, the design freedom for new vehicles has decreased. One possible reason for this contradictory situation is that as the knowledge of a specific vehicle configuration grew, it reduced the need or the want to explore beyond it. Keeping the same configuration, or at least close to it, reduces the risk involved with its design, but other vehicle configurations that may potentially prove to be more beneficial are left unexplored. Another possible reason is that the full knowledge from each vehicle design is not completely passed down from generation to generation. While the knowledge of design has generally increased over the years, this issue with knowledge retention keeps designers from reaching their full potential by having to redesign past vehicles and configurations. These issues are especially prevalent for high-speed aerospace vehicles. The Aerospace Vehicle Design (AVD) Laboratory has been tackling these issues for many years, and their solution was the Aerospace Vehicle Design Synthesis (AVDS) system. This synthesis system provides a generic design methodology to open up the solution space topographies and allow more unconventional vehicle configurations to be explored. Each generation of AVD researchers has improved upon this system to increase its capabilities, and the research presented herein introduces the author’s contribution. First, to further help the knowledge retention issue, the Vehicle Configuration Compendium (VCC) is introduced. This compendium is a self-contained parametric library that combines a comprehensive database and knowledgebase of past-to-present aerospace vehicles to aid design engineers by making the past always available. The power of this system was shown within a NASA-funded study regarding hypersonic commercial transportation, with two of the vehicle verification studies out of seven provided herein. Lastly, to improve the capabilities of AVDS to increase the solution space topographies, improvements of the geometry and aerothermodynamic disciplinary processes were accomplished. For the geometry disciplinary process, a parametric 3D modeling software was used in conjunction with AVDS to generate models that could be used for method and synthesis verification, synthetic data, and to use more complex scaling methods to explore more possibilities within a solution space. For the aerothermodynamics disciplinary process, a method was developed to calculate the structural index parameter, a parameter that can be used during conceptual design to represent the structural and aerothermal effects that the vehicle may experience. This method was verified against historic data from when it was originally developed, and new maps were generated to visualize how the parameter is affected by temperature, cruise time, and TPS material. These improvements to AVDS with the VCC and the disciplinary methods, will assist future researchers in their quest of aerospace vehicle design.

Abstract: Technological advancements, the prevalence of digital media, and shifting age demographics in the U.S. workforce dominate most of the economic, environmental, and social aspects of our work lives. This is particularly evident in Manhattan, New York City, New York (NY), the heart of the U.S. fashion, apparel, and textile industry. Up until the 21 st century, the once-self-contained industry relied on foundational operational practices that had remained unchanged for over 200 years. However, since the late 1970s domestic operations such as cut-and-sew, product development, and manufacturing were gradually chipped away by the lure of lower labor and production costs in the Global South. Digital and automated technologies designed to increase productivity led to a significant contraction of the industry’s often older and skilled workforce. Together with trade policies, these situational factors brought about the dismantling of U.S. factories and the gradual demise or reduction of fully staffed NY design, product development, and marketing corporate headquarters. After the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, the NY Garment Center suffered its greatest decrease in employment, leading to additional economic and labor losses. The 21st-century U.S. workplace presents a unique historical situation in which as many as five generations may work side by side. Due to increasing life expectancies and people delaying retirement for social or financial reasons, a multigenerational workplace is becoming increasingly normal. As digital natives, most younger workers are equipped with the latest technology skills, but they lack soft skills and tacit knowledge that can only be acquired over time and through experience. To maintain creative practices and facilitate knowledge transfer between generational cohorts, this dissertation suggests that the fashion industry embraces the concept of an inclusive, age-diverse workforce. My work challenges the industry’s problem with ageism and its extreme focus on youthfulness. In the three studies that follow I examine the potential of creative collaboration across age and experience levels between multiple generations who work in the visual- and youth-focused NY fashion and textiles industry. I argue that intergenerational teams and mentoring across all ages will ensure that foundational practices continue for the next and subsequent generations.

Abstract: Power generation in the global power sector has recently seen a paradigm shift from centralized bulk generation to distributed generation. In this regard, there are two transmission technologies available: high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) and high-voltage direct current (HVDC). The technical and economic benefits of HVDC transmission technology have enabled many countries to implement it widely for long-distance bulk power transmission, particularly between remote locations and densely populated areas. HVDC technology, however, is still relatively new in Pakistan. Despite this, HVDC technology holds great promise in Pakistan, specifically in utilizing and integrating distributed renewable energy sources with the national grid, as well as enabling cross-border energy trade. This study aims to provide a first-ever scientometric analysis of the HVDC technology field, highlighting key research themes and trends. A correlation is established between HVDC research and its adoption in Pakistan by extracting articles from the Scopus database and analyzing them with the VOS viewer, a modern data analysis tool. The scientometric analysis indicates a minimal contribution from Pakistani authors in the field of HVDC technology as compared to authors of the neighboring nations, highlighting a significant gap in knowledge transfer and technology adoption. Moreover, an overview of HVDC technology is provided, along with a comparison between HVAC and HVDC technologies. Last but not least, Pakistan’s existing and proposed HVDC projects, prospects, and challenges associated with HVDC adoption are discussed.

Abstract: Research on the plant growth promoting microorganisms (PGPM) is increasing strongly due to the biotechnological potential for the agricultural, forestry, and food industry. The benefits of using PGPM in crop production are well proven; however, their incorporation in agricultural management is still limited. Therefore, we wanted to explore the gaps and challenges for the transfer of biotechnological innovations based on PGPM to the agricultural sector. Our systematic review of the state of the art of PGPM research and knowledge transfer takes Chile as an example. Several transfer limiting aspects are identified and discussed. Our two main conclusions are: neither academia nor industry can meet unfounded expectations during technology transfer, but mutually clarifying their needs, capabilities, and limitations is the starting point for successful collaborations; the generation of a collaborative innovation environment, where academia as well as public and private stakeholders (including the local community) take part, is crucial to enhance the acceptance and integration of PGPM on the way to sustainable agriculture.

Full text: 1. Introduction
Around the world, research on the beneficial plant-microorganisms interaction is becoming more attractive due to the biotechnological potential for the agricultural, forestry, and food industry [1,2]. These “plant growth promoting microorganisms” (PGPM) interact in symbiosis with plants, playing important functional roles in germination, development, and adaptation to environmental characteristics [3]. During the last decades, dozens of microbial species and hundreds PGPM strains have been studied by research groups worldwide. Scientific publications disclose their characteristics and performance in interactions with plants under laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions [4,5,6]. Often these strains are very well characterized and scientific knowledge encompasses background on their identity, growth conditions, colonization ability, incompatibilities, as well as primary and secondary metabolism. More advanced studies may complement genetic data or identification of specific secondary metabolites. This information is highly relevant for the development of microbial inoculants.
Despite the diversity of plant associated microorganisms, the most commonly studied PGPM are Rhizobium , Pseudomonas , Azospirillum , Azotobacter, Bacillus , Glomus , and Trichodermas [7,8]. Some strains of Pseudomonas , Rhizobium , Bacillus , Glomus , and Trichoderma are also commercially available as single or combined strains.
Applied studies highlight their benefits for agricultural production generated by the inoculation of beneficial microorganisms in crop plants (Figure 1) [9]. Such benefits are increased productivity and crop yield (e.g., a major fruit number, major plant size, plant survival, and increases in germination rate) [9,10]. Additionally, PGPM increases the plant’s tolerance against biotic and abiotic stress, an important characteristic for facing the challenges of global change in agriculture and forestry [10]. The use of beneficial microorganisms in agriculture is considered as environmentally friendly, as the application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides can be significantly reduced [9,11].
An effective use of PGPM in agriculture could contribute to combating undernourishment and food insecurity as well as to optimize agricultural inputs in energy, fertilization, pest control, and water [11,12]. The benefits of using PGPM in crop production are well proven; however, their incorporation in agricultural management is still limited. Therefore, we wanted to explore the gaps and challenges for the transfer of biotechnological innovations based on PGPM to the agricultural sector. Our systematic review on the state of the art of PGPM research and knowledge transfer takes Chile as an example. Chile is considered as a natural laboratory, stretching out from subtropical to subantarctic ecosystems. This particularity transforms it into a model for extrapolating to global tendencies [13].
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Case
Chile has a surface area of 756,950 km 2 , with many climates, including the driest desert on Earth (Atacama Desert), Mediterranean areas, rainforests, and southern areas such as Antarctica. In addition, Chile presents varied geography characterized by the mountain ranges of the Andes and the coastal mountain range, the Atacama Desert, the altiplano, central valleys, and extensive pampas in Patagonia [14].
2.2. Search Strategy for Scientific Publications
A bibliographic search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Keywords related to beneficial plant-microorganism interaction in Chile were used to identify articles published up to 31 May 2021. On the other hand, we searched for articles from leading research groups in this field published in the same time frame. Please refer to the Supplementary Material for more details (Figure S1). Duplicates and grey literature, book chapters etc. were eliminated.
2.3. Selection of Scientific Publications
Different selection criteria were considered to select articles that fit the objectives (Figure S1). Only articles describing, isolating, or applying beneficial microorganisms associated with plants in Chile were selected, excluding articles on plant pathogens and reviews.
2.4. Meta-Analysis
For the spatial analysis, the geographic information (sampling or study area) was extracted from all selected articles and classified into six geographic zones based on available information on the agro-climatic atlas of Chile [15]. The geographic zones are denominated as: zone I: hyper-arid zone (18 to 25° S), zone II: arid to semi-arid zone (25° to 32° S), zone III: Mediterranean zone (32° to 36° S), zone IV: temperate (warm) zone (36° to 39° S), zone V: temperate (cold) zone (39° to 44° S), zone VI: Patagonian to subantarctic zone (44° to 55° S) (Table S1). The articles were analyzed according to the type of technique (culture-independent, culture-dependent, and both), origin and type of microorganism, and plant host (commercial, native, or both).
Additional information was extracted to further characterize the selected research studies (Supplementary Material 2):
- (1) . Type of PGP mechanism: here, we distinguished 7 PGPM mechanisms (phosphate solubilization, N fixation, siderophores production, phytohormones production, ACC-deaminase activity, exopolysaccharides production, biocontrol capacity), as well as the category “others” for all other reported mechanisms.

- (2) . Type of environmental stress: here, we distinguished pH, nutrient deficit, salinity, drought, pollution, temperature (heat or cold), UV radiation, altitude, herbivory, fire, and others.

- (3) . Inoculated plant type (vegetable, grass, fruit tree, etc.).

- (4) . Technology Readiness Level (TRL) [16].

- (5) . Strain identity.



2.5. Database of Microorganisms Available for the Chilean Agricultural Sector
The record of officially registered commercial strains and products in Chile and the registry of the commercializing companies was taken from the report of the Agricultural and Livestock Service of the Chilean Ministry of Agriculture (January 2021).
3. Plant-Microorganism Interaction in Chile: A Case Study
3.1. General Overview of Plant-Microorganism Interaction in Chile
Our final database contained 183 scientific publications on PGPM studies realized in Chile between 1989 and 2021. However, it was only in the year 2000 that the number of publications increased significantly (Figure S2). Most studies applied culture-dependent techniques to characterize PGPM-plant interaction (104 articles, Figure 2, Table S2). Nonetheless, studies based on culture-independent techniques have had greater importance since 2010 (Figure S1) due to the massification of next-generation sequencing techniques, bioinformatics analysis of large amounts of data, and the availability of large databases [17,18]. This technical progress enabled an increased resolution of the plant-associated microbial diversity. Interestingly, very few studies employed a combination of culture-dependent and -independent techniques (Figure S2).
Globally, articles are not evenly distributed across geographic zones. Together, the warm-temperate and Mediterranean zone (zone III and IV) comprise approximately 2/3 of the analyzed articles (45.65% (83) and 20.65% (38), respectively) (Figure 2a). These two zones only represent 15% of the national territory but are the richest biodiversity area and contain a high diversity of ecosystems [19]. Furthermore, environmental conditions such as higher precipitation and fertile soils [20,21] favor human settlement (48.9% of the Chilean population) and general development (e.g., agriculture, research) in the warm-temperate and Mediterranean zone [22].
In contrast, geographic zones located in the extreme north (Zone I and II) and south of Chile (Zone V and VI) present a substantially lower number of articles on PGPM (9.78% (18), 6.52% (12), 11.41% (21), and 5.98% (11), respectively). These environments are known for complex and extreme conditions in terms of salinity, aridity, UV radiation, temperature, pH, and heavy metals [23], limiting agricultural activities [24]. Nevertheless, environments may harbor beneficial microorganisms, which can contribute to a quick adaptation of agriculture to climate change conditions such as drought, increased UV, salinity, cold, and heat [25,26], without the replacement to change crop varieties. However, this potential is poorly explored as only 27% of the culture-dependent studies were performed in these geographic zones (zone I and II, zone V and VI) (Figure 2b).
For articles based on culture-independent techniques, the distribution tends to be slightly less biased towards the warm-temperate and Mediterranean zone (Figure 2c), where still 54% of the studies were carried out.
Only seven articles used culture-dependent and independent techniques, of which 5 were carried out in the zone with the highest article number, Zone IV (Figure 2d).
In 89.7% of the revised articles, the studied microorganisms were native to Chile, while only 6.5% used strains introduced (Figure 2e). The effectiveness of introduced microorganisms has been discussed [7,11]. Some studies address this issue, such as Salvatierra-Martinez et al. (2015) [27], where tolerance to salinity and antagonistic capacity were evaluated in 10 native Trichoderma spp. Strains and a commercial bioformulation of exogenous. The native strains demonstrated more tolerance to salinity and better performance in plant growth promotion.
Most studies focus on bacteria or fungi, mainly mycorrhizae (43.5% and 42.4% of the articles, respectively), whereas 9.2% included both microorganisms (Figure 2f).
Finally, 59.2% of the revised articles work with a native plant host, whereas 38.6% evaluate the microbial effect on plants for commercial use, such as agricultural and forestry crops (Figure 2g).
PGPM present a wide range of mechanisms to interact with the plant host [28], including nutrient availability for the host, biocontrol, phytohormone production, etc. In our data set, the most studied mechanisms are biocontrol capacity and phosphate solubilization (20 and 9 articles, respectively). Nonetheless, most studies display a very narrow characterization of the investigated microorganisms, with more than 80% of the articles focusing on one mechanism. Only a small number of studies evaluate experimentally two or more mechanisms (16%). This high specificity regarding the studied PGPM mechanisms does not allow for assessing the capabilities of the isolated strains in a more holistic approach, even though this kind of information would be very helpful for selecting promising microbial strains. Thus, our understanding of the distribution, acquisition, or loss of functional traits in PGPM as an adaption to the plant host niche is still very limited.
3.2. Reduction of Environmental Stress through Inoculation of Microorganisms
Several consequences of global change are challenging for the agricultural sector, particularly when these increase the abiotic stresses for the crop plants, such as floods, salinity, soil degradation, high temperature, and drought [29]. Different microbial mechanisms have been described to improve plant growth under stress conditions, such as the production of phytohormones and exopolysaccharides, as well as the activity of the ACC deaminase enzyme [7,28,30]. In this sense, we searched our database for articles that evaluate the interaction of PGPM and their plant host under environmental conditions.
In total, 42 articles address this topic, 31 based on culture-dependent techniques, 10 based on culture-independent techniques and 1 considers both (Figure 3a). The most studied environmental stresses are drought (15 articles in total), nutrient availability (9 articles), pollution (7 articles), and soil salinity (6 articles) (Figure 3b). While most articles center on single stress (31), articles considering multi-stresses are rare (Table S3). Culture-dependent studies focus on drought, nutrient availability, and soil salinity. Their experimental approach involves exploring the PGPM capacity to mitigate the stress effect in the plant host. Particularly, drought and soil salinity are considered the major stresses for agriculture, which lead to significant yield reduction [31,32]. Therefore, biotechnological solutions, as projected by the authors of these studies, would be relevant for the productive sector but often fail to advance from the laboratory scale to actual commercialization by the industry [33].
For the culture-independent studies, the range of investigated environmental stresses is much broader (Figure 3b). In most cases, the research aims to understand microbial diversity, adaption and/or variability in a natural environment without a specific interest in its applicability. Despite not being directly applicable, this knowledge is valuable for understanding microbial sensibility to different conditions, which, e.g., can help to develop or improve the management of agricultural soils.
3.3. Towards a Biotechnological Solution
In this section, only culture-dependent studies working with microbial inoculation (single strain and/or consortia) were considered, which sum 84 articles. Of these, 55 studies used single-strain inoculation; in 29 studies, microbial consortia were applied. Most biotechnological studies were conducted in the warm-temperate and Mediterranean zone (zone III and IV) (Figure 4). In these two zones, researchers can take advantage of the high ecosystem and crop diversity reflected in a higher diversity of investigated plant types (Figure 4a). However, increasing drought due to climate change will affect this area [34] and research from arid zones (zone I and II), anticipating climate change consequences in formerly more humid areas is urgently needed, but much less performed. The studies from arid zones (zone I and II) mostly focus on vegetable crops, such as tomato and lettuce, which are commonly cultivated despite their water demand. In zone V, PGPM inoculation in grasslands and forest trees is investigated, reflecting the dominant land use types. Finally, no studies with microbial inoculations were found for the subantarctic zone (zone VI).
The relatively high number of studies conducted with vegetables and grasslands reflects these crop plants’ commercial importance (local and global) [35]. Nonetheless, the prevalence of these crops vs. fruit trees or forest trees in scientific studies might also be influenced by their growth characteristics, e.g., short life cycle, plant size, and availability of physiological and genetic information for the species. Such arguments gain importance when considering framework conditions in science, which are defined by the duration of research projects, availability of funds, and scientific excellence measured in publications [33].
During the biotechnological development process, the proof of concept for a new technology is an important step (TRL 3). At that level, the scientific knowledge is considered sufficiently founded to encounter the validation and scaling to the operational environment [36]. In this section, 87% of the articles were classified as TRL1 or 2 (36 and 37, respectively), reflecting knowledge generation in the context of PGPM and their interaction with the plant host (Figure 4b and Figure S3). Only 11% of the articles corresponding to TRL3, and the remaining 2% report findings equivalent to TRL4. These findings exemplify a diagnosis published by other authors in the field [36,37,38]. Among others, the lack of funding for more applied research is probably the major limitation, despite the effort made by the Chilean state to promote this transitional stage via special calls of the national science agency and tax breaks for companies involved in research and development (R+D). It is important to mention that research beyond TRL3 rarely is published in scientific journals, in order to conserve data privacy for patenting (or other form of protection of the intellectual property) [33]. Additionally, the formulation of PGPM based products and the scaling up requires collaborative research, e.g., with bioengineers, agronomists, commercial engineers etc., and alliances with the productive sector, which often escape the interest (or possibilities) of a scientist in PGPM [36,37].
Another relevant aspect is the selection of the microbe to be investigated o scaled up. Here, arguments for science and industry differ widely from each other. For science, the novelty of the research and cultivability of the microorganism is often decisive, whereas for industry technical, economic, and even social aspects (sustainability, innocuousness) are relevant [33]. The higher degree of freedom of choice is reflected in a higher taxonomic diversity of the study microorganisms in science (Figure 5). Interestingly, Bacillus sp. strains are the most used microorganisms in science and industry. Many commercial products contain Bacillus sp. strains, as single strains or consortia (often with Trichoderma ) (Supplementary Material 2), because they maintain high levels of viability in formulations and relatively long shelf life [7,36,39] such as Serratia spp. and Klebsiella spp. are only found in scientific articles, and despite their promising plant growth promotion effects, such strains are difficult to transfer to the industry area in generally stigmatized as pathogens [30,36].
4. Gaps in Knowledge and Technology Transfer of PGPM Research
The knowledge and technology transfer around biotechnological solutions based on PGPM between academia and industry is limited [36,40]. During our analysis of the situation in Chile as a study case, we discussed some critical points of the transfer process, e.g., scaling up from the proof of concept to a proven technology includes various pitfalls [37,41], deviating selection criteria for the PGPM study objects [33]. In this section, we aim to put our results into a broader context, focusing on three transversal aspects: inter- and transdisciplinary research, territories, public policy and society, and collaborative innovation between academia and industry.
4.1. Inter- and Transdisciplinary Research
We detected that PGPM research mainly focuses on understanding interaction mechanisms, microbial community assembly, and function. However, this research rarely leads to application. We consider that a low level of collaboration with other disciplines might be involved, as other scientific specialties are needed during the transfer process. In this sense, inter- or transdisciplinary science provides a possibility to overcome subject-specific limitations. At the same time, scientific findings are communicated in a way that is easier to understand and accessible to various stakeholders (such as industrial partners) [13]. In the health sector, incorporating interdisciplinary formation improved the innovation in research and increased the interaction between professionals of different areas to resolve problems with input from different disciplines [42]. The major challenges for inter- or transdisciplinary science are developing a common base for communication and understanding, generating a common conceptual model, and appropriately handling expectations and misunderstandings.
Beyond the purely academic context, transdisciplinary collaboration is an opportunity to integrate the local and regional community in participatory research, allowing it to properly address real-world problems and sustainable development goals [43]. Additional benefits of such a participatory approach are promoting an open-minding social attitude, enabling cross-learning between participants, and building networks [13,33].
To achieve this, the availability and distribution of funding resources become relevant. They must be adapted to current requirements [44] to ensure an adequate environment for cutting-edge innovations and their application and egalitarian access to knowledge and development in societies.
Inter- and transdisciplinary collaborations in science allow greater knowledge integration and comprehension of the proposed study subject [45]. This also applies to underexplored geographic areas in our review (e.g., arid and semi-arid zones), where PGPM science is much less conducted but highly relevant to face climate change and the increase in desertification worldwide. Similarly to Vásquez-Dean et al. (2020) [46], we consider that this global challenge requires and demands a stronger linkage and cooperation between researchers worldwide.
4.2. Territories, Public Policy and Society
The geographic distribution of the PGPM studies in Chile reflects a tendency that has been observed as a general pattern with regard to research efforts on soil biodiversity (and microbial diversity studies): most studies are concentrated in temperate systems, from which microbial diversity and ecological function often are extrapolated to other ecosystems [47,48]. Moreover, as mentioned before, much less research has been published from arid and semiarid ecosystems which is worrying particularly in the context of increasing desertification due to global change [46,49].
Economic and infrastructure development of a country strongly correlates with establishing national scientific capabilities [50]. For instance, the economic development in most dryland countries is very low compared to countries in other ecosystems [51,52], which could explain (at least partially) the lower scientific productivity in these regions. Emerging and developing countries generally identified the potential of innovation and technology transfer to advance economic development and employment. In this context, allocating public funds is the main source for establishing local capability and sustainable science systems [53,54]. Take the example of Chile (despite being an OECD member state), where an average of 0.36% of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is inverted in science, and only 33% of this amount is contributed by the private sector, which is far below OECD average [55]. Under such conditions, scientific research in emerging and developing countries intends to compete with developed countries, which is not yet achieved but is on track [50]. In addition, the research hotspots of a country geographically correlate with its economically most competitive regions, generating a high degree of inequality in the national science system in both developed and developing countries [50].
Public science policy in developing countries seeks to strengthen knowledge and technology transfer via different mechanisms, focusing on generating public incubators to support entrepreneurship and startups [33,53]. This strategy is also related to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and both are strongly based on science, technology, and innovation. Public incubator programs successfully contributed to economic and social development in countries such as India, Brazil, or China, whereas African countries just started with such public programs [53]. A challenge for policymakers is how to invert public funds most effectively to locally or regionally in order to achieve a sustainable development [43]. Therefore, an overall strategic vision for the territory based on a bottom-up and inclusive process involving all stakeholders and a comprehensive diagnosis of territorial strengths and challenges is required [56].
Public awareness . Despite the multiple benefits PGPM based biotechnological solutions offer to the farmer as well as to the final consumer, these are little integrated into crop management, and commonly little is known about them. At least since the pandemic, microorganisms have become part of daily awareness, but mainly as pathogens to humans, animals, or plants. This negative image, also supported by public health and the advertisement of cleaning and hygienic products that eliminate up to 99.9% of microbes, causes rejection and misunderstanding of microorganisms and their importance for us as well as all ecosystems on earth [57,58]. Therefore, it is important to convert their bad reputation through education (schools and universities) and outreach programs, highlighting the benefits generated by microorganisms (e.g., pharmacy, health, food production, soil fertility, etc.) [57,59]. In the context of PGPM for agriculture, communication and training with specific information and practical guides for using microbe-based products could contribute to overcoming uncertainties, such as efficiency, specificity, or compatibility with other products (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides) [10].
4.3. Collaborative Innovation between Academia and Industry
Although the number of articles analyzed in this review is not small (n > 200), their impact on society is not significant. Kampers et al. (2022) identified in their study two mayor causes for the lack of market introduction: ineffective communication (often leading to the loss of opportunity) and the differences of TRL that academia and industry operate on (which is linked to the aims and expectations on both sides). This divergence of objectives in science and the productive sector could also be complex for the agricultural industry [60].
In the context of ineffective communication, other studies confirm that the dissemination of scientific knowledge historically occurred through platforms, which are not suitable for technology transfer [61]. An “economic impact can be achieved only after a complex, temporally unfolding sequence of interactions between formal and informal channels of knowledge transfer” [61].
We consider that the generation of a collaborative innovation environment, where academia as well as public and private stakeholders (including the local community) take part, is crucial to enhance the acceptance and integration of PGPM on the way to sustainable agriculture. The establishment of such collaborative network is still in its infancy in many countries and is not necessarily linked to the economic potential of a country, as the example of Chile shows [55,62]. In their revision of co-invention patents in Chile, Pinto et al. (2019) reveal that the inventor network in Chile is highly fragmented and a significant majority of the patents granted in Chile belong to foreign inventors.
Such studies highlight the need to strengthen the science-policy–society interface and the collaborative generation of knowledge, based on renewed public policy frameworks, focusing on the local and national scale first [63,64].
In a future scenario, dynamic system would arise in which a rather industrial sector of society generates demand for innocuous agricultural products, stimulating the growth of the biotechnological market, such as the manufacture of biostimulants and biofertilizers based on PGPM. Thus, dynamic and growing marketing with costs and benefits arises. Society generates a demand as the final consumer of safe agricultural products, which generates a growing market for PGPR products, leading to the establishment of costs/benefits for the producer.
5. Final Remarks
Since the discovery of the benefits that the interaction of plants and beneficial microorganisms can generate for agriculture sustainability and adaption to climate change challenges, much scientific research has been developed, and knowledge of involved mechanisms has been gained. However, this scientific knowledge about PGPM does not penetrate society, and technology transfer to the productive sector (agriculture, forestry, and biotechnological industry) is low. This transfer from the academia to the productive sector is essential to scale up PGPM based solutions for agriculture. The bridge of effective communication has two heads and crossing requires the commitment of both. Neither academia nor industry can meet unfounded expectations during technology transfer, but mutually clarifying their needs, capabilities, and limitations is the starting point for successful collaborations. In this context, intermediaries such as R & D bureaus, or even startups, together with a strategic public policy, could contribute to overcoming industry’s limited experience in collaborative innovation.
A more efficient funding mechanism is needed to bridge the gap between scientific findings and promising prototypes, promoting a collaborative environment between academia and industry. Regionally developed PGPM solutions for specific soil and climate conditions offer the opportunity to diversify the productive regional sector, improving the labor market and social development.
Awareness raising in society and within the agricultural sector should be reinforced. Involving society with arguments on food quality and safety and sustainable crop management could be a powerful tool to enhance the incorporation of PGPM based solutions in agriculture. In addition, the current public interest in the circular economy enables the possibility of bringing PGPM to a wider audience and winning new partners.

Abstract: Background and Purpose: The study investigated the impact of intergenerational differences on knowledge transfer among engineers in large Slovenian production organizations. Method: Using the Delphi method, experts answered open-ended questions. The process concluded with a consensus reached in the third round. The resulting questionnaire was then administered to engineers of all ages working in large production organizations. Results: The experts’ responses indicated that intergenerational differences are most prominent in the workplace in terms of computer literacy and the use of information and communications technology. Effective employee engagement, including exemplary leadership, a system of mentoring and reverse mentoring, and a supportive organizational culture, was found to enhance the flow of knowledge transfer. Statistical analysis revealed that there are statistically significance intergenerational differences in knowledge transfer among engineers in large production organizations (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The study’s findings suggest that recognizing intergenerational differences and fostering the abilities of employees can contribute to organizational success. However, the study is limited to engineers in large production organizations in Slovenia. Future research should explore organizations in a wider geographical area and across different sectors.

Multiple stakeholder approach to inter-generation knowledge continuity

Author: Zaid-Dominik, Orna11 University of Haifa (Israel), Israel

Publication info: Zaid-Dominik, Orna. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/multiple-stakeholder-approach-inter-generation/docview/2781300115/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Despite the understanding that loss of knowledge resulting from demographic changes in the workforce, in particular, the massive retirement of baby-boomers, constitutes a high potential risk in advanced economies, research on knowledge continuity (KC) is scant. In particular, empirical research of the antecedents that determine inter-generation KC behavior (KCB) is limited mainly to qualitative studies emphasizing the departing employees' perceptions. The study presented in this dissertation addressed this gap in the literature by adopting a broader perspective to investigate the antecedents of effective inter-generation KC behavior among knowledge workers, incorporating personal and organizational factors before their retirement and the effectiveness of KC behavior after their retirement. Furthermore, we offer a first-of-its-kind multiple-stakeholder approach to the investigation of inter-generation KC, considering the perceptions of various stakeholders that may affect and be affected by knowledge continuity.The study comprised three phases. First, we identified dyads of soon-to-retire employees and their successors in a large technology-intensive firm. In the second and third phases, to test the study hypotheses, we used a longitudinal design to collect data at two time points, before and after the workers' retirement (six months after retirement). Data were collected from 87 dyads and their relevant supervisors and colleagues.The findings suggest that the interaction between soon-to retire employees and their successors embedded in trust relations is positively related to KC behavior, but does not indirectly influence KC effectiveness (KCE) as mediated by KC behavior. Moreover, the workers' perceptions of task interdependence do not moderate these relationships. In addition, transformational leadership does not affect KC behavior directly and does not indirectly influence KC effectiveness. However, the effects of successors and supervisors' perceptions of task interdependence were found to moderate these relationships. Transformational leadership is positively associated with KC behavior, but only among successors who perceive low task interdependence. Furthermore, KC behavior is positively associated with KC effectiveness only among supervisors who perceive high task interdependence. Finally, a moderated-mediation effect of transformational leadership style and task interdependence on KC effectiveness via KC behavior is found. The analysis results demonstrate differences in stakeholders' perceptions. We identified that the supervisors' demonstrated a "blind spot," which, given their role in enabling KC, may have crucial implications in terms of their willingness to act and invest in KC processes.In summary, considering the growing senior population that will be ageing and exiting the workforce in the coming years, the current study sheds light on the influence of different characteristics and needs among different generations and their implications for KC behavior and KC effectiveness. We discuss the important role of managers' behaviors and stakeholders' perceptions in KC among knowledge workers and how human resources practices can help facilitate inter-generation KC and harness its effectiveness.

Abstract: Age is the most dominant form of diversity in the workplace. Five generations are currently represented in the workplace, with each one having their own perspectives and communication styles. Workplace teams are most likely to be comprised of members from multiple generations, yet research is inconclusive regarding how age diversity is impacting productivity and team performance. To examine preferences of working in teams comprising same generation or different generation members, a survey was disseminated to a sample of employees across various organizations in the current workforce, ages 18 and up. The survey examined perceptual generational differences regarding work ethic, communication styles, technology, culture and diversity, and other core values. Results indicate employees value generational diversity and believe generationally diverse teams increase team performance. However, findings indicate tensions are likely to occur when working in generationally diverse teams, including the ability to communicate and transfer knowledge. This research identifies the growing desire for generational diversity in the workforce and points out where investments in training and resources are needed to support knowledge transfer, optimize strengths, and ensure communication is heard and understood by all.

The development of green skills across firms in the institutional context of Thailand

Author: Napathorn, Chaturong11 Department of Organization, Entrepreneurship, and Human Resource Management, Faculty of Commerce and Accountancy, Thammasat University, Bangkok, Thailand

Publication info: Napathorn, Chaturong. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/development-green-skills-across-firms/docview/2737274915/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Purpose > This paper examines the development of green skills across firms located in an institutional context, specifically the national education and skill-formation system, of the under-researched developing country of Thailand. Design/methodology/approach > This paper qualitatively explores the Thai education and skill-formation system and conducts a cross-case analysis of four firms across different industries in Thailand. The empirical findings in this paper draws on semi-structured interviews with various stakeholders; field visits to vocational colleges, universities, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) and firms across industries both in Bangkok and in other provinces in Thailand; and a review of archival documents and web-based reports and resources. Findings > This paper proposes that firms across industries in Thailand must be responsible for helping their employees/workers obtain the green knowledge and skills necessary to perform green jobs through high-road human resource (HR) practices in response to the fact that the Thai education and skill-formation system is unlikely to produce a sufficient number of employees/workers who have green knowledge, skills and abilities and are industry-ready to perform green jobs, leading to a shortage of employees/workers who possess green skills in the labor market. Specifically, curricula in vocational colleges and universities in Thailand are not likely to respond to the needs of firms in producing those employees/workers. Research limitations/implications > The limitations of this research concern its methodology. This research is based on the qualitative studies of the Thai education and skill-formation system and a case study of firms across industries in Thailand. Thus, this paper does not aim to generalize the findings to all other countries but to enrich the discussion on the effects of macro-level HR policies on the creation of green jobs and the development of green skills across firms in each country. Additionally, it is difficult to gain access to firms across several industries and various stakeholders to understand the development of green skills among employees in these firms. The reasons are resource constraints, time constraints and the hesitation of firms in permitting the author to access the data. These difficulties have restricted the sources of information to construct a more nuanced picture of firms across various industries in developing green skills among their existing employees. Consequently, this research does not include firms in several other industries, including the pulp and paper industry, textile and garment industry, plastic industry and agri-food industry. Thus, future research may extend the topic of the development of green skills among employees to these industries. Quantitative studies using large samples of firms across industries may also be useful in deepening the understanding of this topic, which is significant from the perspectives of the strategic human resource management (SHRM), comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices, and green economy. Practical implications > This paper also provides practical implications for top managers and/or HR managers of firms in Thailand, other developing countries and other emerging market economies with deficiencies in the national education and skill-formation system. First, the top managers and/or HR managers can apply various methods to internally develop managers and employees/workers with the appropriate environmental/green knowledge and necessary skills to perform green jobs. The methods include classroom training, on-the-job training, coaching, mentoring systems, job shadowing and being role models for younger generations of employees. Second, these top managers and/or HR managers can cooperate with vocational colleges and/or universities in their countries to design educational programs/curricula related to environmental/green management to be able to produce graduates with suitable qualifications for their firms. These managers can request for assistance from universities in their countries when their firms confront sophisticated questions/problems related to environmental/green management. In this regard, universities will have an opportunity to solve real environmental/green problems experienced by industries, while firms can appropriately and accurately solve environmental/green questions/problems. Third, these top managers and/or HR managers can encourage their firms to apply for certificates of green-/environmentally friendly products or carbon footprint labels from NGOs to foster a green image among firms' consumers. These applications require the firms to pay special attention to the cultivation of green awareness and the development of green skills among their employees. Fourth, these top managers and/or HR managers can encourage their employees to express green-/environmentally friendly behaviors as well as sufficiency-based consumption behaviors. In fact, these top managers and/or HR managers can foster their employees to reduce energy consumption, including electricity and water, to conserve these types of energy for young generations. Fifth, these top managers and/or HR managers can adopt and implement green human resource management (GHRM) practices consisting of green recruitment and selection, green training and development, green performance management, green pay and rewards and green employee relations in their firms to upgrade both the environmental and social performances of firms. Finally, these top managers and/or HR managers must take serious actions regarding the implementation of environmental/green management policies and practices within their firms in order to facilitate the movement of the country toward the bioeconomy, circular economy, and green economy (BCG economy). Social implications > This paper provides social/policy implications for the government, vocational colleges and universities in Thailand, other developing countries and emerging market economies where the skill shortage problem is still severe. First, the government of each country should incorporate green/environmental policies into the national education policy and the long-term strategic plan of the country. Second, the government should continuously implement such national policy and strategic plan by encouraging government agencies, vocational colleges, universities, firms and NGOs to cooperate in developing and offering environmental/green management educational programs/curricula to produce graduates with suitable qualifications for those firms. Third, the government should encourage vocational colleges and universities to equip their students with green skills to be industry-ready in a real working context. Fourth, to alleviate the skill shortage problem in the labor market, the government should foster firms, especially private sector firms, to focus on the upskilling and reskilling of their existing employees. With this action, their existing employees will have green skills, be able to effectively perform green jobs and become an important driver to help the country move toward the BCG economy. Fifth, the government of each country should encourage firms to develop green-/environmentally friendly products by offering them various types of incentives, including tax reductions or tax exemptions. Sixth, the government should encourage universities in the country to sign a memorandum of understanding with leading research institutes and world-class digital technology companies such that these institutes and/or companies admit high-potential university students to work as trainees/entry-level employees for a certain duration. This action can ultimately facilitate knowledge transfer from these institutes and/or companies to those university students who will finally return to work in their home country. Seventh, the government, especially the Ministry of Education, should encourage vocational colleges and universities to teach students in the environmental/green management program based on real case studies/problems found across firms. In this way, graduates should be industry-ready to perform green jobs. Finally, the government must pay serious attention to the implementation of environmental/green management policies across levels within the country so that the transition of the country toward the BCG economy will finally come true in the future. Originality/value > This paper contributes to the SHRM, comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices, and the literature on the green economy and the development of green skills in firms in the following ways. First, this paper focuses on examining how the institutional context of Thailand shapes the development of green knowledge and skills among employees across firms in Thailand. In this regard, the paper aims to fill the gap in the literature on strategic HRM and comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices as proposed by Batt and Banerjee (2012) and Batt and Hermans (2012), who suggested that the literature on strategic HRM should go beyond the organizational context and examine how firms adopt and implement HR practices in response to the national institutional context. Second, the paper aims to extend the literature on the green economy regarding the roles played by institutional factors in shaping the development of green knowledge and skills across firms. Finally, strategic HRM, comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices and green economy studies have overlooked the under-researched country of Thailand. Most studies in these three areas focus more on developed countries. Thus, the findings of this paper should extend the literature on those areas regarding the development of green skills among employees across firms in response to the Thai institutional context.

Full text: Introduction
Scholars and practitioners across the globe have paid increasing attention to the concept of environmentally sustainable growth and development, especially during this period of climate change and COVID-19 (Bunge et al ., 1996; Marcus and Fremeth, 2009; Howard-Grenville et al ., 2014; Marquis et al ., 2015; Consoli et al ., 2016; APEC, 2016; Ren et al ., 2018; Suttipun, 2018; Zhenmin and Espinosa, 2019; Kose et al ., 2020; Barbier and Burgess, 2020), because the current economic model, that is, the so-called brown economy, has not been able to solve several problems regarding inequality, the environment and the depletion of natural resources (Maclean et al ., 2017; Brandi et al ., 2020). By contrast, evidence suggests that the green economy helps reduce the use of fossil fuels, decrease pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, increase the efficiency of energy usage, recycle materials and develop and adopt renewable sources of energy. Additionally, the green economy should help foster environmentally sustainable growth and development across countries, create green jobs and facilitate the development of green skills among people in each country, reduce production losses and solve problems regarding global climate and environmental degradation (Dierdorff et al ., 2009; Loiseau et al. , 2016; Maclean et al ., 2017; Balsalobre-Lorente et al ., 2020; Majeed and Ozturk, 2020).
To develop green skills among people in any country, the institutional context is likely to be important in terms of the education and skill-formation system that are to equip people with the knowledge, skills and abilities (the so-called human capital) required to effectively perform green jobs (Becker, 1962; Mincer, 1962; Consoli et al ., 2016). If the education and skill-formation system in any country cannot respond to the need for the development of green skills across firms, its education and skill-formation system might need to be restructured and/or improved to meet acceptable standards and support the transition toward the green economy in the future. However, prior studies have not paid sufficient attention to the development of green skills across firms in response to the institutional context, that is, the education and skill-formation system, in each country, especially in emerging market economies such as Thailand. In other words, previous research is not likely to go beyond an organizational context and examine how macro-level institutions shape firm-level behaviors in terms of the development of green skills among employees across those firms in emerging market economies. Therefore, this paper aims to fill this literature gap by answering the following research question: “How do firms develop green skills among employees in response to the institutional context in terms of the education and skill-formation system?” To answer this question, the paper uses the case study of the Thai education and skill-formation system and the case study of firms across industries in the emerging economy of Thailand.
Specifically, this paper examines the Thai education and skill-formation system and conducts a cross-case analysis of four firms across different industries in Thailand – SSS Ceramics Public Company Limited, PPP Public Company Limited, Chaophya Park Hotel and Thanya Shopping Park – to understand the roles of the institutional context in terms of the education and skill-formation system in shaping how green skills are developed among employees in these firms. SSS Ceramics Public Company Limited is situated in the manufacturing industry; PPP Public Company Limited is situated in the energy industry; Chaophya Park Hotel is located in the hotel and resorts industry; and, finally, Thanya Shopping Park is situated in the retail industry.
The case study evidence presented in this paper draws on semi-structured interviews with a variety of stakeholders in Thailand. Interviewees included top managers of vocational colleges in Thailand; top managers and directors of environmental/green management programs at universities across the country; a top executive from the Ministry of Education; top managers and project managers at the Thailand Environmental Institute (a nongovernmental organization or NGO); students who performed green jobs during their internship period or after graduating with a bachelor’s degree from Thai universities; and each firm's top managers, human resource (HR) managers and employees. Field visits were also conducted to vocational colleges, universities, an NGO, and firms across industries in both Bangkok and other provinces in Thailand. Additionally, a review of archival documents and web-based reports and resources was performed. Based on the examination of the Thai education and skill-formation system and the cross-case analysis of four firms across industries, this paper proposes that firms across industries in Thailand must be responsible for helping their employees/workers obtain the green skills necessary to perform green jobs through high-road HR practices in response to the fact that the Thai education and skill-formation system is not likely to produce a sufficient number of employees/workers who have green knowledge, skills and abilities and who are industry-ready to perform green jobs, leading to a shortage of employees/workers who possess green skills in the labor market. Specifically, the curricula of vocational colleges and universities in Thailand cannot respond to the needs of firms in producing those employees/workers.
This paper contributes to the strategic human resource management (SHRM), comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices, and the literature on the green economy and the development of green skills in firms in the following ways. First, this paper focuses on examining how the institutional context of Thailand shapes the development of green knowledge and skills among employees across firms in Thailand. In this regard, the paper aims to fill the gap in the literature on strategic HRM and comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices as proposed by Batt and Banerjee (2012) and Batt and Hermans (2012), who suggested that the literature on strategic HRM should go beyond the organizational context and examine how firms adopt and implement HR practices in response to the national institutional context. Second, the paper aims to extend the literature on the green economy regarding the roles played by institutional factors in shaping the development of green knowledge and skills across firms. Finally, strategic HRM, comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices and green economy studies have overlooked the under-researched country of Thailand. Most studies in these three areas focus more on developed countries. Thus, the findings of this paper should extend the literature on those areas regarding the development of green skills among employees across firms in response to the Thai institutional context.
Literature review and theoretical framework
The following three main bodies of literature are reviewed to help develop the theoretical framework used in this paper: the roles of institutional contexts, strategic HRM and the green economy and the development of green skills across firms. Additionally, the institutional context in Thailand in terms of the education and skill-formation system is reviewed to provide a better understanding of how this context shapes the development of the green skills examined in this paper.
The roles of institutional contexts
The comparative institutional theory (Aguilera and Grogaard, 2019; Kostova et al ., 2019; Morgan et al ., 2010; Hall and Soskice, 2001; Streeck and Thelen, 2005; Whitley, 1999) proposes that national institutions play a key role in shaping and constraining firm-level behaviors and HR strategies and practices adopted and implemented across these firms (Batt and Hermans, 2012). One of the popular frameworks for comparative institutional theory that examines the role of institutions in each country is the varieties of capitalism (VoC) framework (Hall and Soskice, 2001). Hall and Soskice argued that to develop and coordinate core competencies, firms must maintain various relationships within five institutional domains, including the education and skill-formation system.
Here, the education and skill-formation system refers to the full range of formal and informal vocational, technical and skills-based education and training for employment in each country. Specifically, in countries with liberal market economies (LMEs), such as the US and the UK, the system offers formal education that focuses on general instead of firm- or industry-specific skills. In other words, firms in LMEs are reluctant to develop managerial and professional employees internally and to invest in firm-specific training (Hall and Soskice, 2001; Napathorn, 2018a). By contrast, in countries in coordinated market economies (CMEs) such as Germany, the national education and skill-formation system provides workers with firm- or industry-specific skills (Finegold and Wagner, 2002). Specifically, firms in CMEs such as Germany pay more attention to the internal development of managerial and professional employees and invest in firm-specific training instead of general training (Crouch, 2005; Finegold, 1999; Culpepper, 1999; Napathorn, 2018a). In this regard, the national education and skill-formation system plays a supporting role in supplying a skilled workforce that responds to the needs of industries and firms and in alleviating the country's skill shortage (Finegold et al ., 2000). However, other systems, such as those in the US, may not play this role due to their sole focus on general training.
In fact, the skill shortage problem is particularly severe in emerging market economies (Napathorn, 2020). Kuruvilla and Ranganathan (2008) examined the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry in India and proposed that the primary macro HR problem in India is the shortage of a skilled workforce (i.e. managerial and professional employees). Specifically, India's education and skill-formation system cannot produce a sufficient number of software engineers and high-skilled manpower that the BPO industry will need. Therefore, firms in the BPO industry are reluctant to invest in the internal development of their managerial and professional employees. Rather, there has been an increase in poaching in this industry. In addition to India, Thailand has faced a skill shortage problem in the labor market because the Thai education and skill-formation system is not likely to produce qualified employees for firms across several industries (Napathorn, 2018a).
Strategic HRM
Within the strategic HRM (SHRM) literature, the development of HR systems and practices that achieve both horizontal fit and vertical fit enables the organization to achieve its objectives/goals (Wright and McMahan, 1992; Baird and Meshoulam, 1988; Delery, 1998; Napathorn, 2018b; Kehoe, 2021). Horizontal fit refers to internal consistency among HR practices within an organization, whereas vertical fit refers to the alignment of the HR systems and practices with other organizational characteristics such as business strategies or organizational objectives/goals (Baird and Meshoulam, 1988; Delery, 1998).
In terms of the vertical fit, it is important to match HR systems and practices with the organization's strategies or objectives/goals. In other words, the fit between the HR systems and the organization's strategies or objectives/goals is important as it leads to superior organizational performance (Baird and Meshoulam, 1988). For instance, Wright et al . (1995), Youndt et al . (1996) and Chadwick et al . (2013) empirically tested the vertical fit argument and emphasized the need to match HR systems and practices with business strategies or organizational objectives/goals to maximize organizational performance.
However, Batt and Banerjee (2012), Batt and Hermans (2012), Napathorn (2018a) and Napathorn (2020) proposed that the literature on strategic HRM has paid too much attention to the organizational context (e.g. the influence of organizations' business strategies on the implementation of HR systems and practices) and should go beyond the organizational context to examine how institutional contexts shape the adoption and implementation of organizations' HR practices.
Green economy and the development of green skills across firms
Within the green economy literature (Pearce et al ., 1989; Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2011; United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 2011; Barbier, 2012; World Bank, 2012a, b; EAA, 2013; European Environment Agency (EEA), 2014; Loiseau et al. , 2016; Policy Research Center on Green Economy at the Faculty of Economics, Thammasat University, 2019; D'Amato et al. , 2017; Merino-Saum et al ., 2020), the concept of a green economy refers to an economic paradigm that simultaneously focuses on both economic development and sustainable environmental conservation. That said, this paradigm assumes that economic advancement and environmental conservation must be in the same direction and must not contradict each other (Maclean et al ., 2017; Tien et al ., 2020). In other words, the development of a green economy and sustainable environmental conservation must not obstruct the wealth creation of the country and must not serve as barriers to the employment of local people. By contrast, the development of a green economy fosters the opportunities of investment in new industries and the development of green jobs in existing industries, leading to job creation for people in that country (Loiseau et al. , 2016; Dordmond et al ., 2021). In particular, the transition toward a green economy maximizes the use of resources such that the younger generations of each country are still able to utilize those resources in the long term (UNEP, 2011; Georgeson et al ., 2017).
Additionally, a green economy is defined as an economic system that leads to the improvement of people's well-being in each country, fosters fairness within society and reduces environmental risks and the shortage of natural resources (Loiseau et al. , 2016; Merino-Saum et al ., 2020). In this regard, the concept of a green economy was proposed by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to alleviate the problems incurred by liberalism and to move the economic system in a direction that aims for sustainable development (UNEP, 2011; Zhu, 2017).
According to the report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2017, development that aims to decrease carbon emissions into the atmosphere and that pays special attention to the climate does not diminish the economic growth rate of the country. In addition, this development has no impact on the country's competitive advantage and the well-being of people in society. This report also provides the guideline that the government of each country should follow to foster the transition to a green economy (OECD, 2017).
There have been no best practices in creating the green economy across countries because policies and strategies to create the green economy usually depend on the economic condition and contexts of each country. However, every country across the globe, including developed countries, developing countries, emerging market countries and poor countries, can effectively adopt and implement the green economy model, leading to the sustainable growth of economy and society. A green economy will also foster the development of eco-friendly innovations and generate new markets for green technologies, products and services. This will eventually create green jobs for people in that country (World Bank, 2012a, b; OECD, 2011; Loiseau et al. , 2016; Dordmond et al ., 2021).
Nevertheless, the transition toward a green economy and green jobs may result in the displacement of some jobs or skills. At the same time, this transition may lead to the creation of several types of green jobs. In this case, the main challenge is whether the level of knowledge and skills of people in that country is sufficient to allow them to effectively perform green jobs (Maclean et al ., 2017; Bombiak and Marciniuk-Kluska, 2018). Here, “green jobs” refer to jobs that help protect the ecosystem and biodiversity, foster the efficient use of energy and resources, reduce the emission of carbon into the environment and reduce waste and pollution in the environment (UNEP, ILO, International Organization of Employers (IOE), and International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), 2008, p. 3; Sulich et al ., 2020). These jobs may be found in the agricultural, manufacturing, research and development, and service industries (UNEP, ILO, IOE, and ITUC, 2008, p. 3; Dordmond et al ., 2021). Additionally, green jobs may provide sufficient wages/salaries, safety and security and appropriate rights for employees/workers (UNEP, ILO, IOE, and ITUC, 2008, p. 3).
Typically, employees/workers who perform green jobs must have green skills. In this study, “green skills” refer to skills related to the environmental awareness and sustainability, science, technology, engineering and mathematics required to perform green jobs. Green skills also include the management skills required when organizations are in the process of transitioning from regular jobs to green jobs according to the concept of a green economy. Examples of green skills include efficient energy usage, water resource conservation, wastewater treatment and zero waste management (Heong et al ., 2016; Maclean et al ., 2017; Cecere and Mazzanti, 2017).
The education and skill-formation system plays a crucial role in equipping employees/workers with green knowledge and skills. That is, vocational colleges and/or universities must train their graduates to possess green knowledge and skills. In particular, graduates must be trained to change their attitudes, perspectives and ideas to be ready to perform green jobs. Therefore, the education and skill-formation system must be adapted to fit with the national policy regarding the development of a green economy and to be ready for the transition toward a green economy. However, if employees/workers do not have green skills, they may not be able to achieve the goals of efficiently utilizing several types of natural resources, protecting and conserving the environment while simultaneously generating income and profits for organizations, and reducing the pollution that may be produced in the process.
However, the main problem among countries across the globe is that their education and skill-formation systems may not be able to produce a sufficient number of graduates who have the requisite green knowledge and skills to respond to the needs of industries and firms, leading to a skill shortage problem in the labor market (Napathorn, 2018a, 2020). This problem may result from the fact that the curricula taught in vocational colleges and universities located in those countries do not fit with the need for green skills among firms/industries (UNEP, 2011; Setiawan, 2017). In that case, firms across industries may have to implement several HR practices to solve this macro-level (i.e. national level) HR problem.
Thailand: institutional context
A combination of ordinary education and vocational education characterizes the education and skill-formation system in Thailand (Suehiro and Yabushita, 2014). These two types of educational tracks are divided at the stage of upper secondary education. Due to the fact that the ordinary educational track (standard educational track) became the dominant mode in public education during the past years, the percentage of students in vocational colleges or schools declined from 44% in 1990 to approximately 35% in 2008 (Suehiro and Yabushita, 2014). Later, the government attempted to increase the percentage of students in those colleges/schools to at least 45% in 2019 (ThailandPlus, 2018). In fact, the labor market in Thailand requires a large number of graduates from those institutions. For instance, in 2018, more than 50,000 graduates from vocational colleges/schools were required by firms in the area of the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) of Thailand, whereas vocational colleges in that area cannot produce a sufficient number of graduates to respond to that demand (Katchwattana, 2018).
In particular, although Thailand is “one of the East Asia's most active countries in educational development,” according to Suehiro and Yabushita (2014, p. 273), there are some problems in the Thai education and skill-formation system, including low student achievement, low academic credentials among teachers and a skill shortage and mismatch between education and the labor market. In terms of the skill shortage and mismatch between education and the labor market, this problem is considered to be the most serious for Thailand because the country has entered the upper-middle-income group of countries in 2011 (a country with a per capita gross national income (GNI) between US$3,976 and US$12,276) according to the World Bank (World Bank, 2011). With regard to the skill shortage problem, most companies in Thailand have been unable to fill vacancies within three months (Siam Commercial Bank Economic Intelligence Center, 2015; Bangkok Post, 2019; Napathorn, 2020). The challenge in recruiting university graduates is the lengthy time needed to find individuals with the right skill set. Regarding the skill mismatch, this problem results from the fact that public universities in Thailand have traditionally focused on the skills needed by the bureaucracy (e.g. political science, law and education) instead of the skills needed by private corporations (e.g. business administration, engineering and sciences). The 1997 Asian financial crisis revealed this mismatch of graduate profiles and skills required in the labor market (Pongpaichit and Baker, 1998; Jestin, 2009; Yabushita, 2020). According to OECD (2011), this phenomenon is referred to as “the over-qualified and under-skilled” problem, which is expressed in an imbalance in academic fields at universities (about 45% in social sciences, business and law; about 20% in engineering and natural sciences) (Siam Commercial Bank Economic Intelligence Center, 2015). The Thai government has attempted to improve this situation by implementing the Second 15-Year Educational Development Plan (2008–2022). This plan intends to increase the proportion of university students in natural sciences major to 50% by the year 2022 (Matichon, 2012; Yabushita, 2015).
To alleviate the problems of skill shortage and mismatch, private institutions and corporations in Thailand have established new types of higher educational institutions to meet the needs of the labor market (Suehiro and Yabushita, 2014). The Technology Promotion Association (TPA), for instance, opened the Thai-Nichi Institute of Technology (TNI) in Bangkok in July 2007, in cooperation with the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, to train students in the areas of production technology and practical knowledge in the automotive and electronics industries and in the science of industrial management. At the same time, Japanese firms provide scholarship and internship services for these students. The Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group, the world's largest producer of animal feed and shrimp and one of the leading producers of poultry and food products, with a strong stake in mainland China, opened its own corporate university (the Panyapiwat Institute of Management or PIM) to educate professionals in management including business practices in China (Napathorn and Kuruvilla, 2018). PIM invites Chinese students from abroad and, at the same time, delegates Thai students to China, Japan and countries in Europe. Similarly, PTT Public Company Limited, the largest petrochemical complex listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), has established its own institution to educate engineers specializing in the petrochemical industry. All of these projects have emerged to solve the problem regarding “a massive under-supply from standard educational institutions of engineers and professionals specializing in several growing industries” (Suehiro and Yabushita, 2014, p. 275) such as the agro food-processing, petrochemical and automotive industries as well as modern retail businesses.
Although Thailand's skill shortage and mismatch have been found to be one of the most serious problems in the nation's education and skill-formation system, and private institutions and corporations have attempted to solve this problem, according to Cha-laamwong (2014), it has persisted and is considered to be one of the threats to the country's ability to extricate itself from the so-called middle-income curse (Napathorn and Kuruvilla, 2018).
Based on the literature review of the three theoretical perspectives (the roles of institutional contexts, strategic HRM, and green economy and the development of green skills across firms); the review of the institutional context in Thailand; the qualitative data obtained from in-depth interviews with a variety of stakeholders including top managers of vocational colleges; top managers and directors of environmental/green management programs at universities across the country; a top executive from the Ministry of Education; top managers and project managers at the Thailand Environmental Institute (an NGO); students who performed green jobs during their internship period or after graduating with a bachelor's degree from Thai universities; and each firm's top managers, HR managers and employees; field visits to vocational colleges, universities, an NGO and firms across industries in both Bangkok and other provinces in Thailand; the non-participant observation of a variety of stakeholders; and a review of archival documents and web-based reports and resources, this paper proposes the following.
Firms across industries in Thailand must be responsible for helping their employees/workers obtain the green knowledge and skills necessary to perform green jobs through high-road HR practices in response to the fact that the Thai education and skill-formation system is unlikely to produce a sufficient number of employees/workers who have green knowledge, skills and abilities and are industry-ready to perform green jobs, leading to a shortage in the labor market of employees/workers who possess green skills. Specifically, curricula in vocational colleges and universities in Thailand are unlikely to respond to the needs of firms in producing those employees/workers.
In sum, this paper aims to fill the research gap by examining the development of green skills among employees across firms in response to the institutional context in terms of the education and skill-formation system of the emerging market economy of Thailand.
Research setting and methodology
Research setting
Thailand has been considered an appropriate site for conducting research on how firms develop green knowledge and skills among employees in response to the institutional context in terms of the education and skill-formation system because the Thai government has attempted to overcome various problems relevant to environmental pollution and climate change, including the severe PM 2.5 dust particle problem, deteriorating natural resources, global warming and the plastic waste crisis (Kraivijitr, 2019). In this regard, the government has recently paid special attention to the sustainable development goal of the country according to the strategy for driving Thailand based on a bioeconomy, circular economy and green economy (BCG economy) model 2021-2026 (NSTDA, 2021). Therefore, the development of green skills among employees has been considered to be a crucial factor in moving the country toward this goal. However, the Thai education and skill-formation system has faced a skill shortage problem in that most firms in Thailand have been unable to fill vacancies within three months and there is a skill mismatch problem in that a majority of university students graduate with degrees in social sciences, business and law, whereas firms need students with the degrees in engineering and sciences (Siam Commercial Bank Economic Intelligence Center, 2015). These two problems might negatively influence the transition of the country toward the BCG economy model. Relatively little research has focused on the adoption and development of green skills among employees across firms in response to the institutional context in terms of the education and skill-formation system of emerging market economies, including Thailand. In this paper, the author thus examines the Thai education and skill-formation system and conducts a cross-case analysis of four firms across different industries in Thailand – SSS Ceramics Public Company Limited in the manufacturing industry, PPP Public Company Limited in the energy industry, Chaophya Park Hotel in the hotel and resort industry and Thanya Shopping Park in the retail industry.
Research methodology
The author qualitatively examined the Thai education and skill-formation system, specifically at the vocational college and university levels, to understand how this system plays a role in producing employees/workers who have green knowledge, skills and abilities. Additionally, the author designed a cross-case comparison of four firms across industries to examine the similarities and/or differences in how these firms develop green skills among employees. Cross-case analysis enables the so-called logic of replication, although each case study confirms or disconfirms arguments regarding the development of green skills among employees drawn from previous cases (Eisenhardt and Bourgeois, 1988). In addition, a cross-case analysis encourages the author to extend initial impressions regarding the data findings (Eisenhardt, 1989) to develop an accurate and reliable theory from the case studies. In fact, this paper uses a qualitative approach − the case study approach − because the nature of this study is exploratory, and the author aims to establish the status quo (Patton, 2002). In addition, the author aims to collect comprehensive and holistic data (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 1994) on the Thai education and skill-formation system and four case study firms. This type of approach also permits the deep exploration of the interactions among several actors at different levels of analysis (Cooke, 2012). The actors in this current study included top managers of vocational colleges; top managers and directors of environmental/green management programs at universities across the country; a top executive from the Ministry of Education; top managers and project managers at the Thailand Environmental Institute (an NGO); students who performed green jobs during their internship period or after graduating with a bachelor's degrees from Thai universities; and each firm's top managers, HR managers and employees.
However, an important recommendation for conducting trustworthy case study research is that the researcher must remain neutral and detached from the cases (Yin, 1984, 2009). Thus, the author attempted to conduct this research and present the findings based on this recommendation. Additionally, another advantage of conducting a cross-case comparison is that it allows for the collection of data using multiple methods such as semi-structured interviews, field observations and analyses of archival documents and web-based resources (Yin, 1994); facilitates the theory-building process (Zhu et al ., 2012); and helps mitigate the problem of single-source bias that might occur when an author relies on only one data source (Napathorn, 2018a). This study also provides data for more extensive research and hypothesis development as part of the ongoing research on green skills and green HRM.
Sampled vocational colleges and universities were purposively selected because these vocational colleges and universities are highly respected and well known in Thailand. These colleges and universities have also offered various educational curricula to a large number of students for quite a long time. Four organizations across industries in Thailand were also selected via purposive sampling (Teddlie and Tashakkori, 2009) because they are located in the key industries that consume large amounts of energy. However, these four organizations have continuously received both national and international awards, such as Thailand Energy Awards and ASEAN Energy Awards, from several organizations for their energy-conservation practices and environmental/green management practices in prior years. Additionally, the top managers of these companies have long paid special attention to the environmental conservation and sustainable growth of their business for a long time and have successfully created green jobs and developed green knowledge and skills among their employees for a certain period. These top managers have always been under the spotlight regarding their green leadership and green management practices. Thus, these four companies should be considered to be good candidates for examining how firms develop green knowledge and skills among employees in response to the national institutional context. In fact, some other companies continuously received both national and international awards for their energy conservation practices and environmental/green management practices in prior years. However, these other companies have not been in the spotlight, and the top managers of these companies are not willing to allow the author to access the data and conduct research concerning this topic. This is one of the reasons that these four companies were purposively selected for this research.
The data in this paper were collected in 2018 and 2019 during approximately 9 months in the field. This research involved 38 semi-structured interviews with a variety of stakeholders including top managers of vocational colleges; top managers and directors of environmental/green management programs at universities across the country; a top executive from the Ministry of Education; top managers and project managers at the Thailand Environmental Institute (an NGO); students who performed green jobs during their internship period or after graduating with a bachelor's degree from Thai universities; and each firm's top managers, HR managers and employees (see Table 1 for a list of interviewees). The age range of the interviewees was between 22 and 65 years. Additionally, this research involved several field visits to vocational colleges, universities, the Ministry of Education, an NGO and firms across industries in both Bangkok and other provinces in Thailand, as well as research using a review of archival documents and web-based reports and resources, including firms' websites (if applicable).
Nonparticipant observation in this study occurred during the pre-interview, interview and post-interview periods. The primary objective of the nonparticipant observation was to observe the characteristics and behaviors of the interviewees and the employees working in the four case companies. In summary, the author collected data for this study via different methods (i.e. semi-structured interviews, nonparticipant observation and reviews of archival documents and web-based resources) to triangulate the data and overcome the single-source bias problem in this paper.
This study, which is a part of a research project on the creation of green jobs and the development of green skills, was ethically approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the author's university, which consists of well-known scholars in the social sciences and humanities fields. In particular, this committee reviewed the research project's proposal, the research methodology and interview protocols for approximately 2 months in 2018 before the committee approved the research project. That said, the author was eligible to start collecting the data only after the research project was approved by the committee. To gain access to each of the organizations, the author submitted a formal letter to them (via email and fax), using the fax numbers and email addresses provided on their websites. Each letter described the research project on the creation of green jobs and the development of green skills, provided some preliminary interview questions and asked for approval to conduct interviews with the organizations' representatives, top managers, HR managers and assigned employees. Finally, after waiting for firms' responses for some time, the author obtained permission to conduct the interviews as requested.
Each of the 38 semi-structured interviews lasted between 1.5 and 3.5 h. All of the interviews were conducted face-to-face and in Thai. The author used different interview protocols for each group of interviewees: (1) top managers of vocational colleges and universities; (2) top managers of the Ministry of Education and the Thailand Environmental Institute; (3) students who performed green jobs during their internship period or after graduating with a bachelor's degree from Thai universities; and (4) top managers, HR managers and employees at each case study firm. The questions for the semi-structured interviews with the top managers of vocational colleges and universities addressed the strengths and weaknesses of environmental/green management programs of each vocational college or university in developing green skills among graduates and in supporting the transition of the Thai economy toward a green economy, the qualifications of the applicants to those programs and the jobs performed by most graduates of those programs. The questions for the top managers of the Ministry of Education and the Thailand Environmental Institute included asking that they provide an overview of environmental/green management programs in Thailand to support the transition toward a green economy, create green jobs and develop green skills among graduates; the strengths and weaknesses of environmental/green management programs in Thailand; and insights into how to improve the weaknesses of those programs to help foster the development of green skills among graduates. The questions for students who performed green jobs during their internship period or after graduating with a bachelor's degree from Thai universities addressed how the environmental/green management programs in which they had participated supported them in developing green skills, the challenges they faced when they performed green jobs, how industry-ready they were when they performed green jobs and the extent to which their employer firms trained their employees to perform green jobs. Finally, the questions for the top managers, HR managers and employees of each case study firm addressed why each case study firm paid special attention to green businesses and green jobs, the nature of green jobs in each firm, the green job policy of each firm, the types of green skills that employees needed to perform green jobs, the challenges or problems each firm faced in recruiting and selecting employees from the labor market who have green skills, how each firm provided training and helped employees develop green skills, how environmental/green management programs in Thailand support each firm's employees' acquisition of green skills and the weaknesses of these programs. Each interview was digitally voice recorded, and the author took field notes during the interviews to facilitate transcription.
This paper applied a thematic analysis (Teddlie and Tashakkori, 2009) (via Atlas.ti) to pinpoint, examine and record patterns or themes within the data. In particular, the thematic analysis here involved three important steps. The author first categorized the raw data obtained from the semi-structured interviews and nonparticipant observation into empirical themes. To identify the empirical themes, the author used language that was as close to the data as possible. As the empirical themes emerged, the author compared the themes within and across these interview transcripts and notes to ensure that the themes fit the data well across the transcripts and field notes. Based on the empirical themes, the author constructed conceptual categories for the creation of green jobs and the development of green skills in firms to respond to the institutional context (Table 2 shows how the author categorized the raw data into empirical themes and consolidated those themes into conceptual categories; Table 3 shows the frequency of each empirical theme). Regarding the saturation of the data, the author believed that 38 semi-structured interviews with a variety of stakeholders should be sufficient to obtain robust results because no new themes, issues or insights were obtained beyond this number of interviews (Strauss and Corbin, 1990).
In conclusion, the author triangulated interviews with the top managers, HR managers and employees in each case study firm with perspectives from the top managers of vocational colleges and universities, the top managers of the Ministry of Education and the Thailand Environmental Institute and the students who performed green jobs during their internship period or after graduating with a bachelor's degree from Thai universities. Additionally, the nonparticipant observation of the attitudes and behaviors of the various groups of interviewees during company visits, the analysis of archival documents and web resources and the analysis of the author's field notes were used to triangulate the interview transcripts before developing the inductive analysis of the creation of green jobs and the development of green skills within firms in response to the national education and skill-formation system.
Empirical findings
The findings show that firms across industries in Thailand must be responsible for helping their employees/workers obtain the green knowledge and skills necessary to perform green jobs through high-road HR practices in response to the fact that the Thai education and skill-formation system is not likely to produce a sufficient number of employees/workers who have green knowledge, skills and abilities and who are industry-ready to perform green jobs, leading to a shortage of employees/workers who possess green skills in the labor market. Specifically, curricula in vocational colleges and universities in Thailand are not likely to respond to the needs of firms in producing those employees/workers. The detailed case studies below provide empirical evidence to support these findings.
The Thai education and skill-formation system
The Thai education and skill-formation system has been divided into two main levels: vocational colleges and universities.
Vocational colleges
Vocational colleges play a crucial role in the skill development and the sustainable development of the country. However, curricula that focus on the development of green knowledge and skills among students or curricula that support students to be able to perform green jobs or environmental/green management curricula have not been integrated into educational programs for vocational college students in Thailand (Interviews#1-2; Interview#3; Interview#4). According to an interview with a top manager of a vocational college, In fact, curricula related to environmental conservation and green management should have long been integrated into educational programs for vocational college students in Thailand. However, this issue has not been addressed successfully. (Interview#1)

In other words, educational programs for vocational college students in Thailand have paid special attention to the development of technical knowledge and technical skills, the use of hands-on learning and the implementation of on-the-job training among students. However, the knowledge and skills related to environmental conservation, green management, energy management and wastewater treatment has not been integrated into curricula. In this regard, in terms of the vocational education, the national education and skill development system does not play a role in the production of labor/employees who have the knowledge, skills and abilities to perform green jobs in Thailand. Thailand has continued to face a shortage of labor/employees who graduate from vocational colleges and who have been trained to perform green jobs or jobs related to environmental conservation (Interviews#1-2; Interview#3).
Nevertheless, in the future, content related to the environment and clean energy should be incorporated into every educational program offered by vocational colleges due to the fact that the issues of the environment, green management and sustainable growth have become increasingly important in Thailand. In addition, requirements may be imposed such that graduates from vocational colleges who wish to apply for a professional certificate must also obtain a certificate for environmental professionals. Because of this, vocational colleges certainly play an important role in the transition of the national economy to a green economy, the creation of green jobs and the development of green skills among employees (Interviews#1-2; Interviews#5-7).
Universities
Universities have played an important role in producing employees/workers who have knowledge and skills in green/environmental management because educational programs at the university level in Thailand have incorporated content related to green/environmental management into their programs. However, the majority of curricula that support the production of employees/workers who have the knowledge, skills and abilities necessary to perform green jobs have only been offered by schools/departments/programs directly relevant to the environment and natural resources. By contrast, the schools/departments/programs that are not directly related to green/environmental management have still not incorporated content on green/environmental management into their programs. According to an interview with a top manager and scholar of the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, Mahidol University, This issue is quite understandable because, although the notion of green management, green jobs, and the green economy have been increasingly popular in today's situations, most of these notions have still been considered in terms of ‘discourse’ more than ‘serious action’. (Interview#8)

Additionally, the government has not allocated a sufficient budget for the creation of green jobs and the implementation of green management within firms. In this regard, the issues of green management, green jobs and green economy have not been as widely mentioned in Thailand as they should be (Interview#8; Interview#9).
Moreover, due to the fact that educational programs related to the environment and green management depend heavily on students who have special interest in the areas of the environment and green management while classes are still taught primarily based on technical knowledge, schools or programs that are not directly related to the environment and green management may not be able to incorporate content on those issues into their programs. One important finding is that universities in Thailand are not likely to respond to the needs of labor markets and industries in that they are not likely to produce a sufficient number of employees/workers who are industry-ready to perform green jobs. The rationale behind this finding is that curricula related to environmental/green management offered by several universities in Thailand are not likely to directly respond to the needs of industries. That said, to perform jobs in several areas of environmental/green management, including wastewater treatment, employees/workers must possess knowledge and skills that are tailored to fit with the contexts of each firm (firm-specific knowledge and skills). In other words, these firms must invest their own budgets in producing and/or training employees/workers to obtain knowledge and skills in green management and environmental conservation. However, the above-described problems may not result solely from the national education and skill-formation system. It may be possible that firms in Thailand (especially small- and medium-sized firms) are not likely to have the necessary readiness in every respect, including budgets, personnel, policies and management support, to seriously and systematically implement environmental/green management policies and practices. In this regard, most universities in Thailand may not have a clear direction regarding environmental and green management programs that fit well with the current demand of the labor markets and firms (Interview#8; Interview#9).
The empirical findings regarding the Thai education and skill-formation system at the university level can be summarized into several issues as follows.
Bachelor's degree programs
Most bachelor's degree programs in the areas of environmental and green management tend to primarily focus on theoretical knowledge, a variety of techniques and sophisticated calculation. However, these programs are not likely to pay attention to the promotion of students' environmental awareness and the development and practice of employability skill and environmental management skill to foster students' abilities to work in real employment situations, although there are a number of graduates from these programs each year. For instance, the bachelor's degree program of the Faculty of Environment and Resource Studies at Mahidol University accepts approximately 110 students each year. However, the number of graduates may be lower than this number for several reasons, including poor academic performance and withdrawal before graduation to pursue study at other universities. One important fact is that not every graduate from that program ultimately finds employment in the areas of green management/environmental conservation. Based on this fact, the number of graduates in these areas who are industry-ready may not be sufficient to respond to the needs of markets and firms. Therefore, these firms have had to invest their budget in training new employees for some time (6 months to one year) before they can begin to function effectively in real working contexts. Most of the graduates in these areas work in environmental impact assessment (EIA) and social impact assessment (SIA) consulting companies, in NGOs such as TEI or in other relevant public agencies. Scholars have expressed expectations that the labor market for this group of graduates will be more open in the future when new environmental laws and regulations are enforced (Interview#8; Interview#9; Interview#10; Interview#11). According to an interview, Graduates from our faculty are competent and are of good quality. They have strong theoretical knowledge. Most employers really appreciate the quality of our students. However, these graduates may lack practical skills because we do not have a sufficient budget to foster them in obtaining those skills. (Interview#8)

Master's degree programs
Master's degree programs in environmental and green management focus on both technical knowledge and environmental management skills so that graduates will have opportunities for promotion to top management in the future. For instance, in the case of the Graduate School of Environmental Development Administration at National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA), its educational program aims to train graduates to be eligible for promotion to top management positions responsible for overseeing environmental/green management of their firms in the future. Additionally, this educational program focuses on the production of employees/workers who are industry-ready to perform green jobs. In this regard, the emphasis of the program offered by the Graduate School of Environmental Development Administration at NIDA is not based on technical knowledge but on practical skills and environmental/green management skills, although the students do not have any background in environmental science and management. In other words, this program can help graduates function in real working contexts (Interview#8; Interview#9; Interview#10; Interview#11; Interviews#12-15; Interview#16).
However, the number of graduates from master's degree programs in environmental/green management from universities in Thailand has been quite small, and it is likely to decline in the future due to Thailand's aging population and its movement toward becoming an aged society. [By the year 2035, Thailand will be the first emerging market economy to become a superaged society (Bank of Thailand, 2018). A superaged society here refers to a country in which the number of aging people who are more than 60 years of age accounts for approximately 30% of the total population or in which the number of aging people who are more than 65 years of age accounts for more than 20% of the total population (World Health Organization, 2002).] In this regard, the number of students who attend universities and who enter the labor market will decline continuously (Interview#8; Interview#9; Interview#10; Interview#11; Interviews#12-15; Interview#16; Interviews#17-18).
Aging society and Thai universities
Thailand is now an aging society, and it will soon become an aged society. The nation's declining birth rate has led to lower numbers of students entering universities. Many second-tier and third-tier universities in Thailand have therefore attempted to adapt themselves to the changing environment by offering bachelor's degree and master's degree programs that aim to produce graduates who are industry-ready to perform green jobs. In this regard, firms do not need to invest a huge part of their budgets in training these graduates. Therefore, the educational programs in this group of universities focus on employability skills and case study analysis. Additionally, this group of universities has, to a greater extent, paid attention to offering educational programs in environmental/green management for sustainability because top managers of these universities believe that the domains of environmental/green management will become increasingly important in the future (Interview#11; Interviews#1-2).
Firm-level practices regarding green jobs
In Thailand, firms typically invest their budgets in training employees/workers to perform green jobs for several reasons. First, the number of graduates who have graduated with degrees in environmental/green management and who are industry-ready to perform green jobs is not sufficient to respond to the demand of the labor market. Second, the top managers of some firms, especially small- and medium-sized firms, still believe that their firms do not need to hire persons who are specialized in environmental/green management to perform green jobs. Additionally, Thailand has had no clear rules, regulations or incentives to force firms to hire environmental/green management specialists to perform those jobs (Interviews#19-22; Interviews#23-27; Interviews#28-30; Interviews#31-32; Interviews#33-38). The empirical findings regarding firm-level requirements regarding green jobs and how green knowledge and skills have been developed among employees within the four case study firms across industries are presented below.
SSS Ceramics Public Company Limited
SSS Ceramics Public Company Limited manufactures, sells and distributes ceramic tiles under the brands of COTTO, CAMPANA and SOSUCO. It has been considered the flagship company that operates businesses related to ceramic tiles in Thailand, and the company has also exported its ceramic tiles to other countries (SSS Ceramics Public Company Limited, 2018).
SSS Ceramics Public Company Limited has paid special attention to green management and environmental conservation. In this regard, it has maximized the utilization of energy and natural resources and managed and conserved the energy in the manufacturing factory via waste heat recovery from kiln to dryer and via the reduction of air leakage based on employee participation. Additionally, the company has initiated a high-efficiency burner activity; installed an air booster system, a photovoltaic (PV) solar rooftop and new spray dryers; and now uses light emitting diode (LED) tube light. Moreover, it has reduced the factory's emissions of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and dust into the atmosphere, treated its wastewater well and focused on zero waste management. In other words, the company works to ensure there are no emissions of any type of waste into the public sphere (Interviews#23-27; Observation).
SSS Ceramics Public Company Limited has primarily used various machines and automation technologies to facilitate the performance of green jobs. For instance, it has used machines and automation technologies to collect the data regarding the utilization of electricity for the purpose of environmental conservation. The company has not emphasized the use of employees/workers to perform these jobs. The reason behind this issue is that the use of various machines and automation technologies helps improve the reliability of the company's manufacturing process, generate efficiency in business operations and reduce waste or various problems that may affect the environment (Interviews#23-27; Observation). According to an interview, I believe that this idea is also in compliance with Thailand's aging society, which has caused a lower number of graduates to enter the Thai labor market. The use of machines and automation technologies to replace labor has led to a hiring freeze at my company. (Interview#23)

However, in the case of some environmental/green management jobs that cannot be performed by machines and automation technologies such as quality assurance, audit and control of the quality of new products made from waste, SSS Ceramics Public Company Limited has trained its existing engineers and foremen to obtain new knowledge and skills in performing environmental/green management jobs through on-the-job training and classroom training. The company has not recruited new employees who have graduated with degrees in environmental/green management directly from the labor market. The main reason why SSS Ceramics Public Company Limited has paid special attention to environmental/green management jobs is that the company wants its products to be widely accepted as environmentally friendly by consumers in Thailand and in other countries. Therefore, the company has attempted to have its products certified by several well-known agencies including TEI (a product carbon footprint) (Interviews#23-27; Observation).
PPP Public Company Limited
PPP Public Company Limited is considered to be the national energy services company in Thailand. It operates its energy and petroleum businesses from upstream to downstream. including natural gas, international trade, technologies and engineering services. Other related businesses include the exploration and production of petroleum, infrastructure, coal, petrochemical engineering and distillation, oil and retail services (PPP Public Company Limited, 2018).
The primary focus of PPP Public Company Limited is to successfully implement zero waste management and zero emission policies by 2050 (Interviews#28-30). One of the important issues at PPP Public Company Limited is the idea of “24 go green.” Based on this idea, the company has attempted to change its employees' attitudes toward green behaviors. Thus, employees must pay special attention to climate change and environmental conservation. The company continually searches for green idols to motivate employees to care about environmental issues (Interviews#28-30; Observation). According to an interview, Our company has implemented blockchain technologies to separate recycled waste so that our employees can review the company's blockchain system to learn their score with regard to using recycled waste such as glass. (Interview#28)

Employees also realize their role in reducing CFC and can monitor the progress of transforming recycled waste into new products from the system. Additionally, PPP Public Company Limited has continuously developed and implemented green management policies, and the company has become the leader in green technology in Thailand. Moreover, the company has successfully integrated environmental issues with digital issues (such as the idea of blockchain technologies mentioned above). Furthermore, PPP Public Company Limited has launched more than 200 green products/services, including bio cups, to customers. The company's products are environmentally friendly and are certified with the “green for life label.” PPP Public Company Limited has also implemented environmental accounting policies and practices for some time (Interviews#28-30; Observation).
PPP Public Company Limited has invested a huge budget into training and developing green knowledge and skills among its employees. It has developed a PPP environmental training course for newly recruited employees. Thus, all newly recruited employees across departments must attend the company's security, safety, health and environment (SSHE) training course. This training course aims to generate environmental awareness among attendees and focuses on the company's environmental management policies and practices as well as safety procedures. It also focuses on environmental and climate change across countries throughout the globe. All the company's employees must regularly attend SSHE training brush-up courses. PPP Public Company Limited has realized that graduates with degrees in environmental/green management may not be prepared to perform green jobs in a real context. Thus, PPP Public Company Limited has continuously trained its employees so they will possess green knowledge and skills, and it also offers its employees mentoring, job shadowing and coaching programs. In other words, PPP Public Company Limited equips its employees with both green management theory and practice for at least 6 months to 1 year so its employees can perform green jobs immediately after training. At PPP Public Company Limited, persons who can successfully perform green jobs must have technical knowledge and must have various types of skills to perform those jobs, including digitalization, communication, teamwork and problem-solving skills (Interviews#28-30; Observation).
Chaophya Park Hotel
Chaophya Park Hotel is located on Ratchadapisek Road, Din Daeng sub-district, Din Daeng district, Bangkok. This hotel began its operations on October 15, 1992. Currently, it has approximately 401 employees and 402 guest rooms in total (i.e. 231 premier rooms, 132 business deluxe rooms, 19 executive rooms, 19 executive suite rooms and 1 Chaophya suite) (data obtained from a field visit on June 19, 2019).
Chaophya Park Hotel has received several awards related to environmental/green management, including the ASEAN Green Hotel Award (data obtained from a field visit on June 19, 2019). The hotel has developed and implemented environmentally friendly service policies and practices, appointed a green team, held meetings with all levels of managers to monitor the progress of green energy projects every second Tuesday of the month and publicized knowledge regarding environmentally friendly services to employees via various media, including posters, leaflets, newsletters, broadcasting, email and exhibitions. Chaophya Park Hotel has a huge monitor located in the lobby area so that everyone can monitor the hotel's real-time usage of electricity. Additionally, the hotel has attempted to treat wastewater and use that treated water for plantation and for washing dirty areas. Moreover, the hotel has attempted to produce biodiesel from used oil, and it has used that biodiesel for small trucks or vehicles used in the hotel. Furthermore, Chaophya Park Hotel produces its own energy to replace the use of external sources of electricity, such as through the installation of solar cells and the production of biogas from waste and wastewater (Interviews#31-32; Observation).
Overall, Chaophya Park Hotel has paid special attention to the environmental/green management for sustainability, as recognized in its environmentally friendly services, green procurement and energy-saving practices. The success of the hotel in performing green management practices is the result of the initiative and support of its top managers, including the hotel's managing director. Additionally, one of the key success factors of Chaophya Park Hotel is its employees/workers. The hotel has not hired specialists/experts in environmental/green management to perform green jobs. Rather, it has gradually trained its existing employees to generate environmental awareness and develop green knowledge and skills. Specifically, the hotel has regularly trained its employees regarding environmentally friendly services. In many cases, its green team has visited several organizations to learn about environmental conservation, energy savings and green management practices. The hotel's top managers have also acted as role models for their employees. For instance, the managing director of the hotel has engaged in behaviors regarding water and electricity saving. She attended a class regarding how to make environmentally friendly dish detergent (so-called green plus). Then, she tried to use it in advance of obtaining certification for the dish detergent from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of Thailand. Afterward, she taught her employees/workers how to make this dish detergent. Additionally, she attended a class regarding how to make green soap and followed the same steps as in the case of green plus. Moreover, on-the-job training has played a crucial role in helping the hotel's employees perform green jobs. That said, Chaophya Park Hotel has encouraged its experienced or senior employees to teach inexperienced or newly recruited employees. For instance, experienced or senior employees teach inexperienced or newly recruited employees to classify various types of waste. This classified waste will ultimately be sold to outsiders, and the income from sales will be returned to the hotel's employees. In some cases, experienced employees teach inexperienced employees to make environmentally friendly soap/shampoo to be used in the hotel. Additionally, experienced employees teach newly recruited employees how to make effective microorganism (EM) liquid and how to make coasters from used napkins. Overall, several activities are performed to create green awareness among employees so that the employees will pay attention to green management endogenously (Interviews#31-32; Observation).
The managing director of Chaophya Park Hotel emphasized the significance of acting as the role model for employees, on-the-job training, study visits to other organizations/firms, generating green awareness among employees and developing green skills among employees. According to an interview with the managing director, Educational programs in environmental/green management offered by universities may equip graduates with knowledge. However, these programs cannot help graduates be industry-ready, possess green skills, and have inner motivation to find green jobs. Thus, on-the-job training and serving as the role model for employees are very important here. (Interviews#31)

In summary, the most important factor that has led Chaophya Park Hotel toward success in developing green jobs is its cultivation of its employees' realization of the importance of non-monetary rewards, that is, the sustainable growth of the country and society.
Thanya Park
Thanya Park was established on November 1, 2012, on the initiative of Mrs. Sununtha Somboondhamma, executive chairman of Thaniya Group. It has been considered to be the first eco-friendly shopping mall in Thailand (Interviews#33-38; Observation). Thanya Park has received several awards related to environmental/green management including the 2016 Thailand Energy Award, the Second Runner-Up 2016 ASEAN Energy Award (energy conservation), the Green Building Award and Green Office Award (data obtained from a field visit on May 23, 2019). The top managers of Thanya Park have realized that, in terms of shopping malls/centers, the service industry typically consumes large amounts of energy and natural resources. Therefore, they proposed that the design and construction of Thanya Park should be environmentally friendly, have the least impact on its surrounding environments and facilitate energy savings (Interviews#33-38; Observation). According to an interviewee, The primary philosophy of Thanya Park is environmental conservation. We are willing to invest huge budgets in the design and construction of the shopping mall in order to conserve the environment and to make a beautiful world for the next generation. (Interviews#33)

In addition to top management support, one of the key success factors regarding the success of Thanya Park's environmental/green management is its employees. Thanya Park has not hired employees/workers who are environmental/green management experts to perform green jobs. However, it has trained its line managers and employees to recognize the importance of environmental conservation. It has gradually developed its employees to possess green knowledge and skills by emphasizing that all Thanya Park's employees must have so-called green DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). In this regard, it has focused on on-the-job training so that its employees have gradually generated environmental/green awareness. Moreover, coaching and mentoring systems are considered one of the crucial tools for Thanya Park to create environmental/green awareness among newly recruited or inexperienced employees (Interviews#33-38; Observation).
In fact, Thanya Park's line managers and employees who are responsible for performing green jobs are persons who have already had their own duties and responsibilities (i.e. marketing and customer service). Thus, when this group of line managers and employees is assigned by top managers to perform environmental/green management jobs, they must develop their own environmental awareness and give special attention to green jobs. In addition to top management support and top managers as role models, on-the job training and other management tools play an important role in developing environmental awareness and green skills among managers and employees. In turn, line managers and employees also serve as role models for other groups of employees, newly recruited employees and even lessees (i.e. persons who rent Thanya Park's property) (Interviews#33-38; Observation). According to an interview with an HR manager, Educational programs at the university level may equip students with theories and knowledge. However, environmental/green awareness, green consciousness, and environmental/green skills may not be integrated into those programs. Therefore, typically, it is firms' duties and responsibilities to cultivate such awareness and consciousness and to develop green skills among their employees. (Interview#34)

In summary, according to the empirical findings, firms across industries must be responsible for helping their employees/workers obtain the green skills necessary to perform green jobs by focusing on various HR practices, including classroom training, on-the-job training, coaching and mentoring systems, and managers as role models in response to the fact that the Thai education and skill-formation system, especially at the levels of vocational colleges and universities, is unlikely to produce a sufficient number of employees/workers who have green knowledge, skills and abilities and are industry-ready to perform green jobs in firms, leading to a shortage of employees/workers who possess green skills in the labor market (see Table 4 for the HR practices used by the four case study firms).
Discussion
Based on the empirical findings at the level of the Thai education and skill-formation system and at the level of firms, this study found support for the following arguments regarding the creation of green jobs and the development of green skills in firms across industries in response to the Thai institutional context. First, firms create green jobs and develop green skills among employees through several HR practices to respond to the institutional context in terms of the deficiencies in the Thai education and skill-formation system. The Thai education and skill-formation system is not likely to produce sufficient numbers of employees/workers with green skill sets for firms. The curriculum tends to primarily focus on technical skills; however, those skills are not likely to be aligned with the needs of industries and firms. Additionally, curricula are not likely to reflect the real working environment of industries and firms. In particular, at the level of vocational colleges, educational programs in terms of environmental/green management have not been integrated into curricula of study. By contrast, at the level of universities, programs of study in terms of environmental/green management have already been offered to students. However, curricula related to environmental/green management policies and practices offered by several universities are likely to focus primarily on theory and knowledge so they cannot directly respond to the needs of industries and firms. Actually, to perform jobs in several areas of environmental/green management, including wastewater treatment, employees/workers must possess both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Therefore, firms must invest their own budget in producing and/or training employees/workers so these employees/workers will possess the appropriate knowledge and skills in environmental/green management. Nevertheless, the above-noted problems may not solely result from deficiencies in the Thai education and skill-formation system. Most small- and medium-sized firms in Thailand may not have the necessary readiness especially, in terms of budgets, personnel and management support, to systematically implement environmental/green management policies and practices. However, in the future, it is expected that Thai environmental/green regulations and laws will become more apparent and will be more seriously enforced to facilitate the movement toward a BCG economy. At that time, every type of organizations in Thailand will have to hire environmental/green management specialists and/or employees/workers who possess knowledge and skills in environmental/green management to perform green jobs. Therefore, the demand for this group of employees/workers from the labor market will be higher in the future. In other words, changes in relevant regulations and laws in the future will tend to lead to an upskilling of environmental/green job requirements in Thailand. Here, upskilling means that employees/workers must learn new skills that extend the present duties and responsibilities of their jobs. In this case, the group of employees will require higher levels of training (Kearsley, 1989; MacDuffie and Kochan, 1995; Osterman, 1995). This upskilling of environmental/green jobs will ultimately exacerbate the skill shortage problem in the Thai labor market.
Second, to alleviate the problem resulting from the deficiencies in the Thai education and skill-formation system, firms tend to internally develop their own environmental/green management specialists over time through internal labor market systems. According to Doeringer and Piore, an “internal labor market” is “an administrative unit, including a manufacturing plant, a hotel, or a shopping mall, within which the pricing and allocation of labor is governed by a set of administrative rules and procedures” (1971, p. 2). The main argument here is that the pricing and allocation of the labor market occur within a firm, a plant, a hotel or a shopping mall (Osterman, 1984; Bidwell and Keller, 2014; Keller, 2018). In this respect, firms apply several training methods, including classroom training, on-the-job training, coaching, mentoring systems and job shadowing; top managers act as role models for younger generations of employees, to internally train and develop line managers and employees/workers to obtain the necessary environmental/green knowledge and skills to perform green jobs. In other words, to develop green skills among employees, firms tend to apply “high-road” or “high-commitment” HR practices to improve the functional flexibility within firms (Erickson et al ., 2003). Functional flexibility here refers to actions that foster stability within the workplace including investments in training and skill development, the promotion of multiskilling and job rotation. In this regard, the case study firms internally train and develop their existing employees to be multiskilled. For instance, at Thanya Park, the firm's line managers and employees are internally developed to possess green knowledge and skills so that managers and employees can alternate between their line functions and green management functions. In the case of Chaophya Park Hotel, the hotel has gradually trained its existing employees to generate environmental awareness and develop green skills. Notably, the movement of firms toward greater functional flexibility plays a crucial role in helping firms develop green skills among employees to successfully perform green jobs.
Third, the skill shortage problem in the labor market may not be unique to the case of the development of green skills among employees across firms in Thailand. In fact, this problem typically arises when a new economy/industry develops or when there is a change in a development strategy (e.g. the movement toward a BCG economy in the case of Thailand).
Here, to minimize the skill shortage problem in the labor market and to optimize long-term green skill development upon transition to the new BCG economy, Thailand needs to adopt a concerted national effort that involves multiple actors, encompassing multiple institutions, at national, university and firm levels (Finegold and Soskice, 1988; Singh and Zammit, 2000; Kuruvilla and Ranganathan, 2008). Solving both macro (i.e. national level) and micro (i.e. firm level) HR problems regarding the development of green skills among employees across firms — problems that tend to require different policy interventions by multiple actors — implies a well-integrated effort. In particular, the Thai government can play a crucial role in increasing the supply of a skilled labor force with green skills necessary to perform green jobs through a number of approaches. For instance, the government should incorporate green/environmental management issues into national education policy. Specifically, national education policy should require vocational colleges to incorporate content/courses related to environmental/green management into their educational programs. Additionally, the government should support the development of various skills, especially green skills, among vocational college students so that they will be industry-ready to function in a real working context. In fact, these educational programs should encourage vocational college students who tend to have creativity and innovation skills to learn how to develop environmentally friendly products and processes by aiming to reduce emissions and the consumption of water, electricity and other raw materials (so-called green innovation). Moreover, the government should foster cooperation between vocational colleges or universities and firms in designing environmental/green management educational programs that respond to the needs of firms to prevent the skill shortage problem and skill mismatches in the Thai labor market. Furthermore, the government should offer a variety of incentives, including tax reductions or tax exemptions, for firms, especially SMEs that pay special attention to environmental conservation/green management. One of the most important notions here is that the government should take serious actions regarding the creation of a BCG economy and the implementation of environmental/green management policies and practices across firms; otherwise, the issue regarding the creation of a BCG economy and the implementation of environmental/green management policies and practices is considered to be only “discourse.”
Similarly, universities should redesign environmental/green management educational programs at the undergraduate level to enable those programs to focus simultaneously on both theories and employability skills. Additionally, those programs should be taught based on real case studies in terms of environmental/green management. In this way, graduates will be industry-ready to perform green jobs. Universities should also cooperate/partner with both public and private firms in designing educational programs/curricula related to environmental/green management to be able to produce graduates whose qualifications respond to customers' needs (i.e. firms). Moreover, universities must welcome questions/problems related to environmental/green management from industries to help firms across industries solve these problems. This action will help firms realize the importance of universities, and both undergraduate and graduate students will have an opportunity to solve real environmental/green problems experienced by industries. These students will ultimately understand real working contexts and be industry-ready to perform green jobs.
Universities in Thailand should also cooperate with world-class universities in other countries to design environmental/green management educational programs that fit the national context of Thailand and support the movement of Thailand toward a green economy. These universities in Thailand should sign a memorandum of understanding with leading research institutes and world-class digital technology companies such that these institutes and/or companies admit high-potential university students from Thailand to work as trainees/entry-level employees for a certain duration (1 year or 2 years). This action can facilitate knowledge transfer from these institutes and/or companies to Thai students who will finally return to work in Thailand.
Furthermore, NGOs, including the Thailand Environmental Institute, should cooperate/partner with vocational colleges, universities and the Ministry of Education to design educational programs/curricula related to environmental/green management. The special expertise of NGOs' officers in the areas of environmental management/conservation should help these vocational colleges and universities produce graduates who have environmental/green management knowledge and skills to directly respond to firms' needs. NGOs should also encourage both public and private firms to pay special attention to green/environmental management and the development of green skills among their existing employees by providing discounts or incentives to such firms that allow them to assign their existing employees to attend NGOs' training programs/courses related to environmental/green management. NGOs can also offer certificates or labels for those firms' green/environmentally friendly products to foster a green image among them. Of course, to obtain green certificates or labels and carbon footprints from NGOs, firms need to intentionally develop green skills among their existing employees and future employees to enable them to have green awareness and serve as an important mechanism to help firms obtain these certificates or labels.
In addition to partnerships with universities in designing educational programs/curricula related to environmental/green management, both public and private firms should pay special attention to the implementation of high-road HR practices or high commitment HR practices to develop green skills among their existing employees, enabling these employees to successfully perform green jobs. In fact, these firms should consider adopting so-called green human resource management (GHRM) practices. GHRM practices are a set of HR practices that enable and sustain environmental/green management within firms (Renwick et al ., 2013; Renwick, 2018). These HR practices consist of green recruitment and selection, green training and development, green performance management, green pay and rewards and green employee relations. In fact, these practices aim to upgrade both the environmental and social performance of firms. They are considered an important tool for incorporating the organizational policies of environmental and social sustainability into HR practices. Specifically, GHRM practices focus on the development of employees' green knowledge, skills and abilities; employees' motivation to demonstrate green behaviors at work; and the maintenance of a green organizational culture and values. In this regard, if both public and private firms adopt and implement these GHRM practices, these practices should play a crucial role in alleviating the problem of green skill shortages in the labor market, promoting environmental sustainability and social inclusion, reducing pressure from various external stakeholders, including NGOs and communities, and fostering the transition of the country toward a greener economy.
Additionally, both public and private firms should cultivate green awareness among their employees and encourage their employees to express sufficiency-based consumption behaviors and environmentally friendly behaviors. These firms should implement the zero waste management system. They should also encourage their employees to reduce energy consumption, including electricity and water, to conserve these types of energy for younger generations in society. In fact, top managers of these public and private firms should serve as role models for their employees by conducting sufficiency-based consumption behaviors and environmentally friendly behaviors, and by reducing energy consumption for sustainable business operations over the long term.
Finally, the argument that firms are responsible for developing green knowledge and skills among employees through high-road HR practices in response to the institutional context in terms of the education and skill-formation system is in accordance with the literature on SHRM and comparative institutional perspective on HR strategies and practices as proposed by Batt and Banerjee (2012) and Batt and Hermans (2012). In particular, within these two streams of literature, Batt and her colleagues noted that, based on the empirical findings from a global call center project, national contexts/institutions influence the HR strategies and practices adopted by call centers across countries (Batt et al ., 2009). Nevertheless, Batt and Banerjee (2012) and Batt and Hermans (2012) proposed that most of the empirical research on SHRM and the comparative institutional perspective on HR strategies and practices have been conducted in firms located in developed countries, especially in the US and the UK Conversely, the literatures tend to ignore how the institutional contexts in emerging market economies or developing countries, including Thailand, affect the adoption and implementation of HR strategies and practices in firms in those economies/countries (Napathorn, 2018a). Thus, the empirical findings in this study are likely to enrich the theoretical and practical discussion on this topic. Therefore, the creation of green jobs and the development among employees in firms located in emerging market economies or developing countries in response to institutional contexts, especially the deficiencies in the national education and skill-formation system, should not be ignored.
To minimize industry bias, the author attempted to conduct this study across industries including the manufacturing industry, the energy industry, the hotel and resort industry and the retail industry. Therefore, the author can, at least, propose that the institutional context in terms of the national education and skill-formation system plays some role in shaping the creation of green jobs and the development of green skills among employees across firms in Thailand.
Last but not least, this paper proposes that firms across industries in Thailand are responsible for helping their employees/workers obtain the green knowledge and skills necessary to perform green jobs through high-road HR practices in response to the fact that the Thai education and skill-formation system is not likely to produce a sufficient number of employees/workers who have green knowledge, skills and abilities and who are industry-ready to perform green jobs, leading to a shortage of employees/workers who possess green skills in the labor market. Specifically, curricula in vocational colleges and universities in Thailand are not likely to respond to the needs of firms in producing those employees/workers.
Conclusions
This paper contributes to the strategic HRM, comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices and green economy literature in the following ways. First, this paper is expected to fill the gap in the literature on strategic HRM and comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices as proposed by Batt and Banerjee (2012) and Batt and Hermans (2012), who suggested that the literature on strategic HRM should examine how institutional contexts shape the adoption and implementation of firms' HR practices. Second, this paper expects to extend the green economy literature on how firms develop green skills in response to institutional factors, specifically the national education and skill-formation system. Finally, the empirical findings of this paper are expected to extend the literature on strategic HRM, comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices and the green economy regarding how the institutional context, in one of the under-researched countries −Thailand − shapes the development of green skills among firms in that country.
This paper also provides practical implications for top managers and/or HR managers of firms in Thailand, other developing countries and other emerging market economies with deficiencies in the national education and skill-formation system. First, the top managers and/or HR managers can apply various methods to internally develop managers and employees/workers with the appropriate environmental/green knowledge and necessary skills to perform green jobs. The methods include classroom training, on-the-job training, coaching, mentoring systems, job shadowing and being role models for younger generations of employees. Second, these top managers and/or HR managers can cooperate with vocational colleges and/or universities in their countries to design educational programs/curricula related to environmental/green management to be able to produce graduates with suitable qualifications for their firms. These managers can request for assistance from universities in their countries when their firms confront sophisticated questions/problems related to environmental/green management. In this regard, universities will have an opportunity to solve real environmental/green problems experienced by industries, while firms can appropriately and accurately solve environmental/green questions/problems. Third, these top managers and/or HR managers can encourage their firms to apply for certificates of green/environmentally friendly products or carbon footprint labels from NGOs to foster a green image among firms' consumers. These applications require the firms to pay special attention to the cultivation of green awareness and the development of green skills among their employees. Fourth, these top managers and/or HR managers can encourage their employees to express green/environmentally friendly behaviors as well as sufficiency-based consumption behaviors. In fact, these top managers and/or HR managers can foster their employees to reduce energy consumption, including electricity and water, to conserve these types of energy for young generations. Fifth, these top managers and/or HR managers can adopt and implement GHRM practices consisting of green recruitment and selection, green training and development, green performance management, green pay and rewards and green employee relations in their firms to upgrade both the environmental and social performance of firms. Finally, these top managers and/or HR managers must take serious actions regarding the implementation of environmental/green management policies and practices within their firms in order to facilitate the movement of the country toward the BCG economy.
This paper provides social/policy implications for the government, vocational colleges and universities in Thailand, other developing countries and emerging market economies where the skill shortage problem is still severe. First, the government of each country should incorporate green/environmental policies into the national education policy and the long-term strategic plan of the country. Second, the government should continuously implement such national policy and strategic plan by encouraging government agencies, vocational colleges, universities, firms and NGOs to cooperate in developing and offering environmental/green management educational programs/curricula to produce graduates with suitable qualifications for those firms. Third, the government should encourage vocational colleges and universities to equip their students with green skills to be industry-ready in a real working context. Fourth, to alleviate the skill shortage problem in the labor market, the government should foster firms, especially private-sector firms, to focus on the upskilling and reskilling of their existing employees. With this action, their existing employees will have green skills, be able to effectively perform green jobs and become important drivers to help the country move toward the BCG economy. Fifth, the government of each country should encourage firms to develop green/environmentally friendly products by offering them various types of incentives, including tax reductions or tax exemptions. Sixth, the government should encourage universities in the country to sign a memorandum of understanding with leading research institutes and world-class digital technology companies such that these institutes and/or companies admit high-potential university students to work as trainees/entry-level employees for a certain duration. This action can ultimately facilitate knowledge transfer from these institutes and/or companies to those university students who will finally return to work in their home country. Seventh, the government, especially the Ministry of Education, should encourage vocational colleges and universities to teach students in the environmental/green management program based on real case studies/problems found across firms. In this way, graduates should be industry-ready to perform green jobs. Finally, the government must pay serious attention to the implementation of environmental/green management policies across levels within the country so that the transition of the country toward the BCG economy will finally come true in the future.
The limitations of this research concern its methodology. This research is based on the qualitative studies of the Thai education and skill-formation system and a case study of firms across industries in Thailand. Thus, this paper does not aim to generalize the findings to all other countries but to enrich the discussion on the effects of macro-level HR policies on the creation of green jobs and the development of green skills across firms in each country. Additionally, it is difficult to gain access to firms across several industries and various stakeholders to understand the development of green skills among employees in these firms. The reasons are resource constraints, time constraints and the hesitation of firms in permitting the author to access the data. These difficulties restricted the sources of information to construct a more nuanced picture of firms across various industries in developing green skills among their existing employees. Consequently, this research does not include firms in several other industries, including the pulp and paper industry, textile and garment industry, plastic industry and agri-food industry. Thus, future research may extend the topic of the development of green skills among employees to these industries. Quantitative studies using large samples of firms across industries may also be useful in deepening the understanding of this topic, which is significant from the perspectives of the strategic HRM, comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices and green economy.

Abstract: Purpose > As older adults are increasingly active in virtual communities (VCs), these platforms for knowledge exchange present opportunities for companies to use elder human capital. The purpose of this study is to understand the antecedent factors that motivate older adults’ knowledge contribution and knowledge seeking (KS) behaviors in VCs. Design/methodology/approach > Rooted in socio-emotional selectivity and social cognitive theories, this study included five key variables and developed models for older adults’ knowledge contributing (KC)/KS behaviors. This paper tested the hypotheses using data from a sample of 204 older adults in 3 VCs in China. Findings > The results provide support for most of the hypotheses and show that while other members’ participation (MP) acts as a substitute for meaning in life and attitude toward aging, it acts as a complement for outcome expectations (OE) focused on others and OE focused on oneself in their impacts on KC/KS activities. Practical implications > The study provides practical insights for developing elder human resources via VCs to avoid knowledge loss. Originality/value > This study described older adults’ unique characteristics when modeling their information and communication technologies-related behaviors and built two models to explain their KC/KS behaviors. It confirmed that the same factor has different levels of impact on older adults’ KC/KS behaviors in VCs. In addition, it confirmed and reinforced the complementary and substitutive effects of other MP as an environmental factor on these behaviors.

Full text: 1. Introduction
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have significantly changed various aspects of society and turned knowledge into one of the most crucial resources for individuals and organizations (Bailey and Clarke, 2001; Del Giudice and Della Peruta, 2016; Wang et al. , 2020; Del Giudice and Maggioni, 2014; Cillo et al. , 2019). During the past two decades, industrial practitioners and scholars have paid much attention to knowledge management practices and research and obtained very useful insights into the use of knowledge (Glyptis et al. , 2020; Alavi and Leidner, 2001; Chiu et al. , 2006; Singh, 2019; Al Ahbabi et al. , 2019; Singh et al. , 2019). As society and technologies continue to evolve, organizations have recently faced two new trends. On the one hand, they have to devise strategies to avoid the “brain drain” and the loss of valuable knowledge due to the retirement of the baby boomer generation (Noguchi, 2015; Wang et al. , 2017; Slagter, 2007; SHRM, 2014; Joe et al. , 2013). On the other hand, the rise of virtual communities (VCs), online spaces where people share “their experiences and knowledge in free-flowing, creative ways that foster new approaches to problems” (Wenger and Snyder, 2000, p. 140), has attracted numerous users, including older adults, to contribute/seek knowledge and turned these communities into valuable external knowledge repositories (Wang et al. , 2020; Rice et al. , 2019; Pan et al. , 2015; Di Gangi and Wasko, 2009). Older adults’ knowledge contributing (KC) and knowledge seeking (KS) activities in VCs have thus, become a way for organizations to use elderly human resources, and, therefore, a topic of note in knowledge management.
Scholars have begun to explore older adults’ participation in VCs and social media (Nimrod, 2010; Choi et al. , 2014; Zhou, 2019; Su and Tong, 2021). They have analyzed the outcomes of older adults’ VC usage in terms of empowerment and well-being (Heo et al. , 2015; Niehaves and Plattfaut, 2014; Srivastava and Panigrahi, 2019), as well as the improvement in their quality of life through social and knowledge exchanges (Choi et al. , 2014; Zhou, 2018). However, compared with the volume of the studies on young people’s or employees’ knowledge management activities in VCs (Scuotto et al. , 2017; Susanty et al. , 2019; Alavi and Leidner, 2001; Al Ahbabi et al. , 2019), only a few studies have explored older adults’ online knowledge or information sharing behaviors (Xiong and Zuo, 2019; Zhou, 2018; Yang, 2019). In addition, there is a paucity of research about the antecedent factors that motivate older adults’ use of VCs as platforms for knowledge exchange. It is necessary to address these limitations and thereby expand our knowledge of older adults’ KC/KS behaviors.
Understanding older adults’ KC/KS behaviors in VCs is important because of the increasing longevity of populations (Gonzales et al. , 2015; Kankanhalli et al. , 2016; Pruchno, 2019). First, addressing this topic has the potential to promote older adults’ productive endeavors and help companies to use external knowledge or open wisdom in a crowdsourcing way, similar to Dell (Di Gangi and Wasko, 2009). Second, insights into the motivations specific to KC versus KS activities can also lead to a better understanding of how older adults use VCs and, in turn, help internet companies develop sustainable VCs for older adults (Bateman et al. , 2011; Butler et al. , 2002; Choi et al. , 2014). Finally, actively engaging older adults in knowledge networks enabled by VCs helps older adults enrich their retired life, and thereby builds a digitally inclusive society (Nimrod, 2013; Nimrod, 2011; Afsarmanesh et al. , 2012; Ramírez-Correa et al. , 2019). Therefore, this study aimed to address the abovementioned research gap, and accordingly, we asked the following question: Q1. How do factors germane to older adults influence their knowledge contribution and KS activities in VCs?

To address this question, we rooted the current study in socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) and social cognitive theory (SCT) and incorporated two key indicators of aging – meaning in life (MIL) and attitude toward aging (ATA) – as well as outcome expectations (OE) focused on both self (OE-self) and others (OE-others) and other members’ participation (MP) in the VC as antecedents in the models of KC and KS activities, respectively. We tested our hypotheses of the complementary and substitutive effects of MP on the direct effects of ATA, MIL, OE-self and OE-others in the KC and KS models, respectively, using data from a sample of 204 participants. We arrived at several insightful findings that contribute to the literature on knowledge management that is relevant for the practices of elder human resources development.
2. Theoretical background
2.1 Older adults’ knowledge contributing and knowledge seeking activities in virtual communities
Compared with traditional offline activities, VCs provide new approaches for people and organizations to conduct knowledge management activities (Wenger and Snyder, 2000; Alavi and Leidner, 2001; Bailey and Clarke, 2001). Knowledge in VCs is usually exchanged in the form of written postings, and includes experiences, insights, expertise and innovative business ideas in certain domains in professional communities (Hsu et al. , 2007; Wasko and Faraj, 2005; Di Gangi and Wasko, 2009), experiences of games, music, novels, comics or niche cultures among young people in leisure-oriented communities (Zhang, 2011) or life wisdom on managing family relationships, experience on retirement arrangement, maintaining health, religion, leisure travel and recommendations of books, films, shows or television programs in communities oriented toward older adults (Nimrod, 2010; Nimrod, 2011; Bennett, 2011; Choi et al. , 2014). Although the subjects of prior studies have mostly been younger people, the conclusions of these studies provide some insights for the present study. For example, the factors that influence KC/KS activities in VCs can be categorized into individual cognitive factors and environmental factors (Chiu et al. , 2006; Chen and Hung, 2010; Hsu et al. , 2007; Lin et al. , 2009; Zhou et al. , 2014). Among individual cognitive factors, OE is a salient factor that has been used to explain older adults’ internet use (Lam and Lee, 2006). As the sustainable development of VCs depends on community MP behaviors and the knowledge resources resulting from those behaviors (Chiu et al. , 2006; Koh et al. , 2007; Yan and Tan, 2014; Zhou et al. , 2014), environmental factors such as MP have also been incorporated in models to explain KC/KS behaviors in VCs.
Scholars have attempted to capture older adults’ characteristics and to explore the impacts of these characteristics on their ICT use (Ryu et al. , 2009; Wagner et al. , 2010; Yang, 2019; Quan-Haase et al. , 2016; Hong et al. , 2013; Ghasemaghaei et al. , 2019). The aging process causes a decline in older adults’ physical and cognitive capabilities, as a result of which they have more barriers and a steeper learning curve in using new technologies or web applications than younger people (Wagner et al. , 2010; Lam and Lee, 2006). Further, older adults are also less motivated by instrumental gains in their online activities in VCs (Nimrod, 2011; Morrow-Howell, 2010; Choi et al. , 2014). Finally, aging may affect many aspects of older adults’ life, and there has been ample evidence in the geriatrics literature that shows that perceptions about how much time they have left to live indeed change older adults’ behavioral patterns (Carstensen et al. , 2003; Fung et al. , 2001; Fung and Carstensen, 2004).
The above differences that older adults exhibit relative to younger adults in their ICT usage in general and their VC usage, in particular, should inform studies about older adults (Ryu et al. , 2009; Wagner et al. , 2010; Yang, 2019; Quan-Haase et al. , 2016; Choi et al. , 2014; Sun and Zhou, 2021). Accordingly, to capture both differences and similarities between older and younger adults in the context of KC/KS behaviors in VCs, we developed a model that is rooted in two theoretical foundations:
- SST, as it addresses unique motivations and behaviors of older adults.

- SCT, as it has been used in the past to study KC/KS behaviors in VCs in general.



We discuss SST next.
2.2 Socioemotional selectivity theory
SST is a life-span theory of motivation that describes how individuals make decisions about activities as an adaptive response to their perceived time left in life (Carstensen et al. , 2003; Fung et al. , 2001; Fung and Carstensen, 2004). SST has been widely used to explain older adults’ online behaviors such as social media use and the sharing of online health rumors (Yang, 2019; Chang et al. , 2015; Kim and Shen, 2020; Rui et al. , 2019). The key notion of time in SST refers to people’s perception of the remaining time rather than the actual time left, namely, given the same length of actual time remaining, people may have different perceptions of the remaining time and may accordingly end up behaving differently (Carstensen et al. , 2003; Fung et al. , 2001; Fung and Carstensen, 2004).
According to SST, when they perceive their remaining time as limited, older adults are more likely to pursue and invest their time and efforts in emotionally meaningful goals that can lead to gratification for them (e.g. sharing wisdom and life experience with others or voluntarily helping others, namely, KC activities); in such a situation, older adults’ KC emotionally meaningful behaviors are altruistic in nature (i.e. focused on others) (Carstensen et al. , 2003; Clary and Snyder, 1999; Fung et al. , 2001; Fung and Carstensen, 2004; Hendricks and Cutler, 2004; Wang et al. , 2017). We, thus, adopted the construct MIL, which refers to the “pursuit and attainment of worthwhile goals and an accompanying sense of fulfilment” (Krause, 2007), to capture older adults’ abovementioned reactions to the perception of a limited remaining time that drives them to conduct KC activities (Hicks et al. , 2012; Morrow-Howell, 2010).
Conversely, when their perception of the remaining time is open-ended and expansive, older adults will pursue those future-oriented goals that can expand their horizons and prepare them for educational and occupational achievements (e.g. seeking knowledge and learning new skills to enrich their later life and improve their productivity, namely, KS activities); in such a situation, older adults’ KS behaviors for future-oriented outcomes are egotistic in nature (i.e. focused on the self) (Carstensen et al. , 2003; Clary and Snyder, 1999; Fung et al. , 2001; Fung and Carstensen, 2004; Dávila and Díaz-Morales, 2009). Therefore, we adopted the construct ATA, which refers to remaining optimistic about the future and remaining active in learning new skills (Cody et al. , 1999), to capture older people’s abovementioned reactions to a perceived open-ended future that drives them to conduct KS activities (Vošner et al. , 2016; Wagner et al. , 2010; Xie, 2011).
2.3 Social cognitive theory
SCT is a widely accepted theory for explaining individuals’ behavior and postulates that human behavior is the result of triadic reciprocal determinism of three factors, namely, environment, person and behavior (Bandura, 1986). This notion postulates that environmental and individual cognitive factors not only have direct effects on an individual’s behavior but also jointly affect individual behaviors through their interaction effects (Bandura, 1986; Hmieleski and Baron, 2009). SCT has frequently been used to explain people’s knowledge exchanging behaviors in VCs (Chiu et al. , 2006; Zhou et al. , 2014; Hsu et al. , 2007) and also to explain older adults’ computer/internet use in information systems research (Lam and Lee, 2006; Wagner et al. , 2010). Accordingly, we used SCT as a theoretical foundation.
According to SCT, we included OE as an antecedent of KC and KS behaviors, as this variable captures an individual’s perceptions about the expected positive outcomes of their KC/KS behavior in VCs (Chiu et al. , 2006). Further, based on the tenets of SST discussed above, we partitioned OE into two types, namely, expected outcomes that are altruistic, that is, focused on others (OE-others), which is well-aligned with KC behaviors that also aim at helping others by sharing knowledge to improve the prospects of others, and expected outcomes that are egotistical, that is, focused on self (OE-self), which is well-aligned with KS behaviors of older adults for future gains (Fung et al. , 2001; Carstensen et al. , 2003; Fung and Carstensen, 2004). Furthermore, we included MP in the same VC as an environmental factor in our models. This construct captures the frequency of interactions among the members of a VC and constitutes the environment of a VC (Bennett, 2011; Koh et al. , 2007; Chiu et al. , 2006; Zhou et al. , 2014).
2.4 Hypotheses
Based on the above discussion, we built two distinct models but with the same set of antecedents for KC and KS activities (Figure 1).
2.4.1 Direct effects.
The notion that people’s behavior is driven by the outcome they expect from that behavior has been verified by prior studies on VCs (Chiu et al. , 2006; Hsu et al. , 2007; Panigrahi et al. , 2018; Paroutis and Al Saleh, 2009; Fait et al. , 2019). The above conclusion also applies to the context of older adults in VCs. As prior studies have shown, older adults’ expectations of fun, inherent joy and satisfaction they can achieve by helping others from their KC activities, that is, OE-others, motivate them to participate in VCs by way of their KC activities (Nimrod, 2010; Bennett, 2011; Nimrod, 2011; Su and Tong, 2021; Coelho and Duarte, 2016). KC/KS behaviors in VCs are usually intertwined with each other as asking a high-quality question (i.e. a KS activity) can activate other members’ discussion (i.e. KC activities) and a contribution of knowledge to the community knowledge repository (Choi et al. , 2014; Sedighi et al. , 2018; Chatterjee et al. , 2020). Thus, OE-others may be positively related to older adults’ KS behaviors and to their KC activities. Moreover, as KC activities are more altruistic and can give contributors a feeling of meaningfulness while KS activities are more egoistic (Fung et al. , 2001; Carstensen et al. , 2003; Fung and Carstensen, 2004; Knowles and Hanson, 2018; Hargittai and Dobransky, 2017), OE-others is likely to be more strongly related to KC activities than to KS activities. Therefore, we hypothesized: H1a. An older adult’s OE-others positively affects his/her KC/KS behaviors in a VC. This effect is stronger for KC than for KS1.

As seen above, KC/KS behaviors in VCs are usually intertwined with each other (Choi et al. , 2014; Sedighi et al. , 2018; Chatterjee et al. , 2020) and OE-self (e.g. expectation of making new friends or social ties for the future) positively influences people’s KC/KS behaviors (Chiu et al. , 2006; Hsu et al. , 2007; Pan et al. , 2015; Xiong et al. , 2018; You and Hon, 2019; Ardichvili et al. , 2003). The above conclusion applies to the context of older adults in VCs because they also consider VCs as tools to seek fun and form new social ties (Nimrod, 2010; Nimrod, 2011; Bennett, 2011; Su and Tong, 2021; Knowles and Hanson, 2018; Hargittai and Dobransky, 2017) and achieve other meaningful goals (Choi et al. , 2014; Sedighi et al. , 2018; Chatterjee et al. , 2020). We proposed that OE-self is expected to be positively related to older adults’ KC/KS behaviors as well. However, as KS activities are self-focused and aimed at self-improvement while KC activities focus on the emotionally meaningful goals of helping others (Fung et al. , 2001; Carstensen et al. , 2003; Fung and Carstensen, 2004; Knowles and Hanson, 2018; Hargittai and Dobransky, 2017), OE-self is expected to be more strongly related to KS activities. Therefore, we hypothesized: H2a. An older adult’s OE-self positively affects his/her KC/KS behaviors in a VC. This effect is stronger for KS than for KC.

Older people are more likely to think about the meaning of life and their relationships with other people when they perceive their remaining time as limited (Krause, 2007; Krause, 2009; Fung et al. , 2001; Fung and Carstensen, 2004; Ten Bruggencate et al. , 2018; Barbosa Neves et al. , 2019). Older adults like helping others because sharing useful knowledge with the younger generations can make them feel a strong sense of pride and self-esteem (Lai, 2007; Wang et al. , 2017), and they can also get a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment via achieving goals such as gaining new knowledge (Kim and Merriam, 2004; McWilliams and Barrett, 2018; Chiu et al. , 2016). The above conclusion applies to the context of older adults in VCs because engaging in KC/KS activities helps older adults enrich their sense of enjoyment and meaning and directs them to meaningfully spend their remaining time. Thus, we posited that the pursuit of MIL can positively influence older adults’ KC/KS behaviors. As MIL refers to the pursuit and attainment of worthwhile goals and an accompanying sense of fulfilment, and, as helping others via contributing knowledge or sharing personal life experiences usually bring people a higher level of sense of accomplishment and emotional satisfaction (Noguchi, 2015; Chai et al. , 2011; Zhang et al. , 2017), we posited that MIL is thus, likely to be more strongly related to KC activities than KS activities. We, therefore, hypothesized: H3a. An older adult’s MIL positively affects his/her KC/KS behaviors in a VC. This effect is stronger for KC than for KS.

Older adults are more likely to participate in those activities that can help them engage actively with life, become adaptive and seek self-satisfaction, when they perceive their remaining time as expansive (Cody et al. , 1999; Gonzales et al. , 2015; Dattilo et al. , 2018; Skirbekk et al. , 2019; Lai, 2007). As older adults are increasingly active in VCs, these have become important avenues for them for maintaining a positive and active lifestyle (Choi et al. , 2014; Zhou, 2018; Ryu et al. , 2009). However, many older adults are afraid that they are too old to use the internet, including participating in VCs (Hargittai and Dobransky, 2017). Considering that ATA refers to older adults’ positive coping with their aging status, including continuing to learn new things to remain an active participant in life (Cody et al. , 1999), we posited that having an active and positive ATA motivates older adults to conduct KC/KS behaviors in VCs. In addition, as older adults are more likely to seek knowledge when they are concerned about their personal development (Fung et al. , 2001; Carstensen et al. , 2003; Fung and Carstensen, 2004; Hargittai and Dobransky, 2017; Sun and Zhou, 2021), we further posited that ATA is likely to be more strongly related to KS activities than KC activities and hypothesized: H4a. An older adult’s ATA positively affects his/her KC/KS behavior in a VC. This effect is stronger for KS than for KC.

2.4.2 Moderating effects.
The sustainable development of VCs depends on community MP and the resources shared by them (Yan and Tan, 2014; Koh et al. , 2007; Chiu et al. , 2006; Zhou et al. , 2020; Zhang et al. , 2017; Wang et al. , 2020). MP in a VC creates two effects – complementary and substitution effects. First, we discuss the complementary effects of MP. A high degree of MP in a VC creates opportunities for creating new knowledge through KC activities and finding new knowledge resources through KS activities. High MP in terms of the frequency of the activities and discussions implies that community members are more active in the community, more frequently seek new knowledge and ask questions in the community and contribute new knowledge that others might be looking for. Further, as a consequence of a higher level of new knowledge contribution by VC members, those seeking knowledge are more likely to find the knowledge they are looking for. Accordingly, in a VC with high MP, VC members have more opportunities for achieving their expected outcomes via their KC/KS behaviors (Yan and Tan, 2014; Koh et al. , 2007; Chiu et al. , 2006; Zhou et al. , 2020; Guo et al. , 2020).
We posited that through this above process, MP serves a complementary environmental factor that can positively moderate and thereby enhance the effects of OE-self and OE-others on VC members’ KC/KS behaviors (Frey and Jegen, 2000; Osterloh et al. , 2002; Osterloh and Frey, 2000; Guo et al. , 2020; Chang and Chuang, 2011). However, as we discussed earlier, OE for older adults can be segmented into OE-self and OE-others based on the different goals prioritized by older adults depending on their perceptions of the remaining time in life. Further, as also discussed earlier, OE-others and KC activities are more aligned with emotionally-oriented goals, while OE-self and KS activities are more aligned with future-oriented goals. Accordingly, for the effects of OE-others, we expected the positive moderation by MP to be stronger for the impact of OE-others on the KC relationship than for the impact of OE-others on KS relationship. Similarly, for the effects of OE-self, we expected the positive moderation by MP to be stronger for the impact of OE-self on the KS relationship than for the impact of OE-self on the KC relationship. Therefore, we hypothesized: H1b. Other MP positively moderates the effects of an older adult’s OE-others on his/her KC/KS behaviors in a VC; that is, the positive effects of OE-others on KC/KS are enhanced when other MP is high and are diminished when other MP is low. This effect is stronger for KC than for KS2.
H2b. Other MP positively moderates the effects of an older adult’s OE-self on his/her KC/KS behaviors in a VC; that is, the positive effects of OE-self on KC/KS are enhanced when other MP is high and are diminished when other MP is low. This effect is stronger for KS than for KC.

We now discuss the substitution effects of MP that curiously result as an offshoot of the high degree of participation by members in the activities and discussions within the VC, which initially created the complementary effects discussed above. As a result of a high degree of MP in the VC, which involves asking and answering questions (i.e. KS and KC activities), a bigger base of knowledge resources is created and becomes available to all members (Yan and Tan, 2014; Koh et al. , 2007; Chiu et al. , 2006; Wang et al. , 2020; Ardichvili et al. , 2003; Zhang et al. , 2017). This availability of already answered questions reduces the opportunities for VC members to contribute new information and knowledge that is different from what already exists in the VC’s knowledge base, thereby dampening the KC activities in the VC.
Moreover, as individuals in general and older adults, in particular, are vulnerable to information overload, a bigger base of knowledge resources within the VC might also deter older adults from sifting through the large number of answers and information related to their question, thereby dampening their KS activities in the VC (Manafo and Wong, 2012; Shrivastav and Hiltz, 2013). Furthermore, even if individuals seek answers to their questions, that is, engage in KS activities, there is no guarantee that others will answer those questions if similar questions have been answered before, thereby further dampening the KC activities in the VC. This essentially becomes a vicious cycle as reduced KC activities would result in lower knowledge resources in the VC, which may then dampen KS activities in the VC.
We posited that through this process, MP serves as a substitute environmental factor that can negatively moderate and thereby dampen the effects of MIL and ATA on VC members’ KC/KS behaviors (Frey and Jegen, 2000; Osterloh et al. , 2002; Osterloh and Frey, 2000; Guo et al. , 2020; Chang and Chuang, 2011). However, as we discussed earlier, MIL and KC activities are more aligned with emotionally-oriented goals, while ATA and KS activities are more aligned with future-oriented goals. Accordingly, for the effects of MIL, we expected the negative moderation by MP to be stronger for the impact of MIL on the KC relationship than for that on the KS relationship. Similarly, for the effects of ATA, we expected the negative moderation by MP to be stronger for the impact of ATA on the KS relationship than for that on the KC relationship. Therefore, we hypothesized that: H3b. Other MP negatively moderates the effects of an older adult’s MIL on his/her KC/KS behavior in a VC; that is, the positive effects of MIL on KC/KS are diminished when other MP is high and are enhanced when other MP is low. This effect is stronger for KC than for KS.
H4b. Other MP negatively moderates the effects of an older adult’s ATA on his/her KC/KS behavior in a VC; i., the positive effect of ATA on KC/KS are diminished when other MP is high and are enhanced when other MP is low. This effect is stronger for KS than for KC.

Older adults’ self-efficacy, age, gender, education, prior VC experience and living status may also influence their KC/KS activities in VCs (Lam and Lee, 2006; Zhou, 2018; Choi et al. , 2014). Therefore, we incorporated them as control variables in our models.
3. Methodology
3.1 Data collection
We collected data using a web-based survey in three VCs supported by Baidu.com in China that specifically cater for older adults. The survey was approved by the administrators of these three VCs [3]. Participation in the survey was voluntary; however, we randomly selected 50 lucky survey participants and provided each of them with one textbook. The survey was accessible for 60 days, and 265 data points were collected. As the data were collected from three VCs, we conducted a T -test to check the inter-group difference. We added a categorial variable (i.e. Groups, value = 1, 2, 3) and examined the differences of two demographical variables (i.e. age and gender) among different groups. The results show there were no significant inter-group differences, and the three groups could be merged into one data set. After deleting the survey responses with incomplete data and those of respondents younger than 55 years (Lam and Lee, 2006), our final sample consisted of 204 data responses (Table 1).
3.2 Psychometric properties of scales
Scales for all variables used in this study were taken from prior research but were adapted to fit the needs of our research context (Appendix 1). Table 2 includes the descriptive statistics and reliability measures for all the variables. The Cronbach’s α values, composite reliability measure values and average variance extracted (AVE) values for all variables, respectively, are greater than suggested values of 0.60 (Nunnally, 2010), 0.70 (Hair et al. , 1992) and 0.50 (Hair et al. , 1992), respectively. These tests provided sound support for the convergent validity in our measurement model.
Two methods were used to estimate discriminant validity. First, item loadings on their respective constructs are all greater than those on other constructs, as shown in Table 2, which provides evidence for the discriminant validity of our scales. Second, the AVE square root values in bold on the main diagonal are all greater than the inter-correlations among all study constructs shown in the bottom triangle of this correlation table (Table 3), demonstrating good discriminant validity among all study variables.
We also addressed the common methods bias (CMB) issue. We dispersed all scale items throughout the questionnaire (Aiken et al. , 1991) and allowed one response per Internet protocol (IP) to control for CMB. Further, we tested the interaction models, and those interactions among variables were not likely to have been apparent to the respondents, minimizing the possibility that respondents would have provided answers based on expected correlations. Finally, we also used Harman’s one-factor test method to statistically assess CMB (Podsakoff et al. , 2003). The first factor captured only 15.998% of the variance. Based on all these efforts, there was no reason to believe that CMB was a potential threat.
4. Results
We used a hierarchical approach to run ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models via SPSS Statistics 20 to test our hypotheses (Models 1 and 3 in Table 4) (Ke and Zhang, 2010). As some of the results from the full OLS models with all variables were not significant, we ran OLS models with only those variables and those interactions in the model where we hypothesized larger effects (in addition to control variables, Models 2 and 4 in Table 4). For example, we hypothesized a stronger effect of OE-self on KC than on KS, while we hypothesized a stronger effect of OE-others on KS than on KC. Therefore, in the reduced KC model (Model 2 in Table 4), we only included OE-self and not OE-others, while in the reduced KS model (Model 4 in Table 4), we only included OE-others and not OE-self.
4.1 Direct effects
The effects of OE-others on KC/KS are positive and the coefficient of KC is greater than that of KS, providing evidence that older adults with high OE focused on benefiting others are more likely to contribute knowledge in VCs to benefit others than seek knowledge for their own future benefits. Thus, H1a is supported.
The effects of OE-self on KC/KS are positive and the coefficient of KS is greater than that of KC, providing evidence that older adults with high OE focused on benefiting themselves are more likely to seek knowledge for their own future benefit than contribute knowledge in VCs for benefiting others. Therefore, H2a is supported.
The effects of MIL on KC/KS are positive and the coefficient of KC is greater than that of KS, as hypothesized in H3a , providing evidence that older adults with high MIL are more likely to contribute knowledge in VCs to increase their own meaningfulness rather than seek knowledge for future gains for themselves.
The effect of ATA on KC is negative and on KS, it is positive. The coefficient of KS is greater than that of KC, as hypothesized in H4a , providing evidence that older adults with a positive ATA are more likely to seek knowledge in VCs for future gains for themselves rather than increase their own meaningfulness. Considering that only the effect of MIL on KC is significant, both H3a and H4a are partially supported.
4.2 Moderating effects
The effects of MP on the relationships between OE-others on KC/KS are positive and the interaction coefficient of OE-others and MP on KC is greater than that of KS, as hypothesized in H1b , providing evidence that MP complements the impacts of OE-others on KC/KS and the effect is stronger for KC than for KS. As both effects are insignificant, H1b is partially supported.
The effect of MP on the relationship between OE-self on KS is positive, as hypothesized in H2b , providing evidence that MP complements the impact of OE-self on KS. The interaction coefficient of OE-self and MP on KS is greater than that of KC, as hypothesized in H2b , providing evidence that the effect is stronger for KS than for KC. As both effects are insignificant, H2b is partially supported.
The effects of MP on the relationship between MIL and KC are negative, as hypothesized in H3b , providing evidence that MP substitutes the impact of MIL on KC. The interaction coefficient of MIL and MP on KC is greater than that of KS, as hypothesized in H3b , providing evidence that the effect is stronger for KC than for KS. H3b is partially supported. Following the procedures recommended by Aiken et al. (1991), we drew the plot for the significant moderating effect (Figure 2).
The effect of MP on the relationship between ATA and KS is negative, as hypothesized in H4b , supporting evidence that MP substitutes the impact of ATA on KS. The effect of MP on the relationship between ATA and KC is positive, supporting evidence that MP complements the effect of ATA on KC. The effect of MP on the relationship between ATA and KC is significant but positive, supporting evidence that MP complements the impact of ATA on KC. H4b is partially supported. Specifically, when MP is high, older adults will lessen their KS behaviors but increase their KC behaviors.
The positive moderating effect is unexpected. We attribute this unexpected finding to older adults’ characteristics. As shown in prior research, older adults usually behave politely online and are more likely to show their approval and praise to others when they find that their age peers contribute their “wisdom” in VCs, even when that “wisdom” is of low quality (Tommaso, 2015). Namely, the enhanced KC behaviors might be participating in discussions such as showing kind words or approval other than meaningful knowledge contribution. We drew the plots for the two moderating effects (Figures 3 and 4).
5. Discussion
Alongside the hypotheses, our results provide some additional unique insights about the KC and KS activities of older adults in VCs. First, among all the predictors, OE-others is the most powerful factor that influences both KC and KS activities of older adults, but with a stronger effect on KC activities. MIL is the second most powerful factor that influences older adults’ KC activities. Taken together, these findings suggest that older adults prioritize emotional meaningfulness over future orientation.
Second, while our H4b holds and we indeed found a higher negative coefficient of MP as a moderator on the ATA → KS relationship, we also found that MP has a complementary effect that enhances the impact of ATA on older adults’ KC activities. Based on the literature, we expected and found that older adults with a high future orientation in terms of high ATA are driven to primarily seek new knowledge in a VC ( H4a ). Perhaps, the ATA → KC relationship becomes stronger because future-oriented older adults feel compelled to make knowledge contributions in the VC to conform to the others when there is high MP and accordingly, high KC by others as well.
5.1 Theoretical contributions
We contributed to the literature on knowledge management in VCs by advancing our understanding of older adults’ KC/KS activities in VCs, which is quite sparse, in four ways. First, by integrating the notions and variables from SST and SCT and using synthetic logic, we developed two models that are comprehensive yet parsimonious and are unique to the emerging yet crucial older adult population to explain their KC/KS behaviors in VCs. Our empirical results provide support to our hypotheses, albeit partially and/or weakly in three of the eight cases.
Second, we addressed information systems (IS) scholars’ concerns about how to describe older adults’ unique characteristics when modeling their ICTs-related behaviors. While OE has been established as an important predictor of behaviors in VCs, to describe and model older adults’ KC/KS behaviors in VCs, we divided the OE construct into two sub-constructs based on the notions in SST. Moreover, we used MIL to capture older adults’ positive reactions when they perceive their remaining time as limited and ATA to capture their positive reactions when they perceive their remaining time as open and expansive. As discussed in the theory section and in consonance with SST, we did not use biological age as this variable has not been found to be predictive of older adults’ behaviors. The above endeavors – modeling older adults’ characteristics and examining their impacts – are a direct response to prior appeals from IS scholars not only to provide insights into how to capture and describe older adults’ characteristics that might influence their ICTs-related behaviors but also to explore the impacts of these characteristics on their ICTs usage (Ryu et al. , 2009; Wagner et al. , 2010; Yang, 2019; Quan-Haase et al. , 2016; Hong et al. , 2013; Ghasemaghaei et al. , 2019).
Third, we also hypothesized and found that the same factor has different levels of impact on KC and KS behaviors. In a similar vein, we found that the impact of ATA is greater on KS than on KC, while the impact of MIL is greater on KC than on KS because of the alignment of these variables with the perceptions of remaining time either as expansive or as limited, respectively. The above findings further reinforce the central role that perceptions of remaining time play in the behaviors of older adults, a concern not usually germane to younger adult populations and thereby advance the literature by demonstrating the importance of developing these unique KC/KS models for older adults.
Finally, this study also confirmed and reinforced the complementary and substitutive effects of MP as an environmental factor on older adults’ KC/KS behaviors, a notion that is central to SCT and effects that have been empirically found in other studies of online behaviors. The different moderating effects of MP provide new evidence of the different roles that social environmental factors play in supporting or hindering older adults’ ICT use (Xiong and Zuo, 2019; Zhou, 2018). Further, the two substitutive effects remind us that older adults’ KC/KS behaviors might be impeded in VCs that are highly active and have many knowledge resources.
5.2 Practical implications
Our research has three practical implications for organizations and VC practitioners. First, organizations could use knowledge-intensive VCs to outsource some of their business to older adults. The gig economy is a new labor-hiring style that allows people to work flexibly and in a self-directed and limitless way and has been changing traditional employee-employer relationships (Ravenelle, 2019; Vallas and Schor, 2020). Organizations that want to reduce their human resource costs could post their operational or business problems in VCs and attract older adults to contribute their wisdom. Companies could provide older adults with intrinsic rewards other than money (e.g. reputational badges or titles such as “certified expert”). This approach will be costless because, as our empirical results show, older adults’ KC activities are more intrinsically motivated and pay relatively less attention to material rewards.
Second, entrepreneurial companies in the gig economy can consider building older adult-specific intermediary platforms to develop elder human resources. Older adults, including elder employees, represent large reservoirs of life experience, job skills and other valuable knowledge. However, older adults have unique characteristics and behave differently than young people when using ICTs. Current gig economy platforms aimed at young people might not work for older adults. We recommend that entrepreneurial companies take older adults’ characteristics into consideration and develop special platforms for them. These platforms can imitate the mechanisms of current gig economy platforms, and companies can set up business units to attract older adults and use their knowledge and life wisdom.
Finally, VC managers should encourage older adults to interact with each other. Our empirical results show that MP provides older adults with opportunities to fulfil their others/self-focused expectations. VCs managers should design and launch more activities that could bring fun, enjoyment, new friends and new social ties to older adults. These activities could attract more older adults to actively participate in VCs and, in turn, generate more knowledge.
5.3 Limitations
We acknowledge two limitations. First, we only had two items for the OE-others and OE-self variables because we divided the OE scale into two sub-constructs based on our theorizing rooted in SST of the differential impacts that these two constructs are likely to have on the KC/KS behaviors of older adults. While three or more items in a scale are preferred in survey-based empirical studies, the two-item scales used in this study might not unduly affect our findings, as two-item scales have been used in prior studies and have been found to show acceptable reliability (Eisinga et al. , 2013). Further, our rigorous scale validation procedures provided evidence of high reliability and validity. Nonetheless, results should be interpreted with caution.
Second, multicollinearity is often an issue in empirical studies and may be a concern in the present study, as we used two related constructs (i.e. OE-others versus OE-self) (Mason and Perreault, 1991). Accordingly, to formally assess multicollinearity, we computed VIF values in both our models. We found only one VIF value to be greater than 5 (at 5.561), which is lower than the common rule of thumb of 10 (Mason and Perreault, 1991), indicating that while a low degree of multicollinearity exists, it is not a serious issue.
5.4 Future research
As older adults are increasingly active on online platforms such as VCs, their KC/KS activities are emerging yet promising research topics in knowledge management. This current study merely examined the antecedents of older adults’ KC/KS behaviors in VCs, and more efforts are still needed. Scholars could take prior studies on knowledge management as references (Singh et al. , 2019; Cillo et al. , 2019; Singh, 2019; Wang et al. , 2020; Al Ahbabi et al. , 2019; Zhou et al. , 2020) and pay more attention to topics such as the process of older adults’ knowledge exchange, mechanisms for older adults’ knowledge governance, performance evaluation of older adults’ knowledge exchange and the monetization of knowledge. We hope that more scholars would shift their interests to older adults and address the abovementioned topics to enrich knowledge management research.

All “a” hypotheses are of direct effects.
All “b” hypotheses are of interaction effects.
A virtual community in Baidu is essentially a Baidu Tieba, which is literally translated as a subforum. The three VCs in this current study were, namely, “happy 1950s (subjective: learning and communication, health and happiness; members: 3,690 as of March 2021),” “retired elderly (subjective: happy and free communication; members: 4,561 as of March 2021)” and “see you in 1950s (subjective: making friends with literature, reading and thinking; members: 5,704 as of March 2021).” The specific topics include life wisdoms on managing family relationships, balance between work and family, experience of retirement arrangements, maintaining health, religions, leisure travel and recommendations of books, films, shows and television programs.

Abstract: Purpose > The purpose of this paper is to develop a replicable model that ensures Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage as well as water treatment facilities at the community level by providing total service coverage at community scale. An intervention was implemented in one of the low-lying areas of Basirhat Municipality (West Bengal, India) that included a number of action programs in order to address household- and community-level water-induced challenges. Design/methodology/approach > A research study was undertaken to identify the root causes of the problems that are generally spawned from geomorphological, hydro-fluvial, climatic factors and processes and the situation becomes complicated when many other cumulative problem-contexts layovers the existing ones. A number of social and technological innovations were tested in the field and this paper critically examined the intervention processes and outcomes. It was implemented through participatory process by involving related stakeholders working at that scale so that necessary public acceptance is received for scaling up, at least, in the similar physical, social, economic and institutional contexts. Findings > The problem conceptualization process, spatial assessment for contextualizing the problem, design of interventions for different scales, development of project deployment strategies from field-based learnings contributed in developing a total solution based on fusing of household-level technical solutions, social innovations and actions for community engagements towards sustainability. Mobilized community members in addressing local inundation and waterlogging crisis. Satellite image-based maps shown to make them understand the upper-lower connection of drainage. People also developed their own action plans and engaged themselves in resuscitation of an old canal, removed the garbage that resulted in improved drainage conditions in the area. Research limitations/implications > Pandemic due to COVID 19 and its related prolonged lock down, West Bengal State Assembly Election, closure of municipal governance system due to the forthcoming municipal election, closure of educational institutions, closure of Anganwadi Centre in the field area were the limitations. Due to the lock down, it was difficult for the team to maintain the time frame as well as the budget. As per the Election’s Code of Conduct gets released no public meeting was allowed without permission, people in the vicinity became suspicious, hence movement of the team members got restricted. Practical implications > Due to the COVID protocols, the team could not organise mass training programs. It was difficult for the team members to commute in public/private transport, hence filed work got impacted. As the team could not access data from the health department, they developed a strategy of generation data on body mass index, mid-upper arm circumferences and waist-to-hip ratios to understand the status of health and nutrition of the community. It was difficult to access the Public Health Engineering Department’s laboratory situated in the municipality for water sample test. Cost escalated due to extension of the project time.

Full text: 1. Introduction
Inundation-related challenges in low-lying areas located, especially in the deltaic plains, received less attention and therefore problems remained less addressed (Ahmed and Sarker, 2015; Ghosh and Mistri, 2020; Rahman and Islam, 2018). Cities are intensifying, encroaching open fields, flood plains and water bodies are depleting rapidly to cater various needs of exploding population (Ahmed et al. , 2021; Ahsan et al. , 2021; Ghosh and Mistri, 2020; Pallavi et al. , 2021; Zhang et al. , 2021). As a result versatile, self-sufficient city landscapes become depleted, degraded zone that aew generally known as peri-urban areas (Liu et al. , 2021; Sansare and Mhaske, 2020). The peri-urban areas are the transitional zones and endure in a crossroad between the development furore and a decaying or destroyed ecosystem. These transitional zones located in city outskirts that are generally situated in low-lying back swamps behind the relatively elevated natural levees on which cities developed (Ascott et al. , 2019; Brelih et al. , 2018). Urbanization has brought in drastic changes in both the topography and adaptability of these peri-urban areas. Cities fail to recognize the importance of peri-urban areas and their ecosystems as store house of resources, act to safeguard from floods and droughts are supposed to be kept as city buffer zones for long-term sustainability of the city and to give a range of ecosystem services to the urban communities (Ascott et al. , 2019; Brelih et al. , 2018). But unfortunately, these areas are becoming occupied by people and cause breakdown of physical/environmental integrity by bringing abrupt change in the pattern of land use. As a result, the vital drainage services that the areas had been providing become jeopardized and water congestions take place leading to long-term waterlogging crisis in the area. It is also important to note, the governance system in the areas is quasi-urban (neither urban, nor rural) although the areas are generally being governed by formal rural governance system (e.g. Panchayet system in India), people primarily depend on urban areas to pursue their livelihoods and other economic activities, the demographic composition is heterogenic as mixed occupational groups live there and thus the choices, priorities, practices are different in many instances. All these in combined fashion seriously affects the service provisions in the areas such as human health, physical communication, education including safe water supply. Sometimes problems take serious turns that need humanitarian support to ensure everyday living of the people safe and secured. In this backdrop, an initiative was taken in the low-lying areas of Basirhat Municipality of West Bengal, India to address water-related challenges at three scales such as household level, community-level and relatively broader area level. Household-level solutions include supply of low cost, easy to operate, sustainable water purifiers; community-level solution focused on securing water-related challenges at social places of public gatherings by setting 1,000 litre water purifier systems and wider area-level solutions include the engagement of local communities to drain out stagnant waters by clearing drains, creating and digging small canals through collective actions. These three types of solutions in mutually complying styles provided a total water solution in the low-lying areas in Basirhat Municipality. In addition to this technical solution, efforts were also given towards developing social innovations so that systems introduced are owned by the community and can sustain long-term. This paper describes the results of pilot interventions implemented at three scales aiming to show why an all-out, total water solution is required in the low-lying settlement areas of the cities and the peri urban areas. Arguments are provided that partial solutions to water-related challenges might not address the difficulties people face in the low-lying settlement areas of the cities and peri-urban contexts happened as results of water-induced challenges.
2. Data collections methods
At the beginning it was conceived that the water-induced challenges are complicated since natural, physical, technological, social, economic, biological elements are involved in the issue. On top of that impacts of disasters such as floods, cyclones and their subtle changes (e.g. frequency of occurrence, magnitude, intensity, etc.) happening under the influence of climate change make the situations worse. It is also imperative to mention that governance system in the low-lying settlement areas of the cities, peri-urban areas/quasi-urban/quasi-rural/pseudo-formal/informal and effective execution of decisions in this context is difficult. In common practices, all these issues are generally not taken into consideration while designing and implementing safe water plans for local-level communities. This is why, detail level conceptual discussions were conducted at the beginning, happened in two phases in Delhi (August and December 2019) where a number of stakeholders including the members of the Professional Institute for Development and Socio Environmental Management (PRISM) and partner agencies (from India and Bangladesh) were participated. The conceptual discussions led to develop project proposal on safe water options for urban flooding settings, related strategies towards field implementation of the activities. Therefore, the pilot intervention that aimed at providing micro, meso, macro water solutions (also short-term, long-term sustainable solutions) in a peri-urban setting in Mathpara area (Ward No. 14) of Basirhat municipality were carried out in four major phases. These are as follows:
- conceptualizing the problem;

- gathering baseline data about the field situations, rapport building with the community members and to secure local ownership over project activities;

- implementation of interventions at three scales such as providing household level water purifiers, community-level safe water facilities and motivating communities to address community-level water congestion (labelled as total safe water solutions); and

- gathering of data on the impacts of interventions implemented.



As indicated earlier that at the beginning a multi-partner consultation meeting was held in Delhi (August and December 2019) led by the Humanitarian Innovation Fund, supported by ELRAH (UK) and that facilitated a process to critically review the drawbacks in the current way of conceptualizing a problem that may ended up into a humanitarian crisis. It stressed on innovation needs (social, technological) of various kinds and their convergence at various levels so that humanitarian crisis can be reduced if not fully eliminated. The follow-up actions of the Delhi-consultation was developing project proposal with strong innovation components. Afterwards, PRISM (India) teamed up with three agencies and relevant experts, did a number of internal discussions and finally an all-agreed proposal was developed where water-induced community challenges were proposed to be addressed in a usually negligent low-lying settlement area in Basirhat Municipality, West Bengal (Figure 1) by ensuring convergence of a number of social–technological–institutional innovations.
Field data collection was done primarily using semi-structured, in-depth interview with 87 households (women were the major respondents); in addition, 10 community consultations and 20 Key Informants were carried out. The community living in the area (Figure 2) is heterogenic by professions and work as daily wage-earners (Table 1) but share common attributes such as poor economic status, lower literacy rate (Figure 3), living in the scarcity of safe water resulted into poor health conditions, filthy environmental conditions and restricted/difficult movements due to widespread waterlogging. The interviews with the people and consultations with community members helped to get an in-depth understanding about the urban flooding and water crisis in terms of seasonality concerns, impacts of safe water scarcity and waterlogging on people like women-elderly-children-disabled, health, economy (both direct and indirect).
Scientific methods such as geo-spatial techniques (topographical mapping, spatial survey) were also conducted to know about the water flow patterns of the area, land topographical conditions to identify the potential areas for water congestion. Locational information of the households using global positioning system were also taken and overlaid on top of local physical conditions so that water-induced problems could be seen relative to the locational attributes such as land morphology and water flow pattern. These maps were later used as tools to convince people for collective actions for excavating local drains towards addressing waterlogging situations. The results of water samples were presented that were tested in different laboratories to know about the quality of drinking water in pre-project situations and also the samples taken from household-level water purifiers cum storage devices distributed under the pilot interventions. This pre and post situation water quality assessments helped to know about the improvements in water quality that is safe for drinking and other purposes.
3. Physical and social settings of the study area
The pilot intervention was implemented in Basirhat Municipality of North 24 Parganas District of West Bengal (India) which is a small city located in the southern deltaic plain of the Hooghly-Ichhamati rivers, came down as right-bank tributaries of the mighty Ganga River (Figure 4). Basirhat Municipality is a sub divisional headquarter of North 24 Parganas District, Gazetted in 1869 and is one of the moderately growing cities of West Bengal in present times. The town has its border with Bangladesh in the East and is often referred to as the “gateway” of eastern Sundarbans to other areas of West Bengal. The city has not any significant industrial base and remained dominantly as a commercial trading center. Its basic urban structure and services are not developed in a planned manner. Presently, the municipal authority has limited capacity to provide basic services like clean urban environment, safe piped water, drainage, solid waste treatment, sanitation, health services, sufficient transport network and other urban amenities.
The Municipality of Basirhat is divided into 23 wards, and this study was conducted in Ward Number 14 (Bhawanipur-Mathpara). The river Ichhamati flows along the northern and eastern side of the municipality (Figure 4). The city has a total area of 22.5 square kilometres with a population of 125,254 and population density of 5,567 per square kilometre as per 2011 census. Basirhat city is located in flat riverine plain with gently sloping lands towards the south. This plain is a part of the Ganga Delta System and is developed by deposition of clay and fine sand by the tributaries of the river Ganga. This soil conditions cause to get the topsoil water saturated in moderate or high rainfall occurrence and generate surface runoff and flooding. Maximum altitude of above mean sea level is 6.31 meters and the land slopes gently towards south east of the city. The municipality is known mainly for its hot and humid climate. The Hallmark of the climate is the prevalence of monsoon from early June to mid-September (Figure 3). Summer or pre-monsoon (March–May) is the principal hot season in the city and South-West monsoon or rainy season (June–September) is the principal humid season. The weather remains dry during the winter (mid-November–mid-February). Based on historic observed data, it has been observed that Basirhat is getting warmer by the day. The total amount of monsoon rainfall which accounts for more than 74% of total annual rainfall (Figure 5) over the area has changed (though non significantly) during the last century though high variability in inter annual rainfall in time and space has been observed. Annual normal rainfall is 1,608 mm with standard deviation of 268.92 and coefficient of variation is 16.71. Monsoon months (June–September), contribute 74% of total annual rainfall with an average variability of 21.6%. Pre-monsoon and post monsoon months contribute 10.5% and 15.5% of rainfall, respectively. Annually Basirhat experiences 77 average rainy days. Annual mean maximum temperature is 29.70°C and annual mean minimum temperature is 21.68°C. Whereas highest maximum temperature reaches even up to 41°C in May and lowest minimum temperature hovers around 10°C in January. Annual average humidity is 77%. Basirhat is one of the vulnerable cities to climate change with extreme climate driven multifarious threats including tidal surges, alternate occurrence of drought and water scarcity and waterlogging. The city is prone to either drought condition as a regular feature or sporadic flood situation due to its climatic state.
It is indicated before that unplanned urbanization process have been happening in Basirhat during past 3–4 decades in the contexts of delicate hydro-meteorological, land morphological conditions of the region (Table 2). These unplanned and inappropriate actions contributed in widening inequality in resources allocations and benefits sharing, especially in low-lying settlements, coupled with disaster induced stresses and caused people to endure with living in poor and miserable conditions. In the current process, concentration of people and communities takes place first in an area and then public service providers enter into the area to provide their services, which is supposed to be happened in the opposite way. In many cases, these agencies provide services in hesitation and unwillingly because the local dwellers are not officially entitled to receive services there due to many reasons. As a result, road communication, safe water supply, proper drainage and sanitation facilities, health-care systems, did not develop in the study locations following a proper planning process.
4. Climate change and disaster risks in the low-lying settlements: humanitarian challenges in Basirhat
Disaster risks are viewed through different lens (Pal, 2019). Study of the direct impacts of hazards, vulnerability assessment, response strategies (adaptation) and resilience building are the keys to measure disaster risks these days (Blaikie et al. , 1994; Wisner et al. , 2004; Olson et al. , 2020). Similarly, any assessment of the scale and nature of urban risk depends on how risk is conceived – whether technological hazards, infectious diseases, violence and terrorist activity are included, how “disasters” are defined and measured and whether consideration is given to post-disaster risks also (Quarantelli, 1998). In this backdrop, low-lying areas of Basirhat city was assessed from disaster and climate change contexts where intensive and erratic rainfall cause widespread flooding leading to develop water-related challenges.
Some of the key changes witnessed in the peri-urban ecosystems of Basirhat are, rapid land use change that took place during the past 10–15 years and open spaces and agriculture land (about 10%) have been converted to residential buildings. There is a gradual shrinkage in water bodies due to rampant encroachment and about 30% ponds are contaminated due to hybrid fish rearing. Drinking water is a major issue impacting on the health of urban poor people. The current problem in Basirhat low-lying settlement areas is the reduction in the area for agricultural activities and continuous waterlogging, impacting the flood resilience of the city. These chronic risks are consequences of poor drainage system of the area. Excessive rainfall in the monsoon months increase the risk of waterlogging. The problem persists in 12 Wards of the Municipality out of 23 Wards and has taken a severe toll on health, livelihoods of people, access to office, school and health-care institutions. The typical features in these affected wards include, standing water for a period of 3–4 h, and the season of waterlogging can stretch for 4–7 months in a year.
One of the major factors of waterlogging is absence of effective urban flood management system, particularly in low-lying outskirt areas of Basirhat. An uncleared solid waste dumped in haphazard manner has added to the problem of waterlogging. Even after receding of flood, water remains stagnant in large number in some pockets. Basirhat city, situated by the side of Ichhamati river, is at a vulnerable location due to rise in river bed as a result of silt deposits where systematic removal of sediments generally does not happen. On top of this, there are tidal surges happen, especially in tidal pick season and saline water from estuary rushes into the river course. Other associated risks are supply of drinking water in some wards (especially in Ward 14), lack of efficient operation of transport vehicles, closed transport routes and health issues (Figure 6), including outbreak of waterborne diseases. Lack of solid waste management, unplanned construction, poor infrastructural development are the causes behind the continuation of water logging problem of Basirhat city. As a result, city’s general public health condition is deteriorating leading to spread of diseases, particularly of vector borne and waterborne diseases in summer and rainy seasons. To add to the already overburdening problems of risk of epidemic, the poor have only local government hospitals to depend upon for treatment.
It was observed during the survey that most of the households (51.72%) were having unstable housing structures and people were suffering a decade long adverse effects of urban floods. Because of urbanization and unscientific drainage system, urban flood is taken place and it persists for more than 7 months in a year. In the same context, it has impacted banefully on the quality of life of inhabitants of this locality by creating water pollution and vector borne diseases. Locals have informed to the team members that because of inundation, taste and smell of water have changed and citizens of this locality have understood that due to waterlogging, health situation of the locality is rapidly deteriorating. It was also observed that cold and fever are the major diseases in this locality and route cause behind the fever and indigestion is water logging as indicated by the respondents. The respondents also mentioned that this situation has damaged the social well-being and cohesion of the society. The field investigation also found unscientific solid waste management process in the locality, which is one of the key reasons for environmental pollution leading to groundwater contamination.
5. Social processes innovations and the deployment of the interventions
It is commonly observed that the people remain less consulted for whom the interventions are designed, who will use and operate the systems and finally personally or collectively own the asset towards the sustainability of the systems/functions provided. Therefore, adequate consultation was carried throughout the project intervention processes to know about the living patterns of the communities, their occupation and risks associated mainly with water. It was found that rapport building with the households and communities is one of the major components to gain community trusts for achieving the maximum benefits from the interventions implemented. In this pilot project, the rapport building has been achieved through conducting field works, experience-visits and interaction and exchange of information with communities on a range of problem-facts such as connection of water with health challenges, direct and indirect cost savings from safe water use, production loss happened as results of waterlogging, costs of communication disruptions, etc. Initially, it was found that winning trusts of people of a completely new person, agency or technology is a big issue. Paying huge and careful attention in household and community consultations helped the rapport building process effective – people gradually expressed their queries, shared their sufferings from waterlogging and water quality concerns (i.e. excess of iron in water), mentioned about their complaints on how they were rejected to receive services from service delivering agencies, showed willingness to receive information and to get skilled in operating and maintaining the water purification and storage device and also gave their own innovative suggestions how problems can be overcome. This consultation phase revealed the history of the problem of the area. Their anguish and struggle to settle in this city outskirt, peri-urban lands were gradually discovered. They shared that decade before the area was under-populated. The area was almost vacant and partly used for agricultural activities. Everything came into discussion – not in pen and paper but many emotions were handled carefully when mother shared her elder son died untimely. It was revealed that majorly women suffered the most, in case of inundation. Pregnant woman, especially, those who were in advanced stage were afraid of living such areas in time of rainy season. No vehicles can reach the area few years back in time of need. Now, only approachable roads are built which is made of concrete but still they are narrow in nature. In general, the people or communities who receive services are generally labelled as “beneficiaries”, but the consultation process helped how to make the community members as “partners” who has a number of roles to play on their parts to ensure the services and solutions sustainable. The community members also selected one female person from them as their leader and to make a bridge between community and the project partners.
6. Total safe water solutions: deployment of interventions at different scales
It was indicated earlier that the project aimed to provide a total solution that may give benefits to the people across the scale. The three scales where the interventions were implemented were as follows:
- safe water solution at household level;

- water availability at community scale; and

- solutions of drainage congestion or waterlogging at wider area scale.



Sections before indicated how people suffer from the challenges happening at different scales separately and also simultaneously. The problem conceptualization process, spatial assessment for contextualizing the problem, design of interventions for different scales, development of project deployment strategies from field-based learnings – all contributed in developing a total solution based on fusing of household-level technical solutions, social innovations and actions for community engagements towards sustainability. The three-stage actions for three scales are described in the sections below.
6.1 Technical solutions at household level
The household level technical solution include a domestic water purifier and safe storage device which is labelled as “AMRITADHARA - DWP”, developed by PRISM, under Safe Water Mission, is entrusted with WHO recommended Household Water treatment and Safe Storage – HWTS. This low-cost device (US$27) was distributed free of costs to all 87 households that was found to be easy to operate by the members of the household. It has the capacity to remove almost all kinds of physical, chemical and biological contaminants and can eliminate bad odour and colour from the water (Table 3). Before the installation of the device, it was comprehensively tested and proven to be effective in many different parts of India, Bangladesh and Vietnam. The device has the capacity to supply safe drinking water for years if properly maintained.
At community scale three large size water treatment plants were installed in the Mathpara (Ward 14 of Basirhat Municipality). The water purification capacity of each unit is 1,000 litres per day by which about 330 people or 60 families can get adequate drinking water (3 litres of water per person per day) from the facility. The facilities were installed in a school, Hindu temple and community place (market place) where hundreds of people meet every day.
6.2 Social innovations
The social innovation is an important pre-requisite for any interventions to serve and sustain in the long run, in community spheres. It is evident that many good technological innovations were introduced towards service improvements and to ensure social well-being but few were successfully remained in service mainly due to the absence of social innovation component in that. In this project, the members of the community were with the project implementation team (Figure 7).
It was indicated earlier (Section 5) that initiatives taken to read and understand the society deeply and created a negotiated space as to find the gateway for implementing the project interventions. The household level water purification units, the Amritadhara needs periodic management, replenish the filter with chemical substances and social processes helped to get the users involved into the process. Efforts given in social innovations also helped to receive necessary motivation of people about why little effort should be given for health and economic benefits by getting continuous supply of safe water for the family members of the household.
6.3 Community engagement and ownerships towards sustainability
The third intervention of the project was to mobilize community members in addressing local inundation and waterlogging crisis. In doing that consultation meetings were conducted with community people which informed them about the causes of waterlogging problem in the area such as:
- unplanned construction of buildings;

- blocking areas by some people for fishery development;

- dumping of garbage and waste materials into the drains that reduces the water drainage capacities of local drains and canals; and

- raising of river bed by sediment depositions and lowering the water conveyance capability of the river resulted in inundation of low-lying areas when river overflows during monsoon floods and cyclone induced water surge (Figures 2 and 8).



People also informed that occurrence of intense rainfall over a short period also cause waterlogging in the area. Satellite image-based maps were shown to them to make them understand the upper-lower connection of drainage. People also informed about social movements and raised the issues with local Panchayet, Block Development Officer and sub-Divisional officer and District Magistrate. But when the community members failed to convince the formal authorities, they developed their own action plans and engaged themselves in resuscitation of an old canal, removed the garbage that resulted in improved drainage conditions in the area according to elevation data from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) (Figure 8).
7. Conclusion and way forward
The natural drainage system in the back swamp, low-lying areas of Basirhat Municipality is composed of canals, creeks which drain out excessive local waters and waters discharged from urban areas into the main river channels and thus urban areas remain flood free and peri-urban areas can sustain physically agile and unharmed. These water retention areas are supposed to be kept as city buffer zones for long-term sustainability of the city and to give a range of ecosystem services to the urban (also local) people. In this backdrop, an initiative was taken in the low-lying settlement areas of Basirhat Municipality of West Bengal, India to address water-related challenges at three scales such as household level, community-level and relatively broader water catchment levels. Household level solutions include supply of low cost, easy operable, sustainable water purifiers, community-level solution focussed on securing water-related challenges at social/public gathering places and wider catchment area level solutions include the engagement of local communities to drain out stagnant waters by clearing drains, creating/digging small canals through collective actions. Scientific methods such as geo-spatial techniques (topographical mapping, spatial survey, water quality tests) along with social methods such as participatory appraisals for gathering information on human health, public awareness campaigns and partnership development with local government agencies were the major activities performed as part of the implementation of interventions. It is imperative to mention that water-related challenges in the low-lying settlement areas of Basirhat Municipality have effectively been addressed by relying on necessary theoretical underpinnings (disaster risk reduction/humanitarian principles) transmitted through application of scientific techniques and mediated through local people and their agencies. However, the outcomes of the pilot interventions such as financial viability, capacity to supply safe and adequate water, social acceptance, community ownership and collective actions, co-creation of knowledge may suggest, with a strong degree of confidence, that the proposed solutions could be replicated in other areas, especially, at least, in other deltaic coastal settings. The water interventions provided at different scales (i.e. household, community, landscape level wider areas) gave local communities relief from waterlogging crisis and reduced health risks associated with unsafe water consumption. The research findings showed that addressing waterlogging crisis in peri-urban contexts needs total solutions irrespective of scales. In doing that in-depth assessment of both human dimensions and physical contexts of the problem is necessary to understand the impacts of one challenge happening in a certain scale on the challenges occurring in other scales. In this study, these issues were critically assessed by using different methods that results in identifying three scales where problem persist that finally helped to design water interventions for peri-urban areas of Basirhat municipality. The community members and the representatives of the local government, i.e. the Panchayet members mentioned that segmented solutions of water crisis will not water-related challenges in peri-urban settings.

Table 2. The water induced crisis in Basirhat against the backdrop of geographical attributes
Regional geographical attributes (regional scale attributes) Influences of factors Impacts in Basirhat (impacts at local scale)
Slope conditions of the region (North to South direction) Intensity of currents in flood waters contributes in increasing water and sediment loads Flooding and inundation, sometimes flash floods causing degradation of water retention ponds
Water supply from large watershed areas Determines amount of water mass (intensity and magnitude of floods) and sediment load Lengthening flood durations, waterlogging happens in low lying areas of the city. Cause to contaminate groundwater
High lands in the upper region and low in the south Water discharge capacity increase, receives more monsoon rainfall-led water mass towards down-slopes May cause flash floods and cause damage of assets (tube wells, water supply infrastructure, etc.)
Sediment deposited soft topsoil Sediment loads, low water infiltration capacity of topsoil and generation of surface runoff Soils becomes saturated by water because of poor drainage conditions of the soil and generate surface runoff and cause floods quickly
Length of the river More water with more length of river Floods may engulf wider area (whole floodplain region)
Relative position of the location Closeness to the sea, geographical position (e.g. situating at the mouth of an estuary) Natures, types, intensity of hazards are determined such as cyclonic induced strong wind and water surge may cause the water issues worse. Basirhat is also under the threats of Sea level Rise due to its location

Abstract: Digital health interventions refer to interventions designed to support health-related knowledge transfer and are delivered via digital technologies, such as mobile apps. Digital health interventions are a double-edged sword: they have the potential to reduce health inequalities, for example, by making treatments available remotely to rural populations underserved by health care facilities or by helping to overcome language barriers via in-app translation services; however, if not designed and deployed with care, digital health interventions also have the potential to increase health inequalities and exacerbate the effects of the digital divide.

A random selection of 25 publications identified from the search will be double screened by four reviewers. If there is >75% agreement for included/excluded publications, the team will continue to screen all the identified publications. For all included publications, study characteristics will be extracted by one author and checked for agreement by a second author, with any disagreements resolved by consensus among the study team.

Full text: Introduction
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated widespread adoption of digital health interventions internationally. This rapid shift to digital delivery has laid bare the impact of pre-existing and emerging systemic health inequalities on communities most in need of accessible health care, specifically people from ethnic minority backgrounds, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, older people (aged ≥65), and people living with disabilities [1,2]. Belonging to one or more of these groups (intersectionality) is a risk factor for experiencing more severe illness and mortality [3]. These same groups are likely to make up a large proportion of people vulnerable to health inequalities regardless of initial illness severity [4].
Health inequalities have been defined as “the systematic, avoidable and unfair differences in health outcomes that can be observed between populations, between social groups within the same population or as a gradient across a population ranked by social position” [5], but the term is also used for differences in access to health care, quality of care received, wider determinants of health such as housing and education, and opportunities to lead healthy lives, including differences in risky behaviors such as smoking [6]. The related term “health inequity” implies a normative judgement about the fairness or otherwise of these differences, “expressing a moral commitment to social justice,” as described by Kawachi et al [7]. For this review, we use the term health inequalities.
The digital divide—the gap between populations able to benefit from access to and use of health information and services online and populations unable to take up such opportunities—is a clear example of health inequality and exacerbates the inverse care law [8] such that digitally delivered health care runs the risk of excluding the people who could most benefit. This review seeks to address issues of social justice in the digital delivery of health care by providing a comprehensive overview of the literature on strategies to reduce the digital divide through the design and deployment aspects of digital health interventions.
The Digital Divide and Digital Health Literacy
Health literacy and digital literacy are both key determinants of health [9]. The term digital health literacy (also referred to as eHealth literacy) brings both literacies together to describe the degree to which individuals can access, understand, and apply digitally delivered health information and services to make informed decisions about their health. Importantly, digital health literacy extends beyond personal responsibility to encompass the responsibility of digital health systems and services to support and dynamically respond to the digital health literacy skills, and the confidence and motivation to develop such skills, in the populations they serve [10].
Digital health literacy competence fluctuates depending on context, but a clear link has been demonstrated between low digital health literacy and poor health outcomes [11]. The accelerated shift to digital health care to comply with social distancing measures arising from COVID-19 heightens the risk of poor health outcomes in digitally excluded groups and further complicates an already complex interplay between intersectionality and digital health literacy as a distributed, or outsourced , concept. For example, many older people may have the financial capital to afford digitally enabled devices and data plans but not the skills, motivation, or confidence to engage directly with such technology; instead, they may be reliant on their networks—family members, friends—to navigate digital health care on their behalf [12,13].
Digital health intervention design and deployment therefore need to be proportionate and prioritize those groups most affected by low digital health literacy on both individual and systemic levels via a two-pronged approach: first, to develop patients’ skills in accessing, understanding, and using digital health information and services, and second, to develop the digital health literacy responsiveness of the systems and health care professionals (HCPs) supporting digital health intervention deployment in practice. This review will have wider implications for research into digital health interventions and will address:
- The digital divide: How should digital health interventions be designed and deployed to mitigate the digital divide (eg, patient access to WiFi-enabled digital devices or subsidized data plans, the inclusiveness of recruitment methods for studies evaluating digital health interventions, strategies to increase uptake and use of a digital health intervention app by people from demographic groups likely to be affected by the digital divide, or the content of onboarding scripts used by HCPs when introducing patients to a digitally delivered health service)?
- Digital health literacy: How can app design and digital skills training be optimized to reduce digital health inequalities arising from low digital health literacy (eg, integration of user testing into the design process, readability of app content, gamification/social features to engage users, or support for HCPs to train as “digital health champions” as part of improving their own skills)?

Rationale for Conducting a Systematic Scoping Review
The decision to conduct a systematic scoping review rather than a systematic review is informed by the purpose of scoping reviews, which is to provide a comprehensive picture of the available evidence to guide further research. This purpose is of relevance to the study of digital health interventions because digital health intervention design and deployment is frequently captured in gray literature (eg, charity reports).
This review will be conducted using methods outlined by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Reviewers’ Manual [14] and will conform to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) [15]. The protocol for this review is based on the JBI framework by Peters et al [16] with further process updates from Levac et al [17] and is structured as follows: identification of the review aims and search questions, selection of evidence sources, charting of data extracted from the evidence sources, reporting of results, and consultation with stakeholders (including HCPs, digital health experts, and digital health intervention users). Results from this review will support decision-making when designing and deploying digital health interventions.
Review Question
The purpose of this systematic scoping review is to identify research that reports on the design and deployment of digital health interventions to reduce the digital divide and increase digital health literacy at macro- (national policy), meso- (national program), and micro- (localized or individual) levels [18]. It aims to do this by discovering peer-reviewed qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research, and gray literature relevant to mapping the contextual and process factors that enable or hinder engagement with digital health services by people vulnerable to the digital divide and individual or systemic low digital health literacy.
This review will seek to answer the review question, “What features of digital health intervention design and deployment enable or hinder engagement with digital health interventions by people from demographic groups likely to be affected by the digital divide?”
Health interventions are increasingly delivered through digital platforms, and it is important that they do not exacerbate or create health inequalities. Our hypothesis is that existing knowledge in the literature can inform our objective to find ways to bridge the digital divide and improve digital health literacy in underserved groups, for example, through digital health intervention design, development, and deployment.
Figure 1 outlines how this review will be conducted.
Figure 1. Systematic scoping review flow diagram. DHI: digital health intervention.
Methods
We will follow the methods recommended by the PRISMA-ScR framework [15].
Protocol Registration
At the time of writing, scoping reviews are ineligible for registration in PROSPERO. For transparency and to enable the systematic scoping review method outlined here to be repurposed for onward research, a summary of the protocol and any supplementary material will be registered with the Open Science Framework [19] and assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for long-term retrieval.
Eligibility Criteria
We will include primary research studies reporting on the design or deployment of digital health interventions that meet the following inclusion criteria.
Population
Adults from different demographic groups (defined based on gender, age, ethnicity, income, and education) in high-income and low-income countries.
Intervention
Digital health interventions are defined as any service intended to improve physical or mental health, or to promote health improvement through, for example, lifestyle change delivered digitally (formally or informally), such as via smartphone apps, social media, email, SMS text message, using wearable technologies, video games (eg, for motor or cognitive training), websites, or telehealth (eg, remote consultations) but excluding telemedicine if this consists solely of remote monitoring without any input from the patient [15].
Comparator
There may or may not be a comparator, depending on the study design.
Outcome
The primary outcome of interest is the capacity to mitigate the digital divide and increase digital health literacy either through the digital health intervention itself or its deployment. Health impact is not considered an outcome of interest for this review.
- “Mitigate the digital divide” refers to removing barriers to digital inclusion, for example, an intervention that provides free smartphones or tablets, or low-cost cellular data or WiFi for people with low incomes [10].
- “Increase digital health literacy” refers to digital skills development [9], either through the design of the digital health intervention or through programs to deploy the digital health intervention, resulting in higher levels or use or confidence in using the digital health interventions, measured either by interview or self-report (eg, the eHealth Literacy Scale questionnaire [20] or use data). Changes in these outcome measures suggest that both users and the health professionals administering the digital health intervention are confident in the use of digital resources for safe and sustainable self-management and to promote safe and sustainable self-management.

For the purposes of this review, gray literature covers conference abstracts and proceedings, white papers, and stakeholder reports (eg, by charities with an interest in digital literacy or who promote the health and well-being of people from different demographic groups) that enhance the contextual understanding of the field.
There will be no limitation by geography because lessons from low-income countries could inform strategies to reduce digital health inequities in high-income countries. We will report and interpret data within the context of the country where the study was based.
Limitations will be placed on user population and on study date. The user population will prioritize the marginalized demographics previously outlined; the study date will be limited to post-2011 (for preprint or publication) in recognition of the rapid change of pace in digital health intervention development [21]. No limitations will be placed on the study design or publication status. However, we will limit included studies to those published in English.
Decisions on whether data should be included or excluded from further analysis will be guided by criteria that, in line with a systematic application of scoping review method [16], will be iteratively refined based on increasing familiarity with the literature under review.
The use of the term digital health intervention is a possible challenge as it covers a range of digital health technologies [22] and may contribute to an imbalance in this review that favors comprehensiveness over precision. This will be addressed by working closely with information specialists to peer review the preliminary search strategy in line with the PRESS (Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies) procedure [23], ensuring a feasible and focused approach that is also flexible enough to be iteratively reworked in response to the results retrieved.
Evidence Sources
Reviews
A preliminary search for registered, preprint, or published systematic, scoping, and other review types will be conducted to pilot the search strategy, covering the following databases (via the Ovid interface, where applicable):
- Cochrane Library
- Epistemonikos
- NICE Evidence
- PROSPERO
- PubMed (with MEDLINE and Europe PMC)
- Trip

The preliminary search will provide keywords that can be incorporated into searches across evidence tiers below that of the gold standard represented by reviews. It will also serve to identify Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and PubMed IDs, which can be inserted into the Yale MeSH Analyzer [24] to extract further MeSH and to identify keywords to capture preprints not yet indexed with MeSH. A cap of 100 review articles will be applied in cases where unfeasible amounts of hits are retrieved.
Model papers for citation “ pearl-growing ”—papers already identified as highly relevant to this review—will be mined for their keywords and applied as test cases for honing the search strategy. Vernacular search terms will be identified from hand searching, including reference list scanning, forward/backward citation snowballing, and table of contents scanning of relevant journals online, such as the Journal of Medical Internet Research and its sister journals.
Further sources for other tiers of evidence include:
- Databases of peer-reviewed primary research (qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods studies):
* CINAHL
- EMBASE
- PsycINFO
- OTseeker
- PubMed

- Gray literature* Conference Proceedings Citation Index
- Health Management Information Consortium
- International HTA Database
- OpenGrey
- GreyNet
- The Grey Literature Report

The Grey Literature Report [25], available up to 2016, is a key source of gray literature that, unusually, is indexed using MeSH. It may be helpful in providing alternative MeSH to feed back into the search strand for peer-reviewed literature.
Alongside database searching, web searching will be conducted systematically, to the extent that this is feasible given that web searching is vulnerable to changing web content and algorithms [26]. Search terms will be used consistently between database and web searching and screen captures of content, and where available, DOIs will be saved for transparency. Web searching will also support the discovery of human-computer interaction (HCI) literature, which is not reliably indexed in MEDLINE. Searching the HCI literature will be helpful for the provision of further perspectives on design challenges (eg, designing for people with low vision or motor impairments).
Web Searching
The following databases will be used for the web searching: Google Scholar Basic Search UK, with use of the “Cited by” function (see Figure 2), for the first 100 results retrieved; MedNar Deep Web Search Engine, for the first 100 results retrieved; and Carrot2.
Targeted consultation with experts in digital health intervention design and deployment and digital health intervention users will also be conducted in parallel. This is part of the added value of scoping reviews. Ethics approval is not required for such consultation.

The following search strategy was used for PubMed (November 2021): ((“digital health” OR “digital health intervention*” OR “DHI” OR “digital rehabilitation”) OR “eHealth” OR “mHealth” AND (app OR intervention OR technology) AND (barrier* OR design OR disparit* OR divi* OR engage* OR exclu* OR inequ*)) AND literacy.
This search strategy will be modified by incorporating MeSH and keywords used to index relevant papers and will inform the search strings for parallel searching in Google Scholar Advanced Search UK and MedNar.
Screening of identified literature will follow the recommendations of the JBI [16]. Of the studies and gray literature initially identified from the searches, 25 publications will be selected at random by dividing the total by four (the number of screeners), then selecting every nth paper (where n=the total divided by four) to assign for double-screening of titles, abstracts, or full-text by four reviewers; if there is greater than 75% agreement for included/excluded publications, then the team will continue to screen all of the identified publications. If agreement is 75% or less, we will hold a further training session to resolve differences in interpretation of the criteria and, if necessary, tighten the wording. Further rounds of double-screening and calculation of interrater agreement will continue until we meet concordance. For included publications, study characteristics will be extracted by one author and checked for agreement by a second author, and any uncertainty over data retrieved will be discussed and resolved via consensus with all contributing authors. Retrieval of a model paper [27] served as the test case for the search strategy.
PRISMA-ScR
The PRISMA-ScR framework will be used to transparently record the selection, deduplication, and screening decision process, supplemented by updated recommendations from Tricco et al [28]. Gray literature may not be searchable by abstract (due to a lack of abstract fields in the gray literature discovery interfaces), so the PRISMA-ScR flow diagram will be adapted to accommodate this. Critical appraisal, for example, of the underlying evidence informing the studies retrieved, is not generally operationalized in scoping reviews [16]. Instead, the focus of this review type is on providing as complete a picture as possible of what is currently known about the topic of interest.
Data Extraction and Charting
Data will be extracted from full-text sources relevant to the review question using the JBI data extraction guidance for scoping reviews [14]. If required, missing data will be requested from authors. Google Sheets [29] will be used to record the initial data extraction of all included sources. In accordance with the iterative approach taken by scoping reviews, the following headers will be trialed and refined as needed [30]:
- Reference
- Region and setting of digital health intervention design/deployment
- Study type (qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, review)
- Funding source
- Stakeholder involvement
- Digital health intervention type
- Digital health intervention purpose
- User population
- Summary of results relevant to this review question

Collating, Summarizing, and Reporting Results
Unlike a systematic review—where evidence sources that do not meet the quality criteria applied are excluded—scoping reviews seek to present an overview of all material reviewed (including gray literature) [24]. We will summarize the results visually [30] to assist validation of the results by stakeholders (described in the following section) and later dissemination.
Consultation Exercise
In parallel with the aforementioned stages, consultation with stakeholders (eg, representatives from charities, experts in researching digital health interventions, and patients or members of the public) will be conducted to validate emerging results. Stakeholders will be identified both a priori (known to the authors) and iteratively as this review progresses (through their representation in relevant sources).
Results
This systematic scoping review is in progress. The final draft of this review will be submitted by September 2022. We expect to report a narrative summary of the findings of included peer-reviewed primary studies and gray literature that describe differences in the ability of people from different demographic groups or people with lower health literacy or digital health literacy to access and use digital health interventions, and any change in this following specific measures taken by the researchers to make digital health interventions more accessible and usable by people from these groups; and the results of qualitative studies that discuss barriers and facilitators to access and use digital health interventions by people from different demographic groups.
Discussion
This review will present a summary of evidence regarding strategies for optimizing the design and deployment of digital health interventions to mitigate the effects of the digital divide and low digital health literacy on populations disproportionately affected by health inequalities and the digital divide. Its results will inform the design and deployment of digital health interventions at a time when they are more used than ever before and will have wider implications for researchers and policy makers using digital health interventions for health improvement. For example, HCI strategies for developing content for websites and apps, such as use of personas with a range of demographic characteristics (including those of digitally excluded populations) [31,32] and use of video and audio to help people of low health literacy use digital health interventions [33].
In conclusion, this review is among the first to examine the design and deployment of digital health interventions specifically in the context of the challenges presented by the digital divide and low digital health literacy at individual and systemic levels. The results of this review will support researchers, digital health intervention developers, and HCPs in identifying what works to optimize digital health intervention design and deployment, with the aim of promoting social justice.

Abstract: Decision-making is one of the important deals in knowledge transfer and it can be useful for the multi-source domains. Meanwhile, the existing knowledge transfer schemes do not use privacy-preserving techniques for preserving security. This can be a problem for critical domains like financial market forecasting as the misuse of security can lead to legal and financial implications. In recent years, cloud services have revolutionized various technological applications. Cloud computing has become more popular with digital technologies as it provides uninterrupted services like transmission, storage, and intensive computing of data. The architecture of the cloud is also cost-efficient. Besides, various promising services from the cloud, some challenges need to be addressed to secure the privacy of the cloud users as millions of users access its services. Privacy preservation is an important aspect in the field of data mining, and the necessity of securing important data in the cloud from hackers is on the rise. Privacy-preserving data mining algorithms have been analyzed over recent years to provide sufficient solutions for securing the privacy of the data in the cloud. This paper plans to introduce a new hybrid meta-heuristic concept for developing a privacy preservation strategy towards business data under the cloud sector. The main objective of this paper is to design a new hybrid red deer-bird swarm algorithm (RD-BSA) to ensure higher convergence and since the use of control parameters over the solution generation is minimized. The proposed privacy preservation scheme on three financial databases is evaluated with the performance against the existing privacy preservation schemes. Different analyses like statistical, key sensitivity, Known-Plaintext Attack (KPA), and Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA) are used for evaluating the efficiency of the algorithm. The comparative analysis of the proposed model over the conventional models demonstrates its effective performance via diverse analysis.

Abstract: Particular emphasis is dedicated to Knowledge Management activities within the EURAD (European Joint Programme on Radioactive Waste Management) and PREDIS (Pre-disposal management of radioactive waste) projects to ensure the capture of existing knowledge, transfer of knowledge between Members States and management of the knowledge for future generations. The EURAD project has three work packages dedicated to knowledge management. One of them, the EURAD Guidance work package (WP12) is developing a comprehensive suite of specific guidance documents that can be used by Members States with radioactive waste management (RWM) programmes that are at an early stage of development but can be beneficial also to more advanced programmes. The PREDIS project does not have a specifically allocated work package for guidance development. Rather, such activities are integrated within deliverables produced as part of the Strategic Implementation and State of Knowledge actions of the Roadmap contributions on predisposal waste management. The EURAD guidance work is based on the existing PLANDIS guide on RD&D planning, developed by the Implementing Geological Disposal of Radioactive Waste Technology Platform (IGD-TP). The guidance documents complement other documents prepared in parallel knowledge management activities inside EURAD project: the State of Knowledge documents. The differentiation is that guidance documents explain in more detail how the process can be established and performed, including illustrative examples. The guides are self-standing documents and integrated with the EURAD Roadmap. The target end users of the guidance are primarily programme owners and managers (i.e., governments/administrations, Waste Management Organisations, Research Entities and Technical Support Organisations) responsible for planning and implementing the RWM programme and the supporting RD&D activities at a national level, even though they might also be of use and interest to other interested stakeholders, such as representatives of civil society. To produce a first list of prioritised topics for guidance documents with the aim to select a topic for a pilot guide, the Guidance WP has developed a screening process that includes review by experts and end users. Based on the priority list, the first pilot guide was developed with the title “Cost Assessment and Financing Schemes of Radioactive Waste Management Programmes”. Experience gained during the selection of topics for the pilot guide and during its production are being incorporated into the procedure for identification of new topics for which guides will be developed. First, the degree of coverage of the EURAD Roadmap themes by suitable guide documents will be analysed by the WP 12 team. The analysis will be combined with feedback from experts verifying the needs for missing guides. Finally, the potential end user community representatives will be given the opportunity to comment on the prioritisation of selected guidance documents and make additional suggestions. The potential end users stay involved also during the production of the guides. This procedure aims to optimise the scarce expert resources in relation to the identified needs of guidance documents. This article explains the approach for selecting topics for guidance documents and the results obtained both in EURAD and PREDIS.

Full text: 1. Introduction
Radioactive waste management (RWM) consists of a large multidisciplinary set of different tasks covering all administrative and operational activities involved in the handling, pre-treatment, treatment, conditioning, transport, storage and disposal of radioactive waste. Typically, RWM has a large time span overarching many decades. These characteristics of the RWM promote the importance of a systematic approach to identify, manage, share knowledge, and enable groups of people to create new knowledge collectively to help achieve safe management of radioactive waste. Activities ensuring this systematic approach are known as knowledge management.
Knowledge management (KM) – including knowledge consolidation – is recognized as a key part of the RWM implementation process and has gained increasing interest in the past 10 years.
The main reasons for the importance of KM are the RW disposal implementation time, spanning several decades, and the complexity and variety of disciplines involved. Each individual phase of a RWM programme from waste generation through processing, disposal, and repository closure, requires continuous RD&D development with improved process understanding.
EURAD supports the implementation of the Waste Directive in EU Member-States, considering the various stages of advancement of national programmes. National RWM programmes across Europe cover a broad spectrum of stages of development, inventories, and level of advancement, particularly with respect to their plans and national policy towards implementing geological disposal.
The PREDIS project targets the development and implementation of activities for pre-disposal treatment of radioactive waste streams other than nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. It is possible to identify several roles which the KM could cover, but within the scope of the project they are closest linked to the technical work package development for characterisation and processing waste streams, as well as waste acceptance criteria (WAC) issues. The long-time span addressed by WM programmes is bringing the need for trans-generation knowledge transfer in all phases of implementation, from pre-disposal through disposal. Another role is to manage effective knowledge transfer inside the multi-disciplinary programmes. The KM is applied to knowledge transfer between different actors within a program or transfer between national RWM programmes themselves. Both EURAD and PREDIS are reactive and responsive while developing ideas for the KM and networking needs of their partner and stakeholder communities.
The KM activities are integrated with technical and strategic activities. This allows KM to benefit from the huge pool of expertise existing within the EURAD programme.
An example of an important programme output which is used not only inside the EURAD project is the EURAD Roadmap [1]. The EURAD Roadmap was prepared as a representation of a generic RWM programme that shall enable users and programmes to orient themselves in the whole area of RWM. The content is focused on what knowledge, and competencies (including infrastructure) is considered most critical for implementation of RWM, aligned to the EURAD Vision and to the EURAD Strategic Research Agenda. The EURAD Roadmap provides detailed information about themes, subthemes and domains and is an efficient tool to map different activities inside a RWM programme.
The Roadmap enables different activities to be linked to the overall RWM process. This addressing provides easier orientation for potential users when they are searching for information on how to start or manage particular activities, taking into account the current best practices.
In the PREDIS project all these items are covered by one work package (WP3), whilst inside the EURAD project there are three different work packages. In EURAD, one team collects existing information (WP11), the second one (WP12) prepares information on how to carry out RWM activities and the third one (WP13) deals with training and networking. The detailed description of the organizational arrangement of knowledge management inside EURAD is given in parallel articles [2–4].
The subject of this article is experience of preparation of guidance documents that are useful for national RWM programs.
In that sense, it is important to identify potential end-users’ groups:
* –
the first group consist of end-users who need to start (or substantially change) a disposal programme implementation. This end-user group is characterized by low experience in a particular area. For this group it is important to get basic orientation. The exchange and sharing of knowledge between advanced programmes and newcomers to the topics is typical. Positive and even negative (if available) examples may be effective but should not be used without taking into account national circumstances. Guides targeted to this end-user are more general, usually covering broad subjects.
* –
End-users who need to manage knowledge in a relatively narrow area, usually within an established framework, are typical for the second group. Guides for this group are more detailed in a narrow topic. The level of detail and variance in national circumstances often make it difficult to provide guidance that is valid for multiple programmes.
With respect to the nature of the Joint European Programme end-users in organizations at an early stage of the RWM programme were approached to facilitate sharing and transfer of knowledge on “how-to do” different activities in RWM.
Needs are identified from a combination of identification of gaps using the Roadmap and Experts (top-down), and specific needs raised directly by the wider community of stakeholders (bottom-up). This has been done either via surveying the KM needs and gaps among organisations or by listing prioritised topics where gaps exist, or information is not sufficient.
2. Method
2.1. Selection of pilot guide
Within the EURAD Guidance Work Package (WP12), activities aim to develop a comprehensive suite of instructional guidance documents that can be used by various stakeholders in any country with RWM programmes, regardless of their status in geological disposal implementation.
The goals of the guidance documents are (a) to share existing experience and lessons learned and to assist transfer of knowledge towards Member States with early-stage RWM programmes, as well as (b) transfer of knowledge between generations. Both goals are objectives of EURAD’s Vision [5].
Guidance documents can facilitate orientation in the field itself (existing knowledge resources and existing international cooperation and networking) as well as to foster understanding different solutions in different cases and countries.
The main priority of the Guidance WP has been to identify a list of the most needed and prioritised topics of guidance documents from which a topic for a pilot guide could be selected. This included considering topics where there is access (within EURAD) to suitable experts from Member States with an Advanced Programme (AP) who could contribute to the Guidance development.
A pilot guide was compiled to test the guidance development process (and the quality management procedure). The EURAD Roadmap Advisory Committee consisting of experts from AP, proposed areas where expert knowledge of programme history would provide useful strategic guidance to new or early stages programmes. The short list consisted of the following topics:
* funding and financing aspects of radioactive waste disposal.
* Optimization of disposal of radioactive waste.
* Derivation of requirements for the disposal system.
* Waste Acceptance Criteria (reserve).
The Guidance WP team finally proposed the topic of ‘Funding and Financing Aspects of Radioactive Waste Disposal’ (Domain 1.3.1 [1]) to be developed as a pilot guide as the time and the readiness of resources for its timely development was assessed as reasonable.
2.2. Developing further guidance
For future guides to be developed in EURAD the simplified approach – implemented for selecting the topic of the pilot guide – will be complemented by following two strategies, the top-down and bottom-up approach. The bottom-up approach at EURAD level means that the selection process is carried out based on the EURAD Roadmap and the needs for further guidance are identified by the systematic evaluation of the themes, sub-themes and domains. This is implemented using input from the available literature, from experts who have experience from the implementation process and feedback from the potential end-users.
The top-down approach means that experts (selected based on their experience and knowledge accumulated in their respective fields of activities) identify where guidance is needed but not available.
Based on the result of this activity and the ongoing evaluation of end user needs and feedback, the approved list of prioritised topics will be regularly updated as a ‘living document’.
Analysis of existing guidance literature
The mapping started by establishing a starting reference point related to the mapping of the available guidance and guide-like technical documents, through a detailed literature search of:
* international regulation documents (ICRP and WENRA);
* international guides (IAEA);
* international guide-like technical documents (IAEA, OECD NEA, EC Projects);
* national guides;
* national guide-like technical documents.
Other main sources for the mapping have been EURAD partners’ courses and international nuclear entities.
Open web was searched to complete the “big picture” of geological disposal materials.
Based on the survey it was concluded that although the available technical documents and guidance are numerous, early-stage programmes or small inventory programmes often face a challenge of information overload and deciphering which sources of information are most accurate and most recent, thus the guidelines aim at providing concise references to orient the reader.
Selection criteria
For selecting guidance topics some basic criteria were defined, clearly linked to and coherent with the EURAD founding documents (Vision document [5], EURAD Roadmap [1] and Strategic Research Agenda [6]):
* interaction with EURAD WPs: are there any outputs from EURAD already available to be used for guidance development? How and to what extent are they used?
* clearly demonstrate European-added value (improved information and knowledge transfer between national programmes and across generations);
* be meaningful, focused and manageable;
* is that any identified guidance gap;
* each contribution should bring complementarity (avoid duplication, keep clear of disconnected, spread or repeated contributions);
* responsive to the end-users needs and expectations (effectively assists the targeted end-users in their programme implementation, i.e. be need-driven);
* importance (it should be evaluated how big an area of the Roadmap is covered by the topic, which more or less correlates with the aspect of how significant a role the given topic has in RWM programme implementation);
* urgency in terms of programme implementation stage (in what stage of RWM programme development should the guidance be implemented, when should the guidance on the given topic be ready for the target end-users);
* expertise (how much expertise is necessary for the development of the given topic outside from Guidance WP, or outside from EURAD);
* length of development (based on the preliminary assumptions how lengthy could the process of development of the guide be).
There are multiple options of materials available for selection that potentially meet the selection criteria and the guidance will be used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the options. One may want to create early buy-in amongst a wider range of end-users by engaging them in the selection and development process. There is a longer time frame for the decision-making process that allows for a more thorough selection process.
Topic selection
On the basis of this long list the Guidance WP team members prepared some topic proposals. The short list consists of the following topics:
* 1.
using the safety assessment as a tool to derive requirements for the disposal system elements;
* 2.
role of implementer in planning and managing repository development programme;
* 3.
developing strategy for data management and preservation of records and knowledge in the context of radioactive disposal programme;
* 4.
using the safety case (and safety functions) to prioritize geological disposal RD&D plans;
* 5.
developer/implementer and regulator interactions during the planning, siting, engineering design, RD&D and construction of disposal facilities;
* 6.
managing interactions in multidisciplinary teams (engineers, geoscientists, sociologists; physicists; modellers, lawyers etc.);
* 7.
establishing and managing programme requirements and how these need to be is linked to the findings of the RD&D programme;
* 8.
developing the design basis for a geological repository;
* 9.
assessing the acceptability of site conditions for the location of a geological repository;
* 10.
characterization of high-level waste at different management stages.
The list was evaluated against predefined selection criteria based on the expert judgement of the Guidance team members in a qualitative and semi-quantitative way.
Each team member could score the topic proposals and the results were discussed at the WP web-meeting. It was emphasised that for any guidance document it shall be ensured that it provides an added value to the target end-users (needs driven) in an area, which is not covered by existing guidance (avoid duplication). Feedback from the potential end-users will also be sought for prioritization suggested topics. Final list of selected topics will be approved by EURAD General Assembly.
After having the topic for the guides approved, experts with relevant experience in the given area will be selected to assist the Guidance WP team in the elaboration of the guidance.
Further guides will be elaborated in current EURAD project in collaboration with experts with experience on the given topic (who ‘have done it before’). Experts from countries with different status of geological disposal implementation are going to work together, which will create a network of experts (effectively contributing to knowledge transfer at EURAD level).
In the case of the PREDIS project, guidance development so far has been especially focussed in one specific topical area for Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC). This has been dealt with using the goal of developing a suite of guidance documents for (i) the selection of optimal methods for the determination of WAC parameters, (ii) principles and procedures regarding the qualification of waste forms for storage/disposal, and (iii) formulation of generic WAC whenever a disposal system has been missing. Information about national experience collected from a number of countries worldwide [7] is being converted into a set of practical advice on establishing the mentioned aspects of a national waste acceptance system. There are also additional guidance documentations that will be part of other technical deliverables within the work packages addressing treatment and processing of waste. However, these are not stand-alone documents within the Knowledge Management part of the PREDIS structure. The format of guidance for PREDIS is more incorporated into the overall knowledge management that is provided through training tools, such as Domain Insights, case studies of best practices and lecture materials that target specific issues in predisposal waste management that are not already covered by other sources, such as the IAEA e-learning modules and Wiki.
3. EURAD guideline production
The EURAD Guidance team adopted the Quality Management Procedure for Guidance Development [8] where the quality principles and procedures to be taken into consideration while producing and updating guidance documents for RD&D activities in RWM are outlined. The aim of such a procedure is to set the requirements for a quality management system targeted at production of any guide document to ensure quality, inclusiveness and transparency during its elaboration, further improvement, and implementation. Among others this includes:
* quality assurance (QA) criteria for elaboration of RD&D Guides to be developed in the framework of WP 12,
* quality requirements how RD&D Guides should be developed, maintained and used according to the QA criteria,
* consultation and review process during the development of the RD&D Guides.
3.1. QA criteria for production/update of guidance documents
Few norms specify how quality, inclusiveness and transparency is assured in a guidance document. Especially, the criteria for selection of authors and guidance production are considered to be relevant for the development of any RD&D guide within EURAD.
3.1.1. The competencies of authors
The authors should have experience and competence for the development of particular guidance document, in line with the scientific area the given guide covers. It is an important quality criterion that the authors of any RD&D guides should have wide experiences and highly qualified competencies to the covered topic.
The authors can be experts having wide experience in RD&D planning, individuals, representing WMO responsible for the development of RD&D plans and Technical Support Organisations (TSO), involved in the reviewing process of these plans and Research Entities (RE), involved in the execution of RD&D activities. End-users of RD&D Guides from early-stage programmes and small inventory programmes participating in disposal should be involved in the drafting process of the RD&D Guides as well.
3.1.2. Procedure for selection of authors
The procedure of selection of authors for a given RD&D guide should be compatible with the general EURAD rules and it would apply within the Guidance work package.
3.1.3. Guidance production criteria
The guidance production criteria have been developed from a list of the scope of criteria for evaluating the overall EURAD Programme and are given in EURAD Quality Management Plan (QMP) [8]. Most important are:
* to support the overall EURAD Roadmap [1], EURAD Vision document [5] (and also Strategic Research Agenda [6]),
* to be ambitious, creative, innovative, and address key needs of End Users with Programmes in Early Stage and with Small Inventories,
* to reach a major impact of the RD&D area of the procedures at relevant phases,
* to systematically outline the set of activities to be implemented,
* to demonstrate procedures intended to be used to attain the stated objectives,
* to describe clearly how appropriate they are for the planned activity and their feasibility,
* to identify the most significant steps to achieving the stated objectives and explain how these will be addressed,
* to show clearly how meaningful and independent peer review can be integrated within the overall implementation plan on a timely basis.
3.1.4. Lessons learned on QA from pilot guide development
As there is an expectation of the highest quality of guidance, the process of its development shall comply with all quality assurance requested in the “EURAD Quality Management Plan” [8] and the “Quality Management Procedure for Guidance Development” [4]. The guidance selection process also must comply with the “Approved list of prioritized topics for further guidance documents and selection process of one topic for the development of a pilot guide” [9].
The quality management procedure consists of the requirements for a quality management system on guides production with special emphasis on the quality assurance criteria, quality requirements on guides development and utilisation. The high importance is given to the reviewing process during the guide production.
The whole process must be performed in a close cooperation with the EURAD Chief Scientific Officer, Bureau/PMO and the Editorial Board, ensuring a thorough review process, transparency in guides topics selection and a requested quality of guidance content. All selected topics must be approved by these EURAD governance bodies and EURAD General Assembly members.
3.2. Guidance production procedure
Development and approval of a guide is performed in several steps. These steps include initiation, drafting, peer review, finalization, approval and “socialization”.
At the “Initiation” step the Terms of Reference (ToR) is developed by WP12 team and approved by Bureau/PMO. The ToR defines the whole process of development of the guide, including topic justification and selection based on the performed gap analyses and the interest from the target end users. In the ToR there is clear definition of the scope of the guide, the timeline, responsibilities (and their distribution between authors, reviewers, other experts and end-users), requirements in volume and contents, etc. In this step special attention is devoted to the clarification of tasks for the individual authors, confirmation of the guide development schedule and organization of a kick-off meeting(s) between the authors.
At the “Drafting” step, detailed development of structure and contents of the guide is completed with identification of reliable and trusted sources of information (e.g. IAEA, EC and international projects, IGD-TP, SITEX Network, EURADSCIENCE). The writing of the guide is performed based on the collection of information from the identified sources according to the established structure and contents of the guide. In the ToR the supporting experts’ team and end-users are identified and consulted to incorporate their feedback. Finally, draft guide is submitted to Bureau/PMO for peer review.
The “Peer review” step includes independent review of the draft guide organized by Bureau/PMO (including selection of reviewers) and submission of Bureau/PMO feedback to the development team.
The “Finalization” step comprises of revision of the guide according to comments and recommendations received from the peer review, agreement of finalized guide by Guidance WP and submission of finalized guide to Bureau/PMO for approval. At the “Approval” step the final checking the management of reviewer comments or statements by Bureau/PMO and approval of the guide by Bureau/PMO is done. During the “Socialization” step distribution of the guide among Communities of Practice (CoP) is performed including the collection of feedback to be used for future revision.
3.3. Consultation, incorporation of feedbacks and final reviews
Consultation with experts and target end-users during the development of a guidance document can bring significant inputs to the deliverable and as a result, can increase its quality. Consultations with PMO representatives/coordinators on the objectives and scope of the given Guide is important to be in line with the general expectations of EURAD. Consultation can be organized especially with Bureau (College representatives), end-users representatives or other EURAD WPs including KM WPs.
When a guidance document is developed in such details that the usability and applicability (whether the document meets the pre-defined goals) can be tested, the feedback from some potential end-users can be asked. Potential end-users of guidance documents can be representative of mandated actors (WMO, TSO, RE) from Advanced Stage Programme (AP), from Early-stage Programme (ESP), from Small Inventory Programme (SIMP) Member States in line with the scope and topic of the given guide. The potential ways of obtaining feedback concerning a draft guide could include asking independent views about the applicability of the given guide, organizing events for the end-users to identify collective viewpoints, compiling questionnaires for dedicated topics.
4. Pilot guide and lessons learned
4.1. Objectives of the pilot guide
The first guide produced (pilot guide) was on “Costing and Funding” for implementation of a radioactive waste disposal [10].
Cost estimations are needed for all projects, programmes and operations. Information on this topic is abundant, and guidance on various approaches and methods is widely available. However, the estimation of the costs of disposal programmes remains challenging due to their complex and societally sensitive nature and long implementation periods, and practical guidance on this issue remains insufficient.
Countries that are just starting to develop their disposal programmes and which have little or no experience in this area may have difficulties in finding the relevant advice on how to perform cost estimations. This guide aims to describe the cost estimation process specifically focusing on radioactive waste disposal programmes, and to provide practical advice on how to conduct this process to result in a consistent, reliable and well-documented cost estimation.
The guide suggests a stepwise approach to costing to make the whole process more transparent and easier to manage. The steps are interdependent and logically cover all the important phases in the cost estimation from defining the purpose and scope of the estimate, selecting the method and obtaining the input data, to performing the cost estimation and the consideration of, including suitable approach to, addressing cost uncertainties and risks management.
The guide also addresses possible mechanisms for financing disposal of radioactive waste. Since details on various financial mechanisms can be found in a number of documents this guide describes only the financing of RWM activities from a pre-collected fund, which is the most commonly applied method.
The intended end-users of this guide include primarily waste management organisations (WMO) or designated organisations if no WMO has yet been established in small inventory programme and early-stage programme countries (including countries that are initiating a new-build nuclear programme), which are, in most cases, responsible for conducting the cost calculations for their respective national programmes. The guide may also be beneficial for those entities (ministries, regulatory bodies and/or their technical support organisations) responsible for reviewing the cost calculations or those obliged to implement the “polluter pays” principle (e.g., waste generators).
The target audience may also include project managers and costing experts (who establish, revise and justify estimations) and those entities which are responsible for financing the national RWM programme.
4.2. Scope of the pilot guide
The guide focuses primarily on the cost assessment methodology for geological disposal, but with certain adaptations it can also be applied to near-surface or borehole disposal programmes since the principles are the same and, from this perspective, the guide may also be beneficial for small inventory disposal programmes.
The report provides general guidance on developing a cost estimation for radioactive waste disposal programmes, including more detailed advice on using a structured approach.
Initially, the guide explains the necessary prerequisites and boundary conditions for the disposal programme and its cost estimation, and emphasises the importance of a national RWM policy and national RWM programme, the existence of a national legislative framework and waste inventory, stakeholder engagement, etc.
The guide provides a brief description of each of these steps including information on additional literature that contains more detailed information.
In the guide the cost assessment of the disposal programme is described as a process consisting of several steps, starting with defining the purpose of the cost estimation, the scope of the work and the timing of activities included in the estimation, selecting the appropriate method for cost estimation, and preparing the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) as a framework for a detailed cost estimation. After performing the cost estimation, the process also includes the analysis of uncertainties and risks in cost assessment and provisions for addressing them as well as thorough documenting of the whole process to provide traceability and performing an independent review of cost estimate to establish confidence in the estimate.
In the guide each of these steps is briefly described and wherever possible additional guidance referring to geological disposal provided. Specific attention is given to the development of the WBS as an essential and practical tool for performing the detailed cost assessment. Based on several disposal programmes and their respective WBSs an attempt was made to summarize the approaches and develop a more generic WBS for geological disposal that would be useful for countries and organisations that have just embarked upon or plan to launch the cost estimation process in the near future.
Similarly, when considering the uncertainties and risks in cost estimation of the disposal programme, the guide provides information on the most common uncertainties and risks in geological disposal (GD) programmes and suggests how they might be addressed.
The guide emphasises that the cost estimation is an iterative process that requires regular updates and improvements in the input data, as well as transparency and quality assurance in the cost assessment process and the data and information management systems.
4.3. Benefits for users of the pilot guide
Potential users of the guide may find beneficial the presentation of a practical example of how the work scope of the geological disposal programme could be broken down into smaller, meaningful elements and hierarchically organised in the form of a WBS, and a discussion on the possible cost uncertainties and risks related to the various WBS elements of geological disposal programmes.
The presentation of selected lessons learnt and experience obtained from the cost estimation processes in a number of national programmes may also be helpful for gaining a better understanding of the process.
The potential users may also find very useful several examples of cost estimations for various aspects of the disposal programme from different countries (e.g., Hungary, Slovenia, Czech Republic) that are included in Appendices as illustrations of how cost estimations are performed in practice.
4.4. Lessons learned
The crucial aspect of the guide production process is a mutual interaction with potential end users which can ensure a complementarity of selected topics and end users needs on guides development. With respect to this, the first short priority list of selected topics developed by WP12 has been communicated with a group of potential end users what provided a valuable contribution to the WP12 team when selecting topic for pilot guide.
Within the process of guidance development, an interaction with international entities is recommended (e.g., the IAEA and NEA) with special emphasis on already published or planned guides. Also, other relevant documents (technical, strategical, methodological, etc.) from publicly accessible sources has been considered and evaluated during a gap analysis leading to the topics selection.
This approach has been consistently applied within pilot guide topics selection and its subsequent development. The feasibility of the guide production process from a technical point of view and the expected timescale has been demonstrated, thus the process can be applied for the next guide production. In addition to the urgency criterion, the accessibility of the experts contributing to the guides must be seriously taken into account when selecting the next topics for guide production. With respect to the demanded experts limited availability, the EURAD cooperation with PREDIS can be highly recommended for planning further RD&D programmes as both projects have available large spectrum of experts.
5. Conclusions
EURAD as a European Joint Programme in the field of RWM research is managing three Knowledge Management WPs (WP11, WP12 and WP13) contributing to the expected KM goals. Within PREDIS, there is one KM WP (WP3) for all KM, closely working with other PREDIS WPs. During implementation of both projects, we begin to coordinate our activities to avoid potential duplication (e.g. EURAD WP12 excluded guide on waste acceptance criteria from its list as it is foreseen in PREDIS activities). The initial informal coordination was developed to more formalized form as EURAD and PREDIS representatives signed Joint Statement on knowledge management in 2021 [11].
EURAD WP12 is contributing to the KM through developing a comprehensive suite of instructional guidance documents that can be used by every interested end user involved in the RWM programmes, preferably those in early stage of its implementation and/or dealing with small inventory, but guidance documents developed within WP12 could be beneficial for advanced programmes as well.
KM should represent an integral part of all RWM programmes in order to support their efficient establishment and successful implementation during all programme phases. The main goal is dedicated to the knowledge enhancement and transfer between involved stakeholders/institutions, possibly between national RWM programmes and, in particular over generation to contribute to the RWM programme sustainability. KM should be considered already from the phase of conceptual planning of the programme. It needs to be implemented as soon as feasible to be an integral part of radioactive waste disposal implementation process.
The necessity of KM integration into RMW programmes, including RD&D, is also identified through the EURAD Founding documents (EURAD Roadmap [1], Vision Document [5], Strategic Research Agenda [6], Deployment Plan [12]), in the field of radioactive waste disposal and complemented with PREDIS KM strategy dedicated to the pre-disposal activities.
The produced pilot Guide on Cost Assessment and Financing Schemes of Radioactive Waste Management aims to fill identified gap and orient the early stages RWM programmes including those programmes dealing with small inventories on how to plan budget activities with special impact on radioactive waste disposal. This pilot guide may contribute to the learning process on costing strategy and methodology as well as on establishing and operating a funding scheme. The experience gained during the drafting of the pilot guide can serve as a sound basis for the development of further guides the topics of which will be defined based on a systematic and transparent selection process.

Abstract: Cancer is a leading cause of death globally, and the incidence is expected to increase to 28.4 million cases by 2040. Precision oncology seeks to address this challenge through the identification and application of biomarkers to personalize treatment in a genomics-based, biomarker-driven approach. In this thesis, I aimed to comprehensively analyze the genomic impact of cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy, both of which are genotoxic and expected to leave a mutational footprint in the cancer genome. By integration with comprehensive clinical data, I assessed the prognostic and predictive value of the signatures identified. My thesis has a strong focus on diffuse gliomas, the most common and aggressive type of brain tumors in adults, which have a poor prognosis despite intensive multimodal treatment. Standard therapy for diffuse gliomas includes surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. I started by examining the genomic impact of the alkylating agent temozolomide in gliomas, and subsequently analyzed the genomic effects of radiotherapy in a pancancer setting. Following the genomic analyses, I investigated the longitudinal nongenetic changes in gliomas associated with TMZ-associated hypermutation and RTassociated deletion signatures. To potentially overcome translational barriers in cancer, I propose the use of spontaneous canine gliomas as a potential model for preclinical and translational science to facilitate the knowledge transfer into clinical practice. I conclude by discussing these findings, focusing on the potential to integrate them into a precision oncology framework and identify novel therapeutic avenues. The use of next-generation sequencing technology and comprehensive molecular characterization have facilitated diagnostic advances in the field of gliomas, including the use of molecular markers and the updated WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System. These advances have yet to be translated into successful treatment strategies. My analyses provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of treatment resistance and open future opportunities for biomarker-guided treatment strategies as part of a precision oncology approach.

In dieser Arbeit habe die genomischen Auswirkungen von Chemo- und Strahlentherapie umfassend analysiert. Bei diesen genotoxischen Therapien ist es zu erwarten, dass sie Mutationen im Krebsgenom hinterlassen. Durch die Integration mit klinischen Daten habe ich den prognostischen und prädiktiven Wert der identifizierten Signaturen erfasst. Der Schwerpunkt meiner Arbeit lag auf diffusen Gliomen, der häufigsten und aggressivsten Form von Hirntumoren bei Erwachsenen, die trotz intensiver multimodaler Behandlung eine schlechte Prognose haben. Die Standardtherapie für diffuse Gliome umfasst eine Operation, Strahlentherapie und Chemotherapie. Zunächst habe ich die genomischen Auswirkungen der alkylierenden Substanz Temozolomid bei Gliomen untersucht und anschließend analysierte ich die genomischen Auswirkungen der Strahlentherapie in einem Krebsentitäts-übergreifenden Datensatz. Im Anschluss an die genomischen Analysen untersuchte ich die longitudinalen nicht-genetischen Veränderungen in Gliomen, die mit zuvor identifizierten genomischen Biomarkern einhergehen. Um translationale Barrieren in der Krebsforschung zu überwinden, schlage ich die potentielle Verwendung von spontanen Hundegliomen als Modell für die präklinische und translationale Wissenschaft vor, um den Wissenstransfer in die klinische Praxis zu erleichtern. Abschließend erörtere ich diese Ergebnisse und setze dabei einen besonderen Fokus auf das Potenzial, sie in einen präzisionsonkologischen Ansatz zu integrieren und neue therapeutische Wege zu erörtern. Der Einsatz der NGSTechnologie und eine umfassende molekulare Charakterisierung haben diagnostische Fortschritte auf dem Gebiet der Gliome ermöglicht, einschließlich der Verwendung molekularer Marker und der aktualisierten WHO-Klassifikation von ZNS-Tumoren. Diese Fortschritte sind bisher noch nicht in erfolgreiche Behandlungsstrategien umgesetzt worden. Meine Analysen liefern wertvolle Einblicke in die molekularen Mechanismen der Therapieresistenz und eröffnen künftige Möglichkeiten für Biomarker-gesteuerte Behandlungsstrategien als Teil eines präzisionsonkologischen Ansatzes.

Abstract: Purpose: As older adults are increasingly active in virtual communities (VCs), these platforms for knowledge exchange present opportunities for companies to use elder human capital. The purpose of this study is to understand the antecedent factors that motivate older adults’ knowledge contribution and knowledge seeking (KS) behaviors in VCs. Design/methodology/approach: Rooted in socio-emotional selectivity and social cognitive theories, this study included five key variables and developed models for older adults’ knowledge contributing (KC)/KS behaviors. This paper tested the hypotheses using data from a sample of 204 older adults in 3 VCs in China. Findings: The results provide support for most of the hypotheses and show that while other members’ participation (MP) acts as a substitute for meaning in life and attitude toward aging, it acts as a complement for outcome expectations (OE) focused on others and OE focused on oneself in their impacts on KC/KS activities. Practical implications: The study provides practical insights for developing elder human resources via VCs to avoid knowledge loss. Originality/value: This study described older adults’ unique characteristics when modeling their information and communication technologies-related behaviors and built two models to explain their KC/KS behaviors. It confirmed that the same factor has different levels of impact on older adults’ KC/KS behaviors in VCs. In addition, it confirmed and reinforced the complementary and substitutive effects of other MP as an environmental factor on these behaviors.

Abstract: Universities have been perceived for several decades as an important development factor in the space that shapes the regional environment throughout the generation of new knowledge or technologies and the production of human capital. Our paper focuses on the less researched phenomenon of academic engagement, and thus, the development of university knowledge transfer based on interpersonal links between researchers and application actors from an academic perspective. This empirical study evaluates the results of a nationwide survey of academic researchers devoted to unhiding various aspects of formal and informal cooperation on an interpersonal basis. Using an econometric approach, the study investigates determinants of academic engagement of individual researchers and describes patterns of formal and informal ties between academics and businesses. The results explain which researchers participate in academic engagement activities and elaborate on the motivations and barriers of university–industry cooperation at the level of the individual. We also identified a significant volume of informal dissemination of knowledge of universities in the space via various channels.

Full text: 1. Introduction
The academic engagement and university–industry relationships can be traced back to the 19th century (Geuna and Muscio 2009). Since the emergence of the concept of “knowledge-based economy” and the following concept of the “third academic revolution”, universities have been even more expected to contribute to economic and technology growth (Geuna 1999). Concerning academic research on the topic, the endogenous growth theory (Lucas 1988; Romer 1990; Grossman and Helpman 1991), the “National Systems of Innovation” approach (Freeman 1987; Lundvall 1992; Nelson 1993; Wiyono and Wu 2022), or the introduction of the Tripple-Helix model (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 1995; Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000) had discussed the university role in supporting the emergence of innovation in the external (non-academic) environment and established a framework for understanding the role of basic research on economic growth and highlighted the human capital dimension of the technological progress. Coming out of the open innovation paradigm, enterprises are pushed to keep their innovation process open to the external environment in order to be more competitive (Mansfield 1995; Vidal et al. 2022). On the other hand, since the last decades of the 20th century, universities have been pushed to compensate for the shortening of the public financing of the academic sector and proposed to meet the new expectations to contribute to the technology growth in national economies via utilisation of produced knowledge (Veugelers and Del Rey 2014).
At this point, it is necessary to repeatedly state that a university, due to its nature, can be considered as a very open institution binding multiple kinds of potential carriers of academic knowledge (university management, researchers, research groups, students, etc.) which makes results of academic research, as Acs and Plummer (2005) state, inherently difficult to protect. As knowledge crosses the boundaries of its source, one person can think of something and the other can utilize it (Baptista and Mendonça 2009). The “commercialization” of the knowledge concept involving the patenting and licensing of inventions as well as academic entrepreneurship (Markman et al. 2008), represents the utilisation of formal transfer channels to be relatively complex—explicit knowledge from a university to an external environment while the transfer process is under full control of the university. On the other hand, the concept of so-called “academic engagement” highlights that part of knowledge diffusion from an academic environment (using both the formal and informal transfer channels) happens on the basis of interpersonal linkages between an enterprise and an individual researcher (Cohen et al. 2002).
Even though university–industry collaborations (UIC) have been intensively researched mainly from the point of view of success determinants, organizational factors and from the point of view of applied commercialization models (Koria et al. 2022), we know less about the importance of interpersonal ties between individual researchers and companies for the development of technology transfers and academic businesses (Perkmann et al. 2013). Rothaermel et al. (2007) first mentioned that research on UIC neglected the analysis of individual researchers’ involvement in the process. Filippetti and Savona (2017) still state that the individual nature of collaborations and individual determinants of academic entrepreneurship were largely neglected by academics. As uncovered by Perkmann et al. (2013), most of the studies focusing directly on the interaction between researchers and businesses uncovered that academic engagement as an activity, or intention of a researcher is selective and differentiated according to sex, age, seniority and academic standing of the scholar.
Therefore, our intention will be to better understand the ways of academic knowledge dissemination through interpersonal ties. Specifically, given the gaps in knowledge outlined above, we will focus on clarifying the determinants of their emergence, while the individual aspects of the academic will be at the centre of our attention. From a conceptual point of view, we based our research framework on the contribution of Perkmann et al. (2013), who summarized that academic engagement is driven by individual, organizational and institutional factors. Following Filippetti and Savona (2017), however, we will be particularly interested in the, so far, less researched individual factors, mainly concerning the productivity of individuals and their networking, or rooting in the private sector that can also play a vital role in explaining academic engagement due to other studies (Gulbrandsen and Thune 2017). Our data allow us to clarify the practices of academic engagement in a wider context through the assessment of motives and barriers, which complement our analysis of determinants. By describing the channels of knowledge dissemination, we will in turn contribute to a topic that has resonated for decades in the literature without detailed answers. It is the informal dissemination of academic knowledge, whose trajectories and dynamics are difficult to describe, as in the conditions of many universities, that is perceived as an activity “behind the back” of the university (D’Este and Patel 2007). The following research questions arise from the identified gaps:
- What motivates academic researchers to participate in academic engagement activities and what barriers to the development of inter-personal linkages with entrepreneurs do they perceive in the conditions of the country relatively slowly adapting university third mission policies and practices?

- What differences in the frequency of formal and informal ties between academics and enterprises emergence can be identified?

- Are academics’ decisions to participate in academic engagement activities influenced by their level of productivity, access to financial resources for science and research, previous experience and networking?



We also argue that the Slovak example of these relationships is excellent for exploring the ways of informal cooperation, given the specific pathway of development of knowledge commercialization in the country. The Slovak legislation in 2017 already defined the possibilities of universities to manage their intellectual property; however, only several public universities in the country have adopted the rather early third mission policies and established TLOs to support knowledge transfer (Rehák et al. 2019). Slovak universities still miss capacities and internal institutions for the development of the commercialization processes, which opens the ground for research on informal knowledge flows, as “side” activities of academics.
2. Conceptual Background
The current literature on the topic can be considered to be extensive but also fragmental and incomprehensive (Perkmann et al. 2013). Several reviews tried to deliver a typology for university–industry collaborations (Dess and Shaw 2001), identify basic aspects and characteristics of universities and enterprises developing cooperation linkages (Agrawal 2001), summarize and compare factors affecting the emergence of commercialization and academic engagement in empirical studies (Perkmann et al. 2013) or investigate the key aspects of university–industry collaboration and find out how these aspects may be related (Ankrah and Al-Tabbaa 2015).
As outlined in the previous chapter, academic engagement refers to the interaction between any actors of the higher education system and actors of different sectors aiming mainly to encourage knowledge and technology exchange (Bekkers and Bodas Freitas 2008) in order to get certain financial or non-financial benefits (Perkmann and Walsh 2009)—e.g., access to rare data, teaching enrichment, joint projects and events (Dess and Shaw 2001). The motivation for engagement crosses the intention to publish research results. It is mostly expected that such cooperation should generate certain benefits or effects on the side of an external partner.
As a first extensive and realistic framework of university–industry collaboration, we consider the contribution of Bonaccorsi and Piccaluga (1994) that summarized six main categories of organizational forms of UIC, namely: personal informal relationships, personal formal relationships, relationships through the third party, formal targeted and formal un-targeted agreements and common focused structures. The majority of newer contribution builds on this framework, and thus, on the assumption that the majority of university–industry collaborations tend to be driven by individuals and pursued on a discretionary basis (Hermanson et al. 2020). Nowadays, it is formally measured in the majority of European countries, how frequently entrepreneurs collaborate with universities, e.g., in terms of the provision of research services, counselling, getting access to unique know-how of researchers, academic technologies or research infrastructure, getting the support with product/service/process development (Rybnicek and Königsgruber 2019). In the case of building the formal or semi-formal relations/partnerships between the academic and non-academic actors, Ankrah and Al-Tabbaa (2015) suggest that UIC formation processes consist of: the identification of potential partners, making contact, partner assessment and selection, partnership negotiation and agreement signing.
However, the confusion in drawing the complex picture of academic engagement, even on an institutional level, is caused by the unrecordability of informal cooperation that has no contractual basis (Link et al. 2007). In literature, informal UI collaboration tends to be perceived as even more significant than formal (Siegel et al. 2003; D’Este and Patel 2007). However, from previous research results, there is not much to discuss on the topic so far. Cohen et al. (2002) state that there is a higher probability of informal cooperation in the case of researchers from social rather than life sciences. Schartinger et al. (2002) also suggest that interaction mechanisms and the use of transfer channels also vary across scientific fields. The possibility of the utilization of informally transferred knowledge can be differentiated, mainly based on the intensity and repeatability of contact with an academic researcher (Bekkers and Bodas Freitas 2008), the applicability of research (Bonaccorsi et al. 2014) or absorptive capacity of the enterprise (Cohen and Levinthal 1990).
In this paper, the main focus will be put on the identification of specific individual drivers of scientist willingness to participate in academic engagement. These factors can be grouped into several categories, namely: (1) institutional factors, (2) productivity factors, (3) access to resources and previous experiences, (4) networking in the application sphere and (5) controls related to common individual traits such as age and sex. In previous research, mostly carried out in conditions of western European countries or the United States, it was mostly the impact of several individual, organisational and institutional factors on academic engagement that was investigated (Perkmann et al. 2013). Concerning the institutional perspective, an affiliation to a scientific discipline strongly affects the collaboration of a scientist with actors of an application sphere. Several empirical studies proved that academics assignable under life and technical sciences (such as ICT, bio-technology, engineering) tend to establish more ties with industry. Scientific affiliation also affects the choice of transfer channels (Bekkers and Bodas Freitas 2008; Bozeman and Gaughan 2007; Martinelli et al. 2008). The relationship or affiliation of an academic with specific entities in a university (like technology centres or centres of excellence) can positively influence cooperation with the application sphere (Bozeman and Gaughan 2007). Less empirical studies focused on the role of TLOs in academic engagement activities, such as TLOs, but would rather support basic commercialization activities such as licencing and spin-off establishments and, indeed, no impact on academic engagement was recorded (Perkmann et al. 2013). In order to examine these realities in our case, we formulated the following hypothesis:
H1:   the chance that a researcher will participate in academic engagement increases if he primarily performs applied research .
H2:   there is no relationship between the establishment of TLO (in various forms) in universities and the development of academic engagement .
Concerning the potential relationship between the productivity of the researcher and his academic engagement activities, we consider these relationships with our prior contribution to the literature gap. Observing this relationship in the conditions of Slovakia is particularly relevant, as the results of research in the conditions of the country point to a barrier to the development of academic engagement in the form of the integration of a wide spectrum of “creative tasks” within the scope of work of a creative employee—mostly, it is teaching, research, project management and administration cooperation with practice synchronously (Buček et al. 2019). In research on the topic, the productivity of the researcher was mostly measured by the number of publications (Lin and Bozeman 2006), while a prevailing part of empirical results found that academics with prior industry exposure produce fewer publications. The quality of scientific research also appears to play a vital role in academic engagement. Collaboration with star scientists drives more success for private enterprises (Zucker and Darby 2007). Several authors measured the “quality” of scientific research by a certain productivity indicator, finding a positive impact of productivity on academic engagement (Bekkers and Bodas Freitas 2008; Haeussler and Colyvas 2011). If the researcher was the originator of intellectual property (mostly measured by patents), they participate more actively in academic engagement (Perkmann et al. 2013). Our intention is to examine this relationship utilizing a broader set of indicators (variable number of A-publications, number of registered patents, dummy for experiences with mobilities , average number of hours teaching, number of PhD students) and formulate the following hypotheses:
H3:   As the number of A-category researcher publications increases, the chances of participating in academic engagement activities decrease .
H4:   As the researcher’s teaching volume increases, the chances of participating in academic engagement activities decrease .
The question of the availability of grants for the researcher’s scientific research activity is also relevant, as it is not only a prerequisite for the creation of new knowledge, but can also support the dissemination of research results in practice (Scandura and Iammarino 2022). Nishimura and Okamuro (2016) found that public funding may create incentives for specific motivations for U–I collaboration. However, we would like to directly address the relationship between the public support of an individual’s research and the likelihood of academic engagements, as we miss this discussion in literature. Therefore, we formulate research for another hypothesis:
H5:   The probability that a researcher will participate in academic engagement activities increases if he has access to public funding for his own R&D activities .
In articles that used the seniority variable, a mostly positive effect of academic’s experiences was found, as academic engagement activities tend to be a result of existing social capital and networks (Perkmann et al. 2013). The relationship or affiliation of an academic with specific entities in universities (like technology centres, or centres of excellence) can positively influence cooperation with the application sphere (Bozeman and Gaughan 2007).
Finally, we utilize a unique approach to the investigation of the relationship between a researcher running their own business and participation in academic engagement activities at universities. This relationship, however, cannot be discussed with literature due to the fact that in conditions of western countries, it is usually restricted to running businesses in sectors related to the scientific focus of the researcher abroad (Perkmann et al. 2013; Dospinescu and Dospinescu 2020). However, since such activities of university employees are not monitored under the conditions of universities in Slovakia, we formulated the following hypothesis:
H6:   The chance that a researcher will participate in academic engagement activities increases if he manages his own business with an activity related to his own scientific discipline .
From the individual characteristics of the researcher, empirical studies identically confirm that men tend to cooperate with external actors more often than women (Link et al. 2007; Boardman 2008; Giuliani et al. 2010). There is also strong evidence for statistical significance of the age factor; however, the results differ in terms of positive or negative effects on the dynamics of academic engagement (Bekkers and Bodas Freitas 2008; Link et al. 2007; Haeussler and Colyvas 2011; D’Este and Perkmann 2011). The significant impact of national policies on academic engagement was not found in empirical studies (Haeussler and Colyvas 2011; Grimpe and Fier 2010).
3. Materials and Methods
The main aim of our research is to investigate individual determinants of academic engagement of individual researchers in Slovak conditions, to evaluate the level of formality to academic engagement processes and to describe motives, expected benefits and barriers of the academic engagement of individual researchers in the case of a country in an early stage of the development of the commercialization of academic knowledge. Thus, our research design can be decomposed on the evaluation of qualitative data from a questionnaire survey that will serve to describe multiple aspects of academic engagement in Slovakia according to individual attitudes of researchers and an econometric analysis of determinants of participation of a researcher on cooperation with a non-academic actor based on a quantification of several questions in the survey.
3.1. Survey
We based our investigation on a questionnaire survey of individual researchers. This approach was adopted due to the fact that secondary data collected by the Ministry of Education, or the Centre of Scientific and Technical Information in Slovakia provide information on indicators of commercialization, rather than academic engagement activities. The only alternative to get information about the dynamics of cooperation between universities and the application sphere was to investigate mandatory disclosed contracts of individual universities. However, this approach would not allow us to acquire information about informal links between researchers and non-academic entities.
The statistical population for our querying was 8521 researchers from all public universities in Slovakia that are not exclusively art-oriented (32 public universities in 2018). We excluded 3 art high schools from the survey due to very specific forms of cooperation with the application sphere in the case of such a school that, in our opinion, requires separate investigation. The questionnaire was organized into 33 questions, out of which 19 were closed, 4 can be considered semi-closed and 10 were open. Open questions were included to get broader information about specific attitudes and perceptions of barriers by researchers that generate linkages with non-academic actors. The questionnaire was distributed in electronic form using the Google forms service. We need to note that 395 emails were undeliverable; therefore, we successfully distributed the questionnaire to 8126 researchers. The response rate was 8.69% which represents 776 responses. In order to distribute our questionnaire, it was necessary to create a database of email contacts for all the mentioned 8521 researchers. This database was created manually by processing employee lists or telephone directories at individual faculties. If neither of these sources of contact was available, we had to obtain e-mails through the employee profiles on the websites of individual departments of Slovak universities. The questionnaire was pre-tested. In the case of the chosen university—the Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra, the questionnaire was first distributed to collect remarks and suggestions towards the research framework and questions set-up, while after processing of these remarks, the questionnaire was re-distributed again to collect data via the updated questionnaire. Up to 61 creative employees of the university (7.9%) took part in pre-testing. Results of pre-testing showed cases of improper or unclear formulation of questions, led to the change of set-up of several questions (open/closed), changes in the set of collected performance indicators of researchers and requested far more precise descriptions and definitions of various aspects of knowledge transfer and academic engagement.
The gained sample is relatively balanced from the perspective of sex and the scientific field of the researcher. In our sample, men accounted for 54.51% of respondents and women for 45.49%. From the perspective of our broadly-conceived scientific fields, 54.25% of respondents fall under life and technical sciences and 45.75% of respondents under social sciences. Up to 60.44% of our respondents achieved the academic degree PhD or equivalent, 25% of respondents were associated professors, 11.47% were professors and 3.22% of respondents achieved the academic degree MA or equivalent. Our structure of the sample by the highest academic honours also approximately follows the distribution in the entire population.
In order to process the information obtained via the survey, we use basic methods of descriptive analysis. As we already mentioned, we gave the academics the opportunity to comment on the perceived attitudes and barriers in the open questions of a voluntary character which allowed them to write extensive answers. Open questions concerning barriers to academic engagement were filled by 139 of the 766 respondents of the survey. To process this data, we used standard methods of content analysis (Given 2008) and text mining (Salloum et al. 2018). To quantify the barriers perceived by researchers we used the open coding technique (Blair 2015) to find common statements. We identified identical barriers in different answers and labelled them by sequential numbers. Subsequently, we subdivided identified barriers into groups by type of actor/organisational level responsible for the barrier occurrence—barriers at the level of individual researchers, at the level of the university, at the level of central policy-making bodies and barriers at the level of non-academic actors.
3.2. Data Analysis
Several questions in our questionnaire were formulated in order to carry out quantitative analysis with the aim to explain how various factors influence the decision of an individual academic to participate in academic engagement activities. A set of indicators has been created to investigate the impact of the chosen individual characteristics of a researcher, on the decision of a researcher to maintain a relationship based on knowledge flow with at least one non-academic actor. The minimum criterion for the “cooperation relationship” was set as a relationship in which there is a direct flow of knowledge to the university to the non-academic actor. Thus, there is at least a relationship based on informal research, service provision or consultancy, respective of formal contract research or counselling. Therefore, it was not a strong enough “tie” for us, e.g., if a researcher just attended a conference with the participation of businesses. Compared to other studies, it is not our intention to delimit cooperation with the “application sphere” to university–industry relations, as university knowledge can generate added value in other sectors as well. By cooperation “with non-academic actor” we understand cooperation with state government entities, self-government entities private actors or even NGOs. The overview of all variables used in model is provided in Table 1.
To test our hypotheses , we utilized logistic regression. In the logit model, log odds for value 1 are a linear combination of one or more independent variables having binary or continuous characters. The corresponding probability that the observed event will happen (1) may range from 0 to 1 (Cox 1958). The probability that the researcher will keep a tie with the enterprise can be written as follows: p = b β 0 + β 1 x 1 + … β k x k b β 0 + β 1 x 1 + . … β k x k + 1 + 1 1 + b − ( b β 0 + β 1 x 1 + … β k x k )  
where:
- β k = are coefficients of independent variables

- x k = value of k -th determinant of academic engagement



In terms of selected explanatory variables, our theoretical model will look as follows: existence of cooperation link = β 0 + β 1 × sex + β 2 × experiences   + β 3 × scientific field + β 4 × applied/basic research + β 5 × A-publications   + β 6 × patents + β 7 × mobility + β 8 × teaching hours + β 9 × RD infrastructure   + β 10 × experiences of department + β 11 × PhD students + β 12 × availability of TLO   + β 13 × private grants + β 14 × state grants + β 15   h spent by communication with application sphere + β 16 × own business + α i + ε i t

4. Results
4.1. Motives, Barriers and Patterns of Knowledge Diffusion via Academic Engagement
Among the 776 respondents of the survey, 56.06% of these researchers declare the existence of a cooperation link with an actor in the application sphere. While more than half of the respondents cooperated with the practice, we still consider this information to be worrisome. Employees of Slovak universities are most often defined as pedagogical and research employees at the same time while the scope of their work also includes developing cooperation with actors in the external environment. However, as the results of the survey showed, at most, almost half of the university’s creative staff was in contact with the application sphere thanks to the collection of data for their scientific research activities.
The emergence of interpersonal cooperation linkages between researchers and non-academic actors in Slovakia does not differ significantly in terms of the affiliation to a scientific area of the researcher. If we classify collaborating academics into the two broadest scientific areas (social sciences, life and technical sciences), we find that while 55.11% of respondents from life and technical disciplines cooperate with the practice, in the case of social sciences, it is up to 57.18% of respondents. In terms of gender, men cooperate with the application sphere more often (51.14% of the sample) than women (44.00% of the sample). Our assumption is that the seniority of researchers influences academic engagement is supported by the result that 51.92% of doctors, 60.31% of associate professors and up to 71.91% of professors in the sample were engaged in cooperation with an external actor.
Figure 1 displays shares of cooperating researchers in our sample that were engaged in chosen sectors that were the subject of our interest. Among the academics that participated on academic engagement, the majority kept cooperating linkage with an actor of the private sector (74.1%), while more than 40% were cooperating with state government bodies and organisations and third sector actors. This information stresses the growing importance of the third sector institutions in regional innovation systems even in conditions of a post-socialistic country.
Another question of key importance was whether informal linkages influence the dynamics of academic engagement and knowledge transfer based on interpersonal cooperation to a negligible extent. The opposite probably turns out to be a reality. Table 2 shows the proportions of cooperating academics in a sample (those that had at least one case of cooperation with an external actor in 2018) that used listed knowledge transfer channels to shift knowledge/information towards an external partner formally and informally. Academics in our sample provide support to non-academic actors most often through counselling. In 2018, more than a third of cooperating respondents provided counselling to non-academic actors, while 22.4% reported formal counselling (under contract) and 26.5% of respondents declared that they also provided informal counselling. Although this is the only transfer channel where we have seen a higher proportion of academics collaborating more informally than formally, looking at the results for other channels in Figure 2, it is evident that under the conditions of Slovakia, the support for the practice, and therefore, the dissemination of knowledge is also largely facilitated informally. Informal support is provided to non-academic actors in Slovakia also in the case of the production of products or materials (4.1% cooperated formally, 3.7% informally), provision of unique technical equipment of the university (9.1% formal, 6.8% informally) or creation of copyright works (16.4% formal, 7.9% informal). Given the unfinished policies, systems of control of academic activities or support tools at many Slovak universities, a significant share of cooperation with practice is, thus, facilitated informally.
An informal transfer is more preferred by men than by women (44% of men and 34% of women in the sample cooperated with external partners using informal channels). At the same time, it appears that the older the researcher is, the more experiences they have and the more they keep a richer network of partners, the more informal relationships they create (36.46% of doctors, 69% of associate professors and 56.82% of professors used informal transfer channels). It is interesting that only 32% of the total number of respondents in the sample who declared that took part in academic engagement utilized both formal and informal knowledge dissemination channels. This result could lead to the formulation of the hypothesis that formal and informal academic engagement can potentially exclude each other.
We found a certain level of informal academic engagement of Slovak researchers in the application sphere. Based on the supplementary information obtained from the presented survey, we note that the universities in Slovakia are not sufficiently trying to protect knowledge produced by individual researchers, to be transferred into the application sphere formally. The majority of researchers in the survey agree that in conditions of the given university, they are allowed to have side businesses, counselling and research activities in an external environment to a relatively unlimited extent. We recorded that 13.92% of researchers from our sample have a private business while working at the university. Other maintained ties can be also a result of the previous job of researchers in other sectors. Up to 38.53% of researchers in the sample worked in the private sector entities in the past, 32.47% worked in the state administration or self-government, 25.52% worked in non-governmental organisations, 16.37% provide services within scientific park, 3.61% within a business incubator and 3.61% of responded researchers were engaged in industrial unions. The answers to the open-ended questions suggest that many researchers often continue to work for actors in other sectors besides the university.
Figure 3 represents the average scores for the expected benefits from academic engagement identified by the respondents in our sample. In view of the fact that the majority of creative jobs at universities in Slovakia have a mixed scientific-pedagogical character, the most important expectations of cooperation with practice are in the form of non-financial benefits. The highest average significance was recorded in the case of enrichment of the teaching process with practical examples and understanding of the real problems of the application sphere (average importance score 2.75). This is also logically linked to the need to strategically build long-term relationships with key stakeholders (average importance 2.6). Researchers not only need to get inputs into their teaching or scientific activities but often want to test hypothesises in the “real world”. Thus, verification of their own scientific results outside the academic sphere reached a still relatively high average score of 2.54.
Expectations of financial profit (whether for themselves, the workplace or the university) gained an average significance of 2.07. Lower scores for financial benefits can be linked to low expectations of personal profit. The results from a different section of our survey, focusing on perceived barriers to academic engagement in Slovakia showed that the majority of surveyed researchers consider personal share of profit from academic engagement activities as inadequate (the majority of this profit is consumed by a university, faculty or department). We would like to compare the average importance of getting financial benefits from cooperation with external actors in the case of researchers from natural/technical and social sciences. While in life and technology sciences, the motivation in the form of profit is observed to a greater extent (average importance 2.43), academics falling under the social sciences rally on non-financial benefits to a greater extent (average importance 1.66).
In order to investigate barriers to academic engagement development, we decided to provide the survey respondents with the opportunity to express their specific attitudes concerning perceived barriers to the development of formal academic engagement (contract-based) through open questions in our questionnaire. We come out from an assumption that the understanding of the barriers to formal cooperation with the application sphere can provide us with a better understanding of why informal cooperation appeared in the case of such a proportion of academics. The answers were processed by the open coding method and in Table 2, we present the repeatedly expressed perceived barriers with an indication of how many respondents mentioned them.
At the level of individual academics, it is mainly the lack of time that hampers the development of academic engagement. Academics in Slovak conditions must teach, lead final theses, carry out research, solve multiple research projects of different nature at once (in order to cover lack of financial resources in the department), execute administrative operations connected with research projects, undergo motilities , build networks and solve projects in the application sphere, having a low level of administrative, managerial, legal or economic support from the side of the university. Due to these facts, the respondents state that the academic engagement activities take place mainly in “free time”. In the case of formal academic engagement via counselling, contractual research and equivalent channels, academics do not feel to be adequately evaluated for this effort “beyond basic responsibilities” from the financial perspective, the perspective of impact on personal growth or from the perspective of recognition of the department in the respective university.
At the level of university management and university-level processes, respondents of the survey state, in several cases, that their university lacks an effective model for staff remuneration for academic engagement and the development of links to the application sphere. As we already indicated, in conditions of several Slovak public universities, academics feel that they are getting a low level of administrative support when organising formal cooperation activities with external partners. It was also stated that universities are, due to the length of contract preparation and multiple levels of contract approval, considerably slower partners for the application sphere than private research institutions and considerably more expensive.
The state policy level of barriers perceived by the responded researchers is mainly from areas of organisation of the public subsidy-based system of financing of higher education in the country and accreditation criteria for evaluation of the university performance. The methodology of the breakdown of state subsidies for higher education is considered by many respondents as overcomplicated and too focused on the number of students admitted to study at a given university. In 2019, there was just a little space to push up state subsidies for a university by academic engagement activities or even by the formal transfer of knowledge via technology licensing or a spin-off establishment. The accreditation (cyclic evaluation of university performance) process in Slovak’s higher-education sector is, in recent years, strongly pushing researchers to invest the majority of their time in efforts to publish scientific articles in foreign journals over efforts towards solving domestic problems.
4.2. Model Specification
At this point, we will move towards our quantitative analysis of determinants influencing the generation of interpersonal linkages between researchers and enterprises. We will work with other not yet presented data obtained from our questionnaire survey for modelling addressed relationships.
First, we would like to briefly describe our explanatory variables. From the institutional factors, the scientific field is a binary variable expressing whether the respondent is a member of a scientific discipline in the field of natural and technical sciences or social sciences. According to several authors, the applicability of academic research is an important prerequisite for the emergence of interpersonal links between researchers and actors of other sectors. Therefore, we have created a binary variable applied/basic research which indicates whether the researcher is mainly focused on basic or applied research. Of the 776 respondents, 8.76% are focused exclusively on applied research, while 40.98% of respondents declared a “predominant” focus on applied research. Purely basic research was carried out by 12.11% of academics in our sample and 38.14% of the respondents focus on basic research predominantly. The relationship between the availability of TLO at universities and a researcher’s decision to cooperate with the application sphere is evaluated using dummy variables expressing whether university institutionalized support is in the form of university TLO or not.
Within the productivity category, the impact of the researcher’s overload, in terms of the level of productivity on building links with the application sphere, is examined. The A-publication variable expresses the number of A-category publications which includes, in particular, the publication of monographs by foreign publishers and contributions in journals impacted in the Web of Science and Scopus. The level of academics’ overload from a pedagogical perspective will be measured by the average number of hours taught per semester in 2018. Only 4.12% of respondents taught zero hours per week in 2018 (purely carrying out research), 12.37% of respondents taught 1–5 h, 35.95% taught 5–10 h, 43.43% taught 10–20 h and 3.87% of respondents in the obtained sample taught more than 20 h per week (a full-time creative employee of university in Slovakia should teach 10 h). Experience and productivity in the field of commercialization of knowledge is expressed by the variable patents (total number in entire career). The binary variable motilities express whether the academic has completed mobility within the academic or private sector in the last 3 years. As PhD students can contribute to lowering the overload of research, we formulate variable PhD students that express a number of PhD students led by an associated professor or professor.
Among the access to resources and previous experience-related factors, first, we investigate the relationship between the availability of the state or private R&D grants on the emergence of observed interpersonal linkages of researchers. We also formulate variable RD infrastructure and experiences of the department with academic engagement and commercialization (liqueur scale—own attitude of the researcher) that will test the relationship between the quality of R&D and the poll of experiences and know-how on the level of institution and academic engagement.
The last section—engagement in the application sphere—contains two variables, the average number of hours invested in communication with actors in the application sphere per month and the variable business that express whether researchers have their own business outside of the academic environment.
We also formulate two controls —sex and experiences. Variable experiences express the length of the academic’s career in the higher education sector; therefore, it serves as an indicator of seniority.
4.3. Results of Model Diagnostics
We execute our LOGIT in the Stata software. First, we proceed with the diagnostics of the model. Having several limits, the linktest can be used to detect specification errors. The idea behind it is that if the model is properly specified, one should not be able to find any additional predictors that are statistically significant except by chance. As linear predictor value _hat is significant, we consider the model to be properly specified. In Table 3. linear predicted value squared _hatsq is not significant; therefore, linktest is not significant. This is signalizing that we face no serious problem of omitting relevant variables and our link function can be considered as correctly specified.
Then we test the proper specification of the model using Hosmer-Lemeshow test of the goodness of fit (Table 4). Hosmer-Lemeshow test suggests regrouping the data by ordering the predicted probabilities and then forming 10 nearly equal-sized groups. Since the test is not significant, we are satisfied with the fit of our model.
In Table 5 below, we can see the classification table for our logit model. The overall rate of correct classification is estimated to be 70.62%, with 76.78% of the normal weight group correctly classified (specificity) and 62.76% of the low-weight group correctly classified (sensitivity).
We use the graph of the ROC curve and AUC to check the classification performance of our model, respective of how much is our model capable to distinguish between 0 and 1 classes (Figure 4). When AUC is approximately 0, the model is actually reciprocating the classes. It means that the model is predicting a negative class as a positive class and vice versa. When AUC is approximately 0.5, the model has no discrimination capacity to distinguish between positive class and negative class. The area under the curve of 0.77, in the case of our model, indicates acceptable discrimination for the model.
4.4. Results of Analysis
In this chapter, we are going to interpret the results of the conducted analysis based on the estimations of the described logit model. First, as far as controls are concerned, only the academic’s sex influences whether or not they will be engaged in the application sphere. As we can see in Table 6, if the researcher is male, there is a 1.58 times higher probability that he will cooperate with an entity outside of the academic sector. The model has further shown that the length of an academic career does not affect the probability of a researcher’s participation in academic engagement activities.
Concerning the observed institutional determinants, the probability of a researcher’s interest to collaborate with practice does not depend on the scientific field, respective of whether academic research focus falls under life and technical or social sciences. However, we have found a positive impact on the nature of academic research. If the researcher focuses purely or predominantly on applied research, there is up to a 2.21 times higher probability that he will generate links with actors of the application sphere; thus, we accept Hypothesis 1. We were curious about the results for the availability of TLO at universities, as more than half of Slovak public universities have not established such an institutional unit yet. Several of the existing academic TLOs show fast and positive results from their initial activities, but most of them can be considered as TLOs in seed phase. Several of them provide administrative support also in cases of contract research or provision of services mainly for private sector entities. However, in line with literature, we still found no impact of TLOs on the emergence of cases of academic engagement; thus, we accept Hypothesis 2.
We found no evidence of the relationship between the majority of productivity indicators and the emergence of cases of academic engagement in Slovak conditions. Thus, we must reject both Hypotheses 3 and 4. The experiences and time investments in publishing high-quality publications, testing and registering intellectual property and the completion of motilities are factors which could be, on the one hand, understood as factors of quality of research of surveyed academics but, on the other hand, as the level of researcher’s overload in time investments to activities different from the academic engagement. However, the reality that we found no evidence of teaching overload’s impact on cooperation with external actors can be considered striking, as respondents of the survey presented this factor as a barrier to academic engagement in open questions. However, this can be explained by the fact that the declared impact of researchers’ workload could not be felt due to a certain volume of “superheroes” among academics who manage to facilitate cooperation with the application sphere even outside working hours. The positive influence of PhD students, in turn, reflects the character of PhD studies in Slovakia. The PhD students are expected to “be a hand” for thesis supervisors, and thus, execute part of the supervisor’s responsibilities (teach for him, work on publications, scientific projects, etc.) and reduce their overload.
Within the “access to resources and previous experiences” group of factors, we found evidence of a positive impact of experiences of the department on the emergence of links between academic and non-academic actors. Results of the experiences of the department point to the fact that an accumulation of experiences by colleagues can help to facilitate the researcher’s intention to build links and cooperate with external actors. We accept Hypothesis 5, as the availability of both public and also private R&D grants increases the likelihood that the academic will cooperate with the actor of the application sphere. At least in the case of contractual (formal) cooperation, if the research is funded from private sources, the research results flow primarily to the research donor. Therefore, there is, to some extent, a relationship of conditionality in a case, but this does not apply to informal cooperation via selected transfer channels. However, it is more interesting that the availability of state research grants increases the likelihood that the academic will cooperate with external actors to a higher extent—2.23 times. These grants provide the researcher with the opportunity to decide how to disseminate his research results to a certain extent. Considering the proportion of researchers that received financing for their research via state grants (75.26% of respondents), academic research in Slovakia is highly dependent on national sources of funding which was also reflected in the results for this variable.
We found a positive impact of networking factors on the emergence of observed cooperative linkages. The respondents were asked to estimate the number of hours invested in keeping communication with actors in the application sphere. It was found to be the determinant slightly increasing the probability that a collaborative relationship between the researcher and the external partner will emerge. As we already stated in the previous chapters, the evolving system of support for the transfer of knowledge into the application sphere under the conditions of some universities has led to the creation of a tradition of “tolerance” of academics’ own business overlapping with their research and development at the university. We found that in the case of academics that have their own business, the probability of cooperation with actors of the application sphere within the academic activities is 4.29 times higher. We can hypothesize that academics who have their own businesses in addition to university jobs facilitate a significant part of informal collaboration between the academic sector and other sectors. Thus, we accept Hypothesis 6.
5. Discussion
In this article, we tried to evaluate the current state of the development of academic engagement in the conditions of Slovakia. Our intention was to map out how academic engagement substitutes for formal knowledge transfer in the conditions of a post-socialist country. We contributed to understanding the informal flows of knowledge from the academic environment into practice and, finally, we investigated the impact of diverse factors at the researcher level on the emergence of interpersonal links between academics and the actors in the application sphere.
The academic sector in Slovakia is a suitable object for comparing academic engagement in the case of the developed and underdeveloped systems of formal technology transfer which can be, for example, demonstrated by lower dynamics of formal transfer (Moravčíková et al. 2017) with its neighbours, Hungary or Czech Republic (Orazbayeva et al. 2018); however, both countries deal with relatively similar problems. During the last decade, the central government, the Ministry of Education, government agencies and individual universities in Slovakia have taken the first steps towards developing, in particular, the formal transfer of knowledge that universities produce. These steps were mainly in the area of building technology transfer infrastructure, creation of the institutional support (science, technology centres, centres of excellence), creation of TLOs in the form of academic firms or university departments (Buček et al. 2019). However, these new institutional units, built with the support of the European Structural Funds, have not been fully exploited due to the unsuitable conditions in the calls under the Operational Program Research and Innovation (outputs of projects cannot serve commercial purposes for a given time period) due to the lack of skilled human capital, the lack of experiences with knowledge transfer, poor links between private and academic sectors and the often changing policies of university management (Moravčíková et al. 2017).
Our results give a clue that academic engagement in Slovakia is more individualized than institutionalized. The proportion of researchers participating on the academic engagement activities showed to be significantly higher in our survey in comparison to previous studies (Moravčíková et al. 2017). The fact that more than 56% of respondents declared that engagement in the application sphere can be the result of a broadened understanding of academic engagement in this study, even in comparison to foreign authors (see e.g., Abramo et al. 2011; Bilić et al. 2017)—especially in terms of multisectoral approach, focus on non-contractual collaboration and collaborations based on non-financial benefits.
Many authors put forward the question of to what extent and by which channels the knowledge from universities spreads informally (Link et al. 2007; Bonaccorsi et al. 2014; Grimpe and Fier 2010). The academics in Slovak conditions have considerable freedom to enter cooperation with external partners in the name of the respective university department. The insufficiencies in the transfer system, policies, culture and missing institutional support in the Slovak academic sector, together with salary conditions, force the universities to tolerate the own business of their employees and a rampant informal collaboration with the application sphere. Of course, it is worrying that individual researchers produce products and materials and provide services during their working time at the university or, even, provide work on the laboratory equipment of the university informally. On the other hand, the survey results suggest that formal and informal KT can go “hand-in-hand”, as the emergence of the formal contract can possibly build on informal collaboration (Link et al. 2007). Considering motives and expectations from collaboration on the side of academics in the case of commercialization activities, one of the main expectations from the collaboration with the application sphere was, in other studies, the expectation of profit (Perkmann et al. 2013). Our survey showed that academics are engaged in the application sphere, especially in order to get non-financial benefits related to obtaining information and data, understanding practical problems and enriching teaching, for which we can find support in studies by other authors (e.g., D’Este and Perkmann 2011; Bodas Freitas and Verspagen 2017) but still look for additional sources of funding.
Several barriers perceived by the respondents of our survey can be considered as conventional also in the conditions of western countries, e.g., the bureaucracy of formal contracts management (Geuna and Muscio 2009) pessimism and resistance to the diversification of academic activities (Van Vugt et al. 2008), the problem of mutual trust and different expectation (Bruneel et al. 2010) and conflicts over public funding of knowledge transferred to application sphere (Reichenfeld 2011). However, as a result of the transformation process from the model of academic research and technology transferring in the socialist era to modern western models, Slovak researchers experience barriers mitigated in western countries several decades ago, e.g., negative attitudes of university management, often changing policies, insufficient time capacity of researchers, remuneration system, the personal assessment system or the impact of academic engagement on career growth. Due to the lengthy administration of contractual relations and the cost of services to external partners, we expect that the academic sector does not have a predominantly good image in the private sector. Therefore, individual businesses often look for a way to connect with individual professors rather than approaching the university formally.
Our quantitative analysis pointed out several factors that influence the dynamics of academic engagement in Slovakia. From an institutional point of view, we found evidence that scientist affiliation to life and technical scientific discipline raises the potential for academic engagement, in line with Bekkers and Bodas Freitas (2008) or Ponomariov (2008). Networking with actors of other sectors, in terms of investments in communication, is also a prerequisite for the emergence of new links with external partners. Academic engagement is also influenced by the accumulation of the experiences of the department and the degree of support for the development of these activities by the management of the department, which is no longer the case in the US and Western Europe (D’Este and Patel 2007; Ponomariov 2008). It means that individual researchers draw collective know-how at university level, even though they subsequently operate independently to certain extent. The observed impact of the availability of state research funding on academic engagement points out that Slovak researchers supply research results to the application sphere rather than react to demand. Finally, we found a crucial role of social capital and business skills in academic engagement in Slovakia which was suggested by, for example, the results of D’Este and Patel (2007). From individual controls, we similarly to Link et al. (2007), Boardman (2008), Giuliani et al. (2010) found that men tend to more likely to participate in academic engagement while we found no support for the impact of researchers’ seniority which means that the age and experiences of the researcher do not play the role in the emergence of collaborative links between universities and external partners.
6. Conclusions
In Slovakia, there is considerable scope for formalizing the transfer of knowledge created by academic research for the application sphere, which requires a change in legislation and accreditation criteria at a national level, institutional capacity building, awareness building, setting up effective internal regulations and support models or employee evaluation models at the level of universities. We found that the probability of an individual’s participation in academic engagement activities in Slovak conditions grows with a focus on applied research, if the researcher has available both public and private grants to cover his research and development needs or to cover the costs of the opening of collaborative ties, has own PhD students, invests time in building networks in the application sphere or runs a business in addition to employment at the university. Despite the considerable volume of empirical studies, we still cannot compare the importance of formal and informal dissemination of university knowledge to the development of regional economies. Our results suggest that in a post-socialist country, the effects of informal knowledge dissemination could be even more significant.
The results show managerial implications at different levels. As far as national policy is concerned, recommendations could be formulated towards changes in the methodology of the breakdown of subsidies of public universities or the accreditation system. In 2017, these mechanisms do not sufficiently recognize the importance of academic engagement for the development of universities and the region itself and create space for internal policies and internal reward systems that do not sufficiently value academic engagement. It is worth considering how to approach increasing the level of formalization of knowledge transfer into practice, as the current level of informal cooperation combined with less rigid rules can have significant impacts on local and regional development. At the level of universities, it is especially desirable to differentiate job positions according to the academic’s narrower specialization in teaching, research or collaboration with industry. In many cases, universities in Slovakia need to build more effective internal tools for motivating academics and decentralize competencies to manage contractual relations with practice.
In future research, it would be interesting to compare the effects of strict formalization of academic engagement with current results. Effects of changes in the law concerning possibilities of IP rights management by universities and academic entrepreneurship should be a solid ground for further research in post-socialistic countries. We recommend focusing future efforts on investigating the nature of the emergence of the concrete links, their strength and specific flows of knowledge between the researcher and the application sphere actor while responding simultaneously to both sides of the cooperation link. The study shows that elaboration of university–industry networks should be broadened by other spatial actors, while university third-sector knowledge flows appear to be much-omitted topic. In particular, we would like to emphasize the need to evaluate the evolution of U-I collaboration patterns in the conditions of post-socialist countries with an emphasis on evaluating how the economic transition affected the applied models of technology transfer, the adaptation of universities to the third mission and the development of academic entrepreneurship.
Considering the limitations of the study, it is necessary to state that, even in the case of the questionnaire survey with a relatively high responce rate, the results of empirical studies based on questionnaires suffer from dishonest answers or possible understanding and interpretation of questions. This also limits, to a certain extent, the exactness of quantitative analyses carried out on the data from the surveys. The main limit of our analysis is the non-measurement of link intensity. Considering the interpretation of motives and barriers, attitudes of the application sphere are necessary for a comprehensive understanding of why university in Slovak republic appears to be often too expensive, slow and untrustworthy partner.

Table 2 Vertical hierarchy of academics’ attitudes towards barriers of academic engagement.
Barriers at Level of Researchers
lack of time for academic engagement on the part of academics (48)
insufficient personal evaluation of academics for the development of cooperation with the application sphere (31)
cooperation with practice often takes place in the free time of researchers (17)
department/faculty management sees academic engagement as “academic private activities” (15)
publishing on topics irrelevant to Slovakia (14)
practice is able to communicate and progress much faster than a university (13)
incompetence of colleagues—many are “held” at university despite low erudition (11)
Barriers at University Level Perceived by Researchers
missing models of staff remuneration for academic engagement (31)
bureaucracy in contract management and approval processes at university (29)
universities are too expensive for external partners (14)
high shares on contracts divided by university, faculty, departments (12)
universities are too slow; lengthy process of project administration for actors of application sphere (8)
unfair distribution of personal bonuses to salary at faculties in relation to academic engagement (5)
obsolete technical equipment of departments (5)
Barriers at the Level of State Policies
the need to remove the number of student-based subsidy schemes for the academic sector (26)
academic engagement is not sufficiently assessed in the methodology of subsidies from the state budget (19)
accreditation criteria for universities are too focused on foreign publications (15)
national scientific grant schemes do not allow co-financing of/by private partners (14)
the lack of a long-term vision for higher education (12)
national grant schemes do not push research to be multidisciplinary (9)

Abstract: Conference Title: 2022 International Conference on Smart Systems and Technologies (SST) Conference Start Date: 2022, Oct. 19 Conference End Date: 2022, Oct. 21 Conference Location: Osijek, Croatia By reviewing current criteria of a modern society it is not hard to demonstrate that most of the qualifiers and quantifiers revolve around energy related trivia. It is hard to imagine a future for the humanity where significant efforts were not made to tackle the two most important questions: sustainability of energy supply and reliability of energy supply (with the opportune issue being energy independence). These issues will be highly influenced by the current state of the related technologies that has been developing swiftly. Predominantly, this relates to the energy generation technologies, however inherent benefits can be reaped from mutual co-benefits of other contemporary technologies such as energy storage, electrified transportation and others. The key to successful harnessing of the available potential lies within the inclusive and innovative approach to utilization of renewable energy sources in high energy demand public and private sectors, aggregated by comprehensive energy management solution that additionally assumes stationary energy storage and electrified transportation devices as intermittent storage. The innovative approach in creating a smart and sustainable energy society of the future will be demonstrated through key results of the Renewable Energy Sources for smart sustainable health Centers, University Education and other public buildings (RESCUE) project, with the most important component being transferability and expansion of the results. Assuming the initial impulse from the regionally established knowledge transfer basis, the foundation for the climate-smart, emission-neutral sustainable energy society of the future has been laid. The key findings of the RESCUE projects can easily be applied to other public buildings, but in the wake of another energy crisis the benefits can also be acquired by private enterprises and SME's looking to downsize daily operational costs. Renewable energy generation and other associated technologies (storage, EV's etc.) present everyone with the opportunity for the paradigm shift (a change in perspective) and the development of novel climate friendly business models that can generate revenue in the same manner (if not better) as classical (fossil based) emission heavy solutions.

Global Governance of Energy Systems Transition in a Geopolitical Context - Looking at the Emerging Dynamics of Oil and Coal Beyond the High-Income Countries

Author: Madhavi, Madhu

Publication info: Madhavi, Madhu. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/global-governance-energy-systems-transition/docview/2734703425/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Despite efforts to decarbonise energy systems gathering momentum in response to intensified calls demanding tangible action and a departure towards cleaner and net-zero energy pathways, oil and coal dominate the global energy systems and are predicted to remain prominent in the foreseeable future in all energy scenarios, threatening the transition to net-zero pathways. Even as the consumption of fossil fuels, particularly coal-fired power declines in the West, India’s continued use of coal, under the current trends, is likely to be one of the dominant contributors towards the global increase in CO 2 emissions in 2040. Oil will also continue to remain strategically important to the global energy systems in the near-term scenario and will continue to influence energy markets and global geopolitics. These realities, together, present grave prospects for the world’s environment. Global energy governance processes have a key role to play but a fundamentally different approach will be needed to lead energy systems decarbonisation. Recognizing the importance for holistic insights for successful and effective governance in the context of net-zero transition and the emerging geopolitics of oil and coal, a mixed-methods approach is adopted in this thesis to analyse the potential of global energy governance arrangements for leading the net-zero transition. The use of both quantitative and qualitative methods enables to capture diverse perspectives to explore the key relationships and feedbacks critical for future energy system transition. Document analysis helps to explore the relevant theories, concepts, and trends. This thesis is informed empirically by system-dynamics models exploring scenarios emerging from continued oil price volatility and expansion of coal-fired generation within the context of energy systems transition. The oil model tests the scenarios resulting from supply-side shocks linked to energy security and demand disruptions as a possible consequence of growing pressures of decarbonisation. Damped oscillation in oil prices occur resulting from ongoing readjustments in systems, occurring even long after initial shocks have passed. Without strategic intervention through effective governance arrangements, the world may remain locked-into using oil in the foreseeable future. Global governance institutions can use the low-price window, to help oil producers to diversify their economies and initiate structural reform to gradually steer the world away from oil. Results from India coal SD-model show that even as India succeeds in meeting its Paris commitment of reducing the emission intensity of its GDP by 30-35% below 2005 levels by 2030, the CO 2 emissions will continue to rise and can only be stabilised with the use of advanced clean coal technology enabled with capture. The insights from India-coal SD model tested by performing a techno-economic feasibility analysis using both document analysis and Monte Carlo Simulation using @RISK software, reveal that notwithstanding their technological suitability, advanced clean coal technologies enabled with CCS will significantly increase the cost of electricity and struggle in India, as in other emerging economies, without adequate financial support, knowledge transfer and international cooperation. Analysed against the challenges revealed by the scenarios examined by the oil and coal model, this thesis observes that the existing institutional framework lacks the mandate to effectively deal with the complexity of challenges facing energy systems transition towards secure, sustainable and affordable energy pathways. This thesis argues that despite some recent claims that a new era for energy governance is underway, its institutional landscape and capacity has remained largely unchanged over the past few decades and, in its current form, is rendered ineffective, in addressing the emerging challenges of decarbonisation. A multi-actor, multi-regime complex of actors with proper mandate and remit may be effective. The research recommends that closer coordination and cooperation between processes and frameworks engaged in governance of energy systems will be needed to address contemporary energy challenges.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2022 3rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML) Conference Start Date: 2022, July 22 Conference End Date: 2022, July 24 Conference Location: Chengdu, China With the coming of intelligent era, the wide using of new generation information technology, such as Internet on Things, AI, Big data and Cloud computing, digital economic development is more and more prosperous for every economic entity, specially, for some emerging economic entities, such as RCEP nations. However, the problem of objective evaluation of ability of digital economic development of different nations and dependence of digital economic development among each nation are very hard but necessary under not leaking digital economic data of all parts. For solving this problem, an improvement Meta Learning approach was proposed creatively which constructed temporal dimension factor and spatial dimension factor based on spatial-temporal information matrix method. It could make knowledge transfer from source network to target network according to the orthogonal rule between temporal dimension factor and spatial dimension factor. 3 different type and smart test ways were designed in order to validate the performance of the approach of this paper comprehensively. Digital economic development data of RECP nations were collected and employed for testing. The amount and accuracy of knowledge transfer from different source network to various target network were validated one by one. The results not only validate the effectiveness of improving Meta Learning approach of this article but also reveal that the diversity of digital economy development among RECP nations but impacting tightly each other. Moreover, there also have relative contribution on opening knowledge transfer from source network to target network under privacy data not be leaked. This content would be researched at more complex industrial data forward.

Abstract: Conference Title: ICC 2022 - IEEE International Conference on Communications Conference Start Date: 2022, May 16 Conference End Date: 2022, May 20 Conference Location: Seoul, Korea, Republic of As an enabler of sixth-generation communication technology (6G), Federated Learning (FL) triggers a paradigm shift from "connected things" to "connected intelligence". FL implements on-device learning, where massive end devices jointly and locally train a model without private data leakage. However, FL suffers from problems of low accuracy and convergence rate when no data is shared to the central server and the data distribution is non-IID. In recent years, attempts have been made on hybrid FL, where very small amounts of data (e.g., less than 1%) is shared from the participants. With the opportunities brought by shared data, we notice that the server is capable of receiving the data in order to assist the FL process and mitigate the challenge of non-IID. Notably, existing hybrid FL only applies the model-level technologies belonging to the traditional FL and does not make full use of the characteristics of shared data to make targeted improvements. In this paper, we propose FedAux, a novel hybrid FL method at knowledge-level, which utilizes shared data to construct an auxiliary model and then transfer general knowledge to traditional aggregated model or client model for enhancing the accuracy of global model and speeding up the convergence of global model. We also propose two specific knowledge transfer strategies named c-transfer and i-transfer. We conduct extensive analysis and evaluation of our methods against the well-known FL methods, FedAvg and Hybrid-FL protocol. The results indicate that FedAux shows higher accuracy (10.89%) and faster convergence rate compared with other methods.

1. Introduction
Artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence, referred to as “AI”) is a discipline that studies how to make machines do things that humans need intelligence to accomplish [1]. Artificial intelligence has experienced the early game, expert system, and other algorithmic models and has developed to the current research direction of machine learning and deep learning [2]. Artificial intelligence is essentially a branch of computer science. With the rapid iterative update of computer technology, it shows stronger intelligence and practicability and is generally accepted by the public. My country’s artificial intelligence started late, and there is still a certain gap compared with developed countries such as the United States. Physical education is one of the important contents of the implementation of comprehensive quality education in my country, and it has a basic supporting role in improving the national physique and improving the quality of life [3]. In recent years, the rapid development of a new generation of artificial intelligence technology has had a significant impact on the content, mode, method, and system of traditional physical education [4]. How to deeply apply artificial intelligence technology to physical education and break through the limitations of time-space scenarios and knowledge transfer methods in traditional models has become a key issue in intelligent physical education in the era of artificial intelligence.
In recent years, sports artificial intelligence research, the main subject is computer science, and the algorithm empirical research of basic theory is preferred [5]. It mainly involves the use of neural network-based machine learning-related algorithms, involving sports performance prediction [6], human action recognition and evaluation [7], technical and tactical decision support, sports injury assessment, etc. [8, 9], [10] As the most important research direction in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years, deep learning (Deep Learning) is a kind of intelligent learning algorithm based on deep neural network and representation level, so as to obtain humanlike analytical learning ability, thus promoting the progress of artificial intelligence related technologies [11, 12]. Among them, the human posture recognition technology in deep learning is a technology that can accurately describe the posture and behavior by sensing the structural parameters of human limbs through sensing signals, images, and other data [13]. Detection of human skeleton joints is the core problem of pose recognition [14]. Since 2012, the rapid development of deep learning technology has promoted the continuous improvement of the detection effect of human skeleton joints [15].
Aiming at the lack of error correction design in the traditional Long and Short-term Memory Network (LSTM) structure [16], a sports artificial intelligence based on Variational Modal Decomposition (VMD) was proposed. Intelligent models [17, 18]. Combining the new ideas of “artificial intelligence” with the needs of sports provides a beneficial guarantee for meeting the needs of scientific training. Based on the VMD-LSTM model and the design and use of portable equipment, this paper constructs a sports monitoring service system, which combines a new method of artificial intelligence to analyze the real-time parameters of the sports process. By establishing this service model, the physical activity of athletes can be monitored.
2. Principles and Methods
2.1. Metamorphic Mode Decomposition
Variational mode decomposition is an adaptive signal processing method proposed in 2014. By iteratively searching for the optimal solution of the variational mode, the modal function and center frequency are continuously updated to obtain several modes with a certain bandwidth function [19]. Variational modal decomposition is an improvement of the EMD algorithm, which has the advantage of better avoiding modal aliasing and end-point effects [20]. Metamorphic Mode Decomposition.
Variational mode decomposition decomposes wearable sports equipment into several eigenmode functions (IMFs) with center frequencies on the premise that each decomposed eigenmode function has a limited bandwidth, by constructing and solving a variational problem to find each eigenmode function and its center frequency [21]. The VMD method decomposes the signal into predefined K eigenmode components IMF, where the IMF is redefined as an AM-FM signal. (1) u k t = A k t cos ϕ t k .
The accuracy of the decomposition result of the VMD algorithm depends on the number of modes K and the value of the penalty factor. If the value of K is too large, it will cause excessive signal decomposition, so that a component determined by the center frequency will be scattered in different eigenmode components; while the value of K is too small, it will cause modal aliasing, that is, different centers. The frequency signal components are in the same eigenmode component after being decomposed by VMD, resulting in components that have no practical significance. Both of these cases can lead to inaccurate results of the decomposition. The value of α will affect the frequency bandwidth of each modal obtained after the signal is decomposed by the variational modal decomposition algorithm, the degree of modal aliasing and the speed of the algorithm. If the value of the penalty factor α is too small, the bandwidth of each frequency is too large, and similar frequencies are mistaken for the large bandwidth part of the same center frequency so that they are decomposed into the same component, and the problem of modal aliasing occurs. When the value is too large, part of the bandwidth is reduced, which may cause the signal to be overresolved and spurious components appear. Therefore, the selection of appropriate parameter values ​​is crucial to the accuracy of the PPG signal decomposition results [22].
2.2. LSTM Model
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a temporal recurrent neural network [2]. The outstanding contribution of this network lies in the use of the self-loop design, and the weight of the self-loop can also be updated in each loop iteration, thus cleverly avoiding the gradient dispersion problem that occurs when the recurrent neural network model updates the weights [23].
Each hidden node of the LSTM network model contains a storage unit, and the entrance of the storage unit is controlled by some logic units. These control units are generally called “gates.” At the entrance of each hidden unit, there are three gates, namely, input gate, output gate, and forget gate [24]. The input gate is used to selectively save the input data, the output gate is used to determine when to output the value, and the forget gate is used to determine when the value should be memorized or forgotten [25]. Hidden nodes are shown in Figure 1. In the whole model, the parameters of the input gate, output gate, and forget gate in each hidden node are learned during the training process [26]. The calculation formulas for the three gates are as follows: (2)   i t = σ W xi x t + W hi h t − 1 + b i , o t = σ W xo x t + W ho h t − 1 + b o , f t = σ W xf x t + W hf h t − 1 + b f ,   c t = f t c t − 1 + i t t a n h W xc x t + W hc h t − 1 + b c , h t = o t t a n h c t .

3. Experimental Procedure and Result Analysis
3.1. Feature Extraction Using VMD Method
The maximum envelope kurtosis method is used to determine the optimal decomposition level K of the VMD, randomly extract several groups of current signals from the first group, and use the maximum envelope kurtosis method for analysis. By observing the variation trend of the local maximum envelope kurtosis in Figure 1, it can be found that the envelope kurtosis is the largest when K  = 11.
So take K  = 11 VMD for current signal processing. It can be seen from the decomposed current signal that IMF1, IMF2, and IMF3 are low-frequency signals, the frequency components are relatively single, and the main frequency components of the current signal are concentrated in the low-frequency current signal. Therefore, the features of the first three IMFs can be directly extracted to represent the movement and detect changes in parameters. There are interference signals such as noise in the high-frequency signal of the current signal, and after calculation, the signal-to-noise ratio in the high-frequency signal is less than 0, which is dominated by noise, and the soft threshold denoising method needs to be used for denoising. The original signal can be regarded as the sum of the decomposed IMFs, so the high-frequency signal can be simplified as follows: (3) IMF h = ∑ i = 4 11 IMF i   i = 4,5 , … , 15.
It can be seen from the calculation that the amplitude of the curve of the denoised signal is smaller than that of the high-frequency signal, which means that some noise is removed and the characteristics of the tool wear signal are preserved. The signal-to-noise ratio of the high-frequency signal before denoising is 6.581 dB, and the signal-to-noise ratio after denoising is improved to 2.024 dB.
Since it is difficult to find the relationship between the signal and sports parameters by directly observing the signal, the original signal is processed to extract features that are related to the body motion parameters. This paper extracts 7-dimensional time domain features, including mean, root mean square, peak value, standard deviation, variance, and kurtosis factor, margin factor; 2-dimensional frequency domain feature, including barycentric frequency and frequency energy value, extracting the mean, root mean square, and peak value of 3 low-frequency IMFs, and one high-frequency IMF, a total of 21 dimension features. Since the classification of sports parameters under multiple working conditions in this paper needs to consider the influence of parameters such as heart rate on the current signal, the three sports parameters are also classified as features, with a total of 24-dimensional features. The model training speed will be slowed down due to too many feature dimensions, and there may be features that are not related to motion parameters in these features. In this paper, the SelectKBest class in the feature-selection of the Python library is combined with the mutual information method to filter the features, and the 6-dimensional features plus 3 cutting parameters are selected from the 21-dimensional feature parameters as the model input.
3.2. Validation of Model Recognition Effect
A total of 921 groups of experimental data were collected in this experiment, and the number of experimental data in each group. Taking the first group as an example, the current signal is divided into three stages, the initial stage of exercise, the middle stage of exercise, and the later stage of exercise. The variation trend of the current signal eigenvalues with motion is shown in Figure 2.
[figure(s) omitted; refer to PDF]
It can be observed from Figure 2 that in the initial stage, the current signal fluctuates greatly, because the body movement state is good, and the body function parameters have not yet adapted to the body. In the normal stage, the current change is relatively gentle, and in the severe stage, it rises sharply, which is caused by the sudden strengthening of the exercise state after the exercise adaptation.
3.3. Normalization
Since there are few initial and late samples in each group of experiments, normal samples occupy the vast majority, and unbalanced samples will affect the final classification effect. Therefore, the SMOTE algorithm is used to oversample the interval with fewer samples. This method is used in minority samples. New sample points are generated on the Euclidean distance [27]. After dividing the 4 groups of experimental data into 3 intervals, the training set and the test set are divided according to the ratio of 3:1. For the multiclassification model, the output label corresponding to each state needs to be coded. In this paper, the One-Hot coding method is used. The data set composed of features after optimization needs to be normalized before classification, and the normalization formula is (4) x = x − x min x max − x min .
As a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), LSTM can better avoid the problem of gradient disappearance and can effectively deal with the long-term dependency problem [1]. Due to the small number of samples collected, this paper designs a model with only a single LSTM layer, the number of LSTM neural units is set to 30, the batch size is set to 32, the cross entropy is selected as the loss function, and the Adam optimization algorithm is used to optimize the model parameters [28], and the structure of the LSTM model is shown in Table 1.

Figure 3 shows the accuracy and loss curve of the LSTM model training process. It can be observed from the figure that the training accuracy value and loss tend to converge after the 150th iteration, and the training accuracy during the training process reaches 94.09%. The classification accuracy rate on the test set reached 92.44%. The loss rate is another way of expressing the accuracy. The loss rate in Figure 3 is stable at about 10% after multiple iterations, which indicates that the model selected in this study has good accuracy and strong applicability. It can be concluded that the model has high recognition accuracy and strong generalization ability, which can meet the recognition requirements of actual motion state parameters. The selected features can better characterize the change of motion state, which is similar to the research results of some scholars [29].
[figure(s) omitted; refer to PDF]
In order to verify the superiority of the model in this paper for the recognition of motion states under multiple working conditions, this paper uses empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition to construct different feature vectors for the same sample set [28] and uses the LSTM model for Classification [30], the final result is far from the method in this paper, and the accuracy is not high. And, this paper compares the LSTM model with the traditional machine learning method Support Vector Machine (SVM) and BP neural network, in which the kernel function parameter σ and penalty factor C of SVM use particle swarm optimization algorithm to find the best parameters, respectively, are 11.580 and 12.926. The BP neural network adopts the structure of 30 × 8 × 3, and the number of iterations is 500 times. In order to avoid experimental chance, each model was tested 5 times to take the average of the accuracy of the test set. Table 2 shows the test results of the model.

Classification model Test set average classification accuracy (%) Optimal classification of test set accuracy (%) Train time (S)
LSTM 93.78 94.02 83.35
PSO-SVM 90.43 91.67 89.49
BP neural network 88.59 89.21 39.86
It can be seen from the table that the training time of SVM is longer than that of LSTM, and the accuracy of the test set is lower than that of LSTM. The data samples in this paper are changed from 921 to 1851 groups after sample synthesis. Efficiency is lower. Although the training time of the BP neural network is shorter than that of the LSTM model, there is a big gap between the recognition effect and LSTM, and there are also big differences between different neural network structures, which is similar to the research results of some scholars [31].
4. Model Predictions
In the research on the physical health of different groups of people, intelligent wearable devices based on machine learning and deep learning algorithms can identify, monitor, and analyze the muscular endurance and physical activity status of people with different physical fitness, including children, adolescents, and adults. Proposing exercise methods suitable for individuals with different physical conditions can promote the formation of healthy living habits.
In the monitoring test, there are many factors that affect the effect of sports wearable devices, including respiratory rate, heart rate, and real-time measurement of hemoglobin. The measurement of respiratory rate is affected by detection time and exercise intensity. Therefore, to obtain accurate respiratory frequency measurement, it is necessary to remove the influence of clutter on the respiratory measurement results. The least mean square can solve the respiratory frequency well, so the system decides to use the least mean square respiratory signal filtering algorithm as the main technology of this module. If all the influencing factors are considered, the experiment becomes very complicated and requires a huge cost. Therefore, the simplified variables in this paper are the fluctuation of electrocardiogram, respiratory signal, and monitoring of blood oxygen concentration.
The electrocardiogram is an electrical activity process that reflects the excitement of the heart. It has important medical reference significance and reflects the activity process of the human body’s electrocardiogram. It has considerable medical and sports measurement importance. In the ECG monitoring part, the system uses textile electrodes as the main material, because when the material contacts the skin, an equivalent capacitance C1 will be generated, which can achieve signal impedance matching and improve the sensitivity and accuracy of signal detection. The single-lead ECG measurement module made of textile electrodes is placed at two points on the surface of the human body. By measuring the potential difference between the two points, the signal can be transmitted to the analog ECG signal conversion interface through the wire, as shown in Figure 4.
[figure(s) omitted; refer to PDF]
The respiratory signal spectrum after filtering processing has regular breathing fluctuation as a whole, and the fluctuation is stable. The maximum amplitude of the fluctuation is 1.5 V, which occurs between 21 and 29 seconds. Within seconds, it can be seen that the monitored exercise participant’s breathing is stable, the exercise training intensity is reasonable, and there is no need to adjust the amount of exercise. The least mean square can solve the respiratory frequency well, so the system decides to use the least mean square respiratory signal filtering algorithm as the main technology of this module. The least-mean-square respiratory signal filtering algorithm consists of five operating modules, firstly measuring n times of inhalation signal x , then measuring n times of exhalation signal e , and then adding the two different signals to calculate the sum signal frequency value, then the three-axis acceleration and the breathing signal are input into the digital filter together, and the breathing signal processed by the digital filter is then output for correlation detection. In square algorithm operation, the operation result will be input into the digital filter again, so as to reciprocate until the error is wirelessly reduced and the error is corrected continuously, so as to obtain the accurate respiratory data measurement signal. Capture, the process of data capture is the real-time measurement of human body functions such as heart rate and hemoglobin by wearable devices, so the monitor of the wearable device becomes the key device for this step.
5. Conclusion

Sports smart wearable system. In order to realize the online monitoring of wearable devices with artificial intelligence in sports and overcome the problem of low recognition accuracy of electrocardiogram, blood oxygen, and respiratory signals in many cases, this paper proposes a combination of variational modal decomposition based on the maximum envelope kurtosis method.

Abstract: Retirement of baby boomers results in institutional knowledge loss and gaps in business continuity. The specific management problem is that managers in American higher education institutions have challenges maintaining business continuity as they lose institutional knowledge when baby boomers retire and millennials assume those positions. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore how organizational managers in online universities are transferring tacit knowledge from the retiring baby boomers to their millennial replacements to maintain business continuity. The conceptual framework of this study was based on Bridges's model on transition to capture the effects of the generational changes occurring in the workforce. The overarching research questions focused on how managers in an online higher education institution manage knowledge to transfer to new managers and support business continuity for their institution. Data were collected through interviews and documents from 20 baby boomers, Gen Xers, and millennial managers employed with the institution for at least three years. Yin's five steps for qualitative data analysis and thematic coding were used to identify three key findings. One finding suggested that knowledge management should be a strategic priority, supported by institutional technology systems, procedures, and policies. Another finding identified the importance of succession planning and knowledge sharing to support business continuity through change and transition. This research study could lead to positive social change by aiding universities to prepare for future workforce changes by developing strategies to retain tacit knowledge, which will support business continuity efforts and allow them to support the communities they serve.
