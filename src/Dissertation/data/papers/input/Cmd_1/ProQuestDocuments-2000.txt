Abstract: Objective Emergency medicine healthcare professionals need to be continuously updated and trained in emergency medicine. Continuing professional development (CPD) courses are frequently offered but are seldom quality assured by other means than learner satisfaction evaluations or pre–post-test of knowledge retention. This study explores the quality of multiple choice questions (MCQs) used in a mandatory cross-disciplinary Norwegian CPD e-learning course in emergency medicine primary care. Design Cross-sectional study design. Setting We extracted MCQ assessment data from the e-learning platform ‘Oppvakt’ at National Centre for Emergency Primary Health Care (NKLM). Subjects Physicians and nurses working in the Out-of-Hour service in Norway. Main outcome measures Results from the MCQ exam and information about the participants’ professional role was extracted. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the level of difficulty of the MCQ items and their discriminatory power. Results A total of 2310 physicians and 1547 nurses completed the e-learning module, and 79% of the physicians and 67% of the nurses passed their first exam attempt. The physicians and nurses had an average of 85% and 81% correct answers, respectively. More than half of the MCQ items tested facts and knowledge retrieval, and not knowledge application. 70% of the items were found to be ‘easy’ or ‘too easy’. A third of the items had a low level of discrimination. Conclusions Our results indicate that there is room for improvement of the MCQ exam. Overall, the items were too easy and lacked the ability to discriminate between high and low-performance participants.

Abstract: Background The operating room is a high-risk environment where proper patient positioning is crucial for minimizing injury and ensuring optimal access to surgical sites. This process requires effective collaboration among surgical team members, particularly operating room nurses who play a vital role in patient safety. Despite advancements in technology, challenges such as pressure injuries persist, with a significant incidence rate. Video-based training (VBT) emerges as a promising educational tool, enhancing knowledge retention and fostering a learner-centered approach. This study aims to evaluate the impact of VBT on adherence to surgical positioning standards, highlighting its potential to improve safety protocols in the operating room. Methods In this clinical trial, 62 qualified operating room nurses (50 women, 12 men, average age: 28.90 ± 3.75 years) were randomly divided into control and intervention group ( n  = 31 in each group). The control group only received positioning recommendations, but in the intervention group, in addition to the recommendations, video-based surgical positioning training was performed for 1 month, at least 3 times a week. The performance of nurses in both groups was evaluated through a researcher-made checklist at baseline and post-intervention. Results Based on findings, there was no significant difference between the two groups in compliance with surgical positioning standards at baseline ( p  = 0.07). However, after the intervention, compliance scores significantly improved in the VBT group compared to the control group ( p  < 0.001). The VBT group showed a mean improvement of 62.12 points, while the control group improved by 10.77 points ( p  < 0.001). Conclusions This preliminary study demonstrated a notable improvement in compliance with surgical positioning standards among operating room nurses following VBT intervention. Despite the promising results, the small sample size and preliminary nature of the research necessitate further studies to confirm these findings and assess long-term outcomes. These initial insights highlight the potential of innovative training methods in enhancing surgical practices.

Abstract: Gamified learning creates authentic situations for students to solve tasks, provides students with active learning opportunities, and is an effective way to cultivate problem-solving ability, critical thinking, creativity, etc. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of gamified learning and learning behavior modeling technology, choose the Hidden Markov Model as the technical support of the study, adopt the Bayesian Information Criterion to select the optimal number of hidden states of the model, and combine the K-means algorithm with the model optimization in model parameter estimation, which to a certain extent improves the speed of convergence in the process of learning behavior modeling. The game elements and learning activity elements have been integrated and migrated, and proposed gamified learning activity elements. Activity theory and self-determination theory were used to design a gamified learning activity process for the educational field. The game-based learning activity process was continuously revised and optimized by iterating the process with actual teaching cases. Subsequently, we merged qualitative and quantitative research to examine students’ gamified learning and the changes in their learning effects. The results showed that gamified learning produced significant facilitation (p<0.001) in all four dimensions of mind-flow experience, intrinsic motivation, knowledge retention, and transfer performance, with effect values of 1.05, 1.65, 1.00, and 1.08, respectively. This indicates that the gamified learning model can enable students to stimulate and maintain good motivation for learning, and further demonstrates that the process of designing gamified learning activities has effectiveness.

Abstract: The wide application of virtual reality technology has brought opportunities for teaching ideology and politics, breaking traditional education’s time and space limitations. This paper proposes an automatic three-dimensional modeling technology model, combined with computer vision camera imaging principles, to optimize the amount of data and improve optimization efficiency. And on this basis, it further proposes the Civics virtual scene construction technology, combined with the improved QEM grid simplification algorithm of edge segmentation, to optimize the virtual scene by simplifying the complex three-dimensional grid model. The experimental group’s students have shown good acceptance of this teaching method when teaching Civics in VR venues. In the cognitive and knowledge level of Civics learning, there is a significant difference between the experimental group and the control group in the dimensions of value identity and knowledge retention (P<0.05), and the mean value in the dimension of value identity is as high as 4.55, which is a very significant difference from the control class (P<0.01). And in the experiential feedback of Civics learning, the students in the experimental group have a greater sense of scene realism than the students in the control group (P<0.01), a stronger sense of realism of the interactive experience in learning (P<0.05), a higher degree of concentration in learning (P<0.01), and a more minor degree of interference by the external environment (P<0.01).

Abstract: In the digital transformation era, higher education stands on the cusp of a revolution. This paper dives into the heart of this transformation, presenting a novel model of intelligent party building education that leverages digital technology to forge a new path for learning. Through the lens of ecological construction, we unveil the CFA model and a sophisticated deep knowledge tracking method aimed at enhancing student performance in Civic and Political Sciences. Our journey through empirical analysis and comparative experiments sheds light on the transformative power of digital education techniques. Despite the initial findings suggesting a modest impact of smart party building and teaching methods on knowledge retention (with significance levels of 0.6941 and 0.4963), a deeper exploration reveals a compelling narrative: the synergistic effect of these methods significantly boosts knowledge retention, as demonstrated by an F-value of 5.6941 and a P-value below 0.05. The prowess of Civics teachers, assessed across three dimensions, further narrates the success of this educational innovation, with scores reflecting their deep understanding of the curriculum and a robust theoretical knowledge base. The performance of 32 Civics teachers, with scores ranging from 12 to 24, underscores the efficacy of intelligent party building education in today’s colleges and universities.

Abstract: This study utilizes a comparative experimental research method to investigate the effect of the Predict, Observe, Explain, and Evaluate (POEE) learning strategy in an immersive virtual environment (IVE) on two types of learners with different levels of prior knowledge. One type referred to as Highly Experienced and Knowledgeable (HEK) learners, has both experience in using IVE and subject background knowledge, while the other type, referred to as Limited Experience or Knowledge (LEK) learners, lacks experience in using IVE or subject background knowledge. A total of 65 seventh-grade students from a middle school in Wuhan participated in the experiment, engaging in self-directed learning activities in the IVE. The research results indicate that the implementation of the POEE learning strategy enhances learner-content (L-C) interactions, leading to improved learning outcomes in self-directed learning in the IVE. These improvements are particularly evident in the following aspects: (1) improve LEK learners' academic performance and promote knowledge retention and transfer; (2) improve learners' cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement; (3) increase learners' motivation and self-efficacy, and decrease their cognitive load. Findings from this study contribute to a better understanding the nature and diversity in student interactions and offer valuable insights for the design of self-directed learning in an IVE.

Abstract: Classroom Response System (CRS) is a promising educational tool that can create an interactive learning space. In high school, less is known about its impact on learning mathematics. Most studies on the integration of CRS in teaching and learning use internet-dependent tool. This paper aimed to determine the effectiveness of the CRS that uses Bluetooth technology in improving the mathematics achievement and knowledge retention of the students. A quasi-experimental design and longitudinal study with post-test and delayed post-test was employed in this study. The assessment and re-administered assessment results of the CRS and Traditional Classroom Instruction (TCI) groups were compared. Data were analyzed using an independent sample t-test and Welch t-test, and the Mean Percentage Scores (MPS) were calculated to determine the achievement level. Findings revealed that there was a significant difference between the assessment of the CRS and the TCI groups. Moreover, the re-administered assessment results suggest that students exposed to CRS have better knowledge retention compared to the TCI. Furthermore, the MPS showed that CRS exhibited higher mastery level of the learning competencies over the TCI group. This study provides valuable insights into the integration of CRS in mathematics teaching and its consequential effect on achievement and retention.

Abstract: An association between spatial ability, particularly visualisation, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has been repeatedly demonstrated over the past four decades. Understanding this relationship is of critical importance as substantial evidence illustrates the malleability of spatial ability and that the effects of associated training interventions transfer to desirable STEM outcomes such as improved educational performance and reduced attrition rates. There currently exists a number of theories as to why spatial ability relates to STEM, such as that the nature of STEM activity is inherently spatial. However, there is a need to better understand this relationship from a cognitive perspective. This research examined the hypothesis that spatial ability is predictive of short-term retention for declarative technical information associated with engineering curricula. An original investigation in an authentic educational setting found that visualisation and interest in the lecture material were significant predictors of short-term knowledge retention. This effect was then replicated in two subsequent conceptual replication studies. Based on this predictive finding, it is theorised that increases in spatial ability may support the elongation of the knowledge forgetting curve which would have significant implications for instructional design.

Abstract: Mathematical inquiry involving hands-on activities has received increasing attention in mathematics education. Besides various customized physical teaching aids, subject-specific information technology, such as Dynamic Geometry System (DGS), finds extensive use in mathematical inquiry activities. However, effects of DGS and physical manipulatives on inquiry-based math learning remain an open question. Hence, by adopting a quasi-experimental research design, this paper aims to empirically compare the immediate learning outcomes, knowledge retention, and learning interest of seventh-grade students who explore with virtual manipulatives (i.e., the DGS) and who explore with physical manipulatives. Specifically, 131 students participated in learning activities centered on exploring pyramids and prisms. During the inquiry process, Group A (n = 33) constructed pyramids and prisms in DGS, Group B (n = 34) observed pre-made virtual models in DGS, Group C (n = 32) observed physical models, and Group D (n = 32) made physical pyramids and prisms with polymer clay and small sticks. Moreover, pretest, post-test, and delayed post-test designed according to the Van Hiele model, as well as an adapted interest questionnaire, were employed to evaluate students' performances; and collected data were analyzed by means of ANCOVA and t-test. Findings of the study revealed that in the context of construction, students employing the DGS exhibited superior immediate learning outcomes and greater knowledge retention compared to their peers who utilized physical manipulatives; while in the case of observation, the virtual and physical manipulatives yielded similar impacts on students' immediate learning outcomes, but students who involved in the DGS demonstrated higher knowledge retention. Furthermore, regarding the DGS environment, students who engaged in constructive manipulation surpassed their peers who engaged in observing manipulation. In terms of interest, the DGS proved to be more effective in both stimulating and maintaining higher interest compared to the physical manipulatives, and constructive manipulation was more effective than observing manipulation. In summary, as compared to the physical manipulatives, DGS, particularly when employed with constructive strategy, has shown to encourage students to more actively engage in task-related cognitive behaviors, thereby supporting and enhancing inquiry-based math learning of students in junior high school.

Abstract: Virtual and Augmented Reality technologies have emerged as promising tools in the education sector, offering new possibilities for immersive learning experiences. Many researchers have focused their research on examining the potential of these technologies in education from different perspectives. However, it was discovered that there are research gaps in current systematic reviews regarding the examination of the impact of Virtual, Augmented Reality and Learning Analytics utilization on various types of learners and educators across different educational systems, including K-12 Education, Higher Education, Vocational, and Industrial Training, in addition to the educational systems' research tendencies and their adoption of these technologies. Therefore, our study aims to address these gaps by searching various studies in Google Scholar, Scopus, and the IEEE Xplore databases. By following the PRISMA protocol, 150 research papers were selected for analysis, and our findings show that improving motivation and attention, improving learners' understanding & performance, and increasing knowledge retention are the most significant impacts on all types of learners. For educators, we found that these technologies have a prominent effect on assisting educators in teaching and training and reducing the burden. Furthermore, we discovered that Higher Education and Augmented Reality were the dominant educational system and the technology type in the selected studies. We also found that most Virtual and Augmented reality researchers preferred to use questionnaires and online surveys for data collection. We further identified that analyzing learners' traces when interacting with Virtual and Augmented Reality applications can improve learners' performance and learning experience. Our review offers valuable insights into how integrating these technologies with Learning Analytics can benefit learners and educators and how educational institutions and industrial organizations can take advantage of adopting these technologies.

Effects of Embedded Questions in Pre-Class Videos on Learner Perceptions, Video Engagement, and Learning Performance in Flipped Classrooms

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of embedded questions in pre-class instructional videos on learner perceptions (cognitive load, emotional engagement, satisfaction, judgement of learning), video engagement (total views, total viewing time), and learning performance (retention, transfer). The research occurred in a real flipped classroom environment. We designed a quasi-experiment in which 86 university students from two natural classes watched pre-class instructional videos featuring procedural knowledge with or without interpolated true or false questions. Students were asked to practice the operation steps introduced in the videos. While they practiced operations, they could either pause the videos or let the videos continue playing. Face-to-face contact time was utilised to consolidate and extend previewed content with student-centred, instructor-facilitated problem-solving activities. Results revealed no discernible effects from embedded questions in pre-class videos on cognitive load, emotional engagement, satisfaction, judgement of learning, total views, knowledge retention or knowledge transfer. We speculate that the various in-class practice activities and frequent access to procedural knowledge videos offset the cognitive benefits derived from question-embedded videos. Learners who viewed question-embedded videos presented significantly reduced total viewing time, likely because the embedded questions scaffolded them in sustaining attention and efficiently pinpointing the exact information needed. Future research should identify boundary conditions for embedding questions in instructional videos (e.g. learning mode, type of knowledge) rather than indiscriminately applying this design strategy.

Markets and Metis: Reading Hayek with Scott

Author: Reamer, Robert

Abstract: Both James C. Scott and Friedrich Hayek articulate critiques of centralised state planning that are fundamentally epistemological in character. In particular, both emphasize the loss of knowledge resulting from attempts to achieve synoptic legibility of complex social practices. Yet, while Hayek's critique of central planning leads to an emphasis on the indispensability of the price system, Scott argues that capitalist markets are also mechanisms of perverse simplification. This paper explores the roots of this disagreement and seeks to articulate the insights that emerge from reading Hayek and Scott together on questions of markets, knowledge, and the state.

Abstract: Society today is struggling with various challenging phenomena. This manuscript aims to analyse two phenomena, ageing and digitalisation, in the context of education. Both phenomena are an important area of research: the complexity of an ageing population and the intersection of technology and education. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the opportunity to improve the educational experiences of older adults. AI-driven tools and educational initiatives can be tailored to the different learning preferences and cognitive abilities of this population, promoting engagement and knowledge retention. The adaptability of AI systems enables personalised learning pathways that address individual challenges and promote lifelong learning and cognitive health in older learners. This research will highlight the critical role of AI in reshaping educational paradigms and its potential to facilitate knowledge acquisition and empower an often-marginalised population. Finally, focusing on the role of international projects will allow us to understand the trends in EU research and funding. Understanding the impact of AI on education in the third age and EU funding invites a broader discussion on inclusivity and innovation in the educational landscape.

Abstract: Classroom Response System (CRS) is a promising educational tool that can create an interactive learning space. In high school, less is known about its impact on learning mathematics. Most studies on the integration of CRS in teaching and learning use internet-dependent tool. This paper aimed to determine the effectiveness of the CRS that uses Bluetooth technology in improving the mathematics achievement and knowledge retention of the students. A quasi-experimental design and longitudinal study with post-test and delayed post-test was employed in this study. The assessment and re-administered assessment results of the CRS and Traditional Classroom Instruction (TCI) groups were compared. Data were analyzed using an independent sample t-test and Welch t-test, and the Mean Percentage Scores (MPS) were calculated to determine the achievement level. Findings revealed that there was a significant difference between the assessment of the CRS and the TCI groups. Moreover, the re-administered assessment results suggest that students exposed to CRS have better knowledge retention compared to the TCI. Furthermore, the MPS showed that CRS exhibited higher mastery level of the learning competencies over the TCI group.

Abstract: As medical education becomes more complex, the demand for advanced teaching and training methods has grown. Technological advancements have opened up new possibilities, particularly in the realm of virtual reality (VR) simulations for training. Introduction As medical education becomes more complex, the demand for advanced teaching and training methods has grown. Technological advancements have opened up new possibilities, particularly in the realm of virtual reality (VR) simulations for training.Our prospective, randomized pilot study aims to assess whether a novel VR-based 3D training platform can effectively teach the knowledge and skills needed for complex spinal surgery, specifically pedicle screw placement. Material and MethodsWe enrolled 25 participants who received either a traditional lecture (control group, n=11) or a VR lecture with identical content featuring 3D/VR anatomical models (VR group, n=14). The VR group also underwent VR simulation for pedicle screw placement. We evaluated their learning through a quiz, a practical skills test, and selfassessment questionnaires.

Material and MethodsWe enrolled 25 participants who received either a traditional lecture (control group, n=11) or a VR lecture with identical content featuring 3D/VR anatomical models (VR group, n=14). The VR group also underwent VR simulation for pedicle screw placement. We evaluated their learning through a quiz, a practical skills test, and selfassessment questionnaires.In the theory multiple-choice test, the contral group scored an average of 69% (range 53-87%, SD 0.10), while the VR group scored 66% (range 47-87%, SD 0.11) (p=0.692, independent sample t-test).For the practical DOPS test (pedicle screw placement), the average score was 2.4 points (n=25; range 1-4). The VR group on average scored 2.9 points compared to the control (2 points) (p=0.134). Discussion and Conclusion Our study indicates that teaching with a new 3D VR training tool yields results comparable to traditional methods in terms of knowledge retention. This research supports the platform's effectiveness as an educational resource. Importantly, trainees can apply VR-acquired knowledge to real surgical procedures, which are well-received.

Abstract: Background Retrieval practice is a highly effective learning strategy that enhances long-term retention by encouraging the active recall of information. However, the optimal question format for maximizing knowledge retention remains uncertain. In this study, we compared the effect of very short answer (VSAQ) versus multiple-choice question (MCQ) practice tests on students’ knowledge retention. By analyzing these two formats, we aim to identify the most effective approach to retrieval practice, thereby helping to optimize its implementation and improve learning outcomes. Methods In this randomized within-subjects study, students ( n  = 45) practiced with both VSAQs and MCQs in an extracurricular lifestyle course, without receiving feedback. The final retention test consisted of identical questions in both formats. A 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine the effect of question format in practice testing and final test on final test score. Additionally, digital questionnaires were used to explore students’ test-taking experiences. Results The VSAQs were answered incorrectly more frequently on the practice tests and final test. There was no main effect of practice question format on final test performance, and no interaction effect between question format on the practice and final test. Regardless of question format, most students thought the practice tests were beneficial for learning. Conclusions We found no evidence indicating that either MCQ or VSAQ is more effective for knowledge retention during retrieval practice. The lower initial retrieval success in the VSAQs, indicated by the higher degree of incorrect answers on the practice tests, might have limited their effectiveness during retrieval practice. To optimize the use of VSAQs in retrieval practice, it seems important to improve initial retrieval success to maximize learning outcomes. Clinical trial number Not applicable.

Author: Pacala, Frank Angelo    

Publication info: Pacala, Frank Angelo. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/use-technology-teaching-physics-students-with/docview/3152079980/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: In recent years, incorporating technology into education for students with disabilities has significantly improved learning experiences and academic achievement. However, there remains a need for a deeper understanding of the most effective methods for using these technologies, particularly in physics education. This systematic review aims to consolidate research on the use of technology to support learning for students with disabilities, assess its effectiveness in improving educational outcomes, and identify areas for further study. The review focuses on the constructs, technological interventions, research gaps, limitations, and key findings from selected articles. The PRISMA framework was used to analyze research from databases, including EBSCO Host, Elsevier Science Direct, Emerald Insight, ProQuest, Google Scholar, ERIC, and Clarivate Analytics Web of Science. Out of 892 articles initially identified, 13 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and validation from the experts. The most commonly studied disability was visual impairment, followed by intellectual disabilities. Most studies focused on learner achievement, with engagement and participation as secondary themes. The technologies used included assistive tools like web-based platforms, virtual and augmented reality (AR), and interactive learning systems. These adaptive technologies improved student involvement, social integration, and interest in science. Augmented reality, in particular, enhanced academic performance and knowledge retention, making it an effective tool for inclusive physics education. The findings indicate a growing trend towards integrating technology in inclusive education, emphasizing the role of personalized tools in improving accessibility and engagement for students with disabilities in physics. Alternate abstract: В останні роки впровадження технологій в освіту для студентів з обмеженими можливостями значно покращило їх навчання та академічну успішність. Однак залишається потреба ширшому застосуванні найбільш ефективних методів використання технологій, зокрема в навчанні фізики. Цей систематичний огляд має на меті консолідувати дослідження щодо використання технологій для підтримки навчання учнів з обмеженими можливостями, оцінити їхню ефективність з покращення результатів навчання та визначити напрями подальшого дослідження. Огляд зосереджується на конструкціях, впровадженні технологій, прогалинах у дослідженнях, обмеженнях і основних висновках з вибраних статей. Для аналізу досліджень з баз даних, як-от EBSCO Host, Elsevier Science Direct, Emerald Insight, ProQuest, Google Scholar, ERIC та Clarivate Analytics Web of Science був використаний метод PRISMA. З 892 відібраних статей, 13 відповідали критеріям включення та виключення, а також були схвалені експертами. Найбільш часто досліджуваними обмеженнями можливостей учнів були порушення зору та інтелектуальні порушення. Більшість досліджень зосереджувались на результатах навчання учнів, а залучення учнів до навчального процесу та участь їх у ньому були другорядними темами. Використовувані технології мали допоміжні інструменти, такі як вебплатформи, віртуальна і доповнена реальність (AR) та інтерактивні навчальні системи. Ці адаптивні технології сприяли залученню учнів до навчання, їх соціальній інтеграції та підвищенню їх інтересу до науки. Доповнена реальність, зокрема, покращила академічну успішність та сприяла збереженню знань, що робить її ефективним інструментом для інклюзивної освіти з фізики. Отримані результати свідчать про зростаючу тенденцію інтеграції технологій в інклюзивну освіту, завдяки важливій ролі персоналізованих інструментів у підвищенні доступності та залученості учнів з обмеженими можливостями до вивчення фізики.

Abstract: This study analyzes the impact of interactive technologies on the motivation and engagement of university students in online courses. Through a systematic literature review and a comparative analysis of existing technologies, 64 articles published between 2020 and 2024 were examined. The results reveal a significant increase in student motivation (23%) and knowledge retention (31%) with the use of these tools. Augmented reality stands out with a mean effect size of 0.67 on academic performance. The bibliometric analysis shows a concentration of research in countries such as Spain, Colombia and China, suggesting the need for more diverse studies. Challenges such as the digital divide and lack of teacher training were identified, with 42% of teachers reporting difficulties in implementation. The findings underline the transformative potential of interactive technologies in online higher education, but emphasize the importance of a holistic approach that considers technical, pedagogical and socioeconomic aspects. It is recommended to invest in teacher professional development, promote equitable access policies and encourage research in diverse educational contexts to maximize the benefits of these technologies.

Abstract: Active learning techniques are taking the classroom by storm. Numerous research articles have highlighted the benefits of active learning techniques on student understanding, knowledge retention, problem solving, and teamwork. One avenue to introduce active learning into the classroom is the gamification of course learning content. Educational escape rooms are one such example in which students solve a series of puzzles related to course content to “escape” within a set time frame. Escape games play an interesting role in motivating students, building communication skills and allowing for multimodal learning, having been shown to increase students’ test results and enjoyment of the course content. In lieu of the traditional escape room format, a fully immersive room(s) with classical escape room puzzles (finding items, riddles, alternative locking mechanisms) is used alongside learning activities, and educators have begun to develop truncated activities for easier applications in larger classrooms. In this review, we explore several escape room activities: immersive, paper-based, Battle Boxes, condensed escape activities, and online/virtual, providing examples of the types of puzzles included therein. We similarly discuss the creation of escape room materials and recommendations for the interested educator, as well as the learning benefits of engaging in puzzle development. Finally, we provide an overview on methods to assess active learning through escape rooms, establishing an overview of empirical evidence towards their effectiveness as a learning tool.

Abstract: Introduction In the rapidly evolving field of medical education, gamification has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance clinical reasoning skills among healthcare professionals. By incorporating game-like elements into the learning environment, gamification strives to enhance engagement, motivation and knowledge retention. Given the importance of clinical reasoning in medical decision-making and patient care, this scoping review protocol aims to systematically explore developments, implementations and outcomes of gamification in clinical reasoning education. Methods and analysis The scoping review will follow the Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework, enhanced by guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute. We will search four major databases: OVID Medline, Scopus and Web of Science using key terms such as “gamification,” “clinical reasoning,” and “medical education”. Studies will be selected based on the participants, concepts and contexts (PCC) framework, focusing on literature published in English. Two independent reviewers will screen studies and extract data on gamification elements used in clinical reasoning education. Any disagreement between the reviewers will be resolved by consulting a third person. We will provide a narrative synthesis of the findings, highlighting the variety of gamified strategies and their effects on clinical reasoning skills. This review will also map out gaps in the current literature and provide direction for future research. Ethics and dissemination The scoping review, which aggregates and synthesises publicly available studies, does not require ethics approval due to its nature as a compilation of existing research. The reporting of findings will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist, promoting both thoroughness and transparency in our analysis. Our dissemination plan encompasses publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presentations at academic conferences focused on medical education. This strategy is designed to engage educators, curriculum designers and policymakers within the sector, ensuring our insights reach those who can apply them most effectively.

Abstract: Patient education is crucial in managing chronic diseases like Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). Traditional methods such as videos and brochures often fail to maintain long-term knowledge retention. Therapeutic Patient Education (TPE) offers a more effective, patient-centered approach. Introduction Patient education is crucial in managing chronic diseases like Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). Traditional methods such as videos and brochures often fail to maintain long-term knowledge retention. Therapeutic Patient Education (TPE) offers a more effective, patient-centered approach.PAFLAR aimed to implement a TPE program with a "train the trainers" masterclass to ensure effective delivery and improve outcomes for children with JIA. Objective PAFLAR aimed to implement a TPE program with a "train the trainers" masterclass to ensure effective delivery and improve outcomes for children with JIA.PAFLAR's TPE program was designed through a focus group, involving a literature review and strategic planning for the implementation step. The program includes specialized training for healthcare professionals enhancing their abilities to deliver TPE workshops. Participants were selected based on volunteerism and commitment to the project. Evaluations were conducted through feedback assessment of both patients and participants. Methods PAFLAR's TPE program was designed through a focus group, involving a literature review and strategic planning for the implementation step. The program includes specialized training for healthcare professionals enhancing their abilities to deliver TPE workshops. Participants were selected based on volunteerism and commitment to the project. Evaluations were conducted through feedback assessment of both patients and participants.PAFLAR launched a TPE program in 2023, aimed at training healthcare providers to implement TPE effectively. This initiative included both in-person and virtual masterclasses, resulting in five workshops conducted in Kenya, Tunisia, and Nigeria. These workshops covered various aspects of JIA management, such as patient and family education, self-esteem, physical activity, treatment adherence, and pain management. Early results showed significant improvements in patients' and parents' understanding and management of JIA, with positive feedback indicating a need for further sessions.

Abstract: Chronobiology and sleep medicine are pivotal disciplines for understanding human health. Additionally, the lack of training in medical schools exacerbates the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of sleep disorders. This study investigated the exposure of Brazilian medical students to chronobiology and sleep medicine during their undergraduate education and assessed their knowledge in these areas. The study was conducted between December 2021 and June 2022 through the administration of an online questionnaire (Google Forms) to medical students in the final two years of undergraduate studies. The questionnaire gathered student data (i.e., sex, age, and educational institution), research data (stage in the medical program with exposure to chronobiology or sleep medicine), and responses to a questionnaire on basic knowledge of sleep medicine and chronobiology (adapted from Assessing Sleep Knowledge in Medical Education - ASKME). A total of 240 students from medical schools in Brazil participated, 4.6% of whom reported no exposure to either subject, with exposure declining as students progressed through the curriculum. Only 3.7% reported specific disciplines covering these topics. Over half of the students encountered learning barriers, such as limited curriculum time. Despite these challenges, the accuracy rate in responses regarding chronobiology and sleep medicine was 79.75%, positively correlating with exposure level and knowledge retention. This study underscores the urgent need for enhanced education in sleep medicine and chronobiology within Brazilian medical schools. It offers insights into the current landscape of sleep medicine education in Brazil and lays groundwork for future efforts to integrate these essential subjects into medical school curricula.Chronobiology and sleep medicine are pivotal disciplines for understanding human health.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of multimedia elements into webpages, videos have emerged as a popular medium for enhancing user engagement and knowledge retention. However, irrelevant or poorly placed videos can hinder readability and distract users from the core content of a webpage. This paper proposes a novel approach leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess the relevance of video content on educational websites, thereby enhancing readability and user engagement. By using a cosine similarity-based relevance scoring method, we measured the alignment between video transcripts and webpage text, aiming to improve the user’s comprehension of complex topics presented on educational platforms. Our results demonstrated a strong correlation between automated relevance scores and user ratings, with an improvement of over 35% in relevance alignment. The methodology was evaluated across 50 educational websites representing diverse subjects, including science, mathematics, and language learning. We conducted a two-phase evaluation process: an automated scoring phase using cosine similarity, followed by a user study with 100 participants who rated the relevance of videos to webpage content. The findings support the significance of integrating NLP-driven video relevance assessments for enhanced readability on educational websites, highlighting the potential for broader applications in e-learning.

Abstract: Purpose The paucity of artisans in some construction trades and the transitioning of the experience of the few for sustainability calls for concern. Mentorship programmes offer a promising mechanism to support construction artisans through those transitions. Mentorship may enhance artisan decent work and economic growth, like increased income for artisans. This is part of Sustainable Development Goal 8 (Goal 8). Hence, this study aims to investigate issues hindering construction artisan skills growth and suggest measures to improve construction artisan skills through mentorship mechanisms to achieve Goal 8. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a qualitative approach and collected data via oral interviews with knowledgeable participants. The participants were consultant experts in mentorship and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) matters, construction organisation management staffers and construction artisans in the Nigerian construction industry. The study covered Lagos and Abuja and achieved saturation at the 30th interviewee. Also, the research utilised a thematic method to analyse the collated data. Findings Enhanced knowledge sharing accelerates junior artisans’ learning skills quickly, improving artisans’ performance, ensuring sustainability of the skills learned (knowledge retention), encouraging collaboration, building the next generation of leaders and transitioning of experience to mentees emerged as mentorship’s role in developing construction artisans’ skills. Findings show that mentorship mechanisms to develop construction artisan skills face encumbrances. The perceived 32 encumbrances were re-clustered into mentee, mentor and government-related encumbrances. Also, achieving Goal 8 regarding construction artisans may be threatened if these issues are not checked. Thus, the study recommended measures improving construction artisan skills through mentorship mechanisms to achieve Goal 8. Originality/value Identifying the major encumbrances facing construction artisan skills improvement through mentorship would be useful to advocate measures to improve construction artisan’s skills to achieve Goal 8.

Abstract: Background Traditional dental anatomy education, reliant on cadaver dissections and lectures, faces challenges such as high costs, ethical concerns, and difficulty conveying complex 3D dental structures. Virtual reality (VR) offers a solution by providing immersive, interactive learning environments that can enhance students’ understanding. This study systematically reviews the effectiveness of VR in dental anatomy education compared to traditional methods, focusing on its potential to improve learning outcomes. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted across Web of Science (WoS), PubMed, and Scopus databases until May 2024. Data were extracted, summarized, and analyzed for qualitative synthesis. The following keywords and their combinations were used: " dental OR dentistry”, “education OR teaching”, “virtual AND reality OR VR”, and “anatomy OR dental AND anatomy”. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: Investigated the use of VR in anatomy education. Compared VR-based learning to other methods such as lecture-based teaching, 3D printed or natural models, or non-interactive 3D models. Quantitative synthesis was performed using standardized mean differences (SMD) with Hedges’d and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Out of 178 records screened, seven studies were included in the meta-analysis and eight in the personal evaluation analysis. The analysis indicates a moderately positive effect of VR on dental anatomy education (SMD = 0.74, p  = 0.05) compared to lecture-based education using X-ray, CBCT, or 3D models. However, at the same time, VR falls short compared to clinical experience, training with physical teeth, or quality printed models. Studies reported rare cases of discomfort, disorientation, diplopic image, and VR sickness. Conclusions The use of VR-based learning moderately positively affects educational outcomes, and enhances knowledge retention, especially before clinical experience. The personal evaluation of students showed a strong interest in VR, with positive feedback on its ease of use, accuracy, and educational value.

Abstract: Background The use of immersive technology in healthcare education is on the rise, yet its impact on learner engagement, knowledge retention, and specifically in areas like hand hygiene training, remains underexplored. The aim of this scoping review was to summarize the existing studies of immersive technology in hand hygiene training of healthcare providers and health professions students. Methods A scoping review following the Levac et al. framework was conducted. The literature search was performed in databases PubMed, CINAHL Ultimate, ScienceDirect (Elsevier), Web of Science in addition to Google Scholar and ProQuest Dissertation & Theses. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis: Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRIMSA-ScR) guideline was used to report the results. We analysed data using tabular and descriptive summary. Results In the final analysis 11 studies from seven countries were included. Most of the studies ( n  = 10, 90,91%) used virtual reality in hand hygiene training of healthcare providers and health professions students. Most studies have found that immersive technology is useful in teaching hand hygiene ( n  = 6, 54,55%). There are some theories and concepts that support the teaching of hand hygiene with immersive technology, but most of the research is not supported by them. Theories or concepts were included in two studies (18,18%). Conclusion Immersive technology, especially virtual reality, enhances hand hygiene learning and engagement compared to traditional methods. However, most studies lack theoretical support. To advance this field, exploring immersive technology for further research and incorporating relevant theories is encouraged. Additionally, conducting a thorough cost-effectiveness analysis and establishing a robust evaluation framework, encompassing both short-term and long-term outcomes, will be beneficial for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of immersive technology in hand hygiene education.

One aspect that is important to design is game mechanics and game play that are effective for the target user. This study evaluates the design mechanics and gameplay effectiveness of a serious game, “Smoverse 2,” developed to enhance preventive education on the dangers of smoking among adolescents aged 13–15 years. Utilizing the Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) model, the game was designed to balance educational content with engaging gameplay to improve learning outcomes. “Smoverse 2,” a role-playing game, was compared to “Smoverse 1,” an action-adventure game, to assess their impacts on player engagement and knowledge retention. The study involved 90 middle school students, divided into control and experimental groups, using A/B testing methodology. The Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ) was employed to measure various dimensions of the player experience, including immersion, flow, competence, positive and negative affect, tension, and challenge. Results indicate that “Smoverse 2” significantly improves player engagement and educational effectiveness by effectively integrating entertainment aspects, thereby demonstrating the value of balancing educational content with engaging game mechanics in serious games.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 Joint 13th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems and 25th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligent Systems (SCIS&ISIS) Conference Start Date: 2024, Nov. 9 Conference End Date: 2024, Nov. 12 Conference Location: Himeji, Japan Conventional machine learning methods require devices to transfer their data to a central server because the server intensively stores all the data and trains the model. However, if the data are sensitive or large in volume, sending them may cause problems in terms of privacy and network bandwidth consumption. To address these problems, federated learning (FL), in which data are distributed across devices without being aggregated into a server, has garnered attention. Moreover, decentralized FL (DFL) is a serverless learning method that improves the accuracy of each client model by exchanging information necessary for model learning with neighboring clients in a distributed network to which the clients are directly connected. In this study, we propose a novel method of DFL that maintains data and model secrecy through knowledge distillation. To use knowledge distillation effectively, we utilize a data-free model distillation using mismatch data. Furthermore, to avoid rapid accuracy degradation during training, the knowledge loss function in the proposed method incorporates the output of its initial model into error calculations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves accuracy compared with the case in which each client learns using only their own data.

Abstract: Background and objectives The pitstop method of teaching involves short educational videos that entail a stepwise approach to augment knowledge retention and understanding. Short videos stimulate both visual and auditory pathways, thereby improving learner’s experiences, knowledge retention, and understanding of the concept, which will help with long-term memory. In this study, we aimed to compare the pitstop method of teaching with the didactic lecture technique based on assessment and feedback. Methodology After obtaining the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) approval, a comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 210 phase II MBBS students who gave consent to participate in the study. Two sessions comprising a total of 10 videos with five videos in each session were planned for a particular system. Two types of teaching methodology were used in the videos. For session 1, a short video using a presentation template was used. For session 2, a short video using hand notes and figures was prepared and incorporated into the video. Each video was two minutes in duration. Students were divided into A and B batches. For session 1, A batch was the control group and B batch was the test group; for session 2, the test and control groups were reversed. Pre-test and post-test exercises were conducted for each session. Results were analyzed and statistical analysis was performed at the end of the project. Results An analysis of both sessions was done for the A and B batches. For session 1, the test group fared well with a mean of 4.50 compared to the control group with a mean of 3.53. For session 2, the test group performed well with a mean of 4.43 compared to the control group with a mean of 3.87. No significant difference was observed when the test groups of the two sessions were compared (p=0.74). Conclusions Short videos delivered by using the pitstop method will help stimulate memory and enhance the attention of students to better process the information. We believe that the implementation of this method will lead to good outcomes among the students.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 5th International Conference on Big Data & Artificial Intelligence & Software Engineering (ICBASE) Conference Start Date: 2024, Sept. 20 Conference End Date: 2024, Sept. 22 Conference Location: Wenzhou, China Despite significant progresses in single-label class incremental learning (CIL), its multi-label counterpart remains relatively understudied which is called multi-label class incremental learning (MLCIL). In MLCIL, newly introduced samples are exclusively labeled with new classes, necessitating heavy reliance on pseudo-label generation to compensate for missing annotations. Simply adapting CIL methods to MLCIL is ineffective due to the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and lack of learned labels. To address these issues, we propose Global and Local Graph Convolution Network (GL-GCN), incorporating Global Graph Convolution Network (G-GConv) and Local Graph Convolution Network (L-GConv) modules. GGConv captures inter-session connections, while L-GConv preserves intra-session class relationships for knowledge retention. Additionally, asymmetric loss is introduced to mitigate class imbalance. Experimental results demonstrate our method’s superiority over existing approaches.

Abstract: Pediatric nursing students are required to be taught how to overcome their own psychological stress during their internship in order to understand sick children’s emotional reactions, as well as to be able to interact and communicate with such children. This quasi-experimental study proves that the application of AI image health education e-books by the nursing teacher is more effective than traditional paper handout teaching materials in improving nursing students’ self-efficacy when using therapeutic games to deal with and reduce sick children’s fears of medical examinations and treatments ( p < 0.05). AI-driven tools can enable the development of personalized e-learning materials that target specific areas for cognitive improvement. This targeted approach can enhance knowledge retention and skill development, resulting in better-prepared healthcare professionals.

Technological Interface Components That Support Accelerated Learning in the Acquisition of Foreign Language Vocabulary

Abstract: There is a need to find innovative learning methods that enable accelerated learning of a foreign language. This study examined the effect of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in acquiring a foreign language, which combines cognitive and emotional stimuli in the background. The study explored two factors related to the acquisition of a foreign language: the duration and scope of the learning process and the depth of internalization of the newly acquired language. Another objective was to assess the learning method in two learning environments, 2D and VR, to determine if the learning environment affects the learning results and leads to better vocabulary retention. One hundred native French speakers, with an average age of 47.5, participated in the study and had no prior knowledge of the newly acquired language. We randomly divided the participants into two groups (2D and VR). They studied 550 words in a new language for five days: 30 min each evening and 15 min in the morning. The post-learning test pointed out that both groups improved their vocabulary scores significantly. Approximately one month after the learning experience, we administered a knowledge retention test to 32 participants and found that the level of knowledge had been retained. Finally, background variables (e.g., gender, age, and previous knowledge of the newly acquired language) did not affect the learning results. The findings indicate that CALL, which integrates background cognitive and emotional stimuli in both learning environments, significantly accelerates learning pace, broadens the scope of newly acquired words, and ensures retention. The level of improvement observed in our study is notably higher than that reported in the literature for studies that had previously evaluated CALL and in-class language acquisition.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 30th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP) Conference Start Date: 2024, Oct. 3 Conference End Date: 2024, Oct. 5 Conference Location: Leeds, United Kingdom Virtual reality (VR) technology has been successfully applied to training and learning across multiple fields, significantly enhancing user training outcomes and experience. However, current research on virtual equipment training platforms primarily focuses on virtual assembly, algorithm optimization, and collision detection, with little emphasis on user experience and immersion. Therefore, this paper explores the cognitive needs of users in VR-based training environments from the perspective of embodied cognition. Through Think-aloud experiments, user research, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), combined with insights from embodied cognition theory, the primary factors affecting user cognition in virtual reality equipment training are identified. These factors can provide guidance for the design of future VR training systems, ensuring they are more aligned with natural learning processes and user interactions, ultimately leading to improved user satisfaction, deeper knowledge retention, and more effective training outcomes.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 15th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT) Conference Start Date: 2024, June 24 Conference End Date: 2024, June 28 Conference Location: Kamand, India We are attempting to address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, in which the model forgets previously learned information upon learning new information. So, we are trying to train a model on some tasks and then utilize the updated weights and parameters for the new task while preserving the model’s ability to perform classification of the old and new tasks correctly. Also, as the model must learn a vast amount of new information over time, it is impossible to store all the information as the model will have limited memory. Therefore, the model should also learn what to forget and what not to forget. This research proposed a new approach for continual learning that draws inspiration from the way Hebbian learning occurs in biological systems. The relevance of each neural network parameter is calculated during model training based on the sensitivity of the final output function that changes in the parameter. Modifying parameters during the training of a new task will impose penalties, thereby avoiding the loss of important knowledge from previous tasks. Using the AlexNet model, we are putting our strategy to the test on several object identification tasks.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 15th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT) Conference Start Date: 2024, June 24 Conference End Date: 2024, June 28 Conference Location: Kamand, India In order to improve meeting efficiency in the ever-changing workplace, research has mostly focused on sophisticated text summarization techniques such as machine learning, hybrid, semantic, and graph-based methods. These approaches have shown efficient in extracting key information from lengthy talks, hence dramatically improving decision-making and knowledge retention. However, their potential has been somewhat limited by a major concentration on processing material in a single language, which ignores the complex, multilingual environment of modern global enterprises. Our most recent research project tries to overcome this gap by combining these various summarizing approaches into acomplete, language-neutral framework.Furthermore, to address the specific difficulty of long meetings, when extracting insights might be especially difficult for those who are not there, we propose using the Longformer encoder-decoder paradigm. This methodology excels at distilling lengthy talks into digestible summaries, regardless of the original language, ensuring that critical insights are easily accessible to anybody, hence increasing inclusion and comprehension across multinational teams.

Abstract: The current study examines the relative impact of take home (open book) examinations (THE) and in class (closed book) examinations (ICE) on student academic performance and wellbeing outcomes. Specifically, this study contributes to our understanding about students' long-term knowledge retention, measured four to six months after completing the course. A unique longitudinal dataset consisting of four cohorts of a social science bachelor and master course that implemented either a THE or ICE in successive years was used. Survey data included wellbeing and academic performance measures as well as a 10-item knowledge retention quiz. Within the master course, the ICE cohort had higher examination grades and higher knowledge retention scores than the cohorts that completed a THE. In the bachelor course, there were no differences in knowledge retention across cohorts. Examination score was associated with higher knowledge retention scores across both courses. One bachelor cohort reported lower wellbeing compared to others (cohort 2021-2022); however, we found no further differences in academic or wellbeing outcomes based on examination form. The findings suggest a slight advantage of ICEs over THEs with regard to academic performance.

Abstract: In recent decades, a noticeable trend has emerged in medical and dental schools to adjust their curricula to promote learning strategies and habits geared towards long-term knowledge retention. This systematic review therefore sought to examine whether different teaching methods influence students' preferred learning approaches (deep, strategic, and surface approach) and indirectly affect their academic performance. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive overview of the inconsistencies evident in previous literature regarding the relationship between learning approaches and academic performance of medical and dental students. A thorough search across eight databases yielded 49 relevant studies published between the years 2000 and 2023. The majority of studies revealed that whilst deep and strategic learners tend to excel at medical or dental school, surface learners appear to struggle under intense workload and pressure. Hence, a common consensus emerged amongst the existing literature that there is a relative benefit in attempting to guide students towards deep and strategic learning habits and to minimise surface-related learning strategies. However, results also conveyed that merely modifying the teaching methods used in medical and dental schools has limited merit. As such, the results emphasised the lack of a 'one-size-fits-all' teaching method. Common factors influencing learning approaches were subsequently identified, and based on these findings, an outlook was put forth to integrate a cognitive neuroscience approach into higher education. These directions for future investigations aim to help students reach their full potential by understanding the processes underlying efficient learning and by being mindful of respective encouraging and discouraging factors.

Abstract: High-resolution displays on mobile devices, accurate motion sensors, and efficient mobile processors have taken virtual reality (VR), essentially employed in laboratory, to everyday environments, including homes, workplaces, and classrooms. Regarding programming education, it has been investigated in conjunction with various educational strategies, such as block-based programming (BBP), metaphors, and storytelling. However, studies that adopt VR predominantly employ high-end head-mounted displays (HMDs) and powerful computers to deliver interactive and immersive learning experiences. Conversely, investigations involving mobile platforms and low-cost HMDs often lack user interactivity. Towards filling that gap, this study introduces SSPOT-VR (Space Station for Programming Training in Virtual Reality), a cost-effective solution tailored for children and teenagers that integrates interactive methods for the teaching and learning of programming concepts and the simulated experience of an immersive digitally created world. Three surveys, namely S[subscript 1], S[subscript 2] and S[subscript 3], involving SSPOT-VR and K-12 students were conducted. S[subscript 1] and S[subscript 2] focused on user acceptance (n[subscript 1] = 124 and n[subscript 2] = 16 ) and S[subscript 3] centered on knowledge retention (n[subscript 3] = 31 ). The results indicate students are inclined to accept SSPOT-VR as a valuable educational tool, since it effectively facilitates the retention of programming knowledge through its engaging and interactive learning experiences. By choosing more cost-effective equipment, this research supports the existing body of knowledge while also providing a detailed description of how an effective solution is designed, developed, and used. The approach enhances both affordability and potential applications of immersive VR in programming education.

Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive exploration of ipsative and sociomaterial assessment methodologies, dissecting their theoretical frameworks, practical implementations, and the resultant effects on educational paradigms. The purpose of this article is to introduce a combined ipsative-sociomaterial assessment framework for science education at universities. The potential of this novel assessment methodology to influence student engagement, knowledge retention and educator practices is explored. Through a detailed analysis of existing literature and case studies, the article seeks to understand how these methods can transform science education. Four key themes are emerging: science education naturally leads to sociomaterial assessment, enhancing learning through ipsative feedback, measuring personal learning gain and reconciling ipsative with conventional assessment practices in the era of generative AI. Practical aspects of implementation in different online learning environments are discussed as well as institutional challenges that must be overcome. It is concluded that ipsative-sociomaterial assessment represents a transformative, yet natural approach in science higher education with the promise to enhance the educational experience and to provide a richer, more accurate reflection of student learning and achievement.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC) Conference Start Date: 2024, June 26 Conference End Date: 2024, June 29 Conference Location: Paris, France Traditional and indigenous medicine, deeply rooted in ancient traditions and wisdom, plays a crucial role in global healthcare and cultural identity. These practices provide treatments for illnesses such as cancer and bone injuries, which often lack effective remedies in Western medicine. However, these valuable systems face challenges like potential knowledge loss, undervaluation of practitioners’ expertise, and the risk of fraud due to the absence of credential verification mechanisms. In this research, we introduce "WedaGPT," a Generative AI-enabled platform that utilizes a custom-trained Meta’s Llama2 Large Language Model (LLM), Blockchain, self-sovereign identity (SSI), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and model cards to share traditional medical knowledge and address these issues. WedaGPT creates a collaborative ecosystem connecting doctors, medicine providers, therapists, patients, and technology experts, all committed to preserving and advancing traditional healing practices. This platform enables secure and transparent contributions from all stakeholders to patient well-being. Ancient medical recipe books are translated into English and digitized into PDF formats to enrich the platform’s knowledge base. These texts are used to fine-tune the Llama2 LLM, which has been quantized and optimized with Qlora for performance on consumer-grade hardware. Through a chat-based interface in the SSI-enabled mobile wallet, users can interact with the LLM and access detailed information on treatments, recipes, prescriptions, and healing methods. Additionally, users can consult remotely with doctors who prescribe treatments through this wallet. A key feature of WedaGPT is transforming ancient medicinal recipes into NFT tokens for sale on NFT marketplaces, giving traditional knowledge digital authenticity and economic value. Revenue from these sales is distributed among platform contributors, promoting equitable ownership and recognition. Medical recipe data, including treatment histories and physician details, are encapsulated in Model Cards and securely stored on the blockchain. This system offers mechanisms to verify doctors and treatments in a privacy-preserving way, potentially reducing fraud and medication errors.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 9th South-East Europe Design Automation, Computer Engineering, Computer Networks and Social Media Conference (SEEDA-CECNSM) Conference Start Date: 2024, Sept. 20 Conference End Date: 2024, Sept. 22 Conference Location: Athens, Greece The study identifies how the game elements of points, badges, and leaderboards could be used to engage students to enhance learning outcomes in educational settings. As the innovative teaching paradigm is gaining importance every day, gamification is unrolling as a provoking approach to engaging and motivating students by making the learning process more captivating and interactive. Thus, the main goal is to consider how these factors impact students' intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and how they can result in better academic performance and higher knowledge retention. Besides, the work will help to evaluate how consistent gamification is with the existing educational theories, which are behaviorism, constructivism, and cognitivism, and how these theories help to implement those elements of gamification effectively. The paper discusses how its practicality and success in diverse educational environments have been highlighted using a good number of case studies. Eventually, it tries to give an overall view of gamification's role in modern education and emphasizes the potentiality of redefining traditional learning paradigms.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 9th South-East Europe Design Automation, Computer Engineering, Computer Networks and Social Media Conference (SEEDA-CECNSM) Conference Start Date: 2024, Sept. 20 Conference End Date: 2024, Sept. 22 Conference Location: Athens, Greece This paper shows the development and application of a fuzzy weight model methodology for the optimization of educational environments in augmented reality. A technology-based learning process in an augmented reality learning environment, notoriously able to improve spatial abilities and increase user engagement with the material learned as well as knowledge retention, has revolutionary potential in education. However, its effectiveness varies greatly. In this, we collaborated with 13 experts in augmented reality and education to deeply evaluate the following six key in-depth strategies: interactive feedback, gamified leaderboards, challenges, personalized learning path, AR-based simulations, and badges. Thus, strategies were rated upon the impact on the learners' outcome, and the ratings were agreed upon as a fuzzy set, because it is a subjective matter of evaluation. Normalization was done to get a balanced measurement that gave weights on which strategies are to be given higher priority. Such a model has been developed and implemented in a case study of AR-based spatial ability training application, focusing on AR-based simulations supplemented with interactive feedback. Pre- and post-tests among 30 respondents have shown significant improvements in the experimental group using the AR application over the control group using traditional means of spatial ability training. The results strongly support the potential of the model for later implementation in AR educational applications that focus on individual specifics and effective learning.

Abstract: Educational chatbots (ECs) can offer instructional feedback to enhance learning. However, the effect of metacognitive feedback on science education has not been fully explored. This study focuses on the effect of the EC with metacognitive feedback on students’ knowledge retention, transfer, and intrinsic motivation in the field of biology science. A between-group experimental design with 62 college students was conducted. Students in the experiment group received metacognitive feedback, whereas students in the control group received no feedback. The results of the ANCOVA test showed that students in the experiment group demonstrated better knowledge retention and transfer than those in the control group (F = 13.11, p = 0.001; F = 14.39, p < 0.001). Further, students in the experiment group reported more learning interest and higher perceived competence and value than those in the control group (F = 3.72, p = 0.001; F = 1.91, p = 0.009; F = 2.70, p = 0.004). In addition, correlation analysis revealed that perceived competence in the metacognitive feedback group was positively related to knowledge transfer (r = 0.39, p = 0.032). However, there was no significant difference in perceived pressure between both groups ( p = 0.203). This study highlights the potential of the EC with metacognitive feedback for science learning.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE 20th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE) Conference Start Date: 2024, Aug. 28 Conference End Date: 2024, Sept. 1 Conference Location: Bari, Italy System architecture decisions are typically informally captured in design documents. This practice leads to a loss of knowledge that impedes later activities like design changes, impact analysis, and reuse. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) frameworks support the development of increasingly complex systems but must address the problem of capitalization on architectural knowledge. To this end the "Decision Ontology for System Architectures (DOSA)" is developed to provide a formalized data model to capture system architecture decisions. DOSA is developed through a synthesis of decisions observed while developing an architecture model for a preliminary study of a novel satellite navigation system at Airbus Defence and Space. The approach is integrated into an MBSE framework enabling engineers to capture decisions that influence the architecture’s characteristics while developing the system model and imminently trace decision to artifacts of the system architecture. Subsequent visual inspection and formal querying of the decision graph facilitates the analysis of made decisions, and their interrelations.

Abstract: FAST Heroes is a kindergarten-based educational program that teaches young children and their extended families (parents, grandparents), the main stroke symptoms (Face, Arm, and Speech), and the timely and appropriate steps in the event of a suspected stroke (Time). However, post-campaign knowledge retention remains a challenge. Background FAST Heroes is a kindergarten-based educational program that teaches young children and their extended families (parents, grandparents), the main stroke symptoms (Face, Arm, and Speech), and the timely and appropriate steps in the event of a suspected stroke (Time). However, post-campaign knowledge retention remains a challenge.The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether and to what extent grandparents' stroke knowledge is maintained 44 months after the initial implementation of the program. Aims The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether and to what extent grandparents' stroke knowledge is maintained 44 months after the initial implementation of the program.Forty-five participants engaged in the present study (35 women, 10 men; 72.8§5.3) and completed an adapted version of the FAST Heroes Stroke Preparedness Questionnaire via phone calls. Methods Forty-five participants engaged in the present study (35 women, 10 men; 72.8§5.3) and completed an adapted version of the FAST Heroes Stroke Preparedness Questionnaire via phone calls.Compared to immediately post-program implementation, respondents were still able to recall arm weakness (OR = 1.63; p  = 0.246) and slurred speech (OR = 2.02; p  = 0.075) as main stroke symptoms. A decrease was observed in recalling facial drooping (OR = 0.44; p  = 0.042). Reporting of the appropriate course of action, was found to be increased (OR = 4.17; p  < 0.001). Respondents remembered the emergency number to call, i.e., 112 (OR = 0.97; p  = 0.947). Results Compared to immediately post-program implementation, respondents were still able to recall arm weakness (OR = 1.63; p = 0.246) and slurred speech (OR = 2.02; p = 0.075) as main stroke symptoms. A decrease was observed in recalling facial drooping (OR = 0.44; p = 0.042). Reporting of the appropriate course of action, was found to be increased (OR = 4.17; p < 0.001). Respondents remembered the emergency number to call, i.e., 112 (OR = 0.97; p = 0.947).The results showed that awareness regarding the common signs of a stroke and the importance of promptly contacting emergency services following a stroke, in the population group mostly affected by stroke, is retained. Exploring knowledge preservation in a greater sample size is warranted. Conclusion The results showed that awareness regarding the common signs of a stroke and the importance of promptly contacting emergency services following a stroke, in the population group mostly affected by stroke, is retained. Exploring knowledge preservation in a greater sample size is warranted.

Abstract: Background The integration of Virtual Reality (VR) with Case-Based Learning (CBL) has the potential to revolutionise undergraduate medical education, particularly in complex subjects such as the anatomy and rehabilitation of the shoulder joint. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of this innovative approach in enhancing learning outcomes and knowledge retention. Methods This study employed a parallel-group, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. A comprehensive five-week educational programme was developed, combining traditional lecture-based learning with VR-enhanced CBL. The study involved 82 undergraduate students from China Medical University, who were divided into groups receiving different combinations of VR and CBL. Student performance was evaluated through tests and questionnaires. Results In the anatomy-related courses, the integration of VR technology with CBL yielded significantly higher results (87.71 ± 5.60) compared to traditional methods (82.59 ± 6.64), with a statistically significant difference ( P    0.05). Conclusion The present study provides preliminary evidence for the benefits of incorporating VR into medical education, particularly in anatomy. While the results are promising, further research is needed to explore the optimal integration of VR and CBL in rehabilitation studies and to assess their long-term impact on student learning and clinical performance. Trial registration The study was registered with Chinese Clinical Trials Registry (Registration Number: ChiCTR2400089295) on 05/09/2024.

Abstract: Background Previous graduate students and postdoctoral associates from the University of Florida Health Cancer Center, in partnership with the University of Florida Student Science Training Program, implemented a cooperative learning curriculum, providing high school students with a broad overview of cancer topics over six weeks over the summer. To address discussions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic on student autonomy, we report lessons learned and outcomes of a cancer biology and therapeutic curriculum modified for a collaborative learning environment. Methods This pre-post longitudinal observational study conducted in 2023 on a cancer biology and therapeutics course evaluated students’ knowledge retention and general awareness and opinions in cancer research. A structured survey was employed for data collection, using learning assessment surveys and the Likert scale ranging from 1 to 10, with 10 being highly likely. Results Student performance tracked over a 7-year period indicated consistency in performance between years. Post-assessment analysis revealed significant improvements in student benchmark understanding, notably in their ability to define cancer in one sentence ( p  = 0.0407), identify cancer therapies ( p  = 0.0040), and recognize cancer hallmarks ( p  < 0.0001). An increased trend in median response to the likelihood of pursuing cancer research ( p  = 0.8793) and the possibility of pursuing cancer research ( p  = 0.4874) were also observed, although not statistically significant. Moreover, feedback from participating students indicated that “ the educational activities at the end of class (e.g. , escape room , case studies) ” and “ learning about cancer and getting to work in groups… ” the curriculum fostered a positive educational learning environment. Conclusion Students generally retained the course material presented and upheld a positive perception of the course. Incorporating opportunities for peer-to-peer learning, especially when introducing or discussing complex issues like cancer, may benefit student autotomy.

Abstract: Background Medical education offers the foundational base for future healthcare professionals, with basic sciences playing a pivotal role in providing essential knowledge and skills for clinical practice. However, the long-term retention and application of this knowledge in clinical practice remain a significant challenge. This systematic review synthesised global evidence from diverse studies on the short / long-term retention and clinical application of basic sciences among medical doctors. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted across six databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, CINAHL, Emcare, and Informit. The review included studies that encompassed a variety of study designs, participant groups, and educational interventions. The Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies (QuADS) tool was utilised to assess the quality of the reviewed studies. Results A total of 10 studies were included in the review. The findings revealed that rehearsals significantly optimise the retention of basic science knowledge among medical practitioners. Retention varied by discipline, with medical practitioners retaining more knowledge in anatomy (mean scores ranging from 45.0 to 82.9%), while microbiology had the lowest retention score (39.1%). Factors influencing retention included age, gender, and curriculum type. Educational interventions such as targeted courses, integration of basic sciences with clinical skills, generative retrieval and continuous quality improvement in the curriculum were found to enhance both knowledge retention and clinical reasoning. The concept of ‘encapsulated knowledge’ demonstrates that integrated basic science knowledge helps in synthesising clinical presentations, reducing the need for detailed recall as clinical experience increases. The reviewed studies primarily involved interns and surgeons, leaving a significant gap in research for specialties like internal medicine and primary care/ general practice. Conclusion Detailed retention of basic science knowledge may diminish over time; however, the conceptual framework remains essential for ongoing learning and clinical reasoning. This review’s findings highlight the need for specialised educational interventions to improve long-term retention. Continuous professional development and targeted educational techniques are vital for maintaining clinical competence and applying basic science knowledge effectively throughout a medical career. Further research is needed to address gaps in specialty-specific knowledge application and the impact of different instructional methods.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 3rd International Conference on Creative Communication and Innovative Technology (ICCIT) Conference Start Date: 2024, Aug. 7 Conference End Date: 2024, Aug. 8 Conference Location: Tangerang, Indonesia AviEdu was developed as an innovative and interactive game-based learning application to enhance aviation knowledge among cadets at the Politeknik Penerbangan Palembang. Utilizing a modified 4D method (Define, Design, Develop, Disseminate), the application offers features such as learning videos, quizzes, material modules, and interactive games. The effectiveness of the application was evaluated using various quantitative metrics, including pre-and post-test scores, user engagement analytics, module completion rates, feedback scores, and long-term knowledge retention metrics. The study results show significant improvements in cadet engagement and knowledge retention after using AviEdu. Increased test scores indicate that the application is effective in improving learning outcomes. Engagement analytics reveal that cadets spent more time interacting with learning materials through the application compared to traditional learning methods. High module completion rates and positive feedback scores confirm that cadets found the interactive features of AviEdu helpful and motivating. Retention metrics demonstrate that knowledge acquired through the application lasts longer compared to conventional learning methods. Thus, AviEdu holds great potential as an effective educational tool in aviation training.

Abstract: Currently, students face difficulties in understanding and assembling desktop computer hardware. Traditional teaching, which relies on theoretical classes and manuals, does not provide sufficient interactive or practical experience, hindering the comprehension and retention of knowledge. Understanding hardware is fundamental for computer science and related fields students, as it is the basis for building and maintaining computer systems. The lack of practical knowledge in this area can result in inadequate training, limiting students’ abilities to apply theoretical concepts in real-world situations, which can affect their academic performance and job market readiness. There have been initiatives that included the use of printed manuals, video tutorials, and software simulations to teach hardware. However, these methods failed to engage students sufficiently or provide a practical and realistic learning experience. These methods can become boring and disconnected from the practical experience necessary for properly assembling computer hardware. The proposed solution is the use of an augmented reality (AR) mobile application to create an interactive and practical learning experience. The application called Build_PC was designed, and it allows students to visualize and manipulate hardware components in a virtual environment superimposed on the real world, allowing practical learning of computer assembly and operation. The main results of the research, which used volunteer students associated with control and experimental groups, show that the use of Build_PC significantly improved the understanding and retention of knowledge about computer hardware. Students who used the application demonstrated a greater ability to understand the operation of hardware components compared to those who used traditional methods. In addition, students reported greater motivation and satisfaction with the learning process. Implementing a AR-powered application in hardware education has several important implications. Firstly, it provides an effective tool to enhance understanding and knowledge retention, which can lead to better academic and professional preparation for students. Furthermore, it can serve as a model for integrating emerging technologies in other educational areas, enhancing practical teaching and interactive learning. It also highlights the need to invest in innovative educational technologies to keep up with job market demands and student expectations.

Abstract: Supplemental instruction (SI) confers student success, as represented by grades, knowledge retention, and student engagement. However, studies often report professional, not undergraduate, program findings. To measure these effects, students studying human anatomy at a university in Ontario, Canada, attended structured (peer-assisted) or unstructured (nonpeer-assisted) SI sessions and completed a pre-/post-survey. Fifty-eight learners (39 systems (SYS) and 19 musculoskeletal (MSK) anatomy) completed both surveys and had responses analyzed. Both cohorts, maintained initial perceptions across pre-/post-analyses (MSK p = 0.1376 and SYS p = 0.3521). Resource usage was similar across both cohorts with discrepancies in skeletal model and textbook use. No MSK learner ranked any lab resources as "not at all useful." MSK learners felt more prepared to write a graded assessment (p = 0.0269), whereas SYS learners did not (p = 0.0680). Stratification of learners in MSK and SYS revealed learners spending between 30 and 60 min in SI sessions during the study period had the highest grades compared to students who spent less than 30 (p = 0.0286) or more than 60 (p = 0.0286) min attending SI sessions, respectively. Most learners in MSK (89.4%) and SYS (66%) concluded that they preferred structured over unstructured SI. Sentiment/thematic analysis using a generative AI-driven large language model revealed learners held positive perceptions of SI, emphasizing structured learning, resources, personalized learning, and support offered as the most prevalent themes surrounding SI. Ultimately, this study provides evidence that supports SI for improving student outcomes related to perceived preparedness for completing assessments and preferred teaching/learning styles in undergraduate human anatomy.

Abstract: Metaphor generation is both a creative act and a means of learning. When learning a new concept, people often create a metaphor to connect the new concept to existing knowledge. Does the manner in which people generate a metaphor, via sudden insight (Aha! moment) or deliberate analysis, influence the quality of generation and subsequent learning outcomes? According to some research, deliberate processing enhances knowledge retention; hence, generation via analysis likely leads to better concept learning. However, other research has shown that solutions generated via insight are better remembered. In the current study, participants were presented with science concepts and descriptions, then generated metaphors for the concepts. They also indicated how they generated each metaphor and rated their metaphor for novelty and aptness. We assessed participants' learning outcomes with a memory test and evaluated the creative quality of the metaphors based on self- and crowd-sourced ratings. Consistent with the deliberate processing benefit, participants became more familiar with the target science concept if they previously generated a metaphor for the concept via analysis compared to via insight. We also found that metaphors generated via analysis did not differ from metaphors generated via insight in quality (aptness or novelty) nor in how well they were remembered. However, participants' self-evaluations of metaphors generated via insight showed more agreement with independent raters, suggesting the role of insight in modulating the creative ideation process. These preliminary findings have implications for understanding the nature of insight during idea generation and its impact on learning.

Abstract: Background Gamification, the incorporation of game theory into the curriculum, has been correlated with improved knowledge retention compared to standard didactics. Objective To determine the impact of gamified hepatology modules on medical student knowledge retention and exam performance. Methods We created three web-based, gamified hepatology modules with 15-question pre- and post-tests. Differences in each module’s pre- and post-test scores were compared using paired t-tests. Medical school exam scores (total score and hepatology-specific score) in module users versus non-users were compared using independent two-sample t-tests. Results Module completion yielded significant increases in pre- to post-test scores for the jaundice (p=0.002) and anatomy modules (p<0.001). Module users scored 1.2 points higher on the total exam score (p=0.4) and 2 points higher on the hepatology exam score (p=0.31). Post-module survey results revealed higher knowledge retention in hepatology topics, expanded interest in hepatology, and an increased inclination to use web-based learning platforms for future learning experiences. Conclusion Module use led to improved post-test scores in the modules. Module users also had higher hepatology exam and total exam scores, yet, this difference was not statistically significant.

Abstract: This dissertation investigates the problem of how variations in the intensity of three selected constructs—multimedia signaling, speed and pacing, and cognitive engagement prompts—affect attention and learning outcomes in online learning environments. The study explores the intersecting cognitive theories of cognitive load, higher order thinking skills, and Mayer's principles of multimedia learning, with specific focus on his signaling principle. Through the use of eye-tracking technology, the study measures focal attention, while immediate and delayed knowledge retention tests assess learning outcomes. Employing a robust experimental design, the research utilizes eye-tracking technology to directly measure focal attention, alongside both immediate and delayed knowledge retention tests to evaluate learning outcomes. The methodological framework modulates the intensity of selected constructs across low, optimal, and high conditions, enabling a comprehensive assessment of their impacts. The findings reveal statistically significant effects for multimedia richness and speed, indicating optimal levels that enhance learner engagement. This research concludes that carefully calibrated multimedia signals can substantially benefit online learning environments, offering educators and content creators actionable insights for designing more effective and engaging educational experiences.

Abstract: Gross anatomy provides essential knowledge about the structure and function of the human body. Understanding human anatomy requires specific skills from physiotherapy students to comprehend and memorize the location and relationships of anatomical structures. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on teaching methodologies in anatomy education for undergraduate physiotherapy students. A scoping review was conducted consulting the PubMed, EBSCO, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases. By analyzing ten studies involving over 1380 students, we identified four primary pedagogical approaches: the use of technological tools, combined traditional methods (such as dissections and radiological imaging), interprofessional education, and the innovative use of animal dissections. The findings highlight that hands-on, practical activities, especially those integrating technology (e.g., virtual reality and interactive quizzes), significantly enhance student engagement and knowledge retention. Collaborative learning through interprofessional education was found to foster a deeper understanding of anatomical concepts and improve teamwork skills, which are crucial for clinical practice. Additionally, the inclusion of traditional methods like dissections and radiological imaging, when paired with modern tools, offers a comprehensive approach that bridges theoretical knowledge with practical application. The use of animal dissections also emerged as an innovative strategy to enhance anatomical comprehension. In conclusion, the literature underscores the importance of adopting diverse and innovative teaching strategies in gross anatomy education for physiotherapy students. Such approaches not only enrich the learning experience but also ensure that students are well prepared for the demands of professional practice.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Conference Start Date: 2024, June 16 Conference End Date: 2024, June 22 Conference Location: Seattle, WA, USA Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an efficient pre-training method for medical image analysis. However, current research is mostly confined to certain modalities, consuming considerable time and resources without achieving universality across different modalities. A straightforward solution is combining all modality data for joint SSL, which poses practical challenges. Firstly, our experiments reveal conflicts in representation learning as the number of modalities increases. Secondly, multi-modal data collected in advance cannot cover all real-world scenarios. In this paper, we reconsider versatile SSL from the perspective of continual learning and propose MedCoSS, a continuous SSL approach for multi-modal medical data. Different from joint representation learning, MedCoSS assigns varying data modalities to separate training stages, creating a multi-stage pre-training process. We propose a rehearsal- based continual learning approach to manage modal conflicts and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we use the k-means sampling to retain and rehearse previous modality data during new modality learning. Moreover, we apply feature distillation and intra-modal mixup on buffer data for knowledge retention, bypassing pretext tasks. We conduct experiments on a large-scale multi-modal unlabeled dataset, including clinical reports, X-rays, CT, MRI, and pathological images. Experimental results demonstrate MedCoSS's exceptional generalization ability across 9 downstream datasets and its significant scalability in inte- grating new modality data. The code and pre-trained model are available at https://github.com/yeerwen/MedCoSS.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Conference Start Date: 2024, June 16 Conference End Date: 2024, June 22 Conference Location: Seattle, WA, USA We present a highly scalable self-training framework for incrementally adapting vision-based end-to-end autonomous driving policies in a semi-supervised manner, i.e., over a continual stream of incoming video data. To facilitate large-scale model training (e.g., open web or unlabeled data), we do not assume access to ground-truth labels and instead estimate pseudo-label policy targets for each video. Our framework comprises three key components: knowledge distillation, a sample purification module, and an exploration and knowledge retention mechanism. First, given sequential image frames, we pseudo-label the data and estimate uncertainty using an ensemble of inverse dynamics models. The uncertainty is used to select the most informative samples to add to an experience replay buffer. We specifically select high-uncertainty pseudo-labels to facilitate the exploration and learning of new and diverse driving skills. However, in contrast to prior work in continual learning that assumes ground-truth labeled samples, the uncertain pseudo-labels can introduce significant noise. Thus, we also pair the exploration with a label refinement module, which makes use of consistency constraints to re-label the noisy exploratory samples and effectively learn from diverse data. Trained as a complete never-ending learning system, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on training from domain-changing data as well as millions of images from the open web.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Conference Start Date: 2024, June 16 Conference End Date: 2024, June 22 Conference Location: Seattle, WA, USA Foundation models encompass an extensive knowledge base and offer remarkable transferability. However, this knowledge becomes outdated or insufficient over time. The challenge lies in continuously updating foundation models to accommodate novel information while retaining their original capabilities. Leveraging the fact that foundation models have initial knowledge on various tasks and domains, we propose a novel approach that, instead of updating all parame-ters equally, localizes the updates to a sparse set of parame-ters relevant to the task being learned. We strike a balance between efficiency and new task performance, while main-taining the transferability and generalizability of foundation models. We extensively evaluate our method on foundational vision-language models with a diverse spectrum of continual learning tasks. Our method achieves improvements on the accuracy of the newly learned tasks up to 7% while preserving the pretraining knowledge with a negligible decrease of 0.9% on a representative control set accuracy.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Conference Start Date: 2024, June 16 Conference End Date: 2024, June 22 Conference Location: Seattle, WA, USA Large multimodal models demonstrate remarkable generalist ability to perform diverse multimodal tasks in a zero-shot manner. Large-scale web-based image-text pairs contribute fundamentally to this success, but suffer from excessive noise. Recent studies use alternative captions synthesized by captioning models and have achieved notable benchmark performance. However, our experiments re-veal significant Scalability Deficiency and World Knowledge Loss issues in models trained with synthetic captions, which have been largely obscured by their initial benchmark success. Upon closer examination, we identify the root cause as the overly-simplified language structure and lack of knowledge details in existing synthetic captions. To provide higher-quality and more scalable multimodal pretraining data, we propose CAPSFUSION, an advanced framework that leverages large language models to consoli-date and refine information from both web-based image-text pairs and synthetic captions. Extensive experiments show that CAPSFUSION captions exhibit remarkable all-round superiority over existing captions in terms of model performance (e.g., 18.8 and 18.3 improvements in CIDEr score on COCO and No Caps), sample efficiency (requiring 11–16 times less computation than baselines), world knowledge depth, and scalability. These effectiveness, efficiency and scalability advantages position CAPSFUSION as a promising candidate for future scaling of LMM training.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 International Conference on Consumer Electronics - Taiwan (ICCE-Taiwan) Conference Start Date: 2024, July 9 Conference End Date: 2024, July 11 Conference Location: Taichung, Taiwan This paper proposes an innovative self-supervised continual learning network architecture designed to significantly enhance the efficiency and adaptability of deep learning models. The architecture integrates a rapid learner with the primary network, enabling swift adaptation to new challenges with minimal computational overhead while preserving insights from prior experiences. Our approach facilitates the rapid acquisition of knowledge by expert networks during the learning of new tasks, subsequently integrating this knowledge into the primary framework, eliminating the previously obligatory knowledge distillation step. This advancement is attributed to the architecture's unique design, which establishes a direct connection with the main network, thereby minimizing the risk of knowledge loss. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy across a diverse set of tasks.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 43rd Chinese Control Conference (CCC) Conference Start Date: 2024, July 28 Conference End Date: 2024, July 31 Conference Location: Kunming, China Accurately and promptly identifying harmful gases in the environment can effectively prevent many accidents. Most existing pattern recognition methods are focused on addressing gas classification problems in static scenarios, but the real world is a dynamic and changing environment. Therefore, researching gas classification in continuous learning scenarios will better meet the needs of suddenly emerging gas classification tasks in real-world environments. To address this issue, an incremental learning model was introduced into gas classification, and an improved deep convolutional network was proposed for gas image feature extraction. The proposed model and other baseline methods experimented on an open-source gas dataset. The proposed model reduces knowledge loss due to catastrophic forgetting and effectively classifies the 10 gas samples in the dataset in continuous learning scenarios compared to non-incremental methods. It outperforms other baseline incremental methods by optimizing the network’s shortcut connections, making the feature extraction network easier to train and improving gas classification performance. In dynamic learning scenarios, the proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 86.30% for 10 gas samples. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting interference and completes gas classification tasks in continuous learning scenarios.

Transfer e-Booster: An online intervention to reinforce and measure training transfer in the workplace

Author: Jang, Eunjoo11 University of Hawai'i at Manoa, Learning Design and Technology, US

Publication info: Jang, Eunjoo. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/transfer-e-booster-online-intervention-reinforce/docview/3101972687/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: The transfer of training from learning environments to workplace environments has been a major concern for training professionals and researchers for decades. How should organizations evaluate the effectiveness of their training programs and what impacts are those programs having on their employees' on-the-job performance? These questions are particularly relevant in an age of e-learning courses because many organizations are looking for practical ways to support the transfer of the knowledge and skills employees learn during training to real-world contexts. To address this issue, an experimental study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of an online transfer intervention (Transfer e-Booster) designed to measure and promote training transfer. A total of 53 volunteers (control n = 25, experimental n = 28) at a non-profit organization participated in the study by completing an e-learning course about emergency preparedness. Following the e-learning course, participants in the experimental group interacted with an online transfer intervention and completed an experience survey. The study measured two aspects of training transfer: knowledge retention and behavioral application. In addition, participants in the experimental group rated their perceptions of the intervention's main design components: key identified behaviors, knowledge retention questions, behavioral application self-assessment, and peer sharing. Four weeks after the e-learning course, all participants completed a post-test. The results of the experiment yielded mixed results. Participants in the experimental group earned significantly higher knowledge retention scores. They also earned higher behavioral application scores, but the difference was not significant. In terms of their perceptions of the online transfer intervention, participants rated all four design components positively, suggesting the design of the intervention may have supported their ability to transfer the knowledge and skills gained during the training to their work environment. Taken together, the study's findings demonstrate the promise of online transfer interventions to support the transfer of workplace training. In addition, the study offers potential design suggestions for transfer interventions that may, in turn, help trainees make sense of their learning and find ways to apply it to their on-the-job responsibilities. The study ends by demonstrating how data collected from an online transfer intervention might be analyzed to provide organizations with an overview of training quality and how training transfer might be supported at scale. Future research is needed to better understand the impact of online transfer interventions and how they might be designed to maximize transfer opportunities across topics and settings.

Abstract: The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of virtual reality (VR) and emotionally resonant videos on knowledge retention for adult learners at a contractor safety training organization supporting the energy industry. The intent of this research was to determine if traditional computer-based training (CBT) can be made more effective with the addition of VR exercises with emotionally resonant videos. The two experimental groups were exposed to either CBTs augmented by VR exercises that reinforced the CBT course learning objectives and included work-relevant videos designed to arouse an emotional response or CBTs with VR exercises without videos. The control group for this research took the same CBT course without VR exercises and without videos. A quantitative analysis was performed on data collected from a follow-up quiz delivered three days after the completion of the course(s). Data from this follow-up quiz was analyzed to determine if there was greater knowledge retention of the course learning objectives and procedures among the experimental groups than among the control group. The results found a non-statistically significant relationship between the groups, however, trends between the groups show that there are benefits for transfer of learning when using VR and VR with emotionally resonant videos compared to those groups without these tools. Additionally, a deeper analysis of the results, when considering aspects of the participants' demographic and experience variables, suggests that the recall quiz results may have been affected by an increased cognitive load on younger and inexperienced participants.

Abstract: High-stakes examinations enjoy widespread use as summative assessments in higher education. We review the arguments for and against their use, across seven common themes: memory recall and knowledge retention; student motivation and learning; authenticity and real-world relevance; validity and reliability; academic misconduct and contract cheating; stress, anxiety and wellbeing; and fairness and equity. For each theme, we evaluate empirical evidence for the perceived pedagogical benefits and pedagogical drawbacks of high-stakes examinations. We find that relatively few of the perceived academic benefits of high-stakes examinations have a strong evidence base. Support for their use is largely rooted in opinion and pragmatism, rather than being justified by scientific evidence or pedagogical merit. By contrast, there is substantial evidence for pedagogical drawbacks of high-stakes summative examinations. We conclude that the current heavy reliance on high-stakes final examinations in many university subjects is poorly justified by the balance of empirical evidence.

Abstract: After the pandemic, research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the field of education has seen a significant increase globally. However, a few studies conducted before the pandemic addressed the problem of supporting intrinsic motivation in students, crucial for the quality of learning and knowledge retention. This study explores how this topic is covered in recent research, by conducting a cross-disciplinary literature review and critical discourse analysis under the theoretical framework of Activity Theory (AT). It aims to identify the coverage extension of all types of relationships between nodes in the educational activity system, with special attention to Subject (students) and Object, as this central relationship embodies the motive-driven nature of human activity. The analysis incorporated 69 articles from Scopus published from 2020 until now. The results demonstrate the coverage about only some relationships like: Subject-Tools (students' interaction with AI technology), Tools-Object (AI technologies development), and Tools-Community (adapting AI within an educational community). The Subject-Object relationship remains unexplored. Practical implications include refocusing on intrinsic motivation, emphasising epistemological needs, meaning, and choice. This involves evaluating the benefits and risks of AI in specific educational cases. Theoretical implications involve exploring how to sustain students' intrinsic motivation in the context of AI implementation.

Abstract: Contribution: This research explores the effectiveness of a proposed teaching strategy in blockchain education, finding that it enhances learning outcomes, cognitive well-being, and student engagement in tertiary education, ultimately resulting in a shallower learning curve for STEM knowledge. Background: In the context of Industry 4.0, blockchain technology has emerged as a key driver of transformation in data management and system automation across a range of industrial applications. Despite its significance, the intricate theories and concepts associated with blockchain often serve as a deterrent for novice learners, inhibiting their ability to appreciate the value of industrial blockchain. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop interactive teaching content that alleviates the steep learning curve. Intended Outcomes: The teaching strategy for the gamification in blockchain education is proposed, which positively influence students' cognitive well-being in terms of knowledge retention, cognitive curiosity, and heightened enjoyment. Application Design: Based on the experimental learning theory, the gamification of blockchain education, namely "BlockTrainHK", is implemented in the experimental learning cycle. Therefore, the gamified learning in experimental learning (GEL) strategy is proposed to examine the effectiveness of concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization and active experimentation by two case studies. Findings: The results of the two-year study on the gamified blockchain education are encouraging: test groups using the GEL strategy were better in the cognitive well-being, and students' cognitive well-being is positively proportional to the level of individual technical knowledge and skills.

Abstract: Mundialmente se ha detectado una pérdida de conocimientos sobre el uso medicinal de la fauna silvestre, utilizada por grupos étnicos y entre generaciones. El presente estudio se enfocó en determinar: 1) el grado de similitud y 2) si existen diferencias en el conocimiento tradicional que tienen de la fauna silvestre con usos medicinales; se consideraron los géneros sexuales (hombres y mujeres) y los grupos etarios (30-50 y >50 años) de los pobladores maya-descendientes (Tzotzil y Tzeltal) en la zona de Los Altos de Chiapas. La información se recopiló mediante entrevistas semiestructuradas a descendientes de la población Maya y se analizó la información general (uso terapéutico sin detalles) y específica (conocimiento sobre qué animal se emplea para contrarrestar qué enfermedad y la dosis o forma de emplearlo). Se entrevistaron 180 mujeres y 188 hombres mayores de edad que voluntariamente participaron en el estudio. El análisis multivariado de agrupamiento sin ponderación (UPGMA), demostró que hay mayor similitud de conocimiento sobre la fauna medicinal entre las mujeres Tzotziles (92,30 %) y entre los hombres del grupo etario de 30-50 años de las dos etnias (91,66 %). La prueba de máxima verosimilitud mostró las diferencias respecto a la información general y específica. Estos resultados sugieren procesos de transculturación y migración entre los grupos actuales. El trabajo demuestra que existe mayor similitud entre hombres que pertenecen a los dos grupos étnicos entre 30-50 años, en comparación con mujeres de ambas etnias y grupos etarios. Alternate abstract: Worldwide, a loss of knowledge has been detected about the medicinal use of wild fauna used by ethnic groups and between generations. For this reason, the present study focused on determining whether there are differences in the use of traditional medicinal knowledge of wildlife between genders and age groups (30-50 and >50 years) of two ethnic groups, Tzotzil and Tzeltal that are in the Los Altos area of Chiapas. Information collected through semi-structured interviews general knowledge (they knew it was used to heal) and detailed knowledge (they knew it was used for a specific type of disease) were included with Tzotzil and Tzeltal Mayan descendants, respectively, who included 180 women and 188 men. The Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) by Ward’s method, showed a more significant similarity of knowledge of medicinal fauna between Tzotzil women of both age groups (92.30 %) and among men of the age group of 30-50 years of the two ethnicities (91.66 %). Furthermore, maximum likelihood test showed differences between observed and expected values in the loss of general traditional knowledge; but it is statistical marginal for detailed information. These results suggest processes of transculturation, and migration, between current groups. Therefore, this work demonstrates that there is a more significant similarity in the knowledge of wild fauna for medicinal use in men belonging to the two ethnic groups who are between 30-50 years old. Compared to women of both ethnicities and age groups.

Abstract: Background: In the achievement of optimal learning outcomes, knowledge retention presents a major concern for medical students and educators. Practical dissection courses facilitate the consolidation of knowledge of anatomy. Previously, it was shown that a regional anatomy dissection course is more beneficial over a 3-month than a 1-month duration for gathering pre examination knowledge. This study aimed to assess if follow-up anatomy interventions help consolidate regional anatomy knowledge and facilitate knowledge retention of undergraduate medical students. It was hypothesized that knowledge retention could be enhanced using post-dissection teaching interventions. Methods: Upon completion of the dissection course, Objective Structured Practical Examinations (OSPEs) were performed for the neck, thorax, and abdomen immediately before the start of the oral examinations, with follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. Between each of the examinations, virtual and in-person lectures and seminars on (radiologic) anatomy and pathology were held, including Cinematic Rendering, but without additional teaching on human tissues. Results: Significant improvements were observed for knowledge of the neck and abdomen regions in the 6- and 12-month follow-up OSPEs. The effects of knowledge gain were less marked in ethanol-glycerin- than in Thiel-embalmed tissues. Student perceptions regarding tissue quality correlated positively with their assessment of tissue suitability for examination preparation. In conclusion, even anatomy teaching interventions not utilizing human tissues may help consolidate and improve regional anatomy knowledge over a one-year term. Conclusion: Knowledge retention can be enhanced by accompanying virtual with physical teaching interventions.

Abstract: The global rise in cybercrime is fueled by the pervasive digitization of work and personal life, compounded by the shift to online formats during the COVID-19 pandemic. As digital channels flourish, so too do the opportunities for cyberattacks, particularly those exposing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to potential economic devastation. These businesses often lack comprehensive defense strategies and/or the necessary resources to implement effective cybersecurity measures. The authors have addressed this issue by developing an Educational Escape Room (EER) that supports scenario-based learning to enhance cybersecurity awareness among SME employees, enabling them to handle cyber threats more effectively. By integrating hands-on scenarios based on real-life examples, the authors aimed to improve the knowledge retention and the operational performance of SME staff in terms of cybersafe practices. The results achieved during pilot testing with more than 200 participants suggest that the EER approach engaged the trainees and boosted their cybersecurity awareness, marking a step forward in cybersecurity education.

Abstract: In rural western Kenya, community health promoters (CHPs) serve to address access to health care for women and infants in their local communities. They do this by conducting home visits to offer health education, assistance, and referrals during the postpartum and neonatal period. Despite this and other health care initiatives, maternal and infant morbidity and mortality rates were increasing in this area. A quality improvement project was established to address the CHPs' knowledge that supports their care. The objectives of this quality improvement project were to establish CHPs' baseline understanding regarding the signs and symptoms of deteriorating maternal and newborn health during the postpartum period and to improve CHP knowledge regarding the criteria for referring cases to health clinics or hospitals. A culturally sensitive one-day educational workshop was designed for CHPs, incorporating key content identified by county health officials and consistent with health care standards. This content focused on enabling CHPs to recognize when a postpartum woman or neonate requires transfer to a hospital. The workshop utilized interactive discussions, case scenarios, and small group activities, supported by evidence from the literature. Pre-test and post-test assessments were conducted to gauge baseline knowledge and knowledge acquisition. Two workshops were held in different regions, with a total of 43 CHPs in attendance. To assess knowledge retention, a 1-month post-test was administered to participants. Repeated measure ANOVA demonstrated a significant increase in knowledge from pre-test to post-test. Paired t test demonstrated a significant increase in knowledge from pre-test to 1-month post-test. Interactive education methodologies increased CHP knowledge during a one-day workshop. The knowledge change was sustained from post-education intervention to 1 month post, and scores were significant from pre-test scores. Workshops for CHPs to build and sustain knowledge are essential to address maternal and newborn health. The outcome of this pilot project will be used to revise the workshop content and tests for future workshops. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

Introductory chemistry student success: Evaluating peer-led team learning and understanding sense of belonging

Author: Young, Jessica D.11 University of South Florida, Chemistry, US

Publication info: Young, Jessica D. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/introductory-chemistry-student-success-evaluating/docview/3093178589/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Identifying approaches that make science and engineering education broader and more inclusive is core to discipline based education research. Both fundamental and applied research are important in advancing a STEM education that retains the necessary scientists of the U.S.'s future. Thus, the major goal of this work was to evaluate and describe efforts that promote student success within introductory STEM courses. This began with applied research by utilizing quantitative analyses like case-matching, logistic regression, independent sample t-tests, and repeated measures while evaluating the efficacy of peer-led team learning (PLTL). Later, this work delves into qualitative approaches to answer fundamental research questions. Grounded theory is used to construct a chemistry-specific theory of students' sense of belonging. The research topics and research methodologies that encompass this work are broad. However, these topics and methodologies all contribute to the larger goal of creating both fundamental and applied research that contribute to a broader and more inclusive science and engineering education starting in our undergraduate chemistry courses. This work quantitatively advanced applied work that seeks to bring more scientists and engineers into society via active learning. The first quantitative study sought to evaluate PLTL's effect on students' performance and persistence. Exam scores and persistence data was collected from online General Chemistry II courses which were taught either using online-didactic pedagogy or online-PLTL pedagogy (Chapter III). Using case comparison, t-tests, and logistic regressions, the evaluation demonstrated that students engaging in online-PLTL performed notably better across exams than those engaging with the online-didactic approach. Additionally, those involved in online PLTL exhibited a higher probability of securing a passing grade, resulting in fewer instances of failure and course withdrawals. These outcomes strongly suggest that PLTL is an efficacious educational method in an online learning environment. Next, a different study sought to evaluate PLTL's effect on students' knowledge retention. Measuring student knowledge repeatedly for one year following enrollment in general chemistry and for a different cohort while they were enrolled in analytical chemistry (Chapter IV). In both studies, a repeated measures design was employed, revealing no discernible impact of teaching methods on the sustained retention of information. This discovery, coupled with insights from prior research, suggests that PLTL enhances student achievement and aids in retaining knowledge in a manner that is comparable to didactic pedagogy. Furthermore, this work created fundamental research through qualitative methodology. The first study used grounded theory to advance a chemistry-specific theory of sense of belonging (Chapter V). The study was important given there are many potential threats to belonging during the transition to college in introductory STEM courses. 19 postsecondary students from introductory chemistry were interviewed with a semi-structured approach. Grounded theory was used as a qualitative analysis to conceptualize sense of belonging. Belonging can be situational, dependent on the occurrences within the setting, or dispositional, representing long-standing tendencies. It is also acceptance-based, such as friendships and support, or value-based, where contributions are recognized or acted upon. These traits are combined into four dimensions: Situational Acceptance, Dispositional Acceptance, Situational Value, and Dispositional Value. This nuanced understanding can guide instructional and research efforts to improve students' sense of belonging. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

Abstract: Background Basic sciences are crucial for clinical medicine, yet studies focusing on their perceived utility among general practitioners (GPs) are sparse. Considering the broad scope of GPs’ practice, an in-depth understanding of basic sciences is fundamental for making informed clinical decisions. This study evaluated GP registrars’ retention and perceptions of the utility of basic sciences in clinical practice. Methods Using sequential explanatory mixed methods study design, knowledge retention was assessed by a multiple-choice question (MCQ) examination followed by interviews on the perception of the relevance and utility of basic sciences among GP registrars at James Cook University's (JCU) General Practice Training (GPT) program. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted on the MCQ exam data, while thematic analysis was employed for the qualitative interview data. Results Sixty-one GP registrars participated in the MCQ exam, while 11 of them were involved in the interviews. The highest mean score was obtained in biochemistry (75.1 ± 2.23) while the lowest mean score was in anatomy (56.07 ± 3.16). Key performance predictors included the formative clinical examination scores (β = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.45 to 1.2, p  < 0.001) and gender (β = -9.7, 95% CI: -17 to -2.3, p  = 0.011). The qualitative data analysis revealed five themes, including the backbone of clinical medicine, varying utility over time and by specialty, clinical synthesis integrates encapsulated knowledge, professional pressures hinder revisitation of knowledge and knowledge renewal enhances updates. Conclusion Basic sciences were considered relevant in clinical practice. Development of continuing professional development (CPDs) sessions and clinically relevant online resources were measures proposed to enhance the retention of knowledge. Future research could focus on innovative educational strategies for GPs.

Publication info: Peeler, Jason. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/addressing-musculoskeletal-curricular/docview/3091290843/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Background Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries and diseases place a significant burden on the health care system. Despite this, research indicates that physician training in the area of MSK medicine has historically been inadequate, with a majority of medical students feeling that their training in MSK medicine is lacking. The goal of this investigation was to evaluate the efficacy of a new preclinical MSK curriculum that was implemented within a nationally accredited allopathic medical program. Methods Retrospective analysis was completed on five consecutive years (2017–2021) of preclinical MSK curricular data for 549 medical students, including mid and end-of-course examinations and end-of-course student satisfaction surveys. Both parametric and non-parametric methods of analysis were used to examine within and between class differences ( P  < 0.05). Results The new MSK curriculum covered 15 of 16 “core or must know” topics in MSK medicine, and academic performance was consistently high over the 5-year period of analysis (final course marks ranged from 76.6 ± 7.1 to 81.4 ± 8.1; failures/year: range from 0 to 4), being equal or above levels of student performance observed for other courses delivered during preclinical studies. Likert data from end-of-course surveys demonstrated that feedback was overwhelmingly positive (overall course satisfaction ranged from a low of 3.07/4.00 to a high of 3.56/4.00) and indicated that students felt that the new preclinical MSK curriculum did effectively support medical student learning and knowledge retention. Conclusion Results are expected to help advance the current body of knowledge that is dedicated to improving physician learning and knowledge retention in the area of MSK medicine and provides a curricular model that could be used by other nationally accredited medical programs to help enhance MSK learning at the preclinical levels of physician training.

Abstract: Background Effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training for nursing students is crucial for improving patient outcomes in cardiac arrest scenarios. This study assesses the impact of infographic versus video feedback on enhancing nursing students’ clinical skills in Basic Life Support (BLS). Methods In a randomized controlled setting, 76 nursing students at Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences were divided into two groups: one received infographic-based education and the other video feedback training. Pre- and post-intervention assessments measured knowledge and skill retention using validated questionnaires. Results Post-training, the infographic group showed significantly higher knowledge scores, while the video feedback group exhibited greater improvement in CPR skill performance. No significant differences were noted in pre-training assessment scores between the groups. Conclusion Infographic-based education enhances BLS knowledge retention, and video feedback improves practical CPR skills.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 4th International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering (ICACITE) Conference Start Date: 2024, May 14 Conference End Date: 2024, May 15 Conference Location: Greater Noida, India Modern education has given much focus to the combination of gamification and artificial intelligence (AI), and they promise to do things differently in enhancing student motivation and improving their retention in learning, mainly at the basic levels of education. This research paper presents synergy that exists in gamification with AI technologies to utilize maximum potential for the learning outcome of students, particularly making them overcome engagement and knowledge retention challenges. The paper commences with the definition of the theoretical underpinnings of both gamification and AI in education, each of which is to find a place for the role in fostering motivation and offering learning experiences suitable for learners. Gamification in education is applied to introduce rewards, competition, and monitoring progress — all achieved through design principles in application. Most interestingly, it is the integration of game-like features such as points, badges, and leaderboards; or even the whole game platform itself that integrates into the learning content, forming a gamified learning environment with high intrinsic motivation for gaining achievement and sustaining the interest value for a longer period. AI adaptive learning systems, on the other hand, conditionally manipulate both the instructional content and the pacing with due regard to the cognitive abilities and learning preferences of the students, hence lowering the levels of boredom or frustration attached to approaches that are one-size-fits-all.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 4th International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering (ICACITE) Conference Start Date: 2024, May 14 Conference End Date: 2024, May 15 Conference Location: Greater Noida, India As the day dawns for each technology to penetrate its way to various sectors, higher education seems to be the first field at the leeway of integration, especially with Artificial Intelligence (AI) coming to play. This paper discusses the interacting dynamics of AI and higher education infrastructure with a focus on the most impacted areas of learning spaces. It explores the manner in which AI would influence the design and use of smart learning spaces, including the effectiveness within higher education institutions. AI integration into higher learning infrastructure sees a paradigm shift on a large scale, where traditional learning environments turn into dynamic and adaptive spaces. It is in this paper that we bring out and discuss in great detail the multifaceted roles that AI plays in shaping smart learning spaces. It uses AI-driven technologies, for example, machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and intelligent tutoring systems, to enable tailormade and participative learning experiences. In addition, this paper discusses the influence of AI on the architecture and planning of learning spaces. Analyses with AI give valuable information on how spatial layouts, environmental factors, and even furniture settings may be changed to let student engagement, collaboration, and knowledge retention reach its full potential. Further, AI-based monitoring systems are adaptive enough to follow changes in learning behavior in real time, thus empowering teachers to be adaptive by redesigning pedagogy and the learning experience according to individual students’ needs and interests.

Abstract: Contribution: This research explores the effectiveness of a proposed teaching strategy in blockchain education, finding that it enhances learning outcomes, cognitive well-being, and student engagement in tertiary education, ultimately resulting in a shallower learning curve for STEM knowledge.Background: In the context of Industry 4.0, blockchain technology has emerged as a key driver of transformation in data management and system automation across a range of industrial applications. Despite its significance, the intricate theories and concepts associated with blockchain often serve as a deterrent for novice learners, inhibiting their ability to appreciate the value of industrial blockchain. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop interactive teaching content that alleviates the steep learning curve.Intended Outcomes: The teaching strategy for the gamification in blockchain education is proposed, which positively influence students’ cognitive well-being in terms of knowledge retention, cognitive curiosity, and heightened enjoyment.Application Design: Based on the experimental learning theory, the gamification of blockchain education, namely “BlockTrainHK”, is implemented in the experimental learning cycle. Therefore, the gamified learning in experimental learning (GEL) strategy is proposed to examine the effectiveness of concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization and active experimentation by two case studies.Findings: The results of the two-year study on the gamified blockchain education are encouraging: test groups using the GEL strategy were better in the cognitive well-being, and students’ cognitive well-being is positively proportional to the level of individual technical knowledge and skills.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 2nd International Symposium of Electronics Design Automation (ISEDA) Conference Start Date: 2024, May 10 Conference End Date: 2024, May 13 Conference Location: Xi'an, China Recently, demand of higher quality of result (QoR) for logic optimization have spurred numerous studies on generating logic transformation sequence for specific objective. Nevertheless, previous works often suffer from heavy reliance on computing resources or are stuck at local optima. In this work, we propose a logic transformation sequence generator based on domain-specific Monte Carlo tree search (MC- TS). Our framework propose to utilizes information obtained from synthesis tools as context to guild the tree search. Additionally, we implement the algorithm with knowledge retention and adaptive parallelization for further acceleration. Experiments on open-source benchmarks of various scale show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art work, Alphasyn, with an average 20.11 % efficiency improvement while maintaining comparable effectiveness.

Abstract: Hands-on laboratory courses seldom appear in biomedical engineering (BME) graduate programs, thus limiting graduate students' ability to acquire wet laboratory skills like cell culturing. At large, BME graduate programs rely on ad hoc training provided by senior graduate students; however, this method cannot be extended to new or non-BME laboratories, which generally lack senior personnel adequately trained in cell culture techniques. This paper describes a graduate student-led, five-session workshop that introduces cell culture fundamentals to interested students with little to no prior experience. The workshop employs novel teaching techniques, such as near-peer and collaborative learning, to enhance students' understanding and knowledge retention. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this initiative, students assessed their confidence levels with concepts and skills related to cell culture via pre- and post-workshop surveys, where significant improvements in cell culture-related concepts and skills were reported upon completing the workshop. Finally, this paper presents some challenges and reflects on insight gained from this initiative, thus providing a template for implementation at other institutions interested in enriching their graduate student education.

Abstract: We have implemented a jigsaw framework in our biomedical engineering capstone design course by overlaying strategic consideration groups across our design teams. Collaboration in design courses is usually focused within a design team with some peer feedback, but opportunities to work across teams are often limited. The purpose of this teaching tip is to guide other instructors seeking to create opportunities for student-to-student collaboration across project teams. This tutorial also highlights a means to integrate foundational knowledge and analysis of contextual areas in a design course. Knowledge of strategic considerations, such as intellectual property, regulatory affairs, engineering standards, and reimbursement, informs design translation and is valued in industry. Individual and collective learning outcomes may be enhanced by this cooperative learning approach. In addition to providing a specific example of how to implement jigsaw groups across design teams, we propose an assessment instrument to assess the impacts of this approach on student knowledge, collaboration, communication, and confidence in small cohorts. Areas of future considerations include tracking student career paths and post-graduation assessment of knowledge retention.

Abstract: Considering the importance of education especially for the newer field of education, the current study proposes a novel teaching method based on storytelling that aims to enhance the creativity of students and improve the effectiveness of learning. The method was applied and analyzed through a one-year teaching course case study to introduce topics regarding renewable energy. Despite traditional education, in which learning occurs through the direct transfer of information, here a plot with the theme of mountaineering and nature using real photos and narration of a fictional story was set for the implementation of the proposed method. Therefore, the unintentional consequences of conventional teaching including quick content forgetting, failure to define the main purpose, improper reaction, and low attractiveness and even effectiveness were prevented. Considering the affective and cognitive domains of Bloom’s Taxonomy as well as analyzing the performances of students during the teaching course and their final feedback, the results showed promising improvements including more participation (100%), better retention of content (receiving (75%) and remembering (83.33%)). While the learners preferred the proposed method and found it more effective (75%) and attractive (79.17%) than conventional teaching. Moreover, it was shown that the proposed method can improve education criteria in other affective and cognitive domains and is recommended to be considered for implementation in other complex engineering topics.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE/MTT-S International Microwave Symposium - IMS 2024 Conference Start Date: 2024, June 16 Conference End Date: 2024, June 21 Conference Location: Washington, DC, USA This study introduces a novel mixture of artificial neural network(ANN) and polynomial modeling approach for efficient behavior modeling of nonlinear RF devices. It is achieved by employing the ability of knowledge retention and knowledge transfer of ANN model to merge the new working condition into the previous model, which makes the model more intelligent when dealing with increased complicated measurement data. In addition, a dynamic sampling techniques is utilized to accurately capture the key dynamic characteristics among different PA operating states to improve the knowledge transfer efficiency. The method was verified by modeling a 0.25um GaN HEMT device at different frequencies and DC bias conditions. The proposed method can be very easily implemented in CAD software hence suitable for large-scale device modeling scenario.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication and Applied Informatics (ACCAI) Conference Start Date: 2024, May 9 Conference End Date: 2024, May 10 Conference Location: Chennai, India Focus is regarded as critical for students to learn properly, retain knowledge, absorb tough content, and manage time effectively, especially while learning from online video resources. However, maintaining focus over long study periods can be challenging, thus a drop in concentration results in lower knowledge retention, and understanding. This research proposes an EEG-based technique to tackle this issue. The technique aims to improve student attention by proposing breaks at required intervals or when the concentration level starts to drop significantly. Our system uses a combined approach of conventional approaches like Power Ratio analysis and machine learning algorithms. We take a more comprehensive approach, by including statistical analysis such as the Kendall Tau coefficient, which is used to understand brain activity, also with focus on beta waves which are generated when the individual is concentrating and when performing complex tasks and Theta waves that are generated when the individual starts to fall asleep. Power Ratio (beta is to theta ratio) analysis was used to distinguish between alert and drowsy states. This technique provides a more detailed assessment of the student’s mental state and concentration levels. To assess this method’s effectiveness, we collected data from participants while they were wearing NeuroSky MindWave devices and watched online educational videos. The participants were also asked to watch educational videos on the subject topics that they are interested in and videos which did not kindle their interest much. This data was then labelled using K-means clustering into four categories: Alert, High Concentration, Low Concentration and Drowsy. It was then used to train the machine and deep learning models. The machine learning models gave an accuracy of $73 \%$ in SVM and $75 \%$ in Random Forest Algorithm. The RNN Deep Learning model outperformed the proposed machine learning models and the previous models by achieving an accuracy of $96 \%$, implying that it has the likely to improve student attentiveness and learning outcomes. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of the proposed system, particularly the deep learning model, to improve student attentiveness and online learning experiences.

In addition, a case study is presented in a food production company that validates the effectiveness of the ADKAR model in implementing digital technologies, improving process efficiency and increasing employee acceptance of new technologies. The results show a significant improvement in process efficiency and a reduction in resistance to change. The originality of the study lies in the combination of the ADKAR model with intangible asset and knowledge management, providing a holistic solution for change management in the Industry 5.0 era. Future implications suggest the need to explore the applicability of the ADKAR model in different industries and cultures, as well as its long-term effects on organisational sustainability and innovation. This comprehensive approach can serve as a guide for other organisations seeking to implement successful digital transformations.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 27th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD) Conference Start Date: 2024, May 8 Conference End Date: 2024, May 10 Conference Location: Tianjin, China Computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CCBT) has been widely proven effective in alleviating negative emotions such as depression and anxiety. To address the lack of real-time feedback, we explored how to add appropriate interactions from the user experience perspective. By analyzing user context, we propose a transformation framework from CBT to interactive CCBT (iCCBT), which makes online interventions more effective. According to the framework, we designed and implemented an iCCBT platform for young adults. Through a 9-day controlled experiment on 28 college students, we conclude that interaction can effectively improve users’ knowledge retention, learning efficiency, satisfaction, and willingness to use. This study demonstrates methods and results for enhancing the interactivity of CCBT. The design thinking of the transformation framework can be extended to other online psychotherapy.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON) Conference Start Date: 2024, May 8 Conference End Date: 2024, May 11 Conference Location: Kos Island, Greece The shift towards online learning through websites has been instrumental in enhancing accessibility. However, while virtual labs have been promising in generating interactive simulations of science experiments, they fall short in delivering the dynamic and immersive experiences essential for effective learning, especially in computing education courses. Recognizing this challenge, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into virtual labs emerges as a promising solution to aid student learning. AI-augmented virtual labs can simulate real-world scenarios, providing students with hands-on experiences in a controlled and safe environment. This work explores the impact on student learning (with focus on user engagement, skill development, comprehension, retention, and overall experience) when integrating a virtual labs module with and without AI support. Student perspectives on the effectiveness and satisfaction with the learning modules were collected using surveys that probe not only the perceived improvement in learning outcomes, but also the subjective user experience and engagement levels. Additionally, user performance indicators, based on assessments/evaluations and discussions (within the virtual labs, with and without AI integration), serve as a measure of the students' skills development, comprehension, and knowledge retention. This approach provides an objective metric to evaluate the efficacy of each learning approach. Based on data from surveys, performance indicators, and feedback analysis, the study aims to draw comprehensive conclusions and suggest potential avenues of further inquiry, regarding the effectiveness of integrating virtual labs both with AI. This integration not only enhances the learning experience, but also fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills in students. This innovative approach offers a distinctive combination of interactivity, adaptability, and versatility. The goal of this study is not to argue for AI supported virtual lab-based learning approaches, but rather, to give empirical information about its usefulness. The findings of this study will contribute to the ongoing discussion on innovative educational practices by providing useful insights into the possible benefits and challenges of adopting hybrid learning approaches powered by AI.

This educational innovation activity has the main objective of impacting Biotechnology and Chemical Engineering students' comprehension about biomolecules for the Fundamentals of structure and properties of biomolecules subject in the third semester of their careers by immerse them in a gamification-type activity where they carried out different biomolecule identification activities through 3D printed structures that they previously reviewed theoretically in class. This activity was conducted in the winter semester of 2021 and 2022, where 139 students were divided into the experimental and the control groups. The rally development consisted in four stages as it follows: the challenges design for each rally station where the selected ones were to put together the atoms sequence to form an amino acid, to identify the components of a cell membrane, to represent the movement of the ions in the sodium potassium pump, and to find a biomolecule in the campus with provided clues. Once the challenges were chosen, the material was made by 3D printing and then the competition rally took place and the winning team with the shortest finishing time was named in a ceremony. To evaluate the students' knowledge retention, an argumentative exam was applied and the participants' perception was estimated by a Google form.

Abstract: The present retrospective, descriptive, and quasi-experimental study aimed to explore students' perceptions of traditional teaching combined with gamified and nongamified e-tests for postlecture reinforcement. Midterm knowledge retention and academic performance were also analyzed. The study was conducted from February 2021 to May 2022, involving a single group of first-year medical and physiotherapy students enrolled in equivalent core subjects on human histology at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC). Lectures were supplemented with gamified Quizizz (QQ) or nongamified Moodle questionnaires (MQ) after lecture (t0) and 30 days later (t30). From 171 attendees, 162 volunteers were surveyed on their perceptions on the experience. Furthermore, 97 volunteers participated in the DOCENTIA-ULPGC survey on the students' satisfaction, and 123 participants individually answered 20 QQ and 20 MQ. Data were analyzed using the program Jamovi 2.3.24. The survey on volunteers' perception comprised 11 Likert items and 3 numerical scale items. The former showed acceptable internal consistency (?-McDonald, 0.70) and validity (KMO, 0.58). Both types of e-questionnaires facilitated learning and motivated pre-reading contents but QQs were preferred. Reinforced lectures were rated higher than those unreinforced. Volunteers expressed higher overall satisfaction though DOCENTIA-ULPGC survey than the prepandemic control group. Average scores peaked at t0 with higher MQ rates. At t30, MQ and QQ scores were acceptable and similar. Participants' outcomes in the final exam tended to improve compared to the prepandemic control group, but without statistical significance. In summary, gamified and nongamified e-quizzes enhanced the student satisfaction and motivation and facilitated midterm knowledge retention.

Improving Knowledge Retention and Perceived Control Through Serious Games: A Study About Assisted Emergency Evacuation

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/improving-knowledge-retention-perceived-control/docview/3075425968/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Digital games for education and training, also called serious games (SGs), have shown beneficial effects on learning in several studies. In addition, some studies are suggesting that SGs could improve user's perceived control, which affects the likelihood that the learned content will be applied in the real world. However, most SG studies tend to focus on immediate effects, providing no indication on knowledge and perceived control over time, especially in contrast with nongame approaches. Moreover, SG research on perceived control has focused mainly on self-efficacy, disregarding the complementary construct of locus of control (LOC). This article advances both lines of research, assessing user's knowledge and LOC over time, with a SG as well as traditional printed materials that teach the same content. Results show that the SG was more effective than printed materials for knowledge retention over time, and a better retention outcome was found also for LOC. An additional contribution of the paper is the proposal of a novel SG that targets the inclusivity goal of safe evacuation for all, extending SG research to a domain not dealt with before, i.e., assisting persons with disabilities in emergencies.

Abstract: In the field of biology education, adaptive learning has been tested through a case study, serving as a crucible for innovative teaching methodologies designed to provide tailored, engaging, and effective learning experiences. This paper meticulously explores the implementation of select innovations in adaptive learning and reports on the outcomes derived from our fictitious case study. Our research underscores the efficacy of personalized learning pathways, where advanced algorithms dynamically customize content delivery based on individual students' needs and learning styles. Through our case study, we present compelling numerical evidence of a 25% improvement in learning outcomes and a notable 20% increase in student engagement. The strategic integration of real-time feedback and assessment mechanisms plays a pivotal role in enhancing the comprehension of biological concepts, as reflected in a 30% increase in student performance and a 15% boost in knowledge retention. Another simulated innovation involves the incorporation of gamification elements, resulting in a statistically significant 18% increase in student participation and a remarkable 22% surge in enthusiasm for biology studies. Our simulated findings accentuate how these elements can make biology education more enjoyable and motivating in a controlled environment. Furthermore, the simulated utilization of multimodal learning resources, such as videos, simulations, and interactive models, showcases a 28% improvement in students' ability to grasp complex biological concepts. This translates into a tangible 25% enhancement in student performance in assessments. The simulated investigation into the potential of Al-enhanced assistance, with AI chatbots and virtual tutors, reveals a simulated 35% increase in student satisfaction and a 27% improvement in performance. These simulated innovations demonstrate the positive impact of AI integration on student support. In addition, our simulated data-driven insights inform content and platform improvements, resulting in a simulated 20% increase in the adaptability of the learning system. These simulated results provide crucial insights into the optimization of adaptive learning in biology education. Through the presentation of these simulated innovations and their associated numerical results, this paper underscores the transformative potential of adaptive learning in the simulated context of biology education. These simulated innovations not only offer tailored learning experiences but also yield concrete, positive outcomes in terms of student understanding and performance. The simulated implications of our research are discussed in detail, emphasizing the promising future of these innovations in shaping simulated biology education. Furthermore, we suggest avenues for future research to continue improving adaptive learning methods, ensuring the simulated advancement of biology education in the digital age.

Abstract: The traditional training methods in radiological hot laboratories involve significant challenges, including the risk of radiation exposure and the development of radiophobia among learners. Virtual reality (VR) presents an innovative educational solution by simulating realistic hot lab environments and procedures without associated risks. This mixed-method study investigates the efficacy of VR in enhancing cognitive retention and practical skills and reducing radiophobia among students. All participants (video and VR cohorts) were given a pre-test, same-day training post-test, after 1 month, and after 3 months. In the 3-month test, 13% of the control group scored > 80%, and 87% of the VR group scored > 80% (6.69-fold more significant). VR simulated the real-world hot lab more accurately than training videos, resulting in increased confidence and safety. Resulting in the control group (video training), radiophobia decreased by 1.52-fold; in contrast, the VR training group reduced by 2.42-fold. These reductions indicate that VR training was significantly more effective in reducing radiophobia than traditional video training. VR enhanced knowledge retention, reduced radiophobia, increased safety confidence, and reduced fear about pursuing a career in nuclear medicine. Overall, VR created a safer working environment, and RT students responded more positively than the instruction videos. Consequently, a mixed-method study revealed key codes of engagement, easy understanding, memory, safety, confidence, learning experiences, implementation in the curriculum, and getting ready for clinical practice.

Abstract: This article is about experiments investigating teaching and learning processes and their effects on students. Specifically, the laboratory experiment method aims to determine if using virtual reality in classes leads to better learning outcomes, knowledge retention, satisfaction, engagement, and attractiveness compared to traditional teaching methods. The study found that students who used VR (Experimental Group—EG) had significantly better learning outcomes (with an average of 5.9747) compared to the control group (Control Group—CG), who only had traditional classes (with an average of 4.6229). The study employed a Likert scale from 1 to 7. The difference between EG and CG was 29.2%. Furthermore, the study found that students in the EG had higher knowledge retention, satisfaction, engagement, and attractiveness compared to the CG. All measurements were above 6.4 on the same scale. This study is important because it explores innovative teaching methods and their potential to improve learning outcomes, satisfaction, and efficiency. It also opens up avenues for further research on teaching methodologies for undergraduate students.

Abstract: Employee turnover introduces several risks, including loss of knowledge, delayed timelines, reduced productivity, quality issues, and reduced morale. When team members leave, they take their expertise and knowledge with them. This can be especially problematic if they were vital contributors to the project or had specialized skills. When team members leave, productivity may decrease due to the need to train new team employees, adjust to changes in team dynamics, and deal with the administrative tasks associated with turnover. A follow-on consequence is that new team members may have a different experience or understanding of the project requirements than those working on the project for an extended period. This can lead to quality issues and errors in the final product. A work environment with frequent turnover can lead to low morale among remaining team members, who may feel overworked or uncertain about the project's future. The impacts of these risks lead to increased costs in the product life cycle trickling down to the customer or impacting the business financials directly. Turnover can result in increased costs, such as hiring and training new team members or paying for overtime to make up for lost time to mitigate these risks. It is essential to have a solid plan for managing turnover, including documenting processes and procedures, cross-training team members, and developing a knowledge management strategy.

Semantic-driven knowledge-enabled cognitive decision support system

Abstract: The importance of knowledge and cognition in business intelligence and decision support systems (DSS) is indisputable. However two major issues, a) biases in cognition, and b) knowledge integration overhead in knowledge warehousing, hinder their optimum utility in such systems. We address the issue of biases by proposing semantic de-biased associations (SDA) model, which is an improvement over the conventional causal map representation of mental models. SDA model incorporates semantics and contextual information to implement automated de-biasing by employing de-biasing techniques and algorithm into the inherent process of mental model elicitation, storage and retrieval. An elicitation process customised for SDA-based representation was also proposed namely SDA articulation and elicitation cycle. SDA model automates the process of mental model validation and integration, so as to prevent any espoused theories to be stored in the system. It also provides faster access to relevant knowledge, while creating a knowledge cycle between user and the system, which provides learning and knowledge growth opportunities to the system users, promoting organizational learning. The issue of knowledge integration overhead is dealt with by proposing a unified, standard storage structure for knowledge warehousing in subjectoriented semantic knowledge warehouse (SSKW). The unified storage structure is achieved through categorising knowledge on syntactic level, and creating universal templates of these categories. In addition, the rules of how they can be connected together are outlined. The categories of knowledge, formalised, are object, process, and event. The connections between them are implemented through semantic relationships. The SSKW provides a domain independent knowledge warehousing architecture to store knowledge in a subject-oriented, semantic, integrated, systematic and meaningful manner. It incorporates object-oriented, semantic, and human-centric approaches to facilitate an intuitive and efficient communication. It prevents loss of knowledge, improves precision of output, and ensures efficient delivery of knowledge when required. The SDA model and SSKW are integrated together in this research to form a human-centric DSS, semantic-driven knowledge-enabled cognitive decision support system (SCDSS). SCDSS accumulates knowledge of many decision makers over time, thus if a decision maker leaves the organisation, his/her knowledge is retained through this system. Moreover, it automates the dissemination of knowledge across the organisation. Two evaluations were conducted to measure the performance of SCDSS against selected criteria. The results of the evaluations show that SCDSS successfully mitigates availability, framing, contextual and group biases, and generates new knowledge during decision making process. The results also demonstrate the effectiveness of SCDSS in knowledge sharing and enhancement, efficiency in producing output; and the relevance of knowledgein the output. The system can be accessed at http://tasneememon.com/SCDSS/index. php. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

Abstract: The National Tracheostomy Safety Project has run high-quality, face-to-face skills courses since 2009. The aim of this project was to produce a virtual reality version of the established course and evaluate its impact on participant learning, and participant and faculty satisfaction. Healthcare staff and students were recruited and randomised to attend one of (1) a face-to-face traditional course (control); (2) a virtual reality course at a conference centre with on-site technical support; (3) a fully remote virtual reality course; the virtual reality groups were combined for the analysis of learning outcomes and satisfaction. The primary outcome was the difference in pre/post-course knowledge scores on a 30-item questionnaire; secondary outcomes included knowledge retention, usability, comfort/side effects and participant performance in a simulated tracheostomy emergency. Thirty-seven participants and 15 faculty participated in this study. There was no significant difference between mean pre/post-course scores from the face-to-face (from 21.1 to 23.1; +2) and combined virtual reality (from 17.1 to 21.1; +4) groups, with both showing improvement (p = 0.21). The mean System Usability Scale score for virtual reality was 76.8 (SD 12.6), which is above average; the median Simulator Sickness Questionnaire score was 7.5 (IQR 3.7-22.4), indicating minimal symptoms. All participants resolved the primary clinical problem in the simulated emergency, but the virtual reality (VR) group was slower overall (mean difference 61.8 s, p = 0.003). This technical feasibility study demonstrated that there was no difference in participant knowledge immediately after and 4 weeks following face-to-face and virtual reality courses. Virtual reality offers an immersive experience that can be delivered remotely and offers potential benefits of reducing travel and venue costs for attendees, therefore increasing the flexibility of training opportunities.The National Tracheostomy Safety Project has run high-quality, face-to-face skills courses since 2009.

Abstract: Introduction: Education of patients prior to an invasive procedure is pivotal for good cooperation and knowledge retention. Virtual reality (VR) is a fast-developing technology that helps educate both medical professionals and patients. Objective: To prove non-inferiority of VR education compared to conventional education in patients prior to the implantation of a permanent pacemaker (PPM). Methods: 150 participants scheduled for an elective implantation of a PPM were enrolled in this prospective study and randomized into two groups: the VR group ( n = 75) watched a 360° video about the procedure using the VR headset Oculus Meta Quest 2, while the conventional group ( n = 75) was educated by a physician. Both groups filled out a questionnaire to assess the quality of education pre- and in-hospital, their knowledge of the procedure, and their subjective satisfaction. Results: There was no significant difference in the quality of education. There was a non-significant trend towards higher educational scores in the VR group. The subgroup with worse scores was older than the groups with higher scores (82 vs. 76 years, p = 0.025). Anxiety was reduced in 92% of participants. Conclusion: VR proved to be non-inferior to conventional education. It helped to reduce anxiety and showed no adverse effects.

Abstract: Understanding the pathways and biological processes underlying differential gene expression is fundamental for characterizing gene expression changes in response to an experimental condition. Zebrafish, with a transcriptome closely mirroring that of humans, are frequently utilized as a model for human development and disease. However, a challenge arises due to the incomplete annotations of zebrafish pathways and biological processes, with more comprehensive annotations existing in humans. This incompleteness may result in biased functional enrichment findings and loss of knowledge. danRerLib, a versatile Python package for zebrafish transcriptomics researchers, overcomes this challenge and provides a suite of tools to be executed in Python including gene ID mapping, orthology mapping for the zebrafish and human taxonomy, and functional enrichment analysis utilizing the latest updated Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. danRerLib enables functional enrichment analysis for GO and KEGG pathways, even when they lack direct zebrafish annotations through the orthology of human-annotated functional annotations. This approach enables researchers to extend their analysis to a wider range of pathways, elucidating additional mechanisms of interest and greater insight into experimental results.

Abstract: Background Although game-based applications have been used in disaster medicine education, no serious computer games have been designed specifically for training these nurses in an IEMT setting. To address this need, we developed a serious computer game called the IEMTtraining game. In this game, players assume the roles of IEMT nurses, assess patient injuries in a virtual environment, and provide suitable treatment options. Methods The design of this study is a retrospective comparative analysis. The research was conducted with 209 nurses in a hospital. The data collection process of this study was conducted at the 2019-2020 academic year. A retrospective comparative analysis was conducted on the pre-, post-, and final test scores of nurses in the IEMT. Additionally, a survey questionnaire was distributed to trainees to gather insights into teaching methods that were subsequently analyzed. Results There was a significant difference in the overall test scores between the two groups, with the game group demonstrating superior performance compared to the control group (odds ratio = 1.363, p value = 0.010). The survey results indicated that the game group exhibited higher learning motivation scores and lower cognitive load compared with the lecture group. Conclusions The IEMT training game developed by the instructor team is a promising and effective method for training nurses in disaster rescue within IEMTs. The game equips the trainees with the necessary skills and knowledge to respond effectively to emergencies. It is easily comprehended, enhances knowledge retention and motivation to learn, and reduces cognitive load.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 International Conference on Distributed Computing and Optimization Techniques (ICDCOT) Conference Start Date: 2024, March 15 Conference End Date: 2024, March 16 Conference Location: Bengaluru, India With the diversification of social education models, the personalization of educational needs, and the advancement of educational quality, online open courses have gradually become one of the important forms in the field of education. This study aims to construct a comprehensive evaluation index system for MOOC learning effectiveness by integrating educational theories and empirical research. Through an in-depth literature review, we traced the development trajectory of MOOCs and synthesized the theoretical framework for evaluating MOOC learning effectiveness based on the current domestic and international research landscape. Employing a weighted approach, we established primary and secondary indicators, supported by specific data such as a 75% average completion rate and an 85% knowledge retention rate, demonstrating the operational feasibility of the evaluation system. Empirical research results revealed strengths of MOOC learners in areas like social interaction, digital literacy, and real-world application. The final evaluation index system provides targeted interventions for educators and theoretical support for further optimization of MOOC platforms. This study contributes valuable guidance for enhancing the effectiveness and adaptability of online education.

The effect of gamified training on retention, knowledge, and confidence: A longitudinal experimental study

Author: Damon, Patrick Michael, II11 Northcentral University, School of Technology, US

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of gamified training in cybersecurity concepts on individuals not employed in information technology roles compared to traditional pieces of training. As the world becomes increasingly connected technologically, so too do the cyber vulnerabilities increase, and it is essential for all types of users, not just those in information technology, to avoid or detect vulnerabilities and potential cybersecurity incidents. This study was guided by the novel 7GOALS framework, built upon the existing PDCA framework. This study also utilizes the foundations provided by gamification theory and self-determination theory while introducing research on learning styles and how individuals have traditionally learned best. The study involved a pre-test, training, post-test, and one more test 30 days after the post-test to examine participants' knowledge, retention, and confidence. For this study, 115 individuals participated in the first component and 71 returned to perform the final test, exceeding the 54 participants that were needed for all components of the study. It was found that gamified training provides more significant increases in knowledge and retention but followed similar trends to traditional training regarding confidence. No relation was found between the level of knowledge and confidence as the control group had an alpha of over .05. A link was also found between knowledge and confidence where the gamified experiment component had a larger power with a rate of .735 with a smaller long-term confidence growth of .396 compared to the control group's .533. Future studies would benefit from increasing the length of the study and the number of participants and adjusting different variables within the gamified pieces of training to determine which are most related to the trainee's success. Ultimately, the study results implicate that engaged, gamified training would be more effective than traditional training for non-technical users.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 International Conference on Integrated Circuits and Communication Systems (ICICACS) Conference Start Date: 2024, Feb. 23 Conference End Date: 2024, Feb. 24 Conference Location: Raichur, India More and more research points to the microbiome's potential as a disease predictor, and the human microbiota is already playing an important role in human health. Microbiome data is notoriously high-dimensional (on the order of hundreds of thousands of dimensions), and prediction methods based on machine learning have a tough time with small sample numbers. Because of this disparity, the data is extremely scarce, which hinders the ability to train a more accurate prediction model. Existing approaches sometimes overlook taxonomic connections across microbial species or fail to account for plenty profiles from both known &nknown microbial-organisms, resulting in a substantial loss of knowledge. However, because to its exceptional feature-learning capability, deep learning has demonstrated unparalleled benefits in categorization tasks. On the other hand, it runs into trouble with metagenome-based illness prediction due to the fact that black-box models don't provide biological explanations and high-dimensional, low-sample-size metagenomic datasets might cause overfitting. Our solution to these issues is MetaDR, an all-encompassing framework for disease prediction in humans that makes use of deep learning and a wide range of data sources. The experimental findings show that MetaDR successfully finds the informative features using biological insights, and it achieves competitive prediction performance while reducing running time.

Abstract: Progress tests (PT) are a popular type of longitudinal assessment used for evaluating clinical knowledge retention and long-life learning in health professions education. Most PTs consist of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) whose development is costly and time-consuming. Automatic Item Generation (AIG) generates test items through algorithms, promising to ease this burden. However, it remains unclear how AIG-items behave in formative assessment (FA) modalities such as PTs compared to manually written items. The purpose of this study was to compare the quality and validity of AIG-items versus manually written items. Responses to 126 (23 automatically generated) dichotomously scored single best-answer five-option MCQs retrieved from the 2021 University of Minho PT of medicine were analyzed. Procedures based on item response theory (IRT), dimensionality testing, item fit, reliability, differential item functioning (DIF) and distractor analysis were used. Qualitative assessment was conducted through expert review. Validity evidence of AIG-items was assessed by using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). The PT proved to be a viable tool for assessing medical students cognitive competencies. AIG-items were parallel to manually written-items, presenting similar indices of difficulty and information. The proportion of functional distractors for both AIG and manually written items was similar. Evidence of validity for AIG-items was found while showing higher levels of item quality. AIG-items functioned as intended and were appropriate for evaluating medical students at various levels of the knowledge spectrum.

Abstract: Nursing students struggle to retain enough anatomical knowledge to meet their entry to practice competencies, but what knowledge is missing and when this occurs has been previously unexplored. A cohort of 80 nursing students were given multiple choice quizzes to assess their anatomical knowledge on 11 different organ systems during their second, third, and fourth year. Results were analyzed in comparison to their first-year examination scores to determine knowledge loss. Results showed an overall knowledge loss of 33.5% in the second year, 31.8% in the third year, and 29.6% in the fourth year. There were significant differences in system specific results. Special senses (i.e., audition) had a 20.6% loss in the second year, increased in retention to a 17.3% loss in third year, and then decreased to a 37% loss in fourth year. The vascular system had a 46.1% knowledge loss at the second-year assessment, declined to 49% knowledge loss in the third year, but improved to 27.6% knowledge loss by the fourth year. A similar change was observed for the musculoskeletal system with second-year loss at 30.7%, third-year loss at 40.3%, and fourth-year loss at 26.6%. These data suggest there are significant differences in the amount of knowledge retained by nursing students depending on the system being tested and the year the test is taken. Identifying the areas and times where anatomical knowledge is lost and gained is valuable for instructors in any program so that specific topics can be targeted at different times with more effective educational strategies.

Abstract: This work investigates the design and usability of a novel eXtended Reality (XR) Vest, which combines two viewpoints for demonstration-based training (DBT). Traditional modalities for DBT, such as prerecorded videos and live instruction, are minimally engaging and potentially hazardous resulting in low motivation and knowledge retention. To combat this, works incorporate XR technology to improve training immersiveness, safety, and engagement. When worn by a trainer, our XR Vest enables trainees to have the first-person perspective of immersive XR environments on an integrated tablet while simultaneously watching the third-person motor movements. To test the XR Vest in DBT, 28 individuals completed three training sessions: 1) using an Oculus Quest 2 (baseline); 2) watching a DBT video on a desktop computer monitor (first-person perspective); and 3) viewing a DBT on the XR Vest (first-person and third-person perspectives). Following each session, the participants performed a memory aptitude test to evaluate their recall, a NASA Task Load Index questionnaire to investigate their perceived workload, and a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire to measure the usability of the systems. A linear mixed-effect analysis showed significant differences between the temporal demand, physical demand, and frustration in the NASA-TLX scores and the integration and learnability features in the SUS scores. The results suggest that incorporating XR technology in first- and third-person perspectives within the XR Vest decreased workload and improved system usability. Future works should evaluate the benefits of this XR design in other domains where DBT is used.

Abstract: Developer turnover is inevitable on software projects and leads to knowledge loss, a reduction in productivity, and an increase in defects. Mitigation strategies to deal with turnover tend to disrupt and increase workloads for developers. In this work, we suggest that through code review recommendation we can distribute knowledge and mitigate turnover while more evenly distributing review workload. We conduct historical analyses to understand the natural concentration of review workload and the degree of knowledge spreading that is inherent in code review. Even though review workload is highly concentrated, we show that code review natural spreads knowledge thereby reducing the files at risk to turnover. Using simulation, we evaluate existing code review recommenders and develop novel recommenders to understand their impact on the level of expertise during review, the workload of reviewers, and the files at risk to turnover. Our simulations use seeded random replacement of reviewers to allow us to compare the reviewer recommenders without the confounding variation of different reviewers being replaced for each recommender. We find that prior work that assigns reviewers based on file ownership concentrates knowledge on a small group of core developers increasing the risk of knowledge loss from turnover. Recent work, WhoDo, that considers developer workload, assigns developers that are not sufficiently committed to the project and we see an increase in files at risk to turnover. We propose learning and retention aware review recommenders that when combined are effective at reducing the risk of turnover, but they unacceptably reduce the overall expertise during reviews. Combining recommenders, we develop the SofiaWL recommender that suggests experts with low active review workload when none of the files under review are known by only one developer. In contrast, when knowledge is concentrated on one developer, it sends the review to other reviewers to spread knowledge. For the projects we study, we are able to globally increase expertise during reviews, [Formula Omitted]%, reduce workload concentration, [Formula Omitted]%, and reduce the files at risk, [Formula Omitted]%. We make our scripts and data available in our replication package [1] . Developers can optimize for a particular outcome measure based on the needs of their project, or use our GitHub bot to automatically balance the outcomes [2] .

Abstract: Background Poor learning and retention are common problems of students, which may be alleviated by optimization of widely used educational methods such as lectures. This study aimed to investigate the effect of spaced learning on the learning outcome and retention of nurse anesthesia students. Methods This was a randomized controlled study with a pre-and post-test design on 64 nurse anesthesia students who were divided into two groups of spaced lecture ( n  = 32) and conventional lecture ( n  = 32). The spaced lectures included three 30-minute training sessions with 10-minute intervals while the conventional sessions including 90 min of continuous training. Students’ knowledge was measured using one valid and reliable questionnaire developed by the research team. All students in both groups took a pre-test, and their level of knowledge acquisition was evaluated immediately after the training. Their level of knowledge retention was tested two and four weeks after the lecture. Results There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding demographic characteristics ( p  > 0.05). In the pre-test, the mean score of knowledge in the intervention group was lower than that in the control group, there was no significant difference ( p  = 0.177). But after the intervention, the mean scores of learning outcome and retention in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group ( p  < 0.001, eta = 0.576). Also, the results showed that learning outcome and retention across the three academic semesters in the two groups are significantly different, and students with a higher academic semester obtained a significantly higher mean score of knowledge and retention ( p  < 0.001, eta = 0.604). Conclusion Spaced learning improves nurse anesthesia students’ knowledge and retention more than conventional method. Future studies focusing on spaced learning should specifically examine the impact of duration and number of intervals, as well as the time gap between training and measurement of learning retention.

Abstract: Background Achievement of evidence-informed decision making (EIDM) requires the integration of evidence into all practice decisions by identifying and synthesizing evidence, then developing and executing plans to implement and evaluate changes to practice. This rapid systematic review synthesizes evidence for strategies for the implementation of EIDM across organizations, mapping facilitators and barriers to the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation, behaviour) model for behaviour change. The review was conducted to support leadership at organizations delivering public health services (health promotion, communicable disease prevention) to drive change toward evidence-informed public health. Methods A systematic search was conducted in multiple databases and by reviewing publications of key authors. Articles that describe interventions to drive EIDM within teams, departments, or organizations were eligible for inclusion. For each included article, quality was assessed, and details of the intervention, setting, outcomes, facilitators and barriers were extracted. A convergent integrated approach was undertaken to analyze both quantitative and qualitative findings. Results Thirty-seven articles are included. Studies were conducted in primary care, public health, social services, and occupational health settings. Strategies to implement EIDM included the establishment of Knowledge Broker-type roles, building the EIDM capacity of staff, and research or academic partnerships. Facilitators and barriers align with the COM-B model for behaviour change. Facilitators for capability include the development of staff knowledge and skill, establishing specialized roles, and knowledge sharing across the organization, though staff turnover and subsequent knowledge loss was a barrier to capability. For opportunity, facilitators include the development of processes or mechanisms to support new practices, forums for learning and skill development, and protected time, and barriers include competing priorities. Facilitators identified for motivation include supportive organizational culture, expectations for new practices to occur, recognition and positive reinforcement, and strong leadership support. Barriers include negative attitudes toward new practices, and lack of understanding and support from management. Conclusion This review provides a comprehensive analysis of facilitators and barriers for the implementation of EIDM in organizations for public health, mapped to the COM-B model for behaviour change. The existing literature for strategies to support EIDM in public health illustrates several facilitators and barriers linked to realizing EIDM.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 5th International Conference on Mobile Computing and Sustainable Informatics (ICMCSI) Conference Start Date: 2024, Jan. 18 Conference End Date: 2024, Jan. 19 Conference Location: Lalitpur, Nepal Educational systems often deliver uniform coursework and exams to all students, irrespective of their prior knowledge, interests, or learning ability. This absence of personalization can lead to reduced engagement levels and diminished learning outcomes. The adoption Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) is driven by its recognition that each learner is unique, with distinct strengths, weaknesses, and learning styles. Traditional classrooms typically cannot accommodate these variations effectively, leading to a significant achievement gap among students. Moreover, ITS excels at promoting self-directed learning by providing instant feedback, hints, and tailored assessments, which motivates the learner to take initiative in their learning process. This shift towards self-directed learning not only fosters a sense of autonomy and responsibility but also equips learners with valuable skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and resourcefulness. This study proposes an ITS which uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT). Through the seamless integration of LSTM across key modules, the Intelligent Tutoring System offers content-level recommendations, dynamic assessments, and real-time support for learner doubts and questions. The study aims to enhance learner engagement, satisfaction, motivation, and knowledge retention by personalizing learning content to individual needs and preferences.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) Conference Start Date: 2024, Jan. 3 Conference End Date: 2024, Jan. 8 Conference Location: Waikoloa, HI, USA Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown remarkable performance in computer vision tasks when trained offline. However, in a Continual Learning (CL) scenario where new data is introduced progressively, models still suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Retraining a model from scratch to adapt to newly generated data is time-consuming and inefficient. Previous approaches suggested re-purposing self-supervised objectives with knowledge distillation to mitigate forgetting across tasks, assuming that labels from all tasks are available during fine-tuning. In this paper, we generalize self-supervised continual learning in a practical setting where available labels can be leveraged in any step of the SSL process. With an increasing number of continual tasks, this offers more flexibility in the pre-training and fine-tuning phases. With Kaizen1, we introduce a training architecture that is able to mitigate catastrophic forgetting for both the feature extractor and classifier with a carefully designed loss function. By using a set of comprehensive evaluation metrics reflecting different aspects of continual learning, we demonstrated that Kaizen significantly outperforms previous SSL models in competitive vision benchmarks, with up to 16.5% accuracy improvement on split CIFAR-100. Kaizen is able to balance the trade-off between knowledge retention and learning from new data with an end-to-end model, paving the way for practical deployment of continual learning systems.

Abstract: Two variants of semantic dementia are recognized based on the laterality of temporal lobe involvement: a left-predominant variant associated with verbal knowledge impairment and a right-predominant variant associated with behavioural changes and non-verbal knowledge loss. This cross-sectional clinicoradiologic study aimed to assess whole hippocampal, subregion, and/or subfield volume loss in semantic dementia versus controls and across its variants. Thirty-five semantic dementia participants and 15 controls from the Neurodegenerative Research Group at Mayo Clinic who had completed 3.0-T volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography were included. Classification as left-predominant ( n = 25) or right-predominant ( n = 10) variant was based on temporal lobe hypometabolism. Volumes of hippocampal subregions (head, body, and tail) and subfields (parasubiculum, presubiculum, subiculum, cornu ammonis 1, cornu ammonis 3, cornu ammonis 4, dentate gyrus, molecular layer, hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area, and fimbria) were obtained using FreeSurfer 7. Subfield volumes were measured separately from head and body subregions. We fit linear mixed-effects models using log-transformed whole hippocampal/subregion/subfield volumes as dependent variables; age, sex, total intracranial volume, hemisphere and a group-by-hemisphere interaction as fixed effects; and subregion/subfield nested within hemisphere as a random effect. Significant results ( P < 0.05) are hereby reported. At the whole hippocampal level, the dominant (predominantly involved) hemisphere of both variants showed 23-27% smaller volumes than controls. The non-dominant (less involved) hemisphere of the right-predominant variant also showed volume loss versus controls and the left-predominant variant. At the subregional level, both variants showed 17-28% smaller dominant hemisphere head, body, and tail than controls, with the right-predominant variant also showing 8-12% smaller non-dominant hemisphere head than controls and left-predominant variant. At the subfield level, the left-predominant variant showed 12-36% smaller volumes across all dominant hemisphere subfields and 14-15% smaller non-dominant hemisphere parasubiculum, presubiculum (head and body), subiculum (head) and hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area than controls. The right-predominant variant showed 16-49% smaller volumes across all dominant hemisphere subfields and 14-22% smaller parasubiculum, presubiculum, subiculum, cornu ammonis 3, hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area (all from the head) and fimbria of non-dominant hemisphere versus controls. Comparison of dominant hemispheres showed 16-29% smaller volumes of the parasubiculum, presubiculum (head) and fimbria in the right-predominant than left-predominant variant; comparison of non-dominant hemispheres showed 12-15% smaller cornu ammonis 3, cornu ammonis 4, dentate gyrus, hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area (all from the head) and cornu ammonis 1, cornu ammonis 3 and cornu ammonis 4 (all from the body) in the right-predominant variant. All hippocampal subregion/subfield volumes are affected in semantic dementia, although some are more affected in both dominant and non-dominant hemispheres of the right-predominant than the left-predominant variant by the time of presentation. Involvement of hippocampal structures is apparently more subregion dependent than subfield dependent, indicating possible superiority of subregion volumes as disease biomarkers.Two variants of semantic dementia are recognized based on the laterality of temporal lobe involvement: a left-predominant variant associated with verbal knowledge impairment and a right-predominant variant associated with behavioural changes and non-verbal knowledge loss.

Investigating the role of collective trauma among Afghan refugees: A transformative mixed methods study

Author: Kirsch, Jaclyn Elizabeth11 The Ohio State University, Social Work, US

Publication info: Kirsch, Jaclyn Elizabeth. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigating-role-collective-trauma-among-afghan/docview/3031747529/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Although higher levels of mental health concerns among refugees and other forced migrant populations have received considerable attention, there is a dearth of literature exploring the concept of collective trauma and its impact on mental health outcomes among this population. Afghan refugees have been found to experience high levels of individual trauma that negatively impact their mental health, but there is a lack of understanding of the impact of collective trauma experiences on mental health outcomes. Guided by the Social Determinants of Mental Health (SDMH) Framework integrated with Historical Trauma Theory and Intersectionality, this multiple-manuscript dissertation explores the phenomenon of collective trauma among the Afghan refugee population in resettlement spaces. This dissertation uses data from a community-based participatory project that followed a transformative mixed methods study design developed in partnership with the Afghan refugee diaspora in Central Ohio. This exploratory mixed methods study began with a community survey (N = 173) eliciting information on mental health, individual trauma, collective trauma, and post-migration difficulties, followed by a second phase of focus group discussions (N = 36). In the first study, a scoping review was conducted to examine the current state of literature on the concept of collective trauma in the forced migration context. Following the guidelines established by Arksey & O'Malley (2005), the scoping review examined 19 articles were found that met review criteria. Six major themes were identified: (1) exploration of collective trauma; (2) impacts of collective trauma: (3) intergenerational trauma; (4) resilience and resistance; (5) practice and policy failures of the West; (6) solutions to healing. Results support the inclusion of collective trauma in future research on forced migration populations and advocate for interventions that work to heal collective trauma experiences. The second study uses quantitative data from the transformative mixed methods study to identify the frequency of collective trauma events and symptoms and investigate the sociodemographic differences among Afghan refugees on well-being outcomes postmigration. Results revealed high levels of collective trauma experienced by participants (N = 173). The most common experiences included "loss of knowledge about our culture as a result of the education give to our children", "loss of land", "losing our traditional values", and "loss of respect by our children for traditional ways". In addition, the most common collective trauma symptoms included "sadness or depression", "anxious or nervousness", and "loss of sleep". Collective trauma experiences varied across different demographic strata. For example, women, Afghans who spent time in displacement and on military basses, ethnic minorities within the Afghan population, those with limited English, those with precarious visa statuses, and those with lower income showed an increased likelihood of experiencing higher levels of collective trauma symptoms and mental health concerns. Building off the findings of the second study that points to high levels of collective trauma among this population, the third study uses mixed methods results to investigate the role of collective trauma on Afghan refugee mental well-being and explore how collective trauma experiences among Afghans are associated with mental well-being within the post-migration context. Using hierarchical multiple regression, quantitative results showed a good model fit and that increased collective trauma is positively associated with negative mental health outcomes.

Abstract: In this work, we improve the generative replay in a continual learning setting to perform well on challenging scenarios. Because of the growing complexity of continual learning tasks, it is becoming more popular, to apply the generative replay technique in the feature space instead of image space. Nevertheless, such an approach does not come without limitations. In particular, we notice the degradation of the continually trained model’s performance could be attributed to the fact that the generated features are far from the original ones when mapped to the latent space. Therefore, we propose three modifications that mitigate these issues. More specifically, we incorporate the distillation in latent space between the current and previous models to reduce feature drift. Additionally, a latent matching for the reconstruction and original data is proposed to improve generated features alignment. Further, based on the observation that the reconstructions are better for preserving knowledge, we add the cycling of generations through the previously trained model to make them closer to the original data. Our method outperforms other generative replay methods in various scenarios. Code available at https://github.com/valeriya-khan/looking-through-the-past .

Abstract: Anomaly detection is of paramount importance in many real-world domains characterized by evolving behavior, such as monitoring cyber-physical systems, human conditions and network traffic. Current research in anomaly detection leverages offline learning working with static data or online learning focusing on constant adaptation to evolving data. At the same time, lifelong learning represents an emerging trend, answering the need for machine learning models that continuously adapt to new challenges in dynamic environments while retaining past knowledge. Although this aspect could be beneficial to build effective and robust anomaly detection models, lifelong learning research is mainly dedicated to proposing new model update strategies in image classification and reinforcement learning domains. The limited scope addressed by lifelong learning works thus far creates a gap in understanding whether such techniques and capabilities can be fruitfully exploited in anomaly detection contexts, which represents the main motivation of this paper. More specifically, anomaly detection provides unique challenges, such as an evolving normal class and limited availability of anomalies, which significantly differs from the landscape and scenarios of lifelong image classification and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we face this issue by exploring, motivating, and discussing lifelong anomaly detection, as well as providing foundations with regard to scenarios, strategies, and metrics. First, we explain why lifelong anomaly detection is relevant, defining challenges and opportunities to design anomaly detection methods that deal with lifelong learning complexities. Second, we formulate and characterize lifelong learning settings tailored for anomaly detection problems, and design a scenario generation procedure that enables researchers to experiment with lifelong anomaly detection using existing datasets. Third, we perform experiments with popular anomaly detection methods on proposed lifelong scenarios, emphasizing the gap in performance that could be filled with the adoption of lifelong learning. In summary, our efforts are directed at assessing the performance of non-lifelong anomaly detection models in lifelong scenarios and how the adoption of lifelong learning impacts their learning capabilities. Overall, we conclude that the adoption of lifelong anomaly detection is important to design more robust models that provide a comprehensive view of the environment, as well as simultaneous adaptation and knowledge retention.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 14th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science & Engineering (Confluence) Conference Start Date: 2024, Jan. 18 Conference End Date: 2024, Jan. 19 Conference Location: Noida, India In the Peruvian financial sector, deficiencies persist in customer service training due to inadequate comprehension of work motivation and the absence of suitable incentives, reflective of concerns regarding skill shortages and operational inconsistencies among employees. This study proposes a gamification framework tailored to enhance the training of Customer Service advisors within financial entities, addressing the gap in specific training models for this crucial sector. Through analysis, design, and validation stages, the research scrutinizes existing methodologies and implements the framework within a financial Contact Center, yielding impressive results. Notably, a remarkable 85% reduction in training time (from 60 to 8.80 minutes) while maintaining consistent evaluation scores with a 1% increase, alongside a noteworthy 13% decrease in average evaluation duration, underscores the framework's efficacy. These findings emphasize its potential for continual enhancement in training practices, promoting heightened productivity, knowledge retention, and motivation among Customer Service advisors within the financial landscape.

Abstract: Background Sustaining evidence-based practices (EBPs) is crucial to ensuring care quality and addressing health disparities. Approaches to identifying factors related to sustainability are critically needed. One such approach is Matrixed Multiple Case Study (MMCS), which identifies factors and their combinations that influence implementation. We applied MMCS to identify factors related to the sustainability of the evidence-based Collaborative Chronic Care Model (CCM) at nine Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient mental health clinics, 3–4 years after implementation support had concluded. Methods We conducted a directed content analysis of 30 provider interviews, using 6 CCM elements and 4 Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) domains as codes. Based on CCM code summaries, we designated each site as high/medium/low sustainability. We used i-PARIHS code summaries to identify relevant factors for each site, the extent of their presence, and the type of influence they had on sustainability (enabling/neutral/hindering/unclear). We organized these data into a sortable matrix and assessed sustainability-related cross-site trends. Results CCM sustainability status was distributed among the sites, with three sites each being high, medium, and low. Twenty-five factors were identified from the i-PARIHS code summaries, of which 3 exhibited strong trends by sustainability status (relevant i-PARIHS domain in square brackets): “Collaborativeness/Teamwork [Recipients],” “Staff/Leadership turnover [Recipients],” and “Having a consistent/strong internal facilitator [Facilitation]” during and after active implementation. At most high-sustainability sites only, (i) “Having a knowledgeable/helpful external facilitator [Facilitation]” was variably present and enabled sustainability when present, while (ii) “Clarity about what CCM comprises [Innovation],” “Interdisciplinary coordination [Recipients],” and “Adequate clinic space for CCM team members [Context]” were somewhat or less present with mixed influences on sustainability. Conclusions MMCS revealed that CCM sustainability in VA outpatient mental health clinics may be related most strongly to provider collaboration, knowledge retention during staff/leadership transitions, and availability of skilled internal facilitators. These findings have informed a subsequent CCM implementation trial that prospectively examines whether enhancing the above-mentioned factors within implementation facilitation improves sustainability. MMCS is a systematic approach to multi-site examination that can be used to investigate sustainability-related factors applicable to other EBPs and across multiple contexts.

A qualitative case study on organizational climate factors influencing employee retention within a local municipality

Author: Ackerman, Donna L.11 Trident Univer sity International, College of Business Administration, US

Publication info: Ackerman, Donna L. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/qualitative-case-study-on-organizational-climate/docview/2954882753/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Employee retention is vital for employee morale, knowledge retention, performance, and cost savings. Although the City of Fort Worth municipality has generally experienced above-average employee turnover and attrition, an interesting case is the municipality's Customer Care Contact Center, which has experienced high employee retention. The problem this study addressed was the lack of knowledge of employee perceptions concerning organizational climate factors that influenced employee retention at the City of Fort Worth Contact Center. The researcher used this knowledge to provide actionable recommendations for the City of Fort Worth on organizational climate factors to increase employee retention citywide. Therefore, this qualitative case study examined employee perceptions of organizational climate factors that influenced employee retention at the City of Fort Worth Customer Care Contact Center, generated knowledge on how to improve organizational climate factors, and provided actionable recommendations that could be used in other departments across the city to increase retention. This qualitative case study was conducted by administering online questionnaires, follow-up interviews, and a focus group that resulted in the qualitative data analysis from 22 employees, which consisted of 16 customer service representatives (CSRs) and six leaders. This research study included the following research questions: RQ1. What are the employee perceptions of the organizational climate factors that influence employee retention at the City of Fort Worth Customer Care Contact Center? RQ2. How can the City of Fort Worth use those organizational climate factors to increase employee retention citywide? This study followed the Braun and Clarke (2006) six-step thematic data analysis process of coding and analyzing themes, and data from all three data instruments were triangulated to improve credibility and reliability. The key findings were six themes that described the organizational climate factors that influenced employees to stay at their jobs. The first five themes focused on the following factors influencing employee perceptions, behaviors, and outcomes: work-life balance and well-being, supervisor quality and effectiveness, teamwork, development and advancement opportunities, and empowerment and accountability. The sixth theme focused on specific retention strategies, such as encouraging self-care and leading by example. Aligning with Herzberg's two-factor motivation-hygiene theory and social exchange theory (SET), used as the theoretical framework, findings indicated that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors must be present, desired by employees, and perceived as valued to maintain employee satisfaction, improve performance, and employee retention. Implications for business included the opportunity to implement recommended strategies in other departments within the City of Fort Worth to encourage more motivated, engaged, and satisfied employees, which may lead to higher retention rates and organizational cost savings due to the potential reduction in recruitment costs. The research study revealed that quality leadership was a key component for creating a climate that fostered employee motivation and satisfaction: a prerequisite for increased employee retention. On this basis, future research should examine the ability of leadership development programs to expand leadership skills that foster healthy organizational climate factors in the workplace. Other recommendations for future research included determining if the civil service departments, such as police and fire, could apply the results successfully.

Abstract: An organisation's success to a great extent depends on its capability to leverage knowledge and produce value from its knowledge resources. However, shifting workforce demographics are causing challenges to organisations in this regard. A significant number of experienced employees are retiring, changing to part-time or moving from their employment. This leads to corporate memory loss. Catalysts of the problem include cost saving calls that have left companies struggling to maintain the current productive labour force in the face of dwindling labour pools due to streamlining of operations. The recent economic recession caused retrenchments across many organisations and thus loss of knowledge. The increased mobility of the younger generation of employees is not helping either. The consequences of this management challenge range from loss in efficiency, loss in time, lack of capacity to reach strategic goals, decrease in employee and customer satisfaction levels, costly expenditures of trying to recoup lost knowledge pieces ultimately resulting in the potential compromise of the company's performance. It is therefore the objective of this study to establish if there is a relationship between knowledge management and organisational performance. As part of the study, knowledge management was thought to comprise the key constructs of knowledge dissemination (KDI), knowledge acquisition (KAC), responsiveness to knowledge (RTK) and knowledge management practices (KMP) as identified in prior studies. Interestingly, results point to the inability of respondents to clearly distinguish between KDI, KAC and RTK constructs. It would therefore seem that the understanding that previous researches, predominantly undertaken in developed societies, relied upon to create the three constructs does not exist in the construction and engineering industry in South Africa. The three constructs were thereafter collapsed into a distinct construct called knowledge process capability (KPC).Using a respondent population of employees from companies in the construction and engineering industry in South Africa, results revealed the existence of relationships between the component-constructs of KPC and KMP with organisational performance. A similar association was depicted on the constructs of interest, being knowledge management and organisational performance. Academically, the results enrich the body of literature as it pertains to knowledge management specifically in South Africa and more so in the engineering and construction industry. Practically, the empirical evidence provides necessary impetus for greater attention and investment on the part of companies in the area, buoyed by the realisation that it contributes to the goal of better organisational performance.

Organizational Resilience to Knowledge Loss in Biotechnology Research

Abstract: In this article, we examine organizational resilience to research and development (R&D) productivity losses following knowledge loss (aka “forgetting”) using a long panel (1970–2007) of data on U.S. biotechnology research. In our model, knowledge and R&D productivity loss may occur through three mechanisms, scientist turnover, interference with knowledge retrieval, and scientist knowledge decay. Our model also proposes three means through which organizations may become resilient to the effects of knowledge loss on R&D productivity. First, managers may compensate for knowledge losses due to turnover by recruitment. Second, the effects of interference to knowledge retrieval due to the use of new technologies may be minimized if new technologies are introduced into organizations by members with little prior experience in using incumbent technologies or by scientists with little prior collaboration experience. Third, scientists may mitigate the effects of knowledge decay by relearning because the reacquisition of previously lost knowledge is easier than learning it was initially. Irrespective of their source, our results suggest that the agency plays a role in making an organization resist the negative effects of knowledge loss on its R&D productivity.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and eXtended and Virtual Reality (AIxVR) Conference Start Date: 2024, Jan. 17 Conference End Date: 2024, Jan. 19 Conference Location: Los Angeles, CA, USA Anatomy education is an indispensable part of medical training, but traditional methods face challenges like limited resources for dissection in large classes and difficulties understanding 2D anatomy in textbooks. Advanced technologies, such as 3D visualization and augmented reality (AR), are transforming anatomy learning. This paper presents two in-house solutions that use handheld tablets or screen-based AR to visualize 3D anatomy models with informative labels and in-situ visualizations of the muscle anatomy. To assess these tools, a user study of muscle anatomy education involved 236 premedical students in dyadic teams, with results showing that the tablet-based 3D visualization and screen-based AR tools led to significantly higher learning experience scores than traditional textbook. While knowledge retention didn’t differ significantly, ethnographic and gender analysis showed that male students generally reported more positive learning experiences than female students. This study discusses the implications for anatomy and medical education, highlighting the potential of these innovative learning tools considering gender and team dynamics in body painting anatomy learning interventions.

Abstract: This study explores a game model that uses scaffolding to learn about cultural heritage based on adventure games. A case study using traditional Chinese murals tested the effectiveness of serious games in improving learning performance and knowledge acquisition. This study observed and evaluated the learning outcomes of 64 students by using serious game learning compared to traditional video learning in an experimental setting. Changes in knowledge acquisition, intrinsic motivation, cognitive load (extrinsic load vs. germane load), and engagement were collected through a series of tests and scales. Experimental results show that digital adventure games have better learning performance and knowledge retention effects, higher intrinsic motivation, germane load, and engagement than traditional video learning. The reasons affecting academic performance were analyzed from the data, and it was found that intrinsic motivation and germane cognitive load positively affected game performance, and external cognitive load hurt game performance. This study provides experience on the design of serious games in cultural heritage learning.

Abstract: In the task incremental learning problem, deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously seen classes/tasks as they are trained on new classes/tasks. This problem becomes even harder when some of the test classes do not belong to the training class set, i.e., the task incremental generalized zero-shot learning problem. We propose a novel approach to address the task incremental learning problem for both the non zero-shot and zero-shot settings. Our proposed approach, called Rectification-based Knowledge Retention (RKR), applies weight rectifications and affine transformations for adapting the model to any task. During testing, our approach can use the task label information (task-aware) to quickly adapt the network to that task. We also extend our approach to make it task-agnostic so that it can work even when the task label information is not available during testing. Specifically, given a continuum of test data, our approach predicts the task and quickly adapts the network to the predicted task. We experimentally show that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets for both non zero-shot and zero-shot task incremental learning.

Leadership strategies to initiate and reinforce knowledge sharing among employees

Author: Oshineye, Morufat11 Walden University, Management, US

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/leadership-strategies-initiate-reinforce/docview/2919441907/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Knowledge loss due to the exit of experienced employees with critical knowledge results in significant financial and nonfinancial impacts on employees and organizational competitiveness. Business leaders are interested in finding strategies to initiate and reinforce employee knowledge sharing to prevent business failure. Grounded in social cognitive theory, the purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore strategies business leaders in Nigerian oil and gas public sector agencies use to initiate and reinforce knowledge sharing among employees to prevent knowledge loss. The participants were five business leaders in Nigerian oil and gas public sector agencies who successfully initiated and reinforced knowledge sharing among employees. Data were collected through semistructured interviews and a review of organizational documents. Thematic analysis yielded four themes: develop structured mentoring, institute a knowledge-sharing culture, establish open and effective communication, and provide leadership support. A key recommendation is for business leaders to utilize the employee handbook to assist in knowledge sharing. The implications for positive social change include the potential to increase intellectual capital among employees, boost efficiency and overall productivity, and reduce the learning curve cost attributed to employee replacement, resulting in cost savings that organizations can channel toward social projects for the benefit of the host community.

Abstract: Stock selection is essential for portfolio diversification to reduce risks and maximize profits. However, stock selection is challenging owing to the non-stationary nature of stock markets. In fact, stock markets experience abrupt or gradual concept drift because of their inherent volatility. Concept drift is a phenomenon in which the statistical characteristics of data change over time. Recent stock selection methods have adopted graph neural networks to capture the relational dependencies between stocks. These methods perform non-continual learning that uses a fixed set of stocks without knowledge retention. Non-continual graph learning-based methods can adapt to abrupt concept drift, while continual graph learning-based methods can adapt to gradual concept drift because they involve knowledge retention. To adapt to both abrupt and gradual concept drifts, we propose a stock selection framework called DASS, which combines non-continual and continual models for diversified adaptation. For the both models, we employ graph learning to extract both temporal and relational dependencies. Our graph learning method relies on three main components: 1) low-level temporal modeling, which extracts temporal dependencies of individual stocks; 2) relational modeling, which extracts relational dependencies between stocks; and 3) high-level temporal modeling, which extracts temporal dependencies from the learned relational dependencies. Furthermore, DASS leverages both simple graphs and hypergraphs because they complement each other. The performance of DASS is compared with that of state-of-the-art stock selection methods. Experimental results for stocks included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index reveal that DASS achieves a compounded annual growth rate of 83.2%, outperforming the second-best method by 23.0%P.

Abstract: This work investigates the design and usability of a novel eXtended Reality (XR) Vest, which combines two viewpoints for demonstration-based training (DBT). Traditional modalities for DBT, such as prerecorded videos and live instruction, are minimally engaging and potentially hazardous resulting in low motivation and knowledge retention. To combat this, works incorporate XR technology to improve training immersiveness, safety, and engagement. When worn by a trainer, our XR Vest enables trainees to have the first-person perspective of immersive XR environments on an integrated tablet while simultaneously watching the third-person motor movements. To test the XR Vest in DBT, 28 individuals completed three training sessions: 1) using an Oculus Quest 2 (baseline); 2) watching a DBT video on a desktop computer monitor (first-person perspective); and 3) viewing a DBT on the XR Vest (first-person and third-person perspectives). Following each session, the participants performed a memory aptitude test to evaluate their recall, a NASA Task Load Index questionnaire to investigate their perceived workload, and a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire to measure the usability of the systems. A linear mixed-effect analysis showed significant differences between the temporal demand, physical demand, and frustration in the NASA-TLX scores and the integration and learnability features in the SUS scores. The results suggest that incorporating XR technology in first- and third-person perspectives within the XR Vest decreased workload and improved system usability. Future works should evaluate the benefits of this XR design in other domains where DBT is used.

The effect of medication information delivery format on cognitive load and knowledge retention of informal caregivers

Author: McPherson, Mary Lynn11 University of Maryland, Baltimore, Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, US

Publication info: McPherson, Mary Lynn.

Abstract: Informal caregivers (IFCs) are tasked with many responsibilities in patient care, including medication management. Many IFCs feel ill-prepared for this responsibility, and it is incumbent on health care professionals to provide education and ensure IFCs competence in medication management. One common strategy is to provide a medication information leaflet to the IFC to prepare them for this role. Designing medication information leaflets using sound educational principles, such as an infographic designed according to the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML), may optimize knowledge retention and decrease cognitive load for IFCs. The purpose of this randomized, experimental study was to investigate the impact of medication information delivery format on immediate retention of medication information and cognitive load of IFCs of patients with a serious illness. Using purposive sampling, 120 IFCs who have provided some element of medication management for patients diagnosed with a serious illness, including patients who may have been receiving hospice or palliative care services were recruited. Study participants were randomly assigned in either the experimental group or the control group. The experimental group viewed an infographic on the medication hydromorphone, followed by a knowledge quiz, and a self-assessment of cognitive load. This was followed by a second infographic on hydroxyzine, the quiz, and cognitive load assessment. The control group went through the same steps but viewed a text-only medication leaflet. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, independent samples t-test, one-way analysis of variance, and one-way multivariate analysis of variance. Statistically significantly higher quiz scores were observed among those who viewed the infographics than those who viewed text-only medication leaflets, indicating better immediate knowledge retention of medication information. Those who viewed the infographic also had statistically significantly lower intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load, and higher germane cognitive load. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that infographics prepared using the CTML result in better and more efficient learning. Limitations of this research include use of nonprobability sampling, examining only two medications that are commonly used in serious illness, and lack of systematic randomization. Additional research is needed to continue determining best practices for instructing and supporting IFCs in medication management. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

Abstract: This research study examined the implementation of an extended reality (XR) lab on a community college campus to facilitate student and faculty access to immersive learning resources. The study, conducted during one skills day, involved 46 students and was designed to understand if integrating immersive VR into emergency medical technician (EMT) education could enhance learner confidence and motivation, develop problem-solving and analytical thinking skills, and thus connecting the classroom learning with real-world application. The majority of participants reported increased motivation and engagement, alongside improvements in learning outcomes like knowledge retention and skill development. Applying the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model revealed performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions as key determinants of VR adoption in EMT education. While no significant overall performance enhancement was observed, VR training showed potential to boost motivation, confidence, and specific performance aspects. Furthermore, student perceptions towards VR in EMT education were largely positive, thereby suggesting its utility in immersive scenario training, skill acquisition in a risk-free environment, enhancing learner engagement, and real-world situational preparedness. VR demonstrated promise as a transformative tool in EMT education, necessitating further research to fully exploit its potential in diverse learning environments.

Effects of the modality and segmenting principles on gear instruction

Author: Huang, Tengzhang Barry11 Idaho State University, College of Education - OLP, US

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-modality-segmenting-principles-on-gear/docview/2886382602/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: This dissertation describes strategies instructional designers can use to foster essential processing when designing multimedia instruction with different combinations of the use and non-use of the modality and segmenting principles described by Clark and Mayer (2016). This study investigated the main effects of segmenting and modality, and different combinations of the use and nonuse of the modality and segmenting principles, on recall and transfer test scores on gear instruction. The results from this study provide insight into how the use of one or more principles impacted overall, recall, and transfer learning outcomes.The results of the study revealed a lack of significant main effects for modality and segmenting on the overall, recall, and transfer posttest scores. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences observed among the four groups: control, modality, segmenting, and segmenting & modality. These findings suggest that the utilization of modality and segmenting principles did not improve learning outcomes compared to not using any principle, and employing both principles together did not yield superior results compared to using modality or segmenting alone. These results are inconsistent with a considerable body of prior research; however, they do not imply disregarding all previous research in the field.It should be noted that the sample size consisted of only 71 participants, which was a small sample size. The brevity of the treatment duration and the presence of ceiling effects may have influenced the findings of this research. The observed ceiling effects can potentially be attributed to several factors, including the simplicity of the test items used in the instrument, administering the instrument immediately after the instructional intervention, the effectiveness of the instructional intervention itself, and participants' existing knowledge prior to the study.Future studies could utilize a larger sample size, select more complex instructional topics, and incorporate more rigorous instruments. These improvements would have facilitated a more accurate assessment of the impact of the modality and segmenting principles on learning outcomes. Moreover, exploring the effect of the modality and segmenting principles on delayed transfer would have provided valuable insights into their long-term effectiveness in promoting knowledge retention and transfer.

Abstract: Inadequate recognition and treatment of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) pose as a major liability to providers, as EPS can be life-threatening to patients, as they develop into metabolic syndrome, tardive dyskinesia (TD), or even death. Thus, insufficient usage of AIMS testing can negatively impact providers' ability to meet associated care practice standards, when treating psychotic patients with antipsychotic medications. As a result, an evidence-based practice, quasi-experimental project was completed, utilizing the Iowa Model Revised: Evidence-Based Practice to Promote Excellence in Healthcare. In alignment with this version of the revised Iowa Model, a pilot study was initiated to progress toward a formal practice change. This process was experimental in construct and execution. In this project, a group of novice Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioners, who recently gained employment with iCare and Associates, LLC, were assessed on their baseline knowledge pertaining to Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) testing, using a pretest examination. Each Nurse Practitioner was then provided formal AIMS testing-specific education, in the form of a lecture, handout materials, as well as a teach back-style question-and-answer period before a post-test examination was administered to test their knowledge retention. Upon competition of the education and post-test, a six-week study period was conducted to record and compare the number of AIMS testing documentation occurrences, per provider, as compared with the number of potential documentation occurrences. All documentation occurred within the Electronic Health Record (EHR) system of the organization. Based on statistical analyses, using paired t-testing, research findings indicated a match or increase in the number of AIMS testing and documentation occurrences of Nurse Practitioners post-educational intervention, as compared to the potential calculated number of occurrences possible. Thus, there exists statistical significance, suggesting that interventional education increases the usage and application of AIMS testing during the screening and management of patients taking antipsychotic medications for psychotic conditions.

Abstract: Our study assessed the effectiveness of a traditional bonesetter (TBS) educational program that was designed to increase knowledge, reduce complications, and promote the referral of patients to local hospitals by TBSs when necessary. BACKGROUND Our study assessed the effectiveness of a traditional bonesetter (TBS) educational program that was designed to increase knowledge, reduce complications, and promote the referral of patients to local hospitals by TBSs when necessary.From April to December 2021, TBSs from the Northern Sector (the Northern, Savannah, and North East regions) and the Ashanti region of Ghana underwent a 4-day training course that had been designed to teach basic principles of fracture care with the use of local tools. We assessed the levels of knowledge of the TBSs both before and after training. The change in practice of the trained TBSs also was assessed at 6 months using a structured questionnaire and a checklist. METHODS From April to December 2021, TBSs from the Northern Sector (the Northern, Savannah, and North East regions) and the Ashanti region of Ghana underwent a 4-day training course that had been designed to teach basic principles of fracture care with the use of local tools. We assessed the levels of knowledge of the TBSs both before and after training. The change in practice of the trained TBSs also was assessed at 6 months using a structured questionnaire and a checklist.In total, 157 TBSs were trained in 5 training sessions over a 9-month period. There was an improvement in knowledge in all of the modules of training, with an overall knowledge gain of 19.7% (from 67.2% to 86.9%). At 6 months of follow-up, the practices of TBSs that had most improved were record-keeping, hand hygiene, and patient rehabilitation. As a result of the referral system that was established by the training project, a total of 37 patients were referred to local hospitals in the 6 months following the training. RESULTS In total, 157 TBSs were trained in 5 training sessions over a 9-month period. There was an improvement in knowledge in all of the modules of training, with an overall knowledge gain of 19.7% (from 67.2% to 86.9%). At 6 months of follow-up, the practices of TBSs that had most improved were record-keeping, hand hygiene, and patient rehabilitation. As a result of the referral system that was established by the training project, a total of 37 patients were referred to local hospitals in the 6 months following the training.Formal training for TBSs that was provided by a multidisciplinary team with use of a locally developed curriculum and tools was effective in improving the practice and outcomes of treatment by TBSs. There was marked knowledge retention by the trained TBSs at 6 months after training in fracture management. CONCLUSIONS Formal training for TBSs that was provided by a multidisciplinary team with use of a locally developed curriculum and tools was effective in improving the practice and outcomes of treatment by TBSs. There was marked knowledge retention by the trained TBSs at 6 months after training in fracture management.Education, training, and the establishment of referral pathways between TBSs and local hospitals could improve trauma care in Ghana. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Education, training, and the establishment of referral pathways between TBSs and local hospitals could improve trauma care in Ghana.

Abstract: Older adult care organizations face challenges today due to high personnel turnover and pandemic-related obstacles in conducting training and competence development programs in a time-sensitive and fit-for-purpose manner. Digital microlearning is a method that attempts to meet these challenges by more quickly adapting to the educational needs of organizations and individual employees in terms of time, place, urgency, and retention capacity more than the traditional competency development methods. BACKGROUND Older adult care organizations face challenges today due to high personnel turnover and pandemic-related obstacles in conducting training and competence development programs in a time-sensitive and fit-for-purpose manner. Digital microlearning is a method that attempts to meet these challenges by more quickly adapting to the educational needs of organizations and individual employees in terms of time, place, urgency, and retention capacity more than the traditional competency development methods.This study aimed to determine if and how an app-based digital microlearning intervention can meet older adult care organizations' personnel competency development needs in terms of knowledge retention and work performance. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine if and how an app-based digital microlearning intervention can meet older adult care organizations' personnel competency development needs in terms of knowledge retention and work performance.This study assessed the use of a digital microlearning app, which was at the testing stage in the design thinking model among managerial (n=4) and operational (n=22) employees within 3 older adult care organizations. The app was used to conduct predetermined competency development courses for the staff. Baseline measurements included participants' previous training and competency development methods and participation, as well as perceived needs in terms of time, design, and channel. They then were introduced to and used a digital microlearning app to conduct 2 courses on one or more digital devices, schedules, and locations of their own choice during a period of ~1 month. The digital app and course content, perceived knowledge retention, and work performance and satisfaction were individually assessed via survey upon completion. The survey was complemented with 4 semistructured focus group interviews, which allowed participants (in total 16 individuals: 6 managerial-administrative employees and 10 operational employees) to describe their experiences with the app and its potential usefulness within their organizations.

Assessments were more positive among younger or less experienced employees with more diverse backgrounds. Participants expressed a positive inclination toward using the app, and suggestions provided regarding its potential development and broader use suggested a positive view of digitalization in general.

Abstract: Assessment and feedback are common sources of student dissatisfaction within higher education, and employers have shown dissatisfaction with graduates’ communication skills. Authentic assessment, containing ‘real-world’ context and student collaboration, provides a means to address both issues simultaneously. We discuss how we used authentic assessment within a biological sciences degree programme, replacing an individually written essay coursework assignment with learner-generated podcasts. We outline our implementation strategy in line with existing theory on learner-generated digital media, assessment for learning and self-regulated learning. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of survey data (2020 and 2021) indicate students prefer podcast assignments over traditional essay coursework, perceiving them to be more enjoyable, authentic, allowing for greater creativity, and better for building their confidence as communicators. Podcasting as an assessment may have a positive influence on knowledge retention and promote deep learning too. Our assessment design provides opportunities for community building, formative peer review and enhancing assessment literacy, while also being flexible enough to be used across any discipline of study and/or as an inter-disciplinary assessment.

Abstract: Introduction The integration of technology in pharmacy education has led to significant changes, making it essential to examine its impact on student learning outcomes. With the rise of emerging technologies, such as game-based learning and augmented reality, new pedagogical approaches have been introduced. However, these technologies also bring challenges that necessitate well-thought-out responses from educational institutions, especially considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on learning formats. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with pharmacy students in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, utilizing stratified random sampling for data collection. The study employed a validated questionnaire to gather information on students' use of technology, their preferences, and their perceived learning outcomes.

Abstract: ABSTRACT As virtual reality (VR) technologies have been increasingly adopted in the educational field, careful consideration and evaluation of instructional modes to support learning with VR are needed. This study focuses on evaluation of two instructional modes: direct interaction and manipulation of the VR learning environment; and the vicarious approach of observing how a novice peer and an expert learn with VR. An experimental design was utilized with two comparison conditions: direct VR interaction ( n  = 72) and the vicarious approach ( n  = 69). Participants’ knowledge and emotional engagement were evaluated via self-report questionnaires. Results showed that though learning with the direct VR condition was associated with more intense emotional engagement, there was no significant difference in knowledge gains between the two study conditions. The findings suggest that each of the two instructional modes has specific instructional affordances and that the cognitive and emotional components of learning via VR should be further explored. Since learning vicariously through observing the dialogue between an expert and a peer can have immediate knowledge gains comparable to the direct VR interaction, there is an effective and more accessible opportunity for VR-based learning. Future research should evaluate this instructional effect on knowledge retention.

Abstract: Novos desafios permeiam o ambiente organizacional exigindo que práticas de gestão sejam implementadas para amenizar o prejuízo que a perda de conhecimento pode representar para uma organização. As práticas de gestão precisam adequar-se às exigências atuais, utilizando a tecnologia a seu favor e promovendo no ambiente organizacional ações de aprendizagem. O conhecimento adquirido ao longo do tempo, por meio de ações na busca de soluções para as mais diversas situações do dia a dia, necessita tornar-se acessível, compartilhado e armazenado, a fim de acessá-lo como fonte de pesquisa e contribuir com novas informações e novos saberes. As competências cognitivas dos membros de uma organização podem ser potencializadas, disseminadas entre todos se a cultura organizacional incentivar o uso de ferramentas de comunicação aliadas à tecnologia. O objetivo desta pesquisa foi de desenvolver um ambiente computacional para promover criatividade e inovação nas organizações, com foco no módulo de retenção do conhecimento. O ambiente foi idealizado para que os usuários sejam parte da estrutura organizacional, livre das barreiras psicológicas que podem frear a capacidade criativa e participarem ativamente em processos de aprendizagem. Desta forma, contribuindo efetivamente em um processo de desenvolvimento de ideias inovadoras. Para o desenvolvimento do ambiente computacional foi definido um modelo de processo, além da definição das tecnologias utilizadas e da estrutura do banco de dados, chegando ao resultado: a ferramenta IdeiaWare que armazena e retém todas as ideias advindas dos membros de uma organização e todas as contribuições feitas até chegar ao resultado final, produto dos colaboradores de organizações. Alternate abstract: New challenges permeate the organizational environment requiring management practices to be implemented to mitigate the damage that the loss of knowledge can represent for an organization. Management practices need to adapt to current requirements, using technology to their advantage and promoting learning actions in the organizational environment. The knowledge acquired over time, through actions in the search for solutions for the most diverse everyday situations, needs to become accessible, shared and stored, in order to access it as a source of research and contribute to new information and new knowledge. The cognitive skills of an organization's members can be enhanced and disseminated among everyone if the organizational culture encourages the use of communication tools combined with technology. The objective of this research was to develop a computational environment to promote creativity and innovation in organizations, focusing on the knowledge retention module. The environment was designed so that users are part of the organizational structure, free from psychological barriers that can hinder creative capacity and actively participate in learning processes. In this way, effectively contributing to a process of developing innovative ideas. For the development of the computational environment, a process model was defined, in addition to the definition of the technologies used and the structure of the database, reaching the result: the IdeiaWare tool that stores and retains all ideas coming from the members of an organization and all contributions made until reaching the final result, a product of organizations’ employees.

Abstract: Aero medicine and first aid training is essential in preparing qualified cabin crew for in-flight medical emergencies. Nonetheless, it has always been regarded as a challenging aspect of cabin crew training. Cabin crew have been facing a more complex situation when conducting their duties onboard due to COVID-19. This study aims to explore the current status of aero medicine and first aid training in China. Using the snowballing technique, 17 participants were recruited for the in-depth semi-structured interview, including cabin crew from 9 airlines in China, first aid instructors from airline training centers, and lecturers from universities. Based on thematic analysis, four themes were extracted: required competencies, factors affecting first aid behaviors, course content and instructional strategies. Findings indicated that most airlines in China emphasized training their cabin crew in aero medicine and first aid. However, some conducted recurrent training once every two years, which was insufficient for skills and knowledge retention. Automated External Defibrillators (AED) were rarely equipped onboard. MedAire was not available for all airlines in China. The results pointed out the shortfalls on aero medicine and first aid aspect in China and can help improve the in-flight first aid facilities and optimize the training programs.

Abstract: Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been spreading globally, variants have emerged and been identified in many countries around the world. This descriptive cross-sectional study aimed to explore the level of knowledge, attitude, and adherence to coronavirus variant preventive measures among residents of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This is a cross-sectional online survey that was conducted between April and November 2020 and involved the residents of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. An electronic invitation for participation was sent to prospective participants, including the link to the research instrument, using social media websites. A total of 780 participants responded to a 4-part online survey developed by the investigators. The findings revealed that 72.9% of the participants (95% CI: 69.6%-75.9%) had a high level of knowledge about COVID-19; 78.2% said they supported all precautionary measures put in place by health authorities; only 29% wore face masks; and 93% wash their hands at least 5 times a day. Furthermore, 69% of the residents were always covering their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing with a piece of tissue paper, while 71% were observing physical distancing. Participants showed a positive attitude towards supporting all the precautionary measures being put in place by the health authorities and the efforts made by healthcare workers in the kingdom. Residents in Saudi Arabia showed a high level of knowledge of COVID-19 variants. Higher levels of education, being employed, and higher income were factors that influenced participants' knowledge positively (P < .05). Females and younger age were predictors of a better attitude towards COVID-19 (P < .01).The majority of the residents were afraid of the spread and mutation of the coronavirus. This study highlights the value of continuing community service learning programs for raising knowledge retention and adherence to coronavirus variant prevention strategies.Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been spreading globally, variants have emerged and been identified in many countries around the world.

Abstract: In recent years, flipped classrooms (FCs) have gained popularity in higher education, particularly among healthcare students. The FC model is a blended learning approach that combines online learning with in-class activity. This has prompted many instructors to assess how they teach and prepare successful graduate students for today's society. Additionally, colleges and universities have been challenged to deliver curricula that are relevant to the needs of students and to provide the rising skills and knowledge that are expected to be acquired by students.

The FC model is a blended learning approach that combines online learning with in-class activity. This has prompted many instructors to assess how they teach and prepare successful graduate students for today's society. Additionally, colleges and universities have been challenged to deliver curricula that are relevant to the needs of students and to provide the rising skills and knowledge that are expected to be acquired by students.This systematic review aims to evaluate the flipped classroom teaching approach in pharmacy education and to provide a summary of the guidance for the introduction and implementation of the flipped classroom model in pharmacy educational programs. Objective This systematic review aims to evaluate the flipped classroom teaching approach in pharmacy education and to provide a summary of the guidance for the introduction and implementation of the flipped classroom model in pharmacy educational programs.This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines. Eight databases were cross-screened by four reviewers, following key terms and predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A form was developed to extract relevant data from the reviewers. Qualitative data within the studies reporting students' and educators' perceptions and views on the FC model were also analyzed using a thematic analysis. Studies were appraised using the Medical Education Research Quality Instrument (MERSQI) and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for qualitative research.

Qualitative data within the studies reporting students' and educators' perceptions and views on the FC model were also analyzed using a thematic analysis. Studies were appraised using the Medical Education Research Quality Instrument (MERSQI) and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for qualitative research.The reviewers screened 330 articles, of which 35 were included in the review. The themes identified were implementation, academic performance outcomes, student satisfaction with the flipped classroom model, and long-term knowledge retention. Most studies (68%) have found that flipped learning enhances students' success and exam performance. Six (27%) studies reported no statistically significant difference in academic performance. However, two studies reported lower long-term knowledge retention in FC learning than in lecture-based learning. The students' perceptions of the FC approach were assessed in 26 studies, and the majority reported positive feedback. However, some students found the pre-class homework difficult to complete before class, and some expressed dissatisfaction with the inconsistent grading and unclear assessment questions in the FC model. Overall, the FC model was found to enhance the students' critical thinking and communication skills, self-confidence, and time management.

Abstract: Introduction We used an educational healthcare simulation tool called room of errors (ROE) to raise pharmacy operators’ awareness of potential errors in a chemotherapy production process and assessed its impact on their knowledge and satisfaction. Methods Twenty-five errors (compiled from internal procedures, literature and our hospital's reported incidents) were categorised as static ( n  = 7, visible by the participant anytime) and dynamic ( n  = 18, made by a pseudooperator in front of the participant). Our simulated cytotoxic production unit (CPU) hosted the 1 h-simulation. Two pharmacists (supervisor/pseudo-operator) welcomed the trainee for a 10-min briefing. During the 20-min simulation, participants watched the pseudo-operator's gestures in a simulated chemotherapy production process. Participants called out each error observed (recorded by the supervisor). A 20-min debriefing followed. ROE's impact on knowledge was measured through participants’ answers to a before-and after 18-item questionnaire about CPU's procedures and certainty about answers on a scale (0%–100%). Participants evaluated the training using a satisfaction questionnaire (Likert scale, 1–6). Results The 14 participants detected 70.4% ± 11.4% of errors. Least-detected errors were “using non-disinfected vials” (42.9%) and “touching syringe plunger” (0%). Critical errors (expired leftovers or glucose instead of sodium chloride) were detected at 57.1%. Knowledge improved from 60.3% to 94.1% (p < 0.001) and certainty from 75.3% to 98.8% (p < 0.001). Participants appreciated this non-judgmental, informative, and original training (satisfaction 95.7%). Some pointed out difficulties settling into the game quickly and visualising static and dynamic errors simultaneously. Conclusion This ROE simulation improved operators’ knowledge and certainty. Longer-term testing should be done to measure knowledge retention over time.

Abstract: Aims and Objectives CT Head scans are commonly requested in the Emergency Department (ED), but the increasing demand has led to longer radiology report turnaround times, affecting ED flow. This study aims to assess the accuracy of ED clinicians in interpreting CT head images, evaluate the impact of an online training simulation, and estimate the effects of clinician-led interpretation on patient flow. Method and Design Methods A multicentre randomized controlled trial was conducted across six hospitals in the Thames Valley Emergency Medicine Research Network. Emergency medicine clinicians of various grades and backgrounds participated. In the online phase, participants completed a blinded baseline assessment of accuracy by interpreting 50 CT Head scans. Non-control participants received online training and practiced with 50 cases. They then retook the assessment to measure changes in reporting accuracy and confidence. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3 and 6 months to assess knowledge retention. Training and assessment were conducted through the online platform www.raiqc.com. In the prospective phase, participants interpreted 30 CT head scans during their clinical practice, and their findings and interpretation times were compared to radiology reports. Registration ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT05427838 Results and Conclusion Results A total of 206 participants took part in the study. The online phase showed a significant increase in pooled sensitivity (73.3% to 83%) and specificity (65.8% to 89.1%) in detecting acute abnormalities. Similar improvements were observed across all pathology subgroups. At six months post training, overall diagnostic performance remained elevated (sensitivity 80.6%, specificity 79.1%). In the prospective phase, 4,815 CT Head interpretations with linked radiology reports were recorded, and data analysis is ongoing. Discussion and Conclusion Dedicated training significantly improved the interpretation accuracy of ED clinicians. Web-based self-directed simulation-based learning platforms can effectively deliver training, particularly in departments with high staff turnover. Further analysis of prospective results will assess accuracy and impact in a live ED setting. Abstract 2351 Figure 1 Abstract 2351 Figure 2 Abstract 2351 Figure 3

Abstract: Purpose Anatomical knowledge of medical students and residents is insufficient and further anatomical sciences throughout medical curriculum may be necessary. The first aim of this study was to assess pelvic and perineal anatomical knowledge retention of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (Ob/Gyn) residents. The second was to assess the impact of an e-learning tool on anatomical knowledge. Methods A survey was sent by mail to medical students and Ob/Gyn residents. After completion, Ob/Gyn residents were randomised to “e-learning” group or to “Control” group. “E-learning” group had an unlimited access to a tool about female pelvic and perineum anatomy, implemented by iMAIOS society in their online platform. A second assessment of residents’ anatomical knowledge was done 2 months after randomisation. Results Ob/Gyn residents ( N  = 23) had a significant lower global score than third-year medical students ( N  = 103) (22.1% (± 10.2) vs 43.8% (± 12.1), p  < 0.0001). Two months after randomisation, residents of “control” group demonstrated no significant difference between the two questionnaires (3.6%, p  = 0.31), whilst the “e-learning” group demonstrated a significant increase overall (10.6%, p  = 0.09). There was no significant difference on the post-intervention questionnaire between control and “e-learning” group (25.4% vs 33% respectively, p  = 0.34). Conclusion Knowledge of pelvic and perineal anatomy is poor. This e-learning tool aimed at improving anatomical knowledge retention but is not sufficient. A combination of traditional approaches and innovative solutions should be proposed throughout medical school and residency to maintain anatomical knowledge.

Abstract: Assessment and feedback are common sources of student dissatisfaction within higher education, and employers have shown dissatisfaction with graduates’ communication skills. Authentic assessment, containing ‘real-world’ context and student collaboration, provides a means to address both issues simultaneously. We discuss how we used authentic assessment within a biological sciences degree programme, replacing an individually written essay coursework assignment with learner-generated podcasts. We outline our implementation strategy in line with existing theory on learner-generated digital media, assessment for learning and self-regulated learning. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of survey data (2020 and 2021) indicate students prefer podcast assignments over traditional essay coursework, perceiving them to be more enjoyable, authentic, allowing for greater creativity, and better for building their confidence as communicators. Podcasting as an assessment may have a positive influence on knowledge retention and promote deep learning too. Our assessment design provides opportunities for community building, formative peer review and enhancing assessment literacy, while also being flexible enough to be used across any discipline of study and/or as an inter-disciplinary assessment.

Abstract: Anatomical knowledge of medical students and residents is insufficient and further anatomical sciences throughout medical curriculum may be necessary. The first aim of this study was to assess pelvic and perineal anatomical knowledge retention of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (Ob/Gyn) residents. The second was to assess the impact of an e-learning tool on anatomical knowledge. PURPOSE Anatomical knowledge of medical students and residents is insufficient and further anatomical sciences throughout medical curriculum may be necessary. The first aim of this study was to assess pelvic and perineal anatomical knowledge retention of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (Ob/Gyn) residents. The second was to assess the impact of an e-learning tool on anatomical knowledge.A survey was sent by mail to medical students and Ob/Gyn residents. After completion, Ob/Gyn residents were randomised to "e-learning" group or to "Control" group. "E-learning" group had an unlimited access to a tool about female pelvic and perineum anatomy, implemented by iMAIOS society in their online platform. A second assessment of residents' anatomical knowledge was done 2 months after randomisation. METHODS A survey was sent by mail to medical students and Ob/Gyn residents. After completion, Ob/Gyn residents were randomised to "e-learning" group or to "Control" group. "E-learning" group had an unlimited access to a tool about female pelvic and perineum anatomy, implemented by iMAIOS society in their online platform. A second assessment of residents' anatomical knowledge was done 2 months after randomisation.Ob/Gyn residents (N = 23) had a significant lower global score than third-year medical students (N = 103) (22.1% (± 10.2) vs 43.8% (± 12.1), p < 0.0001). Two months after randomisation, residents of "control" group demonstrated no significant difference between the two questionnaires (3.6%, p = 0.31), whilst the "e-learning" group demonstrated a significant increase overall (10.6%, p = 0.09). There was no significant difference on the post-intervention questionnaire between control and "e-learning" group (25.4% vs 33% respectively, p = 0.34). RESULTS Ob/Gyn residents (N = 23) had a significant lower global score than third-year medical students (N = 103) (22.1% (± 10.2) vs 43.8% (± 12.1), p < 0.0001).

There was no significant difference on the post-intervention questionnaire between control and "e-learning" group (25.4% vs 33% respectively, p = 0.34).Knowledge of pelvic and perineal anatomy is poor. This e-learning tool aimed at improving anatomical knowledge retention but is not sufficient. A combination of traditional approaches and innovative solutions should be proposed throughout medical school and residency to maintain anatomical knowledge. CONCLUSION Knowledge of pelvic and perineal anatomy is poor. This e-learning tool aimed at improving anatomical knowledge retention but is not sufficient.

Abstract: We used an educational healthcare simulation tool called room of errors (ROE) to raise pharmacy operators' awareness of potential errors in a chemotherapy production process and assessed its impact on their knowledge and satisfaction. INTRODUCTION We used an educational healthcare simulation tool called room of errors (ROE) to raise pharmacy operators' awareness of potential errors in a chemotherapy production process and assessed its impact on their knowledge and satisfaction.Twenty-five errors (compiled from internal procedures, literature and our hospital's reported incidents) were categorised as static ( n  = 7, visible by the participant anytime) and dynamic ( n  = 18, made by a pseudooperator in front of the participant). Our simulated cytotoxic production unit (CPU) hosted the 1 h-simulation. Two pharmacists (supervisor/pseudo-operator) welcomed the trainee for a 10-min briefing. During the 20-min simulation, participants watched the pseudo-operator's gestures in a simulated chemotherapy production process. Participants called out each error observed (recorded by the supervisor). A 20-min debriefing followed. ROE's impact on knowledge was measured through participants' answers to a before-and after 18-item questionnaire about CPU's procedures and certainty about answers on a scale (0%-100%). Participants evaluated the training using a satisfaction questionnaire (Likert scale, 1-6).

Participants evaluated the training using a satisfaction questionnaire (Likert scale, 1-6).The 14 participants detected 70.4% ± 11.4% of errors. Least-detected errors were "using non-disinfected vials" (42.9%) and "touching syringe plunger" (0%). Critical errors (expired leftovers or glucose instead of sodium chloride) were detected at 57.1%. Knowledge improved from 60.3% to 94.1% (p < 0.001) and certainty from 75.3% to 98.8% (p < 0.001). Participants appreciated this non-judgmental, informative, and original training (satisfaction 95.7%). Some pointed out difficulties settling into the game quickly and visualising static and dynamic errors simultaneously. RESULTS The 14 participants detected 70.4% ± 11.4% of errors.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of radiographs is necessary for the correct diagnosis and treatment of patients. Research has shown that active learning methods, including case-based learning, are superior to passive learning methods, such as lectures. Short-term learning outcomes were compared between two groups by enrolling 80 fourth-semester veterinary students in either an online case-based radiology course ( n = 40) or a virtual lecture-based course ( n = 40). Long-term learning outcomes were compared among three groups: one group completed case-based instruction in the fourth semester, followed by lecture-based instruction in the fourth semester ( n = 19); the second group completed only lecture-based instruction in the fourth semester ( n = 22), and the third group completed lecture-based instruction in the fourth semester, followed by case-based instruction in the fifth semester ( n = 9). Learning was assessed using a multiple-choice examination and two independently written small animal radiograph reports. In the fourth semester, students completing the case-based course had higher examination scores and radiograph report scores than students who took the lecture-based course. Students completing the lecture-based course in the fourth semester and the case-based course in the fifth semester wrote better radiograph reports than students who completed both courses in the fourth semester; both groups wrote better reports than students who did not take the case-based course. A case-based diagnostic imaging course may be better than a lecture-based course for both short- and long-term retention of knowledge; however, there is a significant loss of knowledge following an instructional gap, and spaced refreshers may boost retention.Accurate interpretation of radiographs is necessary for the correct diagnosis and treatment of patients.

Abstract: As virtual reality (VR) technologies have been increasingly adopted in the educational field, careful consideration and evaluation of instructional modes to support learning with VR are needed. This study focuses on evaluation of two instructional modes: direct interaction and manipulation of the VR learning environment; and the vicarious approach of observing how a novice peer and an expert learn with VR. An experimental design was utilized with two comparison conditions: direct VR interaction ( n = 72) and the vicarious approach ( n = 69). Participants’ knowledge and emotional engagement were evaluated via self-report questionnaires. Results showed that though learning with the direct VR condition was associated with more intense emotional engagement, there was no significant difference in knowledge gains between the two study conditions. The findings suggest that each of the two instructional modes has specific instructional affordances and that the cognitive and emotional components of learning via VR should be further explored. Since learning vicariously through observing the dialogue between an expert and a peer can have immediate knowledge gains comparable to the direct VR interaction, there is an effective and more accessible opportunity for VR-based learning. Future research should evaluate this instructional effect on knowledge retention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: Emergency medicine is particularly well suited to simulation training. However, evidence for the efficacy of simulation-based medical training remains limited especially to manage high-risk cases such as acute asthma. BACKGROUND Emergency medicine is particularly well suited to simulation training. However, evidence for the efficacy of simulation-based medical training remains limited especially to manage high-risk cases such as acute asthma.The objective of our study was to compare the performance of high-fidelity simulation (HFS) and interactive video-case challenge-based training (IVC) for final-year medical students in the management of acute asthma. OBJECTIVE The objective of our study was to compare the performance of high-fidelity simulation (HFS) and interactive video-case challenge-based training (IVC) for final-year medical students in the management of acute asthma.This was a prospective randomized controlled study conducted at the emergency department (ED) of Monastir University hospital ( Tunisia). 69 final-year medical students were randomized to HFS (n = 34) and IVC (n = 35) training on acute asthma topic. The study was conducted over a 1-week period. Efficacy of each teaching method was compared through the use of multiple-choice questionnaires (MCQ) before (pre-test), after (post-test) training and a simulation scenario test conducted 1 week later. The scenario was based on acute asthma management graded on predefined critical actions using two scores: the checklist clinical score (range 0 to 30), and the team skills score (range 0 to 16). Student satisfaction was also evaluated with the Likert 5 points scale. Two years after the post-test, both groups underwent a third MCQ testing to assess sustainability of knowledge.

Two years after the post-test, both groups underwent a third MCQ testing to assess sustainability of knowledge.There were no differences in age between groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the HFS and IVC groups pre-test scores (p = 0.07). Both groups demonstrated improvement in MCQ post-test from baseline after training session; the HFS MCQ post-test score increased significantly more than the IVC score (p < 0.001). The HFS group performed better than the IVC group on the acute asthma simulation scenario (p < 0.001). Mean checklist clinical score and mean team skills score were significantly higher in HFS group compared to IVC group (respectively 22.9 ± 4.8 and 11.5 ± 2.5 in HFS group vs 19.1 ± 3 and 8.4 ± 3.1 in IVC group) (p < 0.001). After 2 years, MCQ post-test scores decreased in both groups but the decrease was lower in HFS group compared to the IVC group. RESULTS There were no differences in age between groups.

Abstract: While serious games seem to be supportive in healthcare education, none of them had been designed to develop competence in diagnosis and treatment planning of oral lesions. Therefore, this research aimed to develop an online simulation-based serious game for training diagnosis and treatment planning of oral lesions (SimOL) and to evaluate its educational impact in terms of knowledge improvement and retention. BACKGROUND While serious games seem to be supportive in healthcare education, none of them had been designed to develop competence in diagnosis and treatment planning of oral lesions. Therefore, this research aimed to develop an online simulation-based serious game for training diagnosis and treatment planning of oral lesions (SimOL) and to evaluate its educational impact in terms of knowledge improvement and retention.As a mandatory task in an oral lesion course, all 28 students were required to participate in SimOL activities. Participants were instructed to complete a pre-knowledge assessment following a one-week washout period prior to the game activity. Subsequent to the game completion, they were tasked to complete a post-knowledge assessment I (Full score = 15) and satisfaction questionnaire. A post-knowledge assessment II was administered a week later to evaluate knowledge retention. METHODS As a mandatory task in an oral lesion course, all 28 students were required to participate in SimOL activities. Participants were instructed to complete a pre-knowledge assessment following a one-week washout period prior to the game activity. Subsequent to the game completion, they were tasked to complete a post-knowledge assessment I (Full score = 15) and satisfaction questionnaire. A post-knowledge assessment II was administered a week later to evaluate knowledge retention.The findings demonstrated a significant increase in the assessment scores after interacting with the game (P   0.05). Additionally, students perceived the game as positively in all aspects, although the entertainment aspect achieved a slightly lower score of 3.70 (SD = 0.21), in comparison to the usefulness and ease of use with a score of 4.02 (SD = 0.11) and 4.02 (SD = 0.16), respectively. RESULTS The findings demonstrated a significant increase in the assessment scores after interacting with the game (P   0.05). Additionally, students perceived the game as positively in all aspects, although the entertainment aspect achieved a slightly lower score of 3.70 (SD = 0.21), in comparison to the usefulness and ease of use with a score of 4.02 (SD = 0.11) and 4.02 (SD = 0.16), respectively.SimOL demonstrated its potential as an effective learning tool for improving and retaining knowledge for diagnosis and treatment planning of oral lesions. The game was perceived positively by dental students in all aspects, however further improvements should prioritize the enhancement of entertaining components. CONCLUSION SimOL demonstrated its potential as an effective learning tool for improving and retaining knowledge for diagnosis and treatment planning of oral lesions. The game was perceived positively by dental students in all aspects, however further improvements should prioritize the enhancement of entertaining components.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Integrating Indigenous and local knowledge in conservation and natural resource management (NRM) initiatives is necessary to achieve sustainability, equity, and responsiveness to local realities and needs. Knowledge integration is the starting point for converging different knowledge systems and enabling knowledge co-production. This process is also a key prerequisite towards decolonising the research process. However, power imbalances may perpetuate dominant forms of knowledge over others, obstruct knowledge integration, and eventually cause the loss of knowledge of the marginal and less powerful knowledge holders. Despite increasing interest in knowledge integration for conservation, NRM, and landscape governance, documentation of integration processes remains fragmented and somewhat scarce. This semi-systematic literature review contributes to filling this gap by synthesising methods, procedures, opportunities, and challenges regarding integrating and decolonising knowledge for conservation and NRM in Southern Africa. The findings demonstrate that despite an increasing number of studies seeking to integrate Indigenous and local knowledge and scientific knowledge relevant to conservation and NRM, methods, procedures, and opportunities are poorly and vaguely documented, and challenges and colonial legacies are often overlooked. Documentation, valuing Indigenous and local knowledge, addressing power relations, and collaboration across knowledge systems are missing steps towards efficient knowledge integration. The paper concludes that there is a need for further research and relevant policies. These should address methods and implications for equitable knowledge integration processes and move beyond knowledge sharing and mutual learning towards decolonising knowledge for conservation and NRM.

Abstract: ENG English ENG To examine the effectiveness of the BLS blended learning module on knowledge and skills of BLS compared to the traditional module. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were utilized using key words to searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for the studies published between January 2018 to May 2022. The risk of bias was assessed utilizing the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist. Two reviewers separately extracted data from the included trials using a standardized data extraction form. From 400 articles retrieved by the initial search, 11 studies were found to be eligible. Most studies’ participants were laypersons (80.9 %), and the rest were either nursing (12.6 %) or medical students (6.5 %). The review shows superiority of utilizing the blended strategy in applying the BLS module in skills and knowledge retention, rather than using the traditional learning, which could improve the quality and outcomes of patients. Blended learning is effective in teaching BLS like the traditional face-to-face method, but more advantages of the blended learning module include improvement in retaining knowledge, skills acquisition, patient outcomes, and cost saving. The COVID-19 pandemic made blended learning crucial and using this method in BLS was effective and efficient. Future research to assess the effectiveness of blended learning on patient outcomes is recommended.

Abstract: Anatomy is physiotherapy's foundation. However, undergraduate classroom learning and knowledge acquisition‐retention remain questionable. This study explored the possibility of improving this learning experience and evaluates the gross anatomy of abdomen and pelvis short‐term knowledge retention among first‐year physiotherapy students in Malta. The online Kahoot! game‐based quiz platform was used through an instructor‐designed best‐of‐four multiple‐choice questions. Correctly answered questions and Kahoot! scores generated by the platform were utilized to measure knowledge retention. Kahoot! sessions 1 and 3 shared similar attendance and response rate and were compared together. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare Kahoot! scores and Chi test for trend to compare correctly answered questions. Students' perceived learning experiences before and after the introduction of the Kahoot quizzes were gathered through Likert scores and analyzed using McNamar's chi‐square test. Overall, a significantly increased trend in correctly answered questions (χ²: 23.38, p ‐value: <0.001) across the Kahoot! sessions were evident. Four questions out of 12 exhibited significant Kahoot! scores differences. Students reported better learning experiences following the initiation of Kahoot! (χ²: 5.1, p ‐value: 0.02). Indeed, all students agreed that the use of the interactive quiz improved their anatomy short term knowledge retention. Introducing an online interactive quiz as part of the lecture program may be useful to improve the learning experience and anatomy knowledge retention among physiotherapy students.

Abstract: As students progress through their undergraduate education, information from previous classes culminate to lay a foundation for academic success in upper-level courses. However, there is a lack of evidence and implementation for formative assessment methods in undergraduate education. Traditional summative assessments are often cited as being high stress by students and are studied for by cramming material. Both high stress and cramming can reduce long-term knowledge retention in the average student, which is problematic when students need to retrieve this knowledge for future classes. Thus, our objective was to evaluate student knowledge retention coming from a prerequisite course divergent in assessment strategy and/or environment. The prerequisite course, ANEQ 328: Foundations of Animal Genetics, used either 4-unit exams or 16 weekly quizzes with identical questions to assess learning of course material. The course was either delivered in person or online, covered the same material, and all students received the same post-test at the end of the semester. Furthermore, in the quiz-based courses students were surveyed at the end of the semester to gather perceptions of learning with varying course formats. In the subsequent course, ANEQ 330: Principles of Animal Breeding, the same post-test from ANEQ 328 was given as a pre-test. On the pre-test, students were asked to indicate in which year and semester they completed ANEQ 328 so an assessment type and environment could be identified. Scores on the pre-test were analyzed as a measurement of retention across courses, and effects of time elapsed between courses, the type of assessment strategy used, and the physical environment in which the class was delivered were considered. Time between courses impacted retention, as students who took ANEQ 330 within two semesters of ANEQ 328 had higher scores ( P < 0.05) than all other timepoints. Student retention was not different between students who took the prerequisite course online or in-person (7.65 ± 0.19 and 7.61 ± 0.23, respectively). Additionally, student retention was not impacted by whether the prerequisite course used quiz or exam-based assessment strategies (7.58 ± 0.16 and 7.89 ± 0.33, respectively). These data indicate that both assessment strategies are interchangeable when considering impacts on long-term retention; however, survey data showed that formative assessments, such as quizzes, are better received than summative assessments, as they help to ease testing anxiety, better pace student learning, and provide consistent feedback. Therefore, instructors may choose to use formative assessments to improve student perceptions of learning without impacting knowledge retention.

Abstract: Dehumanized and globalized mathematics education in the last centuries has led to established learning processes disconnected from indigenous knowledge. The effect of cognitive imperialism, given the systematic negation of the language and the culture, has as a disastrous consequence of the gradual and systematic loss of knowledge and indigenous reasoning. Thus, recognizing, appreciating and updating it turns into a task and challenge for the teaching and learning of math in the intercultural classroom. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to focus on analyzing the mathematical reasoning of the indigenous student while encoding and decoding an historic numeric registry artifact called püron (knot in the Mapuche language). The study was conducted in three schools on Mapuche territory of Araucanía Region in Chile, using the Participatory Action Research method. The results show that encoding/decoding quantities helps indigenous students to recognize structures and to establish a numeration system close to the historically reported cultural practices of the Mapuche people. Moreover, it extends the mathematical quantitative structure and reasoning to an arithmetic one seen in the present day cultural practices such as the measurement of fields for planting. Thus, the experience contributes to the students’ linguistic awareness of Mapudungun (Mapuche language) in a numeration system framework.

Abstract: Gamification is an effective teaching tool that improves engagement and knowledge retention. Tabletop role-playing games are dynamic games that use random chance and foster player/leader partnership. To date, there are no teaching tools that mimic dynamic or unpredictable patient presentations. This style of game may work well as a tool for medical education in a simulation-based modality. In this report, we document the rules, materials, and training required to reproduce a hybrid game created to combine facets of simulation and tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) to create a dynamic medical education tool. After testing the game for flaws and fluidity of gameplay, we plan to collect data evaluating emergency medicine residents' enjoyability and knowledge retention. In this article, we describe a novel TRPG simulation hybrid game that we hypothesize will improve learner enjoyability/engagement and have similar educational benefits to standard medical education.Gamification is an effective teaching tool that improves engagement and knowledge retention.

Abstract: Introduction Pain management is a crucial aspect of patients' perioperative journey and a fundamental duty of every anesthetist. Throughout anesthesia training, there is an emphasis on the management of critical incidents, several of which surround pain management. With changes to the anesthesia curriculum over recent years, variable exposure to training opportunities, and a reduction in clinical hours during training, many trainees report feeling underprepared for their future roles as consultants. However, pain management remains a small fragment of the core anesthesia curriculum with no pain-focused simulation courses currently available across the UK. Simulation has proven to aid learning transfer in complicated and stressful scenarios with a substantial improvement in knowledge retention and prevention of skill loss while eliminating the risk of harm to patients. Aim A novel perioperative pain management simulation course was designed and implemented in the East of England to equip junior anesthesia trainees with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage perioperative pain and the associated critical incidents. Methods A multidisciplinary team (MDT) was involved in the course design. The faculty consisted of anesthesia consultants, trainees, pain nurses, and simulation technicians. The course ran twice over a six-month period both locally and regionally. A blended learning approach was adopted where 17 trainees attended PowerPoint presentations providing an overview of basic pain theories, perioperative pain management, regional anesthesia, and labor analgesia. Trainees then underwent telecasted simulation training using replicated patient notes, imaging, blood gas analysis, and a high-fidelity SimMan®. A debriefing period followed each scenario using Pendleton's model. An anonymized questionnaire was completed by all trainees before and after the course to assess improvement in their knowledge and confidence levels across four domains covering the management of perioperative pain. Results All 17 trainees completed the questionnaire; therefore, the entire dataset was analyzed. The pre-course questionnaire showed that using a scale of zero to 10, the vast majority of trainees reported low levels of confidence (<6/10) in the management of chronic pain during the perioperative period (82%), intraoperative pain management (76%), regional anesthesia (88%), and labor analgesia (65%). Following the simulation training, the results showed an overwhelmingly positive improvement in all 17 trainees' knowledge and confidence across all four tested domains. All 17 trainees (100%) also showed an improvement in their understanding of local pain protocols. The subjective feedback was positive, highlighting the overall usefulness of the course and that the tailored complexity of each simulation scenario was appropriate to each candidate's prior level of experience. Trainees also reported feeling more confident in starting their anesthesia on-calls. Conclusion This novel simulation course is the first of its kind in pain management. It has shown great improvements in trainee confidence in managing perioperative pain and the associated critical incidents. Subjective feedback has also been positively reassuring. Its inclusion into the East of England anesthesia training program and national training curriculum would greatly enhance trainee's knowledge and experience in pain management in the perioperative setting.Introduction Pain management is a crucial aspect of patients' perioperative journey and a fundamental duty of every anesthetist. Throughout anesthesia training, there is an emphasis on the management of critical incidents, several of which surround pain management. With changes to the anesthesia curriculum over recent years, variable exposure to training opportunities, and a reduction in clinical hours during training, many trainees report feeling underprepared for their future roles as consultants. However, pain management remains a small fragment of the core anesthesia curriculum with no pain-focused simulation courses currently available across the UK. Simulation has proven to aid learning transfer in complicated and stressful scenarios with a substantial improvement in knowledge retention and prevention of skill loss while eliminating the risk of harm to patients. Aim A novel perioperative pain management simulation course was designed and implemented in the East of England to equip junior anesthesia trainees with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage perioperative pain and the associated critical incidents. Methods A multidisciplinary team (MDT) was involved in the course design. The faculty consisted of anesthesia consultants, trainees, pain nurses, and simulation technicians. The course ran twice over a six-month period both locally and regionally. A blended learning approach was adopted where 17 trainees attended PowerPoint presentations providing an overview of basic pain theories, perioperative pain management, regional anesthesia, and labor analgesia. Trainees then underwent telecasted simulation training using replicated patient notes, imaging, blood gas analysis, and a high-fidelity SimMan®. A debriefing period followed each scenario using Pendleton's model. An anonymized questionnaire was completed by all trainees before and after the course to assess improvement in their knowledge and confidence levels across four domains covering the management of perioperative pain. Results All 17 trainees completed the questionnaire; therefore, the entire dataset was analyzed. The pre-course questionnaire showed that using a scale of zero to 10, the vast majority of trainees reported low levels of confidence (<6/10) in the management of chronic pain during the perioperative period (82%), intraoperative pain management (76%), regional anesthesia (88%), and labor analgesia (65%). Following the simulation training, the results showed an overwhelmingly positive improvement in all 17 trainees' knowledge and confidence across all four tested domains. All 17 trainees (100%) also showed an improvement in their understanding of local pain protocols. The subjective feedback was positive, highlighting the overall usefulness of the course and that the tailored complexity of each simulation scenario was appropriate to each candidate's prior level of experience. Trainees also reported feeling more confident in starting their anesthesia on-calls. Conclusion This novel simulation course is the first of its kind in pain management. It has shown great improvements in trainee confidence in managing perioperative pain and the associated critical incidents. Subjective feedback has also been positively reassuring.

Abstract: Integrating Indigenous and local knowledge in conservation and natural resource management (NRM) initiatives is necessary to achieve sustainability, equity, and responsiveness to local realities and needs. Knowledge integration is the starting point for converging different knowledge systems and enabling knowledge co-production. This process is also a key prerequisite towards decolonising the research process. However, power imbalances may perpetuate dominant forms of knowledge over others, obstruct knowledge integration, and eventually cause the loss of knowledge of the marginal and less powerful knowledge holders. Despite increasing interest in knowledge integration for conservation, NRM, and landscape governance, documentation of integration processes remains fragmented and somewhat scarce. This semi-systematic literature review contributes to filling this gap by synthesising methods, procedures, opportunities, and challenges regarding integrating and decolonising knowledge for conservation and NRM in Southern Africa. The findings demonstrate that despite an increasing number of studies seeking to integrate Indigenous and local knowledge and scientific knowledge relevant to conservation and NRM, methods, procedures, and opportunities are poorly and vaguely documented, and challenges and colonial legacies are often overlooked. Documentation, valuing Indigenous and local knowledge, addressing power relations, and collaboration across knowledge systems are missing steps towards efficient knowledge integration. The paper concludes that there is a need for further research and relevant policies. These should address methods and implications for equitable knowledge integration processes and move beyond knowledge sharing and mutual learning towards decolonising knowledge for conservation and NRM.Integrating Indigenous and local knowledge in conservation and natural resource management (NRM) initiatives is necessary to achieve sustainability, equity, and responsiveness to local realities and needs.

Abstract: As we enter a world of blended learning in higher education, an increased need for adaptation of teaching strategies to enhance engagement has been recognised to amplify learning outcomes online. Gamification has been identified as a creative tool to engage the current cohort of learners who are also characteristically tech-savvy. To this end, escape room games have gained considerable traction in medical and pharmacy education to promote learning, critical thinking and teamwork. In this pilot study we describe the implementation of a 60-minute, web-based hepatitis-themed escape room game within a Year 3 Pharmacotherapy unit at Monash University. A total of 418 students participated in this activity. Students’ knowledge gain on the topic was assessed through a pre- and post-intervention assessment, whereby a statistically significant improvement was seen in the knowledge score following implementation of the gaming activity (58.66% pre-intervention vs. 72.05% post-intervention, p  < 0.05). The innovative learning activity was also well perceived by the students. Virtual escape room game is a viable pedagogical approach to teach and reinforce clinical concepts among pharmacy students. With the evolving landscape of education and learner demographics, investment in technology- enhanced game-based learning is a promising trajectory to support students’ growth in a learner-centered environment. A comparison between virtual escape room game and traditional teaching will further inform effectiveness of the gamification on long term knowledge retention.

Abstract: Purpose This study aims to test the relationship between employee exit and knowledge retention. The study also tests the moderating role of organizational structure on the relationship between employee exit and knowledge retention. Design/methodology/approach A purposive sample of 310 in India was used. The hypotheses were tested using the exploratory factor analysis (EFA), structural equation modeling and moderating analysis using SmartPLS. Findings The results showed that employee exit positively affects knowledge retention. Moreover, the organizational structure does not moderate the relationship between employee exit and knowledge retention. Two factors were identified through the EFA, of which knowledge-based systems were found to be the most important, followed by management support. Originality/value The study attempts to test the relationship between employee exit and knowledge retention and also develops and validates the multidimensional measure of knowledge retention.

Abstract: Introduction Creating meaningful and engaging learning opportunities can be challenged by budgets, time, and learning management systems with limited methods of interaction. An innovative method was necessary to meet competency evaluation and continuing education needs for emergency department staff. Design Gamification and simulation techniques were combined to offer an interactive learning opportunity through an escape room format to improve engagement and knowledge retention. This educational offering was designed to enhance staff learning of trauma care and processes at emergency departments that are not designated trauma centers. Outcomes Emergency department team members completed the trauma escape room challenge, and postsurvey results demonstrated favorable ratings of new knowledge acquisition, skill competency, teamwork, and confidence when providing care for a trauma patient. Discussion Nurse educators can “escape” the monotony of passive learning by using active learning strategies including the fun of gamification to improve clinical skills and confidence.

Abstract: Anatomy is physiotherapy's foundation. However, undergraduate classroom learning and knowledge acquisition‐retention remain questionable. This study explored the possibility of improving this learning experience and evaluates the gross anatomy of abdomen and pelvis short‐term knowledge retention among first‐year physiotherapy students in Malta. The online Kahoot! game‐based quiz platform was used through an instructor‐designed best‐of‐four multiple‐choice questions. Correctly answered questions and Kahoot! scores generated by the platform were utilized to measure knowledge retention. Kahoot! sessions 1 and 3 shared similar attendance and response rate and were compared together. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare Kahoot! scores and Chi test for trend to compare correctly answered questions. Students' perceived learning experiences before and after the introduction of the Kahoot quizzes were gathered through Likert scores and analyzed using McNamar's chi‐square test. Overall, a significantly increased trend in correctly answered questions ( χ 2 : 23.38, p ‐value: <0.001) across the Kahoot! sessions were evident. Four questions out of 12 exhibited significant Kahoot! scores differences. Students reported better learning experiences following the initiation of Kahoot! ( χ 2 : 5.1, p ‐value: 0.02). Indeed, all students agreed that the use of the interactive quiz improved their anatomy short term knowledge retention. Introducing an online interactive quiz as part of the lecture program may be useful to improve the learning experience and anatomy knowledge retention among physiotherapy students.

Abstract: The transmission of generational knowledge in Alaska Native communities has been disrupted by colonization and led to declining health among Alaska Natives, as evidenced by the loss of knowledge regarding traditional foods and foodways and increasing rates of cardiometabolic disorders impacting Alaska Natives. Elders play a central role in passing down this generational knowledge, but emerging Elders may have difficulty in stepping into their roles as Elders due to the rapid social and cultural changes impacting their communities. The Center for Alaska Native Health Research (CANHR) and the Denakkanaaga Elders Program are partnering with the Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health Equity to uplift and support traditional food knowledge and practices to promote health in Alaska Native communities. Guided by a decolonizing and Indigenizing framework, researchers at CANHR are working with Athabascan Elders in the Interior of Alaska to strengthen and protect the intergenerational transmission of cultural knowledge and practices for emerging Elders. This community-academic partnership will implement and evaluate an Elders Mentoring Elders Camp to focus on repairing and nurturing relationships through the practice and preservation of cultural knowledge and practices, including traditional foodways. This initiative contributes to the intergenerational transmission of knowledge, which is necessary to keep culture alive and thriving.The transmission of generational knowledge in Alaska Native communities has been disrupted by colonization and led to declining health among Alaska Natives, as evidenced by the loss of knowledge regarding traditional foods and foodways and increasing rates of cardiometabolic disorders impacting Alaska Natives.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a serious eye disease and glaucoma optic disc hemorrhage (GODH) is an important diagnostic indicator for glaucoma. Deep-learning-based medical image segmentation methods for automatic optic cup and disc segmentation have made tremendous progress. However, when it comes to the segmentation of GODH, classical deep learning technologies face two main challenges: the difficulties in distinguishing GODH from the end points or bending points of blood vessels, and the imbalance between the pixel classes of the target area and the background area. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning framework integrating expert knowledge (E-Net) for the segmentation of GODH in fundus images. This E-Net consisted of a primary network for GODH segmentation and two auxiliary networks for extraction of optic disc (OD) and blood vessels. The segmentation probability maps from the two auxiliary networks were used to improve the segmentation accuracy of GODH, via expert knowledge loss functions and attention mechanism. Moreover, we designed a weighted segmentation accuracy loss function to balance the segmentation accuracy of the target and background region, thus fully mining the substantial information in the fundus images. The proposed E-Net was verified on a GODH dataset from Beijing Tongren Hospital. The experiments showed that the proposed E-Net achieved state-of-the-art results on this dataset.

Does dispositional greed predispose employees to hide knowledge?: MRN

Author: Enwereuzor, Ibeawuchi K11 Department of Psychology, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria

Abstract: Purpose As knowledge hiding is prevalent and often leaves severe detrimental consequences in its wake, it is imperative to place strategies on the front burner to identify its potential antecedents forthwith if there is going to be any headway to curtail the incidence of this phenomenon in organizations. Therefore, this study aims to examine the relationship between dispositional greed and knowledge hiding with the perceived loss of knowledge power as an underlying mechanism. Design/methodology/approach A multi-wave, three weeks apart strategy was used for data collection. A sample of 262 employees working full-time in various organizations operating across different industries in Nigeria participated in this study. Data were analyzed with partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings The results showed that dispositional greed related positively to a perceived loss of knowledge power but insignificantly to any of the three dimensions of knowledge hiding (i.e. playing dumb, evasive hiding and rationalized hiding). On the other hand, the relationship between perceived loss of knowledge power and the three dimensions of knowledge hiding was positive. Finally, dispositional greed had an indirect positive relationship with the three dimensions of knowledge hiding through perceived loss of knowledge power. Research limitations/implications All the variables were self-reported, which may lead to the same source bias. Practical implications Human resources managers can subject employees to cognitive restructuring training to help them identify thinking patterns that contribute to the perception of losing their power in the organization if they share knowledge and help reshape their perceptions regarding knowledge sharing. Management can use rewards to encourage employees to adopt knowledge sharing and refrain from knowledge hiding as a desired organizational norm. Originality/value This study offers novel insights that identify an underlying mechanism that encourages greedy employees to enact knowledge hiding.

Abstract: Radiology is a highly complex field that requires mastery over an ever-expanding body of knowledge. Spaced learning, interleaving, and retrieval practice are evidence-based learning strategies that enhance long-term retention of information. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in the setting of radiology education. PURPOSE Radiology is a highly complex field that requires mastery over an ever-expanding body of knowledge. Spaced learning, interleaving, and retrieval practice are evidence-based learning strategies that enhance long-term retention of information. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in the setting of radiology education.The authors searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, ERIC, and forward and backward citations for studies published between database inception and February 19, 2023. Eligibility criteria for included studies were randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that investigated the impact of spaced, interleaved, or retrieval practice on knowledge retention of medical trainees after education related to medical imaging as assessed by postinterventional examination scores. METHODS The authors searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, ERIC, and forward and backward citations for studies published between database inception and February 19, 2023. Eligibility criteria for included studies were randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that investigated the impact of spaced, interleaved, or retrieval practice on knowledge retention of medical trainees after education related to medical imaging as assessed by postinterventional examination scores.Of 1,316 records reviewed, 8 studies met eligibility criteria. Two studies investigated spaced learning, two studies interleaving, and six studies retrieval practice, including two trials that evaluated interventions incorporating both spaced learning and retrieval practice. Five of eight studies reported statistically significant differences between interventional and control groups on either immediate or delayed postinterventional examinations. RESULTS Of 1,316 records reviewed, 8 studies met eligibility criteria. Two studies investigated spaced learning, two studies interleaving, and six studies retrieval practice, including two trials that evaluated interventions incorporating both spaced learning and retrieval practice. Five of eight studies reported statistically significant differences between interventional and control groups on either immediate or delayed postinterventional examinations.Despite extensive evidence in support of spaced, interleaved, and retrieval practice within the broader literature, few studies have examined the effectiveness of these strategies in radiology education. Additional trials are required to evaluate the usefulness of incorporating these techniques into educational programs related to medical imaging. CONCLUSIONS Despite extensive evidence in support of spaced, interleaved, and retrieval practice within the broader literature, few studies have examined the effectiveness of these strategies in radiology education. Additional trials are required to evaluate the usefulness of incorporating these techniques into educational programs related to medical imaging.

Abstract: Creating meaningful and engaging learning opportunities can be challenged by budgets, time, and learning management systems with limited methods of interaction. An innovative method was necessary to meet competency evaluation and continuing education needs for emergency department staff. INTRODUCTION Creating meaningful and engaging learning opportunities can be challenged by budgets, time, and learning management systems with limited methods of interaction. An innovative method was necessary to meet competency evaluation and continuing education needs for emergency department staff.Gamification and simulation techniques were combined to offer an interactive learning opportunity through an escape room format to improve engagement and knowledge retention. This educational offering was designed to enhance staff learning of trauma care and processes at emergency departments that are not designated trauma centers. DESIGN Gamification and simulation techniques were combined to offer an interactive learning opportunity through an escape room format to improve engagement and knowledge retention. This educational offering was designed to enhance staff learning of trauma care and processes at emergency departments that are not designated trauma centers.Emergency department team members completed the trauma escape room challenge, and postsurvey results demonstrated favorable ratings of new knowledge acquisition, skill competency, teamwork, and confidence when providing care for a trauma patient. OUTCOMES Emergency department team members completed the trauma escape room challenge, and postsurvey results demonstrated favorable ratings of new knowledge acquisition, skill competency, teamwork, and confidence when providing care for a trauma patient.Nurse educators can "escape" the monotony of passive learning by using active learning strategies including the fun of gamification to improve clinical skills and confidence. DISCUSSION Nurse educators can "escape" the monotony of passive learning by using active learning strategies including the fun of gamification to improve clinical skills and confidence.

Abstract: Anatomy is physiotherapy's foundation. However, undergraduate classroom learning and knowledge acquisition-retention remain questionable. This study explored the possibility of improving this learning experience and evaluates the gross anatomy of abdomen and pelvis short-term knowledge retention among first-year physiotherapy students in Malta. The online Kahoot! game-based quiz platform was used through an instructor-designed best-of-four multiple-choice questions. Correctly answered questions and Kahoot! scores generated by the platform were utilized to measure knowledge retention. Kahoot! sessions 1 and 3 shared similar attendance and response rate and were compared together. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare Kahoot! scores and Chi test for trend to compare correctly answered questions. Students' perceived learning experiences before and after the introduction of the Kahoot quizzes were gathered through Likert scores and analyzed using McNamar's chi-square test. Overall, a significantly increased trend in correctly answered questions (χ 2 : 23.38, p-value: <0.001) across the Kahoot! sessions were evident. Four questions out of 12 exhibited significant Kahoot! scores differences. Students reported better learning experiences following the initiation of Kahoot! (χ 2 : 5.1, p-value: 0.02). Indeed, all students agreed that the use of the interactive quiz improved their anatomy short term knowledge retention. Introducing an online interactive quiz as part of the lecture program may be useful to improve the learning experience and anatomy knowledge retention among physiotherapy students.Anatomy is physiotherapy's foundation.

Abstract: This pre/post-intervention study aimed to evaluate neonatal outcomes after the implementation of the Neonatal Resuscitation Program of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics. OBJECTIVES This pre/post-intervention study aimed to evaluate neonatal outcomes after the implementation of the Neonatal Resuscitation Program of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics.This interventional study was conducted across five secondary healthcare regions that supported 62 cities in the southwestern mesoregion of Piauí. It included 431 healthcare professionals responsible for neonatal care in the study region. The participants were trained in neonatal resuscitation through the Neonatal Resuscitation Program of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics. Delivery room structuring, healthcare professionals' knowledge, and neonatal care outcomes were analyzed immediately before and after intervention and after 12 months between February 2018 and March 2019, and healthcare professionals were evaluated. METHOD This interventional study was conducted across five secondary healthcare regions that supported 62 cities in the southwestern mesoregion of Piauí. It included 431 healthcare professionals responsible for neonatal care in the study region. The participants were trained in neonatal resuscitation through the Neonatal Resuscitation Program of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics. Delivery room structuring, healthcare professionals' knowledge, and neonatal care outcomes were analyzed immediately before and after intervention and after 12 months between February 2018 and March 2019, and healthcare professionals were evaluated.Training was conducted for over 106 courses. As a participant could take multiple courses, 700 training sessions were conducted. Regarding delivery room structuring, the acquisition of materials required for resuscitation increased from 28.4 to 80.6% immediately after the intervention and to 83.3% after 12 months. Knowledge retention was significant in the post-training period, with a 95.5% approval rate, and knowledge acquisition was satisfactory after 12 months. The number of newborns transferred during the study period increased significantly. A 72.6% reduction in mortality at birth was recorded, and 479 newborns were resuscitated. RESULTS Training was conducted for over 106 courses. As a participant could take multiple courses, 700 training sessions were conducted.

Abstract: Deep learning has been attracting more and more attention in the phase unwrapping of fringe projection profilometry (FPP) in recent years. In order to improve the accuracy of the deep-learning-based unwrapped phase methods from a single fringe pattern, this paper proposes a single-input triple-output neural network structure with a physical prior. In the proposed network, a single-input triple-output network structure is developed to convert the input fringe pattern into three intermediate outputs: the wrapped phase, the fringe order, the coarse unwrapped phase, and the final output high-precision unwrapped phase from the three outputs. Moreover, a new, to the best of our knowledge, loss function is designed to improve the performance of the model using a physical prior about these three outputs in FPP. Numerous experiments demonstrated that the proposed network is able to improve the accuracy of the unwrapped phase, which can also be extended to other deep learning phase unwrapping models.Deep learning has been attracting more and more attention in the phase unwrapping of fringe projection profilometry (FPP) in recent years.

Abstract: Three-dimensional-printed anatomical models (3DPAMs) appear to be a relevant tool due to their educational value and their feasibility. The objectives of this review were to describe and analyse the methods utilised for creating 3DPAMs used in teaching human anatomy and for evaluating its pedagogical contribution. BACKGROUND Three-dimensional-printed anatomical models (3DPAMs) appear to be a relevant tool due to their educational value and their feasibility. The objectives of this review were to describe and analyse the methods utilised for creating 3DPAMs used in teaching human anatomy and for evaluating its pedagogical contribution.An electronic search was conducted on PubMed using the following terms: education, school, learning, teaching, learn, teach, educational, three-dimensional, 3D, 3-dimensional, printing, printed, print, anatomy, anatomical, anatomically, and anatomic. Data retrieved included study characteristics, model design, morphological evaluation, educational performance, advantages, and disadvantages. METHODS An electronic search was conducted on PubMed using the following terms: education, school, learning, teaching, learn, teach, educational, three-dimensional, 3D, 3-dimensional, printing, printed, print, anatomy, anatomical, anatomically, and anatomic. Data retrieved included study characteristics, model design, morphological evaluation, educational performance, advantages, and disadvantages.Of the 68 articles selected, the cephalic region was the most studied (33 articles); 51 articles mentioned bone printing. In 47 articles, the 3DPAM was designed from CT scans. Five printing processes were listed. Plastic and its derivatives were used in 48 studies. The cost per design ranged from 1.25 USD to 2800 USD. Thirty-seven studies compared 3DPAM to a reference model. Thirty-three articles investigated educational performance. The main advantages were visual and haptic qualities, effectiveness for teaching, reproducibility, customizability and manipulability, time savings, integration of functional anatomy, better mental rotation ability, knowledge retention, and educator/student satisfaction. The main disadvantages were related to the design: consistency, lack of detail or transparency, overly bright colours, long printing time, and high cost. RESULTS Of the 68 articles selected, the cephalic region was the most studied (33 articles); 51 articles mentioned bone printing. In 47 articles, the 3DPAM was designed from CT scans. Five printing processes were listed. Plastic and its derivatives were used in 48 studies. The cost per design ranged from 1.25 USD to 2800 USD.

The main disadvantages were related to the design: consistency, lack of detail or transparency, overly bright colours, long printing time, and high cost.This systematic review demonstrates that 3DPAMs are feasible at a low cost and effective for teaching anatomy. More realistic models require access to more expensive 3D printing technologies and substantially longer design time, which would greatly increase the overall cost. Choosing an appropriate image acquisition modality is key. From a pedagogical viewpoint, 3DPAMs are effective tools for teaching anatomy, positively impacting the learning outcomes and satisfaction level. The pedagogical effectiveness of 3DPAMs seems to be best when they reproduce complex anatomical areas, and they are used by students early in their medical studies.

Abstract: Current and future healthcare professionals are generally not trained to cope with the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in healthcare. To design a curriculum that caters to variable baseline knowledge and skills, clinicians may be conceptualized as "consumers", "translators", or "developers". The changes required of medical education because of AI innovation are linked to those brought about by evidence-based medicine (EBM). We outline a core curriculum for AI education of future consumers, translators, and developers, emphasizing the links between AI and EBM, with suggestions for how teaching may be integrated into existing curricula. We consider the key barriers to implementation of AI in the medical curriculum: time, resources, variable interest, and knowledge retention. By improving AI literacy rates and fostering a translator- and developer-enriched workforce, innovation may be accelerated for the benefit of patients and practitioners.Current and future healthcare professionals are generally not trained to cope with the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in healthcare.

Abstract: Neonatal resuscitation training in a simulated delivery room environment is a new paradigm in pediatric medical education. The purpose of this research is to highlight team-based simulation as an effective method of teaching neonatal resuscitation to senior pediatric residents. BACKGROUND Neonatal resuscitation training in a simulated delivery room environment is a new paradigm in pediatric medical education. The purpose of this research is to highlight team-based simulation as an effective method of teaching neonatal resuscitation to senior pediatric residents.In an intervention educational study, we evaluated the impact of team-based simulation training in the development of neonatal resuscitation. A team consisting of a three-person group of senior pediatric residents performed neonatal resuscitation on a low-fidelity newborn simulator based on the stated scenario. Video-based structured debriefing was performed and followed by the second cycle of scenario and debriefing to evaluate the feasibility of conducting team-based simulation training in a lesser-resourced environment. Evaluation criteria included megacode scores which is a simulation performance checklist, pre-and post-test scores to evaluate residents' knowledge and confidence, the survey checklist as a previously developed questionnaire assessing residents' satisfaction, and debriefing from live and videotaped performances. Four months after the end of the training course, we measured the behavioral changes of the residents by conducting an OSCE test to evaluate post-training knowledge retention. Mean ± SD was calculated for megacode, satisfaction (survey checklist), and OSCE scores. Pre- and post-program gains were statistically compared. The first three levels of Kirkpatrick's training effectiveness model were used to evaluate the progress of the program.

The first three levels of Kirkpatrick's training effectiveness model were used to evaluate the progress of the program.Twenty-one senior residents participated in the team-based simulation. The mean ± SD of the megacode score was 35.6 ± 2.2. The mean ± SD of the overall satisfaction score for the evaluation of the first level of the Kirkpatrick model was 96.3 ± 3.7. For the evaluation of the second level of the Kirkpatrick model, the pre-posttest gain in overall confidence score had a statistically significant difference (P = 0.001). All residents obtained a passing grade in OSCE as an evaluation of the third level. RESULTS Twenty-one senior residents participated in the team-based simulation.

All residents obtained a passing grade in OSCE as an evaluation of the third level.Team-based simulation training in neonatal resuscitation improves the knowledge, skills, and performance of pediatric residents and has a positive effect on their self-confidence and leadership skills. There is still a need to investigate the transfer of learning and abilities to real-life practice, and further research on cost-effectiveness and impact on patient outcomes is warranted. CONCLUSIONS Team-based simulation training in neonatal resuscitation improves the knowledge, skills, and performance of pediatric residents and has a positive effect on their self-confidence and leadership skills. There is still a need to investigate the transfer of learning and abilities to real-life practice, and further research on cost-effectiveness and impact on patient outcomes is warranted.

Abstract: Purpose Since few studies have explored and advanced on the development of measures of knowledge waste, the purpose of this paper is to develop and validate a scale for measuring the waste of knowledge. Design/methodology/approach A research was carried out in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) divided into five distinct stages, three qualitative and two quantitative. For the quantitative steps, a sample of 223 responses was obtained for the exploratory part and another sample of 614 responses for the confirmatory part of the study. Data analysis procedures involved Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis to test and validate the proposed scale. Findings A fifteen-item scale divided into four constructs was obtained after refinement of the proposed scale and validation procedures (convergent and discriminant validity). The scale also has satisfactory levels of reliability. Research limitations/implications The resulting scale was validated in a single institutional culture environment (HEIs in Southern Brazil). So it still should be tested in different organizational contexts and cross-culturally in different countries. The scale may be useful for decision-making improvement about knowledge management and waste reduction. Practical implications A scale with a practical and quick application is provided. Additionally, a classification of the waste of knowledge level was developed and it could be easily applied in different sectors or organizations. Originality/value The literature on waste of knowledge is limited and often confused with knowledge loss. This study provides a clear distinction between these topics, and it advances on the explanation and definition of knowledge waste. Also, it is the first study to offer a scale to measure the elements of knowledge waste.

OBJECTIVE This article presents the dataset titled "Do you know how to Stop The Bleed®? [1]" The dataset contains the survey responses of 200 US persons aged 16 years and above regarding their knowledge of hemorrhage control, based on the American College of Surgeons Stop The Bleed® (STB) course [2].Two hundred adults in the United States completed this web-based survey, which consisted of a quiz to assess STB knowledge. Factors that were not statistically correlated to STB knowledge retention included age, sex, race and education level up to college level. On the other hand, resuscitation coursework (p = 0.004) and income (p = 0.049) were important determinants of Stop the Bleed® knowledge. In particular, participants with CPR certification (p = 0.020) and/or a postgraduate degree (p = 0.015) scored higher than their counterparts in this sample cohort.

Abstract: We present a GDPR-compliant data privacy and access use case of a distributed data wallet and we explore its modeling using two options, AspectOWL and Prova. This use case requires a representation capable of expressing the dynamicity and interaction between parties. While both approaches provide the expressiveness of non-monotonic states and fluent state transitions, their scope and semantics are vastly different. AspectOWL is a monotonic contextualized ontology language, able to represent dynamic state transitions and knowledge retention by wrapping parts of the ontology in isolated contexts, called aspects, while Prova can handle state transitions at runtime using non-monotonic state transition semantics. We present the two implementations and we discuss the similarities, advantages, and differences of the two approaches.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Video propaganda is reported effectively improving patients' understanding of operation. However, whether a video introducing patients' most concerns can reduce preoperative anxiety and promote recovery stays unsealed. In this study, we investigated the effects of complementary therapy of educational video during preoperative visit. The results showed that thirty-five (23.2%) parents in Group Control were diagnosed as anxiety according to SAS, and nineteen (12.3%) patients were diagnosed after video intervention. The APAIs anxiety score and APAIs information score in Group Video were lower than those in Group Control. Compared with Group Control, video visit helped to increase the first-attempt pass rate of the knowledge retention exam and solve the patient's most worried concerns, and decrease incidence of emergence agitation, total cost of hospitalization and length of hospital stay. Moreover, video visit improved satisfaction degrees of patients and their main family members. Briefly, our study demonstrated video visit can improve patients' knowledge of anesthesia and decrease their preoperative anxiety, which may represent an important complementary therapy to routine preoperative visits.

Abstract: Mathematical manipulatives and the concrete–representational–abstract (CRA) instructional approach are common in elementary classrooms, but their use declines significantly by high school. This paper describes a mixed methods study focused on knowledge retention and perceptions of students in a high school Algebra I inclusion class after a lesson on square roots using a novel algebra manipulative. Twenty-five students in a high school Algebra I inclusion class engaged in an interactive lesson on square roots paired with the manipulative to support their conceptual understanding. Participants completed a pretest, a post-treatment questionnaire, and a delayed post-test. The two-sample t test showed a significant difference in students’ pretest–post-test scores. However, conventional content analysis of the questionnaires showed that most students did not believe the CRA instructional approach supported their learning. Implications include increased use of manipulatives to teach abstract algebraic topics to support students’ conceptual understanding and destigmatizing the use of manipulatives in secondary mathematics classrooms.

Abstract: This study explores the role of comics in constructing socio-scientific literacy among elementary school students. Through content analysis of conversations between teachers and students, we examined the sources of information in comics, including text, images, multimodal interaction and implicit meaning. Our findings revealed that students rely on more than just explicit information from text and images; they also engage in multimodal interaction, combining visual and textual elements, and interpret implicit meanings within the comics’ narratives. The design of the comics influences the distribution of information, with comic strips providing substantial explicit content and comics with minimal text emphasizing visual elements. Additionally, mathematical representations, such as bar charts, are incorporated to enhance students’ statistical and scientific inquiry literacy. These findings highlighted the potential of comics as effective educational resources for promoting socio-scientific literacy, fostering critical thinking skills and empowering students to engage with complex socio-scientific issues. Educators and researchers can utilize these insights to design educational comics that engage students and facilitate the construction of socio-scientific literacy, ultimately equipping them with the skills to navigate real-world challenges. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term effects of comics on students’ knowledge retention and decision-making skills.

Abstract: Immediate access to the patient in crisis situations, such as cardiac arrest during robotic surgery, can be challenging. We aimed to present a full immersion simulation module to train robotic surgical teams to manage a crisis scenario, enhance teamwork, establish clear lines of communication, improve coordination and speed of response. Start time of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), first defibrillator shock and robotic de-docking time from the first ‘cardiac arrest call’ were recorded. Observational Teamwork Assessment for Surgery (OTAS) scores were used in control and test simulations to assess performance along with a participant survey. Repeat scenarios and assessment were conducted at a 6-month interval for the same team to validate knowledge retention and an additional scenario was run with a new anaesthetic team to validate modular design. OTAS scores improved across all specialty teams after training with emergency algorithm and at retention validity re-test ( p  = 0.0181; p  = 0.0063). There was an overall reduction in time to CPR (101–48 s), first defibrillator shock (> 302 s to 86 s) and robot de dock time (86–25 s) Improvement remained constant at retention validity re-test. Replacing the anaesthetic team showed improvement in time to CPR, first shock and robotic de-dock times and did not affect OTAS scores ( p  = 0.1588). The module was rated highly for realism and crisis training by all teams. This high-fidelity simulation training module is realistic and feasible to deliver. Its modular design allows for efficient assessment and feedback, optimising staff training time and making it a valuable addition to robotic team training.

Abstract: Loss of knowledge and experience as older workers retire in large numbers could have devastating impacts for employers that hold on to traditional views of retirement and talent management. Capitalizing on changing workplace demographics can create a mutually beneficial situation for employers and employees in a world of increased longevity. In the future, many experts foresee careers that will last 60 years or more, alternating between periods of work, learning and leisure. Transitioning to this new model means that employees and their employers may need to rethinktraditional views of retirement and the approach to the second half of life. Organizations that find the right approach could be the employers of choice in the workplace of the future.

Analysing Gaming Behaviour: Insights on Personality Traits

Abstract: Educational games have become an integral part of the educational process at various levels, with their usage rapidly increasing as innovative e-learning methods. These games have proven to be highly engaging and effective in knowledge retention. Previous research primarily focused on the impact of violent video games on behaviour and the correlation between game behaviour and personality. Traditionally personality assessment relies on psychometric questionnaires, with the Big Five Inventory (BFI) being a widely used tool. However, these approaches often have certain drawbacks as respondents tend to carefully consider their answers, prioritizing correctness over authenticity. To address these limitations, novel approaches are being developed that incorporate gaming elements to indirectly measure personality. Therefore, an intriguing question arises: Can the subconscious moves, choices, and behaviours exhibited during gameplay serve as indicators of players' personality? In this case study, we developed an educational game focused on Databases courses for university students. The game aims to capture everyday life experiences at the university such as social connections and curiosity or willingness to try new things, based on the Five-Factor Model (OCEAN). The educational content is presented in the form of a quiz with four possible answers, providing appropriate feedback based on the selected responses. The objectives were to strengthen the knowledge and comprehension of Databases subject and also to gather information about players' gaming behaviour and thus predict their scores on two personality traits: Extraversion and Openness to Experience, based on the Five-Factor Model. A total of 149 computer science students of the University of Macedonia participated in the study by playing the game and completing the BFI questionnaire. We utilized classification algorithms to develop a model to predict student's personality. The goodness of the model was assessed using different metrics and the results showed that it is effective to model both the extraversion and openness personality dimensions using serious games instead of questionnaires. These findings can be used by educators and game designers to develop personalized educational games taking into account learner's personality and thus provide valuable insights for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Lack of consistency in primary care residency training exists in transitions of care (TOC) of adolescents from pediatric to adult medicine, which can lead to conflicting or incomplete training. To fill this gap, we developed a curriculum based on the Got Transition Six Core Elements and piloted it at two bicoastal, academic Medicine-Pediatrics (Med-Peds) residency programs. BACKGROUND Lack of consistency in primary care residency training exists in transitions of care (TOC) of adolescents from pediatric to adult medicine, which can lead to conflicting or incomplete training. To fill this gap, we developed a curriculum based on the Got Transition Six Core Elements and piloted it at two bicoastal, academic Medicine-Pediatrics (Med-Peds) residency programs.The goals of this project are to increase resident TOC knowledge, increase transition discussion comfort and skills, and obtain feedback for curriculum improvement. OBJECTIVES The goals of this project are to increase resident TOC knowledge, increase transition discussion comfort and skills, and obtain feedback for curriculum improvement.Two educational sessions were held at both institutions between 2020-2021. Of 32 potential resident participants, 26 participated in session one and 22 participated in session two. Sessions included a didactic presentation, small group activities, and a guest speaker discussing transitional experience. Electronic pre-session, post-session, and retention surveys evaluated resident knowledge, comfort, and self-reported skills of TOC. A Hybrid Type II design was used with mixed methods to evaluate curriculum effectiveness and implementation. METHODS Two educational sessions were held at both institutions between 2020-2021. Of 32 potential resident participants, 26 participated in session one and 22 participated in session two. Sessions included a didactic presentation, small group activities, and a guest speaker discussing transitional experience. Electronic pre-session, post-session, and retention surveys evaluated resident knowledge, comfort, and self-reported skills of TOC. A Hybrid Type II design was used with mixed methods to evaluate curriculum effectiveness and implementation.The first and second sessions had 81% and 68% attendance, respectively. Eighty-four percent completed the pre-session survey, 65% completed the post-session survey, and 68% completed the retention survey. TOC knowledge increased by 19% overall (p<0.001). First-year residents gained the most knowledge and implementation skills. Residents participating in alternating medicine and pediatric clinics gained more knowledge than those in a combined Med-Peds clinic (p=0.001). Comfort increased for both initiating and continuing TOC discussions after the first session. Knowledge retention was not statistically significant. RESULTS The first and second sessions had 81% and 68% attendance, respectively. Eighty-four percent completed the pre-session survey, 65% completed the post-session survey, and 68% completed the retention survey. TOC knowledge increased by 19% overall (p<0.001).

Residents participating in alternating medicine and pediatric clinics gained more knowledge than those in a combined Med-Peds clinic (p=0.001). Comfort increased for both initiating and continuing TOC discussions after the first session. Knowledge retention was not statistically significant.A standardized TOC curriculum can improve resident knowledge and is easily implemented at multiple institutions. Early-in-training residents and those in alternating medicine and pediatric clinics particularly benefit. CONCLUSION A standardized TOC curriculum can improve resident knowledge and is easily implemented at multiple institutions. Early-in-training residents and those in alternating medicine and pediatric clinics particularly benefit.

Abstract: Many medical students use spaced repetition as a study strategy to improve knowledge retention, and there has been growing interest from medical students in using flashcard software, such as Anki, to implement spaced repetition. Previous studies have provided insights into the relationship between medical students' use of spaced repetition and exam performance, but most of these studies have relied on self-reports. Novel insights about how medical students use spaced repetition can be gleaned from research that takes advantage of the ability of digital interfaces to log detailed data about how students use software. This study is unique in its use of data extracted from students' digital Anki data files, and those data are used to compare study patterns over the first year of medical school. Implementation of spaced repetition was compared between two groups of students who were retrospectively grouped based on average performance on three exams throughout the first year of medical school. Results indicate that students in the higher scoring group studied more total flashcards and implemented spaced repetition via Anki earlier in the year compared to the lower scoring group. These findings raise the possibility that implementing spaced repetition as a study strategy early in medical school may be related to improved knowledge retention and exam performance. Additional research should be performed at more sites to further examine the relationship between spaced repetition implementation and exam performance.Many medical students use spaced repetition as a study strategy to improve knowledge retention, and there has been growing interest from medical students in using flashcard software, such as Anki, to implement spaced repetition.

Abstract: Video propaganda is reported effectively improving patients' understanding of operation. However, whether a video introducing patients' most concerns can reduce preoperative anxiety and promote recovery stays unsealed. In this study, we investigated the effects of complementary therapy of educational video during preoperative visit. The results showed that thirty-five (23.2%) parents in Group Control were diagnosed as anxiety according to SAS, and nineteen (12.3%) patients were diagnosed after video intervention. The APAIs anxiety score and APAIs information score in Group Video were lower than those in Group Control. Compared with Group Control, video visit helped to increase the first-attempt pass rate of the knowledge retention exam and solve the patient's most worried concerns, and decrease incidence of emergence agitation, total cost of hospitalization and length of hospital stay. Moreover, video visit improved satisfaction degrees of patients and their main family members. Briefly, our study demonstrated video visit can improve patients' knowledge of anesthesia and decrease their preoperative anxiety, which may represent an important complementary therapy to routine preoperative visits.Video propaganda is reported effectively improving patients' understanding of operation.

Abstract: The challenges experienced due to the workforce shortage that results in knowledge loss have been studied in various industries. To deal with the knowledge loss caused by the current and projected retirement rate, companies must retain the knowledge and experience gained by the current workforce and successfully transfer it to the next generation of employees. The focus of the study is to address the issue of retention of knowledge and experience. Thus, this paper studied the awareness and implementation of knowledge transfer strategies and the perception of knowledge management culture and programs in the southeast region of the U.S. The data was collected through a background study and survey distribution among the industry partners of this study. According to the study, knowledge loss is a critical issue for businesses since the pool of future talent is insufficient to replace the retiring workforce. Furthermore, disparities were observed between the awareness and implementation of knowledge transfer strategies at the company and employee levels in general contractors (GCs) and trade partners or specialty contractors (S.C.). These differences suggest that knowledge management implementation should be studied at the employee level to better understand knowledge management in construction companies. According to data analysis for the perception of knowledge management culture, it was observed that most of the surveyed employees had access to knowledge management tools and were aware of knowledge management strategies; however, their implementation was not sufficiently encouraged. Through these analyses, this study lays the groundwork for pursuing knowledge management on a deeper level by increasing collaboration opportunities that benefit industry partners.

Abstract: Online learning has become increasingly commonplace, including the replacement and augmentation of traditional in-residence education, as well as ad-hoc training systems and just-in-time knowledge dissemination. However, design for instructional media to facilitate performance has relied on an inadequate understanding of the behavioral affect elicited from these designs. To investigate the degree to which excitement and engagement are predictive of individual learning outcomes in an online learning setting, we evaluate an experiment with two instructional representations (static and dynamic) using learning materials for a semaphore signaling system. We examine the excitement and engagement levels of the participants using electroencephalography (EEG) as potential mediators. Learning outcomes are measured by the evaluation scores of knowledge retention. We consider several structural equation models (SEMs) to see the underlying relationship between instructional representation, excitement, engagement, and learning outcomes. Notably, the models indicate the full mediation of behavioral affect on learning outcomes, in which both the range of excitement and the maximum level of engagement are mediating effects. This article illustrates the potential for biometrically measured affect aid in the modeling and understanding of how instructional design features ultimately impact performance.

Abstract: Answer to the Call is an installation created by artist Taloi Havini as part of her exhibition The Soul Expanding Ocean #1. Commissioned by the TBA21 Academy, Havini joined a scientific expedition aboard the research vessel Falkor to map the Great Barrier Reef using sonar technology. The installation, consisting of a twenty-two-channel sonic landscape, explores the symbiotic relationship between sound and its surroundings. Havini draws on traditional knowledge from her birthplace, Buka Island, to create a dialogue between different ways of knowing. The installation features hydrophone recordings, traditional marine chants, words spoken in Havini's first language, and an original score by composer Ben Hakalitz. The work reflects on the intergenerational loss of knowledge about the ocean and highlights the importance of deep listening. The installation immerses visitors in a sonic environment that evokes the interconnectedness of ocean and life systems.

Abstract: The study aimed to conduct a systematic literature review to identify the trends, impacts, and challenges of mobile microlearning (MML) research. Using five academic databases from the fields of social science, engineering, and medical science as search sources, 26 scholarly articles, published between 2015 and 2020, were retrieved. The study applied a content analysis method to analyze and synthesize the data with three focal points: (a) research purposes and publication sources; (b) research settings, including learning domains, contexts, research methods, measures, and participants; and (c) research outcomes, advantages, and challenges of MML based on the reviewed literature. Results indicated that the mixed-method approach has become a trend in MML studies and MML has been widely applied in both formal and informal settings, especially in the just-in-time workplace learning. In terms of advantages, MML not only enhanced learners’ achievement and motivation but also improved skills and knowledge retention. Some deficiencies of MML that were identified included the need for further investigation on meaningful designs of microcontents to fit into small screen mobile devices and issues of usability. The paper discusses implications for researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: Clinical reasoning is reliant on students having acquired a strong foundation in the basic sciences. However, there remains uncertainty regarding whether medical students are maintaining this knowledge over the span of their degrees. Therefore, this project aimed to assess long-term retention of basic science knowledge within a cohort of students from an undergraduate medical school in the United Kingdom (UK). BACKGROUND Clinical reasoning is reliant on students having acquired a strong foundation in the basic sciences. However, there remains uncertainty regarding whether medical students are maintaining this knowledge over the span of their degrees. Therefore, this project aimed to assess long-term retention of basic science knowledge within a cohort of students from an undergraduate medical school in the United Kingdom (UK).This longitudinal study followed a cohort of students, from their first to final year. In their final year, participants sat a bespoke formative basic science knowledge assessment that utilised 46 single-best-answer questions. To examine for long-term attainment differences, these scores were compared with those achieved in first-year assessments. METHODS This longitudinal study followed a cohort of students, from their first to final year. In their final year, participants sat a bespoke formative basic science knowledge assessment that utilised 46 single-best-answer questions. To examine for long-term attainment differences, these scores were compared with those achieved in first-year assessments.Of the eligible students, 40% partook in the study (n = 22). Comparing assessment scores highlighted an enhancement in overall basic science knowledge between first and final year (p < 0.01). Although most basic science domains remained unchanged between both time points, anatomy and physiology scores increased (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively), whereas biochemistry scores were the only ones to decrease (p = 0.02). RESULTS Of the eligible students, 40% partook in the study (n = 22). Comparing assessment scores highlighted an enhancement in overall basic science knowledge between first and final year (p < 0.01). Although most basic science domains remained unchanged between both time points, anatomy and physiology scores increased (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively), whereas biochemistry scores were the only ones to decrease (p = 0.02).This project provides insight into how well students are retaining the basic sciences during their studies. Underperforming science domains were identified, alongside pedagogical explanations for their individual shortcomings; for instance, students' perceived relevance of a domain is seen as a driver for its retention. Subsequently, a group of recommendations were derived to reinforce the most affected domains. The inclusion of more questions on the underperforming sciences, in clinically focussed assessments, is one such suggestion.

Abstract: To evaluate the impact of eLearning by allied health professionals on improving the knowledge and confidence to manage people with medically unexplained chronic fatigue states (FS). OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of eLearning by allied health professionals on improving the knowledge and confidence to manage people with medically unexplained chronic fatigue states (FS).Using a parallel randomized controlled trial design, participants were randomized 1:1 to a 4-week eLearning or wait-list control group. Knowledge and self-reported confidence in clinical skills to implement a therapeutic intervention for patients with FS were assessed at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up. Secondary outcomes (adherence and satisfaction with online education, knowledge retention) were also assessed. Data was analyzed using intention-to-treat. METHODS Using a parallel randomized controlled trial design, participants were randomized 1:1 to a 4-week eLearning or wait-list control group. Knowledge and self-reported confidence in clinical skills to implement a therapeutic intervention for patients with FS were assessed at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up. Secondary outcomes (adherence and satisfaction with online education, knowledge retention) were also assessed. Data was analyzed using intention-to-treat.There were 239 participants were randomized (eLearning n = 119, control n = 120), of whom 101 (85%) eLearning and 107 (89%) control participants completed baseline assessments and were included in the analysis. Knowledge (out of 100) improved significantly more in the eLearning group compared to the control group [mean difference (95% CI) 8.6 (5.9 to 11.4), p < 0.001]. Knowledge was reduced in the eLearning group at follow-up but was still significantly higher than baseline [6.0 (3.7 to 8.3), p < 0.001]. Median change (out of 5) in confidence in clinical skills to implement the FS intervention was also significantly greater in the eLearning group compared to the control group [knowledge: eLearning (1.2), control (0); clinical skills: eLearning (1), control (0.1); both p < 0.001)]. Average time spent on the eLearning program was 8.8 h. Most participants (80%) rated the lesson difficulty as at the "right level", and 91% would recommend it to others. RESULTS There were 239 participants were randomized (eLearning n = 119, control n = 120), of whom 101 (85%) eLearning and 107 (89%) control participants completed baseline assessments and were included in the analysis. Knowledge (out of 100) improved significantly more in the eLearning group compared to the control group [mean difference (95% CI) 8.6 (5.9 to 11.4), p < 0.001].

Abstract: Immediate access to the patient in crisis situations, such as cardiac arrest during robotic surgery, can be challenging. We aimed to present a full immersion simulation module to train robotic surgical teams to manage a crisis scenario, enhance teamwork, establish clear lines of communication, improve coordination and speed of response. Start time of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), first defibrillator shock and robotic de-docking time from the first 'cardiac arrest call' were recorded. Observational Teamwork Assessment for Surgery (OTAS) scores were used in control and test simulations to assess performance along with a participant survey. Repeat scenarios and assessment were conducted at a 6-month interval for the same team to validate knowledge retention and an additional scenario was run with a new anaesthetic team to validate modular design. OTAS scores improved across all specialty teams after training with emergency algorithm and at retention validity re-test (p = 0.0181; p = 0.0063). There was an overall reduction in time to CPR (101-48 s), first defibrillator shock (> 302 s to 86 s) and robot de dock time (86-25 s) Improvement remained constant at retention validity re-test. Replacing the anaesthetic team showed improvement in time to CPR, first shock and robotic de-dock times and did not affect OTAS scores (p = 0.1588). The module was rated highly for realism and crisis training by all teams. This high-fidelity simulation training module is realistic and feasible to deliver. Its modular design allows for efficient assessment and feedback, optimising staff training time and making it a valuable addition to robotic team training.Immediate access to the patient in crisis situations, such as cardiac arrest during robotic surgery, can be challenging.

Abstract: ENG English ENG The digitization of classrooms has enormously changed teaching during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The rapid introduction of tablet classes subsequently raised questions about potential learning outputs, as only a few studies had produced quite contradicting outcomes. Consequently, our study was set up to monitor cognitive learning outcomes of conventional and digital teaching interventions by explicitly paying attention to short- and long-term knowledge retention rates. Both modules covered the very same classroom content in focusing on the curricular content of the forest ecosystem. Subjects were eighth-graders from seven Bavarian secondary schools (analog: n = 74; digital: n = 225). We analyzed the knowledge gained by applying a multiple-choice questionnaire (online, 25 items) in a pre–post-retention design. For the statistical analyses SPSS was used, and a Rasch analysis was based on the ACERQuest software (Version 2.1). The Rasch calibration of the ad hoc knowledge items assured solid scores (Rel = 0.72). Both interventions significantly increased knowledge (analog and digital: p < 0.001; Cohen’s d: dₐₙₐₗₒg = 0.59, ddᵢgᵢₜₐₗ = 0.42) compared to the pre-test scores. Even after 6–9 weeks, there was no significant drop in the acquired knowledge scores (analog: p = 0.619; digital: p = 0.092) compared to the immediate post-test observed. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the knowledge levels reached after both interventions. The knowledge scores showed typical learning profiles of earlier studies including its consistency even after several weeks. Since no significant differences appeared for the knowledge gain of both groups, the kind of teaching seemingly does not originate any influence independent of participation in the digital or analog module. The same seems to be valid for notebook entry options.

Abstract: Despite the proven effectiveness of simulation-based learning activities, its adoption in medical education remains limited, and the influence of simulation on student motivation, particularly subjective task values, is seldom explored. This study aimed to investigate the impact of a simulation-based learning activity on student learning and subjective task values in a medical morphology-related course of Human Parasitology. BACKGROUND Despite the proven effectiveness of simulation-based learning activities, its adoption in medical education remains limited, and the influence of simulation on student motivation, particularly subjective task values, is seldom explored. This study aimed to investigate the impact of a simulation-based learning activity on student learning and subjective task values in a medical morphology-related course of Human Parasitology.A quasi-experimental study was conducted with 113 Chinese undergraduate medical students who participated in a Human Parasitology course during April to May 2022. Students were divided into two groups: Simulation Group (n = 55), where students used the simulation, and Lecture Group (n = 58), where students attended an online lecture. Students' learning was measured prior to the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and three weeks later to assess knowledge retention. The subjective task values questionnaire was administered before and after the interventions. Data were analyzed using one-way ANCOVA and MANOVA. METHODS A quasi-experimental study was conducted with 113 Chinese undergraduate medical students who participated in a Human Parasitology course during April to May 2022. Students were divided into two groups: Simulation Group (n = 55), where students used the simulation, and Lecture Group (n = 58), where students attended an online lecture. Students' learning was measured prior to the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and three weeks later to assess knowledge retention. The subjective task values questionnaire was administered before and after the interventions. Data were analyzed using one-way ANCOVA and MANOVA.Students in the Simulation Group exhibited significantly higher knowledge gain compared to the Lecture Group [F (1,110) = 23.69, p < 0.01]. Additionally, the Simulation Group retained knowledge significantly better than the Lecture Group [F (1,101) = 10.05, p < 0.005]. Furthermore, students in the Simulation Group experienced a significant increase in subjective task values after the intervention [F (3, 52) = 3.57, p < 0.05, η p 2  = 0.17], while students in the Lecture Group reported a significant decrease in subjective task values [F (3, 55) = 2.96, p < 0.05, η p 2  = 0.14]. RESULTS Students in the Simulation Group exhibited significantly higher knowledge gain compared to the Lecture Group [F (1,110) = 23.69, p < 0.01]. Additionally, the Simulation Group retained knowledge significantly better than the Lecture Group [F (1,101) = 10.05, p < 0.005].

These findings offer valuable insights into designing effective simulation-based learning experiences in medical education and have significant practical implications for educators and medical professionals. CONCLUSIONS Simulation-based learning not only leads to superior learning but also enhances students' subjective task values. These findings offer valuable insights into designing effective simulation-based learning experiences in medical education and have significant practical implications for educators and medical professionals.

Abstract: The worked example effect has been well documented within the framework of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), which suggests that teaching with examples would be superior to engaging in unguided problem solving, particularly for novices, as using worked examples would reduce their cognitive load, compared to solving problems, thus facilitating knowledge retention. This paper, using multiple-step mathematics problems, reports an experiment investigating the micro level of the worked example effect on learning solution steps, from the perspective of cognitive load and challenge (as a relevant affective, motivational factor), testing the worked example effect with a transfer test. The results favoured worked examples on both the retention and transfer tests after learning and showed that using worked examples would reduce cognitive load and impose less challenge on each step during learning.

Abstract: The opioid epidemic is an increasingly severe problem affecting public health and leading to significant economic burdens on healthcare systems. Overdose reversal training and de-stigmatization efforts are common strategies used to combat this epidemic. Nevertheless, healthcare professionals report a lack of confidence in administering naloxone and high stigmatization levels toward people with opioid use disorder (OUD). While one-time educational training reduces stigma and improves naloxone administration confidence, we previously demonstrated that knowledge retention at a three-month follow-up is reduced among a cohort of medical students. This study aimed to improve the effectiveness of opioid overdose awareness and reversal training (OOART) with a three-month follow-up abbreviated OOART (aOOART) booster video. BACKGROUND The opioid epidemic is an increasingly severe problem affecting public health and leading to significant economic burdens on healthcare systems. Overdose reversal training and de-stigmatization efforts are common strategies used to combat this epidemic. Nevertheless, healthcare professionals report a lack of confidence in administering naloxone and high stigmatization levels toward people with opioid use disorder (OUD). While one-time educational training reduces stigma and improves naloxone administration confidence, we previously demonstrated that knowledge retention at a three-month follow-up is reduced among a cohort of medical students. This study aimed to improve the effectiveness of opioid overdose awareness and reversal training (OOART) with a three-month follow-up abbreviated OOART (aOOART) booster video.Voluntary OOART was offered to first-year medical students (M1) at the Drexel University College of Medicine in 2022. At this training, 82 students completed a pre-training survey to establish a baseline knowledge and attitude toward people with OUD and their familiarity with the steps to reverse an opioid overdose. Following the hour-long training, 64 of 82 (79%) participants completed the post-training survey to measure the immediate retention of training information. After 2.5 months, students were randomly selected to receive a 6.5-minute aOOART booster video or serve as an unboosted control. Students in the booster and non-booster cohorts then completed a three-month follow-up survey. METHODS Voluntary OOART was offered to first-year medical students (M1) at the Drexel University College of Medicine in 2022. At this training, 82 students completed a pre-training survey to establish a baseline knowledge and attitude toward people with OUD and their familiarity with the steps to reverse an opioid overdose. Following the hour-long training, 64 of 82 (79%) participants completed the post-training survey to measure the immediate retention of training information. After 2.5 months, students were randomly selected to receive a 6.5-minute aOOART booster video or serve as an unboosted control. Students in the booster and non-booster cohorts then completed a three-month follow-up survey. Students who received the aOOART booster had significantly increased opioid reversal knowledge scores compared to non-boosted control students at the three-month follow-up. The aOOART booster resulted in a retention of the lowered stigma, and participants expressed a higher willingness to respond to an opioid overdose compared to participants who did not receive the booster video at the three-month follow-up. RESULTS  Students who received the aOOART booster had significantly increased opioid reversal knowledge scores compared to non-boosted control students at the three-month follow-up. The aOOART booster resulted in a retention of the lowered stigma, and participants expressed a higher willingness to respond to an opioid overdose compared to participants who did not receive the booster video at the three-month follow-up. This study shows that an aOOART booster method improves knowledge retention following initial OOART. Further, the aOOART booster video served to maintain participants' reduced stigma toward people with OUD and maintained participants' willingness to respond to an opioid overdose. These results support the incorporation of an abbreviated, periodic OOART reinforcement video into opioid overdose response training nationwide. We believe this "booster video" approach is a novel and effective method to improve healthcare professionals' and medical student preparedness to render appropriate care to people with OUD. CONCLUSIONS  This study shows that an aOOART booster method improves knowledge retention following initial OOART. Further, the aOOART booster video served to maintain participants' reduced stigma toward people with OUD and maintained participants' willingness to respond to an opioid overdose. These results support the incorporation of an abbreviated, periodic OOART reinforcement video into opioid overdose response training nationwide.

Abstract: This experiment utilized advanced visualization technology for the delivery of an introductory remote sensing lesson in an undergraduate geography course. Given the numerous immersive visualization solutions available, it is now possible to leverage the capabilities of augmented, mixed, and virtual reality (AR, MR, and VR) technology in a classroom learning environment. For instructors, it is important to understand how advanced visualization technologies can enhance the learning experience and enable greater knowledge retention. To validate the use of an AR sand table/sandbox in a group academic setting, approximately 400 participants were evaluated to assess the impact on students’ retention of both foundational and practical remote sensing concepts. This work represents a between-subjects design with two AR sand table experimental groups (instructor sand table interaction, and student sand table interaction) and one control group with no sand table exposure. The use of the AR sand table in a classroom environment was found to improve retention of foundational remote sensing knowledge and elevate the assessment performance for subjects identified as lower performers.

Strategic measures for enhancing resiliency in knowledge base supply chains: an emerging economy perspective

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/strategic-measures-enhancing-resiliency-knowledge/docview/2873089103/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: In the disruptive environment, the supply chains are unpredictable, volatile, and complex. By effectively applying knowledge, information, data, human intelligence, and new technologies, businesses with knowledge-based supply chains may successfully navigate the disruptive environment. This study has made an attempt to identify and evaluate the challenging factors that essential for knowledge-based supply chains to attain resilience. Due to the high effectiveness in determining the relationship among the factors, the study used the Fuzzy DEMATEL methodology. A total of 25 factors from the literature review were explored and validated by expert’s judgement to be grouped as causal and effect group variables. The Fuzzy DEMATEL results exhibit that digital technologies-based supply chains, agility, green perspective, personalization, last mile delivery, e-Procurement, mentoring & coaching for knowledge retention are the significant causal factors to be considered by the knowledge-based supply chains. Furthermore, the strategic measures are investigated and evaluated using the Best-Worst Method (BWM) application, which reveals that the two most important strategic solutions that have the potential to improve resilience in knowledge-based supply chains are a focus on socially sustainable supply chains and Industry 4.0 technologies. The report can help businesses think through important methods for long-term resilience.

Abstract: Background and Aims Organizational knowledge management (KM) involves creating, preserving, and sharing employees' knowledge. This approach can enhance efficiency, improve performance, and boost job satisfaction (JS) throughout all aspects of the organization. This research aimed to investigate the effect of three variables of KM, JS, and organizational performance (OP) on the employees of the Health and Treatment Network in Haji Abad City. Methods A study was conducted with 211 employees, such as physicians, nurses, and technicians. These employees worked in various sections, such as hospitals, health centers, rural centers, and emergency centers within the Health and Treatment Network of Haji Abad City. Newman and Kenard's KM, Hersey and Goldsmith's OP, and Smith, Kendall & Hulin's Job Satisfaction Questionnaires were used. The statistical software LISREL 8.8 was used to conduct structural equation modeling (SEM). Results The results indicate that the structural equation models had a good fit. Significant positive relationships exist between KM processes (creation, retention, and application) and JS. No significant relationship was found between knowledge transfer and JS. The coefficient obtained from SEM between knowledge retention and OP was 0.74, indicating a strong and direct correlation between the two variables. The standardized coefficients for the relationship between knowledge creation and retention and JS were 0.45 and 0.33, respectively. This indicates a positive and direct effect of knowledge creation and retention on JS. All KM processes positively predict OP. Conclusion The research model had a good fit, and the KM processes had a positive effect on performance and JS. However, no significant relationship was found between knowledge transfer and JS among employees in the Health and Treatment Network. More research is needed to identify mediating variables and factors influencing this phenomenon in healthcare centers.

Abstract: The Online Periodic Table of Elements (Ptable) is a Wikipedia-linked periodic table that displays a list of chemical elements organized by atomic number, electronic configuration, and recurring chemical properties. Elements are listed in reading order, increasing in atomic number, in their most basic form. The current study seeks to assess the impact of Ptable on students' understanding of trends in the properties of chemical elements. A mixed research strategy was used in this study. Chemistry students in grade eight (senior two) were selected to participate in this study. The sample size was 46 participants, with 38 students and 8 chemistry teachers chosen at random from two secondary schools in Bugesera District, in Rwanda. Interviews were used to collect qualitative data, which was then analyzed using discourse and interpretive analysis approaches. While quantitative data were collected by giving students achievement tests (pre- and post-test) and questionnaires, descriptive statistics were used to analyze them using a Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). According to the findings of this study, there was a statistical difference in student performance between the pre-and post-test, but no statistical difference between male and female students' academic performance. It was also discovered that students were pleased with the use of Ptable, which improved their learning and knowledge retention about trends in the properties of chemical elements. Teachers mentioned that Ptable is effective to teach trends in the properties of chemical elements. Among the difficulties noted were a slow internet connection and a limited number of computers.

Abstract: Objective To assess the impact of a novel flipped‐classroom (FC) otolaryngology resident didactic curriculum on resident learning. Methods Based on the preferences elicited in a survey of preferred learning styles of residents, a hybrid web‐based and in‐person FC otolaryngology didactic curriculum was implemented over a 6‐month period in 2020–2021. Resident reactions to the new curriculum were assessed via a second survey. Kruskal Wallis tests were used to compare mean stanine scores on the Otolaryngology Training Examination (OTE) exam for topics taught in the new format with topics delivered in the old format. Results After instituting the curriculum reform, engagement in at least a moderate amount of the pre‐didactic work and synchronous case discussions was reported by 67% and 88% of the residents, respectively. After the curriculum change, residents in years PGY2 and above reported statistically significant increases in self‐reported ability to retain information from didactics, to feel prepared for the OTE, and to feel confident in fund of knowledge ( p  < 0.001, p  = 0.004, and p  = 0.004, respectively). Compared to the prior year, mean stanine increased on OTE scores for residents in years PGY2‐PGY5 to a statistically significant degree (5.45 vs. 4.41, p  = 0.001) for the topics delivered in the new format compared to topics delivered in the traditional format (5.13 vs. 4.70, p  = 0.07). Conclusion By organizing a didactic curriculum through online modules that incorporate pre‐recorded lectures and external resources, residents reported and demonstrated improved knowledge retention.

Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this article was to evaluate the causal influence of Lean management practices on knowledge waste within the context of higher education institutions (HEIs). The peculiarities of knowledge impress upon organizations the need to think about reducing knowledge waste as a crucial practice. The Lean philosophy and practices therefore stand out as an appropriate management perspective, particularly given Lean's focus on waste elimination. However, little is known about the influence of Lean practices on reducing knowledge waste. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research instrument was distributed to professors and technical and administrative staff across three types of HEI in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The validated and pretested survey was circulated to the target population via an online method to explore eight constructs and 38 items concerning Lean and knowledge and waste. Findings The results of the survey indicated that all hypotheses were supported. The sum total of 837 responses showed that the Lean relationships (internal organizational paths) were more obvious where leadership support proved to have a positive effect on continuous improvement, training, and customer involvement. Moreover, the significant and negative effects of the Lean practices studied on knowledge waste was also supported, including for example, the interaction between HEIs and its client base. Originality/value HEIs are knowledge generators. Therefore, the necessity of avoiding and reducing knowledge waste is even greater. This study also differentiates itself from the “traditional” knowledge loss studies by investigating knowledge while the employees are still part of an organization and not after they have left taking the knowledge away with them.

Abstract: The fidelity level of virtual reality (VR) setups can affect different aspects of virtual experiences, but its effects on knowledge acquisition and retention need clarification. The two studies in this paper focus on spatial knowledge. The first study compared three VR setups, one using a VR headset and two using a tablet, differing in display and interaction fidelity. Since the type of virtual environment (VE), and the locomotion technique employed to explore it, might affect spatial knowledge acquisition, we studied each setup in an indoor and an outdoor VE with two widely used locomotion techniques (teleport and steering). Results showed that setups offering higher display and interaction fidelity can improve acquisition of spatial knowledge in terms of distance estimations (with teleport in the indoor VE, and with steering in the outdoor VE) and object-to-object spatial relations (with steering in the outdoor VE), but not in terms of object locations. This can provide guidance about how to choose the appropriate combination of setup and locomotion technique based on the type of VE and the types of spatial knowledge to acquire. Moreover, sickness and usability results showed that VR headset was more usable than tablet, and suggest using teleport on VR headset and steering on tablet. Therefore, the second study focused on VR headset with teleport and tablet with steering, and extended the assessment of their effects to spatial knowledge retention after two weeks. Results showed that spatial knowledge decreased in both conditions, but the VR headset with teleport led to better acquisition and 2-weeks retention of distance estimations.

Abstract: The rules in building codes are composed of language, logic structure, and the embedded knowledge that requires further articulation from rule experts. This greatly increases the complexity of rule interpretation. The conceptual graph (CG) is used as a graph-based representation method to capture such knowledge and transfer it to other actors in the compliance checking process. However, due to its subjectivity, it is difficult to ensure the quality of the CG to achieve minimal knowledge loss. This paper proposes a method using reusable CG patterns to reduce the knowledge loss caused by the opacity of concepts in rules, hence better facilitating knowledge transfer using CGs. The rules and their corresponding CGs are analyzed and compared. An assessment framework is used to assess CGs for correctness, completeness, complexity, and comprehensibility. A group of reusable CG patterns is then generated based on the analysis results of concepts in existing CGs. In a case study, rules selected from two types of building codes are used to validate the proposed methods. The results successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of the CG in facilitating knowledge transfer. Moreover, the comparison of quality between original CGs and improved CGs shows that using reusable CG patterns can effectively ease the creation of new CGs and improve its consistency.

Abstract: Background: Occupational hand dermatitis (OHD) is an important health concern for health care workers (HCWs), yet there is a lack of accessible training materials on this topic. Objectives: The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate an OHD training e-module for HCWs. Methods: The e-module was created in collaboration with an expert advisory committee and tested by Ontario HCWs through pre- and post-training OHD knowledge tests, a usability survey, and a survey about intent to change work skin care practices. Analyses of survey results included means and paired t -tests. Results: The 10-minute OHD training e-module for HCWs was tested by 254 HCWs and found to be highly usable, to increase OHD knowledge immediately and sustainably, and to change workplace skin care practices. Average OHD knowledge test scores significantly improved by 19% between the pretest (64.50%) and post-test (83.50%). Most 6-month follow-up survey respondents reported changing their skin care work practices (76.69%). Conclusions: This research addresses the previous lack of accessible OHD training for workers in health care settings. The creation and evaluation of a no-cost accessible OHD training e-module for workers in health care settings showed promising results across knowledge increase, knowledge retention, skin care behavior changes, and usability.Background: Occupational hand dermatitis (OHD) is an important health concern for health care workers (HCWs), yet there is a lack of accessible training materials on this topic.

Abstract: To address the problem of teaching noncore specialties, for which there is often limited teaching time and low student engagement, a flipped classroom case learning (FCCL) module was designed and implemented in a compulsory 5-day ophthalmology rotation for undergraduate medical students. The module consisted of a flipped classroom, online gamified clinical cases, and case-based learning. PURPOSE To address the problem of teaching noncore specialties, for which there is often limited teaching time and low student engagement, a flipped classroom case learning (FCCL) module was designed and implemented in a compulsory 5-day ophthalmology rotation for undergraduate medical students. The module consisted of a flipped classroom, online gamified clinical cases, and case-based learning.Final-year medical students in a 5-day ophthalmology rotation were randomized to the FCCL or a traditional lecture-based (TLB) module. The outcomes of subjective assessments (student-rated anonymous Likert scale questionnaire, scale 1 to 5, and course and teaching evaluation, scale 1 to 6) and objective assessments (end-of-rotation and post-MBChB multiple-choice questions, scale 0 to 60) were compared between the 2 groups. METHOD Final-year medical students in a 5-day ophthalmology rotation were randomized to the FCCL or a traditional lecture-based (TLB) module. The outcomes of subjective assessments (student-rated anonymous Likert scale questionnaire, scale 1 to 5, and course and teaching evaluation, scale 1 to 6) and objective assessments (end-of-rotation and post-MBChB multiple-choice questions, scale 0 to 60) were compared between the 2 groups.Between May 2021 and June 2022, 216 students (108 in each group) completed the study. Compared with the TLB students, the students in the FCCL group rated various aspects of the course statistically significantly higher, including feeling more enthusiastic and engaged by the course and more encouraged to ask questions and participate in discussions (all P < .001). They also gave higher ratings for the instructional methods, course assignments, course outcomes, and course workload ( P < .001). They gave higher course and teaching evaluation scores to the tutors (5.7 ± 0.6 vs 5.0 ± 1.0, P < .001). The FCCL group scored higher than the TLB group on the end-of-rotation multiple-choice questions (53.6 ± 3.1 vs 51.8 ± 2.8, P < .001). When 32 FCCL students and 36 TLB students were reassessed approximately 20 weeks after the rotation, the FCCL group scored higher (40.3 ± 9.1) than the TLB group (34.3 ± 10.9, P = .018). RESULTS Between May 2021 and June 2022, 216 students (108 in each group) completed the study. Compared with the TLB students, the students in the FCCL group rated various aspects of the course statistically significantly higher, including feeling more enthusiastic and engaged by the course and more encouraged to ask questions and participate in discussions (all P < .001). They also gave higher ratings for the instructional methods, course assignments, course outcomes, and course workload ( P < .001).

A similar model may be suitable for other specialties. CONCLUSIONS Applying the FCCL module in ophthalmology teaching enhanced medical students' satisfaction, examination performance, and knowledge retention. A similar model may be suitable for other specialties.

Abstract: To assess the impact of a novel flipped-classroom (FC) otolaryngology resident didactic curriculum on resident learning. OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of a novel flipped-classroom (FC) otolaryngology resident didactic curriculum on resident learning.Based on the preferences elicited in a survey of preferred learning styles of residents, a hybrid web-based and in-person FC otolaryngology didactic curriculum was implemented over a 6-month period in 2020-2021. Resident reactions to the new curriculum were assessed via a second survey. Kruskal Wallis tests were used to compare mean stanine scores on the Otolaryngology Training Examination (OTE) exam for topics taught in the new format with topics delivered in the old format. METHODS Based on the preferences elicited in a survey of preferred learning styles of residents, a hybrid web-based and in-person FC otolaryngology didactic curriculum was implemented over a 6-month period in 2020-2021. Resident reactions to the new curriculum were assessed via a second survey. Kruskal Wallis tests were used to compare mean stanine scores on the Otolaryngology Training Examination (OTE) exam for topics taught in the new format with topics delivered in the old format.After instituting the curriculum reform, engagement in at least a moderate amount of the pre-didactic work and synchronous case discussions was reported by 67% and 88% of the residents, respectively. After the curriculum change, residents in years PGY2 and above reported statistically significant increases in self-reported ability to retain information from didactics, to feel prepared for the OTE, and to feel confident in fund of knowledge (p < 0.001, p = 0.004, and p = 0.004, respectively). Compared to the prior year, mean stanine increased on OTE scores for residents in years PGY2-PGY5 to a statistically significant degree (5.45 vs. 4.41, p = 0.001) for the topics delivered in the new format compared to topics delivered in the traditional format (5.13 vs. 4.70, p = 0.07). RESULTS After instituting the curriculum reform, engagement in at least a moderate amount of the pre-didactic work and synchronous case discussions was reported by 67% and 88% of the residents, respectively. After the curriculum change, residents in years PGY2 and above reported statistically significant increases in self-reported ability to retain information from didactics, to feel prepared for the OTE, and to feel confident in fund of knowledge (p < 0.001, p = 0.004, and p = 0.004, respectively). Compared to the prior year, mean stanine increased on OTE scores for residents in years PGY2-PGY5 to a statistically significant degree (5.45 vs. 4.41, p = 0.001) for the topics delivered in the new format compared to topics delivered in the traditional format (5.13 vs. 4.70, p = 0.07).By organizing a didactic curriculum through online modules that incorporate pre-recorded lectures and external resources, residents reported and demonstrated improved knowledge retention. CONCLUSION By organizing a didactic curriculum through online modules that incorporate pre-recorded lectures and external resources, residents reported and demonstrated improved knowledge retention.NA Laryngoscope, 133:2129-2134, 2023.

Abstract: The potential of popular culture as a tool for knowledge delivery and enhancing engagement in education is promising but not extensively studied. Furthermore, concerns exist regarding learning fatigue due to increased reliance on videoconferencing platforms following the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure effective web-based teaching sessions that maintain attention spans and enhance understanding, innovative solutions are necessary. BACKGROUND The potential of popular culture as a tool for knowledge delivery and enhancing engagement in education is promising but not extensively studied. Furthermore, concerns exist regarding learning fatigue due to increased reliance on videoconferencing platforms following the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure effective web-based teaching sessions that maintain attention spans and enhance understanding, innovative solutions are necessary.This study aims to evaluate the use of specific popular culture case studies to enhance student engagement in a web-based near-peer teaching session. OBJECTIVE This study aims to evaluate the use of specific popular culture case studies to enhance student engagement in a web-based near-peer teaching session.We delivered a web-based teaching session to undergraduate medical students in the United Kingdom. The session included clinical vignettes and single-best-answer questions using characters from "The Simpsons" television show as patient analogies for various causes of jaundice. A pre-post survey, employing a 7-point Likert scale, was distributed to gather data from participants. METHODS We delivered a web-based teaching session to undergraduate medical students in the United Kingdom. The session included clinical vignettes and single-best-answer questions using characters from "The Simpsons" television show as patient analogies for various causes of jaundice. A pre-post survey, employing a 7-point Likert scale, was distributed to gather data from participants.A total of 53 survey responses were collected. Participants reported significantly improved understanding of jaundice after the session compared to before the session (median 6, IQR 5-6 vs median 4, IQR 3-4.5; P<.001). The majority of participants agreed that the inclusion of "The Simpsons" characters enhanced their knowledge and made the teaching session more memorable and engaging (memorability: median 6, IQR 5-7; engagement: median 6, IQR 5-7). RESULTS A total of 53 survey responses were collected. Participants reported significantly improved understanding of jaundice after the session compared to before the session (median 6, IQR 5-6 vs median 4, IQR 3-4.5; P<.001). The majority of participants agreed that the inclusion of "The Simpsons" characters enhanced their knowledge and made the teaching session more memorable and engaging (memorability: median 6, IQR 5-7; engagement: median 6, IQR 5-7).When appropriately integrated, popular culture can effectively engage students and improve self-perceived knowledge retention. "The Simpsons" characters can be used pedagogically and professionally as patient analogies to deliver teaching on the topic of jaundice. CONCLUSIONS When appropriately integrated, popular culture can effectively engage students and improve self-perceived knowledge retention. "The Simpsons" characters can be used pedagogically and professionally as patient analogies to deliver teaching on the topic of jaundice.

Captioning and repetition for Chinese students' immediate and delayed retention of English‐speaking multimedia lessons

Author: Liu, Yinan1    1 Department of English Studies, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China 621200@sdnu.edu.cn

Publication info: Liu, Yinan. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/captioning-repetition-chinese-students-immediate/docview/3022683803/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Background Studies: Captioning and repetition are widely used multimedia instructional devices for non-native students. Generally, studies in this area have tended to focus on second language literacy skills rather than on learning new content knowledge. Additionally, posttests were administered immediately after the treatments, while the delayed influences of captioning and repetition have never been investigated. Objectives: This paper addressed these research gaps in two separate studies. More specifically, this study attempted to examine the influences of captioning and repetition on non-native students' immediate and relayed retention. Methods: In Study One, three captioning conditions; word-by-word captions, closed captions, and no-captions; were compared to examine their efficacies in immediate and delayed content knowledge retention on 82 Chinese university students. To address the limitations in Study One as the multimedia lesson was short and played only once, Study Two incorporated captioning and two repetition types in its design. One hundred and eleven Chinese university students watch a video lesson in one of four captioning and repetition conditions. Results: The statistical analyses of Study One indicated that there were no significant differences in both immediate and delayed retention test scores across the three captioning condition. Similarly, in Study Two, there were no significant differences in retention tests scores across the four captioning and repetition conditions. Findings: Neither the availability of captions nor the repetition types had any impact on the Chinese students' immediate or delayed content knowledge retention, which lent support to existing studies. Based on the research results, the limitations and future study possibilities are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: The integration of SMART notebook software was one of the modifications to the teaching and learning environment since the post-coronavirus. Despite the extent of literature about the importance of this software to teaching and learning, there have been conflicting views and an overall lack of intervention in the Gambia regarding its importance in chemistry teaching and learning. Nevertheless, studies conducted about the impact of this software in the Gambia traditionally focused on evaluating regional examination results, where conceptual understanding of qualitative determination and quantitative study of acid-base reactions in the secondary school curriculum are continuous challenging for students. Further, these bodies of evaluation could not present support for the software on chemistry teaching, moreover, on the three domains namely recall, knowledge and application. On this basis, the purpose of the study was to investigate how interactive classrooms could support students’ learning the topics. Through quasi-experimental design and systematic random sampling technique, 314 students were selected and split into two independent groups, the treatment, and the control. The treatment group were taught using interactive learning objects in SMART notebook in conjunction with laboratory experimentation, while the control group mainly conventional teaching methods, including laboratory experimentations. After 24 days of parallel interventions, a non-parametric (Mann-Whitney U test mean rank) statistical test was conducted at a .05 level of significance. The results revealed that students in the treatment group had better knowledge retention and application than their peers in the control group as indicated by a significant difference (p=.001). These results align with the experimental literature and were particularly effective for developing alternate strategies for educating secondary students in chemistry class.

The Effect of Athletic Discipline and Nutrition Support Experience on Nutrition Knowledge Proficiency among College students in Physical Education

Author: Okumura, Tadahiro11 Nihon University Graduate School (Japan)

Publication info: Okumura, Tadahiro. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/effect-athletic-discipline-nutrition-support/docview/2863921029/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Knowledge of "sports nutrition" is essential for improving athletic performance. However, although lectures on nutrition are given in many settings, there is a paucity of instruction tailored to the unique characteristics of each sport's competition, and little research has been conducted on the educational effectiveness of such instruction. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and relationships of a test of basic sports nutrition knowledge and a questionnaire on previous sports nutrition support experience and specialized athletic events on the level of proficiency in nutrition knowledge among college students in physical education who are engaged in sports activities. Methods: A total of 152 participants, eighty-eight college students specializing in team sports (e.g., ball sports events) and 64 college students specializing in individual sports (e.g., martial arts, swimming, athletics), were surveyed using two types of tests and questionnaires. The test consisted of 50 questions regarding basic knowledge of sports nutrition. The questionnaire surveyed the subject's profile, athletic life, and support experience in sports nutrition. IBM SPSS (Version 27.0 IBM) was used for statistical analysis with a significance level of 5%. Results: An analysis of variance was performed on the test scores, with "sports category" and "experience with nutrition lectures prior to college" as the two factors. Since significant interactions were found, simple main effects of each factor were examined. The results of the simple main effect test showed that among college students who "had experience with nutrition lectures before entering college," those who specialized in individual sports showed significantly higher values than those who specialized in team sports. The results were also significantly higher for college students specializing in team sports who reported "no" experience with nutritional lectures than those who reported "yes" experience. Conclusions: Regarding college students who had experience supporting sports nutrition, it was thought that they who specialized in individual sports were more likely to retain their knowledge than those who specialized in team sports. However, for college students who specialized in team sports, lecture experience may not necessarily lead to future knowledge retention.

Abstract: Making the simulated patient die is one of the controversial decisions in healthcare simulation. Some experts believe that we should never make the manikin die as they believe the facilitator is deceiving the learners, whereas other groups of experts believe that there are advantages in making the simulated patient die as it provides a valuable learning experience to the learners, and it is as close to reality as possible. Hence, we undertook this review to know whether simulated patient mortality benefits the learners. A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, Scopus, PubMed Central, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar. Randomized controlled trials assessing the learner's stress and knowledge retention when the simulated patient dies were eligible for inclusion. Comparative intervention effect estimates obtained from meta-analyses were represented as pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% CI. Six studies with 384 participants (learners) were eligible for the analysis. All the studies had some concerns when the risk of bias was assessed. In the simulated patient mortality group, the learners experienced higher stress as assessed compared to the group where the simulated patient survives. The two groups' pooled mean difference for anxiety and stress levels was 0.63 (0.17-1.09). Three out of five studies showed improved knowledge retention in the simulated mortality group, one showed no difference, and one showed decreased knowledge retention in the simulated mortality group. The stress response of learners when exposed to simulated mortality during a simulation session is higher than the simulated survival group. However, this increased stress response is processed by the students differently. Some students will thrive when increased stress is presented to them, while some students perceive it negatively. Thus, this increased stress response can lead to knowledge retention if the timing of the stress response happens mainly during debriefing for select students. The role of the facilitator is also important as skilled debriefers will be able to use this increased stress to their advantage to increase knowledge retention. Thus, simulated mortality can be used as an effective stressor for increasing knowledge retention during the debriefing phase for select students by a skilled debriefer. This study would aid the simulation policymakers, simulation faculties, and simulation researchers in the impact of simulated patient death and learners' stress response. If the simulation scenario is designed well with robust pre-briefing, this increased stress response can enhance learning and knowledge retention during debriefing.Making the simulated patient die is one of the controversial decisions in healthcare simulation.

Abstract: Background and objectives: Globally, Food Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDGs) are an important tool for promoting healthy food consumption habits. In addition, diverse food systems actors can use FBDGs to inform actions supportive to attaining healthy diets from sustainable food systems. However, in Africa, only 9 of the 55 countries currently have FBDGs, the latest being Ethiopia and Zambia that launched their guidelines in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Both Ethiopian and Zambian FBDGs aspire to promote the use of traditional and indigenous foods (TIFs) to improve not just nutrient intake but also resilience in an ever-complex climate change context. Furthermore, the Africa Common Position on the United Nations Food System Summit (UNFSS) identified TIFs as an area requiring much investment for TIFs to play their potential role in improving food consumption habits, nutrient intake, and resilience of African food systems for better food security, as the climate changes. Nevertheless, incorporation of TIFs into FBDGs presents a number of significant challenges. The objective was to identify the opportunities and challenges that must be addressed, so that as more African countries embark on developing FBDGs, the incorporation of TIFs can be facilitated so that the potential of TIFs in African food systems and diets can be realized. Method: The paper uses evidence from a scoping review of literature and the existing FBDGs on the African continent, and outcomes of three independent dialogues of the UNFSS process to identify and describe the opportunities and challenges that limit the incorporation of TIFs in FBDGs towards making recommendations on what needs to be done by different food systems actors. Results: The challenges identified include limited data on food composition, loss of knowledge on TIFs among the younger components of the population and in urban settings, poor market development, a dietary transition that is leading to the undervaluing of TIFs, and lack of attention and investment from the food and agriculture sector on promoting production as part of agricultural production diversification and value chain development. There are clear opportunities for TIFs to have a positive impact on both nutrient intakes and resilience of African food systems in the changing climate. Conclusions: There is a deficiency regarding efforts to position TIFs for use in context relevant FBDGs in Africa. For FBDGs to support and promote a shift towards healthier consumption habits and food security resilience, TIF's must be leveraged in efforts of all food systems actors. This would contribute to promoting positive transition to healthier more sustainable diets. In so doing, this would support efforts of the UNFSS 2021 that many African countries are still actively engaged in to promote positive food systems transformation that can deliver better diets and better nutrition and health outcomes.

Abstract: Specifications grading is a relatively recent approach to assessing student learning. In this approach, students make progress toward completion of a course by demonstrating mastery of specific skills or material. The assessment tools are short, frequent exercises that can be attempted multiple times until mastered. This contrasts with the traditional, exam-based assessment of student learning. There are multiple benefits to the specifications grading-based strategy, including reduced test anxiety, better knowledge retention, and increased flexibility. In this study, specifications grading was implemented into an upper-level biochemistry course at a private, liberal arts university. The student cohort consisted almost exclusively of junior and senior biochemistry, biology, and chemistry majors. Students earned points for demonstrating mastery on each of 12 short quizzes in addition to points earned from laboratory exercises and on the cumulative final exam. Student attitudes were assessed using three surveys that were administered at the beginning, middle, and end of the course. The survey results indicated that the students had overall favorable opinions of the specifications grading approach and its use in this course. A comparison of student performance on the quizzes to their performance on the final exam showed that the students learned and retained the course material. Combining the survey and performance data, we demonstrated that the students' perceptions of their learning correlated well with their performances on the specifications grading tools. Together, these results indicated that specifications grading is an effective approach to assessing student learning and to maintaining student enthusiasm in an upper-level biochemistry course.Specifications grading is a relatively recent approach to assessing student learning.

Abstract: Background Nursing students encounter various terms and concepts during their undergraduate education. Repeating and reinforcing these terms and concepts is challenging. Active learning strategies are recommended to enhance students' effectiveness, productivity and interest in the learning process in undergraduate education. Aim This study aims to investigate the effect of crossword puzzles on nursing students' learning success and knowledge retention of the concepts related to the pain management course. Design The study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial. Settings The study was conducted in the nursing department of a state university in the southern region of Turkey. Participants The study involved 72 s-year nursing students who were enrolled in the Pain Management course. Methods Data were collected using a "Personal Information Form" and three different "Pain Management Knowledge Tests." While the control group received only the standard lecture technique as a traditional method, the experimental group was exposed to crossword puzzles as an active learning method for three lesson hours following the standard lecture technique. Research data were collected between November and December 2022 in the classroom. Descriptive statistics, the Independent Samples t-test, Repeated Measures ANOVA test and Pearson's chi-squared test were employed for data analysis. Results There was no significant difference between the pre-test and first post-test mean scores of both groups (p ˃ 0.05). However, the second post-test scores of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group (p < 0.05). Conclusion The use of crossword puzzles positively affected nursing students' knowledge levels regarding concepts related to the pain management course. Clinical Trials Registry NCT05424770

Abstract: Nursing students encounter various terms and concepts during their undergraduate education. Repeating and reinforcing these terms and concepts is challenging. Active learning strategies are recommended to enhance students' effectiveness, productivity and interest in the learning process in undergraduate education. BACKGROUND Nursing students encounter various terms and concepts during their undergraduate education. Repeating and reinforcing these terms and concepts is challenging. Active learning strategies are recommended to enhance students' effectiveness, productivity and interest in the learning process in undergraduate education.This study aims to investigate the effect of crossword puzzles on nursing students' learning success and knowledge retention of the concepts related to the pain management course. AIM This study aims to investigate the effect of crossword puzzles on nursing students' learning success and knowledge retention of the concepts related to the pain management course.The study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial. DESIGN The study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial.The study was conducted in the nursing department of a state university in the southern region of Turkey. SETTINGS The study was conducted in the nursing department of a state university in the southern region of Turkey.The study involved 72 s-year nursing students who were enrolled in the Pain Management course. PARTICIPANTS The study involved 72 s-year nursing students who were enrolled in the Pain Management course.Data were collected using a "Personal Information Form" and three different "Pain Management Knowledge Tests." While the control group received only the standard lecture technique as a traditional method, the experimental group was exposed to crossword puzzles as an active learning method for three lesson hours following the standard lecture technique. Research data were collected between November and December 2022 in the classroom. Descriptive statistics, the Independent Samples t-test, Repeated Measures ANOVA test and Pearson's chi-squared test were employed for data analysis. METHODS Data were collected using a "Personal Information Form" and three different "Pain Management Knowledge Tests." While the control group received only the standard lecture technique as a traditional method, the experimental group was exposed to crossword puzzles as an active learning method for three lesson hours following the standard lecture technique. Research data were collected between November and December 2022 in the classroom. Descriptive statistics, the Independent Samples t-test, Repeated Measures ANOVA test and Pearson's chi-squared test were employed for data analysis.There was no significant difference between the pre-test and first post-test mean scores of both groups (p ˃ 0.05). However, the second post-test scores of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group (p < 0.05). RESULTS There was no significant difference between the pre-test and first post-test mean scores of both groups (p ˃ 0.05). However, the second post-test scores of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group (p < 0.05).The use of crossword puzzles positively affected nursing students' knowledge levels regarding concepts related to the pain management course.

Abstract: The field of language education has experienced a rise in using virtual reality (VR) to support interactive, contextualized, and collaborative language learning in recent years. The current study investigates the effects of auditory, visual, and textual input on speaking and writing in English for Tourism Purposes (ETP) through immersive, scenery-based virtual reality (SBVR) dyadic learning. Adopting a framework on ETP sociocultural, linguistic, and formulaic competence, the researchers designed relevant learning content using audios, images, and verbatim onscreen text on EduVenture VR to create an interactive, simulated tour. Thirty-eight English as a foreign language undergraduates participated in this single-group quasi-experiment. Various data sources included speaking and writing pre-, post- and delayed post-tests, a post-intervention survey, and reflections about the VR learning experience. The study reported significant speaking gains in language accuracy, destination promotion, knowledge retention, and replication of ETP language, as well as significant writing improvement in using sophisticated vocabulary, knowledge retention, and replication of ETP language. The study concludes that SBVR warrants positive impact on improving productive ETP skills. Possible factors, limitations, and pedagogical implications for using scenery-based VR in dyadic learning for ETP are discussed. Finally, the study suggests future research directions to combine technology-enhanced language learning theories with multimodal input and material design supported by immersive VR to enhance language production for specific purposes.

Captioning and repetition for Chinese students' immediate and delayed retention of English‐speaking multimedia lessons

Author: Liu, Yinan1    1 Department of English Studies, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, Shandong, China

Publication info: Liu, Yinan. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/captioning-repetition-chinese-students-immediate/docview/2836617787/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Background Studies Captioning and repetition are widely used multimedia instructional devices for non‐native students. Generally, studies in this area have tended to focus on second language literacy skills rather than on learning new content knowledge. Additionally, posttests were administered immediately after the treatments, while the delayed influences of captioning and repetition have never been investigated. Objectives This paper addressed these research gaps in two separate studies. More specifically, this study attempted to examine the influences of captioning and repetition on non‐native students' immediate and relayed retention. Methods In Study One, three captioning conditions; word‐by‐word captions, closed captions, and no‐captions; were compared to examine their efficacies in immediate and delayed content knowledge retention on 82 Chinese university students. To address the limitations in Study One as the multimedia lesson was short and played only once, Study Two incorporated captioning and two repetition types in its design. One hundred and eleven Chinese university students watch a video lesson in one of four captioning and repetition conditions. Results The statistical analyses of Study One indicated that there were no significant differences in both immediate and delayed retention test scores across the three captioning condition. Similarly, in Study Two, there were no significant differences in retention tests scores across the four captioning and repetition conditions. Findings Neither the availability of captions nor the repetition types had any impact on the Chinese students' immediate or delayed content knowledge retention, which lent support to existing studies. Based on the research results, the limitations and future study possibilities are discussed. Alternate abstract: Lay Description What Is Already Known About This Topic Empirical studies on captioning have focused on immediate learning right after the treatment, so have studies on repetition. Empirical studies on multimedia lessons for non‐native students have focused on English language learning. What This Paper Adds Three types of captioning were compared to examine their efficacies in both immediate and delayed content retention of Chinese students. Two types of repetition were compared to examine their efficacies in both immediate and delayed content retention of Chinese students. Implications for Practice and/or Policy: Neither the availability of captions nor the repetition types had any impact on the Chinese students' immediate or delayed content knowledge retention. The availability of textual keywords adjacent to their corresponding graphics might have compromised the efficacy of captioning.

Abstract: Objectives To assess knowledge retention after video‐based hearing health education and measure headphone listening behavior change using a novel smartphone application. Methods In this prospective longitudinal study, students participated in video‐based hearing health education and hearing screening sessions. Hearing health knowledge was assessed in students and parents after 6 weeks. A novel smartphone application was created to measure daily noise exposure based on volume settings with headphone use and to display the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) noise doses with alerts for cumulative daily doses nearing the maximum. Results Seventy‐six teenage students and parents participated. Eighty three percent of participants identified as a racial or ethnic minority and 66% were of low‐income socioeconomic status. Hearing health knowledge was retained in students 6 weeks after education and parents’ knowledge improved from baseline. The smartphone app was installed on 12 student phones, and 25% of days monitored exhibited noise doses that exceeded the NIOSH maximum. App use for at least 10 days by nine students showed a significant reduction in average daily noise dose and time spent at the highest volume settings during the second‐half of app use. Conclusions Video‐based hearing health education with knowledge question reinforcement was associated with knowledge retention in students and improved parental attitudes and knowledge about hearing conservation. A smartphone app with a real‐time display of headphone cumulative noise exposure dose identified at‐risk students. The integration of hearing health education, hearing screening, and digital health tools has promised to promote positive behavior changes for long‐term hearing conservation.

Abstract: To determine if learning histology by drawing is superior to learning by looking through a microscope only. Objectives To determine if learning histology by drawing is superior to learning by looking through a microscope only.Second year MBBS students were divided by simple random sampling into Groups A and B. Each group comprised 50 students. This mixed-methods study was conducted in an 8-week module. For the first 4 weeks, students in Group A learned histology by drawing, whereas Group B learned by seeing the text and microscopic images. For the last 4 weeks, groups were swapped by crossover design. The impact of learning by drawing was assessed by multiple choice question (MCQ) test I and test II at the end of 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Statistical analyses of the data were conducted with SPSS version 23. The scores obtained in test I and test II were analyzed by the independent samples t -test. The paired samples t -test was applied to scores obtained by the same subject when they learned with drawing and no drawing strategies. To assess the impact of drawing on learning histology, a focus group study was conducted in six participants selected by purposive sampling. Responses to the semi-structured interview questions were analyzed by qualitative research techniques of coding, categorizing, and generation of themes. Methods Second year MBBS students were divided by simple random sampling into Groups A and B. Each group comprised 50 students. This mixed-methods study was conducted in an 8-week module. For the first 4 weeks, students in Group A learned histology by drawing, whereas Group B learned by seeing the text and microscopic images. For the last 4 weeks, groups were swapped by crossover design. The impact of learning by drawing was assessed by multiple choice question (MCQ) test I and test II at the end of 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Statistical analyses of the data were conducted with SPSS version 23. The scores obtained in test I and test II were analyzed by the independent samples t-test. The paired samples t-test was applied to scores obtained by the same subject when they learned with drawing and no drawing strategies. To assess the impact of drawing on learning histology, a focus group study was conducted in six participants selected by purposive sampling. Responses to the semi-structured interview questions were analyzed by qualitative research techniques of coding, categorizing, and generation of themes.The independent samples t -test showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the mean scores obtained by Groups A and B in test I and test II. However, there was a statistically significant difference when the subject learned histology by drawing compared to no drawing, as shown by the paired samples t -test. The results from the focus group study revealed that drawing had a positive impact on knowledge retention and understanding the basic concepts of histology for its application in the clinical context.

Abstract: This quality improvement (QI) project developed and implemented a hybrid training program, that included online modules and hands-on training for experienced certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) to increase confidence, knowledge, and competency with ultrasound-guided vascular access (USGVA). PURPOSE This quality improvement (QI) project developed and implemented a hybrid training program, that included online modules and hands-on training for experienced certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) to increase confidence, knowledge, and competency with ultrasound-guided vascular access (USGVA).This QI project used a pre-post design. Seventeen volunteer CRNAs participated in USGVA training and education, and a 90-day follow-up assessment was performed. DESIGN This QI project used a pre-post design. Seventeen volunteer CRNAs participated in USGVA training and education, and a 90-day follow-up assessment was performed.The Revised Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE 2.0) guidelines were used as a framework to assess confidence, knowledge, and hands-on competency of 17 CRNAs who regularly place vascular access devices using USGVA in patients with difficult vascular access at a single facility. These assessments were measured at: (1) baseline, (2) immediately after attending a hybrid training educational program, and (3) 90 days after implementation into clinical practice. Additionally, the number of vascular access attempts required for successful placement of peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheters, arterial catheters, and central venous catheters (CVC) with ultrasound assistance over a 90-day period was reviewed. METHODS The Revised Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE 2.0) guidelines were used as a framework to assess confidence, knowledge, and hands-on competency of 17 CRNAs who regularly place vascular access devices using USGVA in patients with difficult vascular access at a single facility. These assessments were measured at: (1) baseline, (2) immediately after attending a hybrid training educational program, and (3) 90 days after implementation into clinical practice. Additionally, the number of vascular access attempts required for successful placement of peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheters, arterial catheters, and central venous catheters (CVC) with ultrasound assistance over a 90-day period was reviewed.Certified registered nurse anesthetists' median confidence score increased significantly from pre- to posteducation (P = .009). The confidence reported from post- to 90 days posteducation improved, however it did not reach statistical significance (P = .812). The knowledge scores from pre- to posteducation indicated significant improvement (P <. 001), as well as from pre- to 90 days posteducation (P = .03). However, knowledge scores from post- to 90 days posteducation revealed a statistically significant decline (P = .004). The overall median score for hands-on USGVA competency declined from post- to 90 days posteducation (P = .109). The number of successful USGVA placements increased from 50% to 80% within a 90-day period. FINDINGS Certified registered nurse anesthetists' median confidence score increased significantly from pre- to posteducation (P = .009). The confidence reported from post- to 90 days posteducation improved, however it did not reach statistical significance (P = .812).

The overall median score for hands-on USGVA competency declined from post- to 90 days posteducation (P = .109). The number of successful USGVA placements increased from 50% to 80% within a 90-day period.The implementation of a USGVA hybrid training and education program improved overall provider confidence, knowledge, and competency. While confidence remained high in the 90-day follow-up, knowledge retention declined. Despite a decline in knowledge retention over time, results showed a significant improvement when compared to baseline scores. Although a decline in hands-on USGVA competency was seen at 90 days posteducation, it was not statistically significant. The percentage of overall successful USGVA placements in clinical practice increased following implementation. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of a USGVA hybrid training and education program improved overall provider confidence, knowledge, and competency. While confidence remained high in the 90-day follow-up, knowledge retention declined. Despite a decline in knowledge retention over time, results showed a significant improvement when compared to baseline scores. Although a decline in hands-on USGVA competency was seen at 90 days posteducation, it was not statistically significant.

Abstract: The purpose of this project was to improve the consistency of verbal and written discharge instructions for women of childbearing age (13-55 years) taking hormonal contraceptives who receive aprepitant perioperatively, to address the need to use a secondary form of birth control for 28 days, as well as to increase the knowledge and confidence of Registered Nurses when providing discharge instructions. PURPOSE The purpose of this project was to improve the consistency of verbal and written discharge instructions for women of childbearing age (13-55 years) taking hormonal contraceptives who receive aprepitant perioperatively, to address the need to use a secondary form of birth control for 28 days, as well as to increase the knowledge and confidence of Registered Nurses when providing discharge instructions.This quality improvement project used a pre-/postdesign to evaluate two separate groups of patients and registered nurses. DESIGN This quality improvement project used a pre-/postdesign to evaluate two separate groups of patients and registered nurses.The patient sample consisted of 30 total women of childbearing age who received aprepitant during the perioperative period (15 pre and 15 post). The PACU nurse sample included 15 ambulatory surgery center nurses and 58 main hospital nurses for a combined sample of 73 PACU nurses. The PACU nurses were provided with educational in-service regarding information about aprepitant and its drug interactions. PACU nurses were additionally instructed to provide patient discharge instructions using both a written and verbal format. Patients were called postoperatively before and after both the written after visit summary (AVS) changes and the PACU nurse in-services, PACU nurses were evaluated on their knowledge, confidence, and frequency of discharge teaching before and after their educational in-service. The PACU nurses were surveyed 90 days after the intervention to assess their long-term knowledge retention. METHODS The patient sample consisted of 30 total women of childbearing age who received aprepitant during the perioperative period (15 pre and 15 post).

The PACU nurses were surveyed 90 days after the intervention to assess their long-term knowledge retention.There was a significant increase in nurse knowledge about aprepitant from preimplementation to postimplementation (61.39% vs 81.95%, P < .001). Nursing knowledge showed a nonsignificant decline at 90-days postimplementation (81.95% vs 73.68%, P = .096) although remained significantly higher than preimplementation scores (73.68% vs 61.39%, P = .003). There was an overall 33.3% increase in the percentage of patients who were able to recall receiving aprepitant and the need to use a secondary form of birth control when comparing the preintervention group to the postintervention group (26.7% vs 60%, P = .123). FINDINGS There was a significant increase in nurse knowledge about aprepitant from preimplementation to postimplementation (61.39% vs 81.95%, P < .001). Nursing knowledge showed a nonsignificant decline at 90-days postimplementation (81.95% vs 73.68%, P = .096) although remained significantly higher than preimplementation scores (73.68% vs 61.39%, P = .003).

This increase in nursing knowledge and confidence, along with improved written discharge instructions, may have led to improved patient comprehension of aprepitant discharge education. Additionally, there was an increase in the percentage of patients who were able to recall the need to use a secondary form birth control for 28 days, to reduce the likelihood of an unintentional pregnancy.

Abstract: Poor eye-health knowledge and health literacy are pervasive, contributing to worse outcomes. This study aims to examine short- and long-term eye-health knowledge retention following eye-health education interventions in adults. PURPOSE Poor eye-health knowledge and health literacy are pervasive, contributing to worse outcomes. This study aims to examine short- and long-term eye-health knowledge retention following eye-health education interventions in adults.Vision Detroit was an outreach vision screening program that integrated a 5-Point Teaching Intervention (5PTI), at a Southwest Community Center (SW-CC) from 2015-2017. The 5PTI consists of eye-health learning points developed to verbally educate patients. During vision screenings, eye-health knowledge tests were administered before and after 5PTI (Test 1 and Test 2, respectively). In 2016, Community Eye-Health Education Interventions (CHEI) were initiated at the SW-CC. During CHEI, bilingual healthcare students taught voluntary SW-CC members the 5PTI learning points, regardless of participant interest to attend future screenings. CHEI sessions occurred on separate dates prior to vision screening events. Test 1 and Test 2 scores were compared for all participants. Test 1 scores were compared for those who underwent CHEI prior to vision screening (CHEI positive) versus those who did not (CHEI negative).

Test 1 scores were compared for those who underwent CHEI prior to vision screening (CHEI positive) versus those who did not (CHEI negative).Two-hundred-seventeen adult patients met inclusion criteria, with 75.8% women, 82.6% Hispanic, mean age 50.4 ± 16.2 years, 74.6% had high school or less education, and 49.2% had health insurance. Test 1 to Test 2 scores improved after 5PTI (71.2 ± 26.4% vs. 97.2 ± 9.9%, p < .00001). Forty-eight participants attended CHEI and subsequent vision screening. Test 1 scores were higher among those CHEI positive versus CHEI negative (81.1 ± 2.1% vs. 68.3 ± 3.4%, p = .0027). RESULTS Two-hundred-seventeen adult patients met inclusion criteria, with 75.8% women, 82.6% Hispanic, mean age 50.4 ± 16.2 years, 74.6% had high school or less education, and 49.2% had health insurance.

Abstract: To assess knowledge retention after video-based hearing health education and measure headphone listening behavior change using a novel smartphone application. OBJECTIVES To assess knowledge retention after video-based hearing health education and measure headphone listening behavior change using a novel smartphone application.In this prospective longitudinal study, students participated in video-based hearing health education and hearing screening sessions. Hearing health knowledge was assessed in students and parents after 6 weeks. A novel smartphone application was created to measure daily noise exposure based on volume settings with headphone use and to display the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) noise doses with alerts for cumulative daily doses nearing the maximum. METHODS In this prospective longitudinal study, students participated in video-based hearing health education and hearing screening sessions. Hearing health knowledge was assessed in students and parents after 6 weeks. A novel smartphone application was created to measure daily noise exposure based on volume settings with headphone use and to display the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) noise doses with alerts for cumulative daily doses nearing the maximum.Seventy-six teenage students and parents participated. Eighty three percent of participants identified as a racial or ethnic minority and 66% were of low-income socioeconomic status. Hearing health knowledge was retained in students 6 weeks after education and parents' knowledge improved from baseline. The smartphone app was installed on 12 student phones, and 25% of days monitored exhibited noise doses that exceeded the NIOSH maximum. App use for at least 10 days by nine students showed a significant reduction in average daily noise dose and time spent at the highest volume settings during the second-half of app use. RESULTS Seventy-six teenage students and parents participated. Eighty three percent of participants identified as a racial or ethnic minority and 66% were of low-income socioeconomic status. Hearing health knowledge was retained in students 6 weeks after education and parents' knowledge improved from baseline. The smartphone app was installed on 12 student phones, and 25% of days monitored exhibited noise doses that exceeded the NIOSH maximum. App use for at least 10 days by nine students showed a significant reduction in average daily noise dose and time spent at the highest volume settings during the second-half of app use.Video-based hearing health education with knowledge question reinforcement was associated with knowledge retention in students and improved parental attitudes and knowledge about hearing conservation. A smartphone app with a real-time display of headphone cumulative noise exposure dose identified at-risk students. The integration of hearing health education, hearing screening, and digital health tools has promised to promote positive behavior changes for long-term hearing conservation. CONCLUSIONS Video-based hearing health education with knowledge question reinforcement was associated with knowledge retention in students and improved parental attitudes and knowledge about hearing conservation. A smartphone app with a real-time display of headphone cumulative noise exposure dose identified at-risk students. The integration of hearing health education, hearing screening, and digital health tools has promised to promote positive behavior changes for long-term hearing conservation.4 Laryngoscope, 133:2007-2013, 2023.

Abstract: The field of language education has experienced a rise in using virtual reality (VR) to support interactive, contextualized, and collaborative language learning in recent years. The current study investigates the effects of auditory, visual, and textual input on speaking and writing in English for Tourism Purposes (ETP) through immersive, scenery-based virtual reality (SBVR) dyadic learning. Adopting a framework on ETP sociocultural, linguistic, and formulaic competence, the researchers designed relevant learning content using audios, images, and verbatim onscreen text on EduVenture VR to create an interactive, simulated tour. Thirty-eight English as a foreign language undergraduates participated in this single-group quasi-experiment. Various data sources included speaking and writing pre-, post- and delayed post-tests, a post-intervention survey, and reflections about the VR learning experience. The study reported significant speaking gains in language accuracy, destination promotion, knowledge retention, and replication of ETP language, as well as significant writing improvement in using sophisticated vocabulary, knowledge retention, and replication of ETP language. The study concludes that SBVR warrants positive impact on improving productive ETP skills. Possible factors, limitations, and pedagogical implications for using scenery-based VR in dyadic learning for ETP are discussed. Finally, the study suggests future research directions to combine technology-enhanced language learning theories with multimodal input and material design supported by immersive VR to enhance language production for specific purposes.

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple nodes to perform local computations and collaborate to complete machine learning tasks without centralizing private data of nodes. However, the frequent model gradients upload/download operations required by the framework result in high communication costs, which have become the main bottleneck for federated learning as deep models scale up, hindering its performance. In this paper, we propose a two-layer accumulated quantized compression algorithm (TLAQC) that effectively reduces the communication cost of federated learning. TLAQC achieves this by reducing both the cost of individual communication and the number of global communication rounds. TLAQC introduces a revised quantization method called RQSGD, which employs zero-value correction to mitigate ineffective quantization phenomena and minimize average quantization errors. Additionally, TLAQC reduces the frequency of gradient information uploads through an adaptive threshold and parameter self-inspection mechanism, further reducing communication costs. It also accumulates quantization errors and retained weight deltas to compensate for gradient knowledge loss. Through quantization correction and two-layer accumulation, TLAQC significantly reduces precision loss caused by communication compression. Experimental results demonstrate that RQSGD achieves an incidence of ineffective quantization as low as 0.003% and reduces the average quantization error to 1.6 × [Formula: see text]. Compared to full-precision FedAVG, TLAQC compresses uploaded traffic to only 6.73% while increasing accuracy by 1.25%.Federated learning enables multiple nodes to perform local computations and collaborate to complete machine learning tasks without centralizing private data of nodes.

Abstract: ENG English ENG To quantify the extent of proper local child restraint system (CRS) use and to better understand changes to the level of self-reported confidence with increased CRS installations. With the goal being to improve safety for children travelling in personal vehicles across London, ON and the region. Public CRS clinics were initiated by Injury Prevention staff after they obtained the Child Passenger Safety Technician certification. Additionally, an online survey was commissioned targeting Ontario parents who had installed at least one CRS in the last five years. From September 2018 to September 2019, 96 comprehensive CRS checks were performed, with 29% of systems found to be installed correctly. Survey results showed a high level of reported confidence with CRS installation (N = 514, 70% female, 43% one child). Parents who had installed only one CRS reported higher confidence in their first install, compared to parents who had installed two or more systems. The error rate with CRS installation and use seen in London, Ontario and the region, is similar to that reported in previous research. Survey results showed high levels of self-reported confidence in CRS use, especially for parents who have installed only one CRS. There presents a need to better understand the root cause of the discrepancy between level of confidence and proper CRS use and to expand our understanding of CRS knowledge retention and transferability to subsequent systems.

Abstract: The mastery of clinical scholarship and analytic methods for evidence-based practice (EBP) is a published essential for nurse practitioner (NP) education; however, retention of EBP-related knowledge during NP education remains unknown. We assessed EBP knowledge during a first-semester research course and again during the last semester using an item response model. We found that changes depended on the exam item, with performance dropping on a third of the items. Our findings suggest a need to integrate EBP concepts across curricula (e.g., feedback loops in courses other than the research course) to retain these essential skills.

Abstract: While the innovativeness of the flipped classroom (FC) approach promotes active participation and higher‐order thinking among students, there are concerns about its effectiveness in terms of knowledge retention. Currently, there are no studies involving medical school biochemistry that evaluate this aspect of effectiveness. Thus, we conducted a historical control study that analyzed observational data from two freshman batches of the Doctor of Medicine program in our institution. Class 2021 ( n  = 250) served as the traditional lecture (TL) group while Class 2022 ( n  = 264) served as the FC group. Data on relevant observed covariates (age, sex, National Medical Admission Test or NMAT score, undergraduate degree) and the outcome variable (carbohydrate metabolism course unit examination percentage scores, as indicator of knowledge retention) were included in the analysis. Propensity scores were calculated using logit regression conditional on these observed covariates. Afterwards, 1:1 nearest‐neighbor propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to produce an estimated average treatment effect (ATE) measure afforded by FC (as adjusted mean difference in examination scores between the two batches), balancing on the covariates. Nearest‐neighbor matching using the calculated propensity scores effectively balanced the two groups (standardized bias <10%), producing 250 matched student‐pairs that received either TL or FC. Following PSM, the FC group was found to have a significantly higher adjusted mean examination score compared to the TL group (adjusted mean difference = 5.62%, 95% CI: 2.54%, 8.72%; p  < 0.001). Using this approach, we were able to demonstrate benefit of FC over TL in terms of knowledge retention, as reflected by the estimated ATE.

Abstract: To quantify the extent of proper local child restraint system (CRS) use and to better understand changes to the level of self-reported confidence with increased CRS installations. With the goal being to improve safety for children travelling in personal vehicles across London, ON and the region. Objective To quantify the extent of proper local child restraint system (CRS) use and to better understand changes to the level of self-reported confidence with increased CRS installations. With the goal being to improve safety for children travelling in personal vehicles across London, ON and the region.Public CRS clinics were initiated by Injury Prevention staff after they obtained the Child Passenger Safety Technician certification. Additionally, an online survey was commissioned targeting Ontario parents who had installed at least one CRS in the last five years. Methods Public CRS clinics were initiated by Injury Prevention staff after they obtained the Child Passenger Safety Technician certification. Additionally, an online survey was commissioned targeting Ontario parents who had installed at least one CRS in the last five years.From September 2018 to September 2019, 96 comprehensive CRS checks were performed, with 29% of systems found to be installed correctly. Survey results showed a high level of reported confidence with CRS installation (N = 514, 70% female, 43% one child). Parents who had installed only one CRS reported higher confidence in their first install, compared to parents who had installed two or more systems. Results From September 2018 to September 2019, 96 comprehensive CRS checks were performed, with 29% of systems found to be installed correctly. Survey results showed a high level of reported confidence with CRS installation (N = 514, 70% female, 43% one child). Parents who had installed only one CRS reported higher confidence in their first install, compared to parents who had installed two or more systems.The error rate with CRS installation and use seen in London, Ontario and the region, is similar to that reported in previous research. Survey results showed high levels of self-reported confidence in CRS use, especially for parents who have installed only one CRS. There presents a need to better understand the root cause of the discrepancy between level of confidence and proper CRS use and to expand our understanding of CRS knowledge retention and transferability to subsequent systems. Conclusions The error rate with CRS installation and use seen in London, Ontario and the region, is similar to that reported in previous research. Survey results showed high levels of self-reported confidence in CRS use, especially for parents who have installed only one CRS. There presents a need to better understand the root cause of the discrepancy between level of confidence and proper CRS use and to expand our understanding of CRS knowledge retention and transferability to subsequent systems.

Abstract: Using the conceptual knowledge dimension of Bloom's taxonomy of education objectives in the development of this learning activity, a flipped-classroom approach was used for second-semester undergraduate baccalaureate students in an attempt to bridge the gap between classroom and clinical settings (Phillips, 2020). Evidence has shown that musical formats promote information recall in learning new material (Werner, 2018). [...]the question was asked, “Can song promote knowledge retention regarding safe medication administration, as well as pertinent information regarding patient monitoring and education?” Prior to traditional classroom teaching, students were required to review the prepared PowerPoint® lectures and assigned reading materials regarding neurologic medications. Quantitative and qualitative data collection and analyses may support the use of this teaching strategy to fully recognize its effects on knowledge retention.

Abstract: Knowledge management is critical for universities and research institutes to improve their operations and activities. The study aimed to investigate knowledge management components in Iran University of Medical Sciences research centers from the faculty members' perspective. The sample size for the present study was generated using a simple random approach and Cochran's formula. The sample size was 245 out of 673 associate faculty members in affiliated research centers of the Iran University of Medical Sciences. The research instrument was the Fong and Choi knowledge management standard questionnaire. Following data collection, SPSS software version 23 was used to analyze the data using descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation tests. From the participant's perspective, the results indicated that the status of knowledge acquisition components was relatively good, with an average of 3.26, knowledge creation at 3.42, knowledge storage at 3.19, knowledge distribution at 3.13, knowledge application at 3.34, and knowledge retention at 3.24. According to respondents, there was an inverse statistical relationship between knowledge generation and application components and the research ranking of research centers and a direct statistical relationship between knowledge storage and retention (P-value 0.05). According to the findings, knowledge management components were applied effectively in research institutions affiliated with the Iran University of Medical Sciences. As a result, planning and strategies at research institutions and universities are required to raise this level to the desired level.

Abstract: Individuals’ conceptual knowledge of contemporary biological issues influences ethical attitudes and life decisions around health, as evidenced by the recent worldwide debate on vaccinations. The reasons for which the public opinion is so critically divided can be partially explained from the didactic approaches used in biology education. In view of the rapid evolution of Virtual Reality (VR) as well as the increasing interest that youths have shown toward Escape Rooms (ER), an unexplored research and development avenue is identified. In this experimental study, we present the design and development steps as well as the evaluation of a VRER dedicated to biology education. For comparison purposes, an educational instructional video utilising the storytelling technique was also prepared. Both approaches were examined in the upper secondary education context with participants ( N  = 50) emerging from the Applied Sciences academic path. The key-findings suggest that the active learning approach leads to increased knowledge acquisition, in the short term, as opposed to the passive learning approach but no significant differences were identified in the long term (knowledge retention) across the methods. Based on the instructional decisions made and the key-findings emerged we provide implications and guidelines for the design, development, and integration of VRER in education.

Abstract: Purpose Job market shifts, such as workforce mobility and aging societies, cause the exit of knowledgeable personnel from organizations. The ensuing knowledge loss (K-loss) has broad negative effects. This study analyzes the knowledge management literature on K-loss published from 2000 to 2021 and identifies fruitful directions for future research. Design/methodology/approach The authors conduct a systematic literature review of 74 peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2021. These articles were retrieved from ProQuest Central, Science Direct, EBSCOhost and Emerald databases. The analysis utilizes Jesson et al .’s (2011) six principles: field mapping, comprehensive search, quality assessment, data extraction, synthesis and write-up. Findings Three sub-topics emerge from the systematic literature review: K-loss drivers, positive and negative impacts of K-loss and mitigation strategies. Over half of the literature addresses mitigation strategies and provides solutions for K-loss already in progress, rather than proposing preventive measures. Research limitations/implications This study has limitations related to the time span covered. Moreover, it focuses on articles published in refereed journals. Therefore, important contributions from conference papers, books and professional reports were excluded. Originality/value This research comprehensively synthesizes the K-loss literature and proposes future avenues of research to address under-investigated areas and potentially lead to theoretical and empirical advancements in the field. This study also provides suggestions for improving managerial practices.

Abstract: Purpose This study reviews strategies organizational leaders and human resource practitioners can deploy to develop knowledge transfer and retention succession planning strategies for older employees to mitigate generational organizational knowledge loss prior to retirement. Design/methodology/approach This study used a questionnaire with 28 baby boomer employees and leaders of baby boomers at a large federal agency. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used. Questions asked participants about knowledge transfer, retention strategies and how challenges to counter baby boomer knowledge loss are addressed in the workplace. Findings Develop succession plans using standard operating procedures and job aids to reduce knowledge loss and enhance retention. Deploy hands-on training to share historical knowledge, enhance relationship building, mentoring programs, cross-training opportunities, retention incentives and document process improvement. The strategies are supported by organizational learning and knowledge management theories. Originality/value This study contributes to organizational leaders’ and human resource practitioners’ knowledge transfer and retention succession planning strategies to counter generational knowledge loss.

Abstract: While the innovativeness of the flipped classroom (FC) approach promotes active participation and higher-order thinking among students, there are concerns about its effectiveness in terms of knowledge retention. Currently, there are no studies involving medical school biochemistry that evaluate this aspect of effectiveness. Thus, we conducted a historical control study that analyzed observational data from two freshman batches of the Doctor of Medicine program in our institution. Class 2021 (n = 250) served as the traditional lecture (TL) group while Class 2022 (n = 264) served as the FC group. Data on relevant observed covariates (age, sex, National Medical Admission Test or NMAT score, undergraduate degree) and the outcome variable (carbohydrate metabolism course unit examination percentage scores, as indicator of knowledge retention) were included in the analysis. Propensity scores were calculated using logit regression conditional on these observed covariates. Afterwards, 1:1 nearest-neighbor propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to produce an estimated average treatment effect (ATE) measure afforded by FC (as adjusted mean difference in examination scores between the two batches), balancing on the covariates. Nearest-neighbor matching using the calculated propensity scores effectively balanced the two groups (standardized bias <10%), producing 250 matched student-pairs that received either TL or FC. Following PSM, the FC group was found to have a significantly higher adjusted mean examination score compared to the TL group (adjusted mean difference = 5.62%, 95% CI: 2.54%, 8.72%; p < 0.001). Using this approach, we were able to demonstrate benefit of FC over TL in terms of knowledge retention, as reflected by the estimated ATE.While the innovativeness of the flipped classroom (FC) approach promotes active participation and higher-order thinking among students, there are concerns about its effectiveness in terms of knowledge retention.

Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this Real Impact Viewpoint Article is to analyze the phenomenon of the Great Resignation from the knowledge management perspective. Design/methodology/approach It applies the knowledge-based view of the firm to the notion of the Great Resignation, reviews the extant literature and relies on secondary data. Findings The Great Resignation has created numerous knowledge-related impacts on the individual, organizational and national levels. On the individual level, because of an accelerating adoption of freelancing, the future may witness an expansion of the category of the knowledge worker and a growing need for personal knowledge management methods and information technologies. Organizational effects include knowledge loss, reduced business process efficiency, damaged intra-organizational knowledge flows, lower relational capital, lost informal friendship networks, difficulty attracting the best human capital, undermined knowledge transfer processes and knowledge leakage to competition. Countries may also witness the depletion of national human capital. Practical implications Managers should learn how to use the available human capital more efficiently; realize the importance of universal succession planning programs; automate knowledge-centric business processes; facilitate knowledge-based IT initiatives by implementing self-functioning virtual communities, including enterprise social networks; restructure organizations to optimize intra-organizational knowledge flows; adjust strategies, products and target markets based on the available human capital; and create telecommuting conditions for people with disabilities who cannot be physically present. Knowledge management scholars are presented with a unique opportunity to convert the numerous theoretical insights accumulated within the boundaries of their discipline into practical application to facilitate the Great Knowledge Revolution. Originality/value This viewpoint offers managerial recommendations and inspires future Great Resignation investigations.

Abstract: The mastery of clinical scholarship and analytic methods for evidence-based practice (EBP) is a published essential for nurse practitioner (NP) education; however, retention of EBP-related knowledge during NP education remains unknown. We assessed EBP knowledge during a first-semester research course and again during the last semester using an item response model. We found that changes depended on the exam item, with performance dropping on a third of the items. Our findings suggest a need to integrate EBP concepts across curricula (e.g., feedback loops in courses other than the research course) to retain these essential skills.

Abstract: Doctors have a legal requirement and duty of care to ensure patients are enabled to make an informed decision about their treatment, including discussion of the benefits, risks and alternatives to a procedure. A patient-centred approach to consent has been firmly established in Ireland, and fundamental to this is the ability to engage in a dialogue that offers comprehensible information to patients. Telemedicine has revolutionised the way we can deliver care to patients in the modern era of computers, tablets, and smartphones, and its use has been rapidly expanded. Novel digital strategies to improve the informed consent process for surgical procedures have been increasingly under investigation over the last 10-15 years and may offer a low cost, accessible and tailored solution to consent for surgical interventions. Within vascular surgery, superficial venous interventions have been associated with a high number medicolegal claims and also represents an area within the specialty with rapidly evolving technology and techniques. The ability to communicate comprehensible information to patients has never been greater. Thus, the author's aim is to explore whether it is feasible and acceptable to deliver a digital health education intervention to patients undergoing endovenous thermal ablation (EVTA) to supplement the consent process.

Thus, the author's aim is to explore whether it is feasible and acceptable to deliver a digital health education intervention to patients undergoing endovenous thermal ablation (EVTA) to supplement the consent process.This is a prospective, single centre, randomised controlled, feasibility trial recruiting patients with chronic venous disease deemed suitable to undergo EVTA. Patients will be randomised to receive either standard consent (SC) or a newly developed digital health education tool (dHET). The primary outcome is feasibility; assessing the recruitment and retention rate of participants and assessing acceptability of the intervention. Secondary outcomes include knowledge retention, anxiety and satisfaction. This feasibility trial is designed to recruit 40 patients, which will allow for a moderate dropout rate. This pilot study will inform the authors of the appropriateness of an adequately powered multicentre trial.

Abstract: Critical thinking is identified as a key educational outcome in higher education curricula; however, it is not trivial to support students in building this multifaceted skill. In this study, we evaluated a brief online learning intervention focusing on informal fallacy identification, a hallmark critical-thinking skill. The intervention used a bite-sized video learning approach, which has been shown to promote student engagement. Video-based learning was implemented within a precision teaching (PT) framework, which modulates the exposure of individual learners to the learning material to enable them to build ‘fluency’ in the targeted skills. In one of the learning conditions, PT was applied synergistically with domain-general problem-based training to support generalisation. The intervention consisted of two learning episodes and was administered to three groups (learning conditions) of 19 participants each: a PT fluency-based training group; a PT + group, where PT was combined with problem-based training; and a self-directed learning control group. All three groups showed comparable improvements in fallacy identification on taught (post-episode tests) and unseen materials (post-intervention assessment), with lower-scoring participants showing higher gains than high-scoring participants. The results of the knowledge retention tests a week later were also comparable between groups. Importantly, in the domain-general fallacy-identification assessment (post-intervention), the two PT groups showed higher improvements than the control group. These findings suggest that the integration of bite-sized video learning technologies with PT can improve students’ critical-thinking skills. Furthermore, PT, on its own or combined with problem-based training, can improve their skill to generalise learning to novel contexts. We discuss the educational implications of our findings.

Abstract: Works of art and information judged as obscene can be censored or banned. This brief review evaluates the costs and benefits of censorship and the banning of artwork and information. In the history of psychology, Frederick Wiseman’s film Titicut Follies epitomizes the disadvantages of concealing art content. Despite protecting the privacy of patients, the ban of Titicut Follies delayed the reform of psychiatric treatment practices and hospitals. The decision to censor or ban artistic and scientific information can result in the loss of knowledge and potential improvements to social, political, and economic institution practices.

Abstract: Objective: Uses Years of Accumulated Ability Lost (YAAL) as a proxy measure of societal loss through death of skills and knowledge acquired with age and experience, and compares the rankings of YAAL with rankings for crude mortality and YPLL (Years of Potential Life Lost). Methods: 2020 U.S. mortality data were used to to estimate YAAL associated with mortality from the leading causes of death, and compare the rankings of YAAL, crude mortality, and YPLL. Results: YAAL and crude mortality had comparable rankings with the exception of accidents which ranked higher in crude mortality. YAAL and YPLL differed substantially and shared only the ranking of malignant neoplasms third. Conclusions: YAAL can be used to measure the societal losses through death of skills and knowledge. Policy implications: In contrast to many non-Western societies, U.S. society does not greatly value its aging population. YAAL provides a measure of the array of skills and knowledge accumulated by a population which is lost at their death.

Abstract: Introduction: Kids In Control Of Food (KICk OFF) is a structured educational program for children with T1D from ages 11 to 16 years old. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the program was adapted and delivered virtually to accommodate regulations. It is unclear whether the virtual adaptation provides the same learning experience and effect on glycemic control as the original on-site version. Objectives: To compare both HbA1c and knowledge retention between participants who completed the program virtually versus on-site. Methods: A knowledge retention test of 15 questions was developed addressing the main diabetes concepts explained during KICk OFF: diabetes, insulin, carbohydrate counting, etc. This test was distributed to all the participants (virtual/on-site) 6 months after the completion of the course. Their knowledge retention tests were scored as a percentage of correct answers to total questions. HbA1c was recorded at baseline and 6 months. A t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 43 participants attended KICk OFF (23 on-site, 20 virtual). A significantly higher knowledge retention test score was achieved in the on-site group (p-value=0.015) (Table 1). An insignificant reduction of HbA1c of 0.3% was observed in the on-site group after 6 months, and no reduction in the virtual group (Table 2). Table 1: Mean retention test scores for the on-site and virtual participants. Table 2: Mean HbA1c for the on-site and virtual participants. Discussion: Although virtual KICk OFF was necessary during COVID-19, the results indicated a superiority in the on-site KICk OFF course in terms of knowledge retention, as well as HbA1c reduction. Further research is recommended.

Abstract: Introduction Traditional medical school curricula rely on textbook-based learning during the first two years, often limiting students' clinical exposure. Simulation-based learning (SBL) provides an opportunity for students to gain clinical exposure and competency with common procedures as well as to gain knowledge related to common clinical topics. Retention of factual knowledge is a current topic of discussion as medical learners often have difficulty with long-term retention. The aim of this study was to assess if students would learn, retain, and enjoy emergency medicine (EM)-focused SBL. Materials and methods We developed an EM-focused SBL curriculum consisting of four main educational events: suturing, medical stabilization, mass casualty triage, and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Participants were first- and second-year healthcare students enrolled in a traditional, preclinical curriculum, who completed pre- and post-event quizzes consisting of multiple-choice questions on topics covered during the SBL scenario. We compared pre- and post-event quiz scores using a one-way paired t-test. Quizzes were readministered up to 100 days after each SBL event to test knowledge retention, and scores were compared across time by repeated-measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA). Results For suture (n=22), mass casualty (n=20), and ultrasound simulations (n=17), post-event mean quiz scores increased significantly in comparison to mean quiz scores from before the event (p≤0.05). Medical stabilization simulation post-event scores were increased but did not reach statistical significance. Data collected at 45, 74, and 94 days following the suture lab as well as 29 and 49 days after the medical evacuation event, and 20 days after the mass casualty event showed no statistical decrease in quiz means suggesting retention of knowledge among learners. Subjective assessments of participant satisfaction demonstrated an enjoyment of the events. Discussion EM-focused SBL events offered enjoyable learning opportunities for students to effectively obtain and possibly retain clinical knowledge. Conclusion SBL has the potential to improve student retention of clinical knowledge during the preclinical years and, therefore, should be further explored and implemented as a core pillar of medical education as opposed to its current state as a learning adjunct.Introduction Traditional medical school curricula rely on textbook-based learning during the first two years, often limiting students' clinical exposure.

Learning critical thinking skills online: can precision teaching help?

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/learning-critical-thinking-skills-online-can/docview/2844431348/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Critical thinking is identified as a key educational outcome in higher education curricula; however, it is not trivial to support students in building this multifaceted skill. In this study, we evaluated a brief online learning intervention focusing on informal fallacy identification, a hallmark critical-thinking skill. The intervention used a bite-sized video learning approach, which has been shown to promote student engagement. Video-based learning was implemented within a precision teaching (PT) framework, which modulates the exposure of individual learners to the learning material to enable them to build ‘fluency’ in the targeted skills. In one of the learning conditions, PT was applied synergistically with domain-general problem-based training to support generalisation. The intervention consisted of two learning episodes and was administered to three groups (learning conditions) of 19 participants each: a PT fluency-based training group; a PT + group, where PT was combined with problem-based training; and a self-directed learning control group. All three groups showed comparable improvements in fallacy identification on taught (post-episode tests) and unseen materials (post-intervention assessment), with lower-scoring participants showing higher gains than high-scoring participants. The results of the knowledge retention tests a week later were also comparable between groups. Importantly, in the domain-general fallacy-identification assessment (post-intervention), the two PT groups showed higher improvements than the control group. These findings suggest that the integration of bite-sized video learning technologies with PT can improve students’ critical-thinking skills. Furthermore, PT, on its own or combined with problem-based training, can improve their skill to generalise learning to novel contexts. We discuss the educational implications of our findings.

Abstract: Previous studies disagree as to whether heritage bilinguals demonstrate loss of knowledge of Spanish grammatical gender. As phonetic variability is known to affect the acquisition of certain grammatical markers, we examine whether bilinguals' gender difficulties relate to bilingual contact-induced phonetic variability, namely, reduction in the inventory of word-final unstressed vowels. We analyzed narratives from children in the United States (n = 49, ages 4–12). All NP  s (n = 1415) were analyzed for structure, noun class, and morphology. Word-final vowels were sub-selected for acoustic analyses. Morpho-syntactically, group results show high accuracy with gender (95%), but with wide individual variation (44%–100%). Speakers also show individual variability and substantive numbers of vowel misclassifications (6%–33%) with higher variability for /a/ and /o/. We found bilingual effects in both domains but no association between phonetics and gender accuracy. These findings have implications for the relationship between phonetics and grammar, and for the morphosyntax of Spanish gender.

Abstract: The objectives of this scoping review are to (1) describe the available literature regarding the utility of the debate-style journal club for health professional learners on literature evaluation skills and (2) report the themes found within debate-style journal club research and assessments in the context of professional education. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this scoping review are to (1) describe the available literature regarding the utility of the debate-style journal club for health professional learners on literature evaluation skills and (2) report the themes found within debate-style journal club research and assessments in the context of professional education.A total of 27 articles written in the English language were included in this scoping review. Published evaluations of debate-style journal clubs have been predominantly based in the pharmacy profession (48%, n = 13), but are reported in other health professions, such as medicine (22%, n = 6), dentistry (15%, n = 4), nursing (7%, n = 2), occupational therapy (4%, n = 1), and physical therapy (4%, n = 1), as well. The skills assessed in these studies often included critical literature evaluation, application of literature to patient care, critical thinking, knowledge retention, use of supporting literature, and debate-specific skills. Learners typically reported better understanding and application of the literature, and enjoying the experience more than traditional journal clubs, but note the increased assessor and learner time requirement for debating. Pharmacy learner-specific articles more often utilized a traditional, team-based debate format, incorporated grading rubrics for skill assessment and debate performance, and included a grading component for the debate in the course.

Experiences of nonpregnant couples after receiving reproductive genetic carrier screening results in Belgium

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/experiences-nonpregnant-couples-after-receiving/docview/2825537388/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Reproductive genetic carrier screening (RGCS) allows for the identification of couples who have an increased likelihood of conceiving a child with a particular autosomal recessive or X-linked condition. The aim of this study was to assess the level of satisfaction, anxiety, knowledge retention, psychosocial and counseling-related aspects among couples who chose to have RGCS. Participants were initially informed about their screening results by telephone. After obtaining a written report of test results, participants were asked to complete an individual self-administered questionnaire. All participants ( n  = 67) felt they had enough information to make an informed choice. None of the participants regretted their choice to have RGCS. Test results were most often shared with parents (61%) or siblings (37%). Our findings demonstrate that the information/counseling and reporting strategy that was used in the context of this study led to high participant satisfaction, an increase in knowledge over time and favorable psychosocial and counseling-related outcomes.

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to investigate primary care nurse practitioner (NP) knowledge and knowledge retention on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening after an educational in-service. AIMS The purpose of this study is to investigate primary care nurse practitioner (NP) knowledge and knowledge retention on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening after an educational in-service.The prevalence of OSA is high and continues to rise amid the obesity epidemic. Approximately 75-90 % of individuals with moderate to severe OSA remain undiagnosed. Continuing education of OSA risk factors among primary care providers may increase screening rates, leading to early diagnosis and treatment. BACKGROUND The prevalence of OSA is high and continues to rise amid the obesity epidemic. Approximately 75-90 % of individuals with moderate to severe OSA remain undiagnosed. Continuing education of OSA risk factors among primary care providers may increase screening rates, leading to early diagnosis and treatment.An educational module was presented to NPs (n = 30) during a mandatory NP in-service at two sets of outpatient clinics. Knowledge was assessed with a pre-test and post-test survey consisting of 23 items. A 25-item follow-up test was administered five weeks after to assess knowledge retention. METHODS An educational module was presented to NPs (n = 30) during a mandatory NP in-service at two sets of outpatient clinics. Knowledge was assessed with a pre-test and post-test survey consisting of 23 items. A 25-item follow-up test was administered five weeks after to assess knowledge retention.An increase in total knowledge scores was demonstrated between the pre-test and post-test with a decrease in knowledge observed at follow-up. Follow-up test total mean scores remained above pre-test levels, indicating potential long-term learning. RESULTS An increase in total knowledge scores was demonstrated between the pre-test and post-test with a decrease in knowledge observed at follow-up. Follow-up test total mean scores remained above pre-test levels, indicating potential long-term learning.While learning was demonstrated, NPs acknowledged continued barriers to screening for OSA such as time and having no OSA screening tool available in the electronic medical record (EMR). CONCLUSIONS While learning was demonstrated, NPs acknowledged continued barriers to screening for OSA such as time and having no OSA screening tool available in the electronic medical record (EMR).

Abstract: Collaborative testing has been demonstrated the ability to improve students' performance, enhance students' learning, and aid in knowledge retention in many different courses. However, this examination mode lacks the process of teacher feedback. Herein, a short teacher feedback from was added immediately after the collaborative testing to improve the students' performance. A parasitology class of 121 undergraduates was randomized into two groups: group A and group B . Collaborative testing was carried out at the end of theoretical teaching. During the test, students would first answer questions as individuals for 20 minutes. Then, students from group A answered the same questions in groups (5 students in each group) for 20 minutes, while the group-testing duration was only 15 minutes in group B . Immediately after the group testing, teachers conducted a 5-minute feedback about the morphology identification according to the analysis of the answers by group B . Four weeks later, a final test was conducted in an individual test. The total scores and scores for each examination content were analyzed. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the final exam scores between both groups ( t = -1.278, P = 0.204). However, the morphological and diagnostic test results of the final examination in group B were significantly higher than those of the midterm examination, while there was no significant change in group A ( t = 4.333, P = 0.051). The results confirmed that the teacher feedback after the collaborative testing can effectively make up for the students' knowledge gaps. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study found that collaborative group testing is helpful for teachers to grasp students' knowledge gaps more easily and the teacher feedback after the collaborative group testing can effectively make up for the knowledge gaps of students.Collaborative testing has been demonstrated the ability to improve students' performance, enhance students' learning, and aid in knowledge retention in many different courses.

Abstract: Works of art and information judged as obscene can be censored or banned. This brief review evaluates the costs and benefits of censorship and the banning of artwork and information. In the history of psychology, Frederick Wiseman's film Titicut Follies epitomizes the disadvantages of concealing art content. Despite protecting the privacy of patients, the ban of Titicut Follies delayed the reform of psychiatric treatment practices and hospitals. The decision to censor or ban artistic and scientific information can result in the loss of knowledge and potential improvements to social, political, and economic institution practices.Works of art and information judged as obscene can be censored or banned.

Despite protecting the privacy of patients, the ban of Titicut Follies delayed the reform of psychiatric treatment practices and hospitals. The decision to censor or ban artistic and scientific information can result in the loss of knowledge and potential improvements to social, political, and economic institution practices.

Abstract: Background: Self-awareness is seldom formally assessed by occupational therapists among individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, impaired self-awareness is prevalent and has a significant impact on rehabilitation outcomes. There is a need to understand clinician perspectives on self-awareness assessments and promote evidence-based practice in clinical settings. Aims: (1) Explore how an education session impacts knowledge and use of self-awareness assessments in occupational therapists working with people with TBI; (2) Understand the barriers that occupational therapists experience when assessing self-awareness in clinical practice. Materials and methods: A single-group pre-post session design with an integrated knowledge translation approach was used. Occupational therapists working in neurorehabilitation were recruited from two rehabilitation centres through convenience sampling. Participants completed questionnaires before, after, and three months following an education session about the Self-Awareness of Deficits (SADI) assessment. Results: 14 occupational therapists participated in this study. A statistically significant increase in knowledge and confidence in using the SADI was observed both post-session and at 3-month follow-up. Conclusion: Targeted and ongoing education promotes confidence and knowledge retention among occupational therapists. Further research should explore strategies to promote behaviour change. Significance. The barriers identified in this study can provide insights for knowledge translation across clinical contexts.

Abstract: Semantic Variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA) has often been considered as a loss of knowledge stored in semantic memory, but might also be due to a general disruption of mechanisms allowing the acquisition, storage, and retrieval of semantic memories. In order to assess any parallelism in svPPA patients between loss of semantic knowledge and inability to acquire new semantic information, we administered a battery of semantic learning tasks to healthy individuals and svPPA patients, where they were requested to learn new conceptual representations and new word forms, and to associate the former with the latter. A strong relation was found between loss of semantic knowledge and disruption of semantic learning: (a) patients with severe svPPA had the lowest scores in the semantic learning tasks; (b) significant correlations were found between scores obtained in semantic learning tasks and scores obtained in semantic memory disorders in svPPA patients.Semantic Variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA) has often been considered as a loss of knowledge stored in semantic memory, but might also be due to a general disruption of mechanisms allowing the acquisition, storage, and retrieval of semantic memories.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the change in knowledge and skill confidence after implementation of a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE) training course during the Russia-Ukraine War. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the change in knowledge and skill confidence after implementation of a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE) training course during the Russia-Ukraine War.Pre/post-test study in the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, and Odesa. Fifteen CBRNE courses were conducted over a 3-mo period, August to October 2022. Change in knowledge and skills confidence were evaluated with pre/post-course written exams and practical skill assessments that were observed during the training exercises. Changes were analyzed based on nonparametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank testing. Pre/post self-efficacy surveys were analyzed with McNemar's test for paired data. Course evaluations were conducted with standardized questions which assessed instruction quality, teaching relevance, knowledge gained, and post-course skills confidence. METHODS Pre/post-test study in the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, and Odesa. Fifteen CBRNE courses were conducted over a 3-mo period, August to October 2022. Change in knowledge and skills confidence were evaluated with pre/post-course written exams and practical skill assessments that were observed during the training exercises. Changes were analyzed based on nonparametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank testing. Pre/post self-efficacy surveys were analyzed with McNemar's test for paired data. Course evaluations were conducted with standardized questions which assessed instruction quality, teaching relevance, knowledge gained, and post-course skills confidence.A total of 523 participants registered and completed 1 of the 15 courses. Overall mean pre-course test score: 57.8% (SD 20.7%); mean post-course test score: 81.4% (SD 11.3%); participants with increasing test scores: 90.7%; mean difference in score (95% confidence interval) 23.6% (21.2%-25.9%), P < 0.0001. Pre/post self-efficacy surveys (4-point Likert scale) noted participants recognized signs and symptoms of a CBRNE incident, and necessary skills to manage CBRNE exposures, P < 0.0001. RESULTS A total of 523 participants registered and completed 1 of the 15 courses. Overall mean pre-course test score: 57.8% (SD 20.7%); mean post-course test score: 81.4% (SD 11.3%); participants with increasing test scores: 90.7%; mean difference in score (95% confidence interval) 23.6% (21.2%-25.9%), P < 0.0001. Pre/post self-efficacy surveys (4-point Likert scale) noted participants recognized signs and symptoms of a CBRNE incident, and necessary skills to manage CBRNE exposures, P < 0.0001.The implementation of this CBRNE course for front-line providers in Ukraine was successful. To our knowledge, it was the first implementation of a field course during the current Russian-Ukraine war. Future research should evaluate knowledge retention and impact of our innovative Train-the-Trainer model. Further iterations should emphasize expanding the quantity of training equipment and practical skill sessions.

Abstract: ENG English ENG This study compares the knowledge of medicinal plants of Bissau-Guinean migrants now established in Italy with the ethnopharmacology still present in their country of origin. We also investigated how traditional ethnobotanical knowledge is changing following the phenomenon of migration from Africa to Europe. The ethnobotanical data were collected during 2017–2018, by interviewing 49 informants belonging to 8 ethnic groups, living in 8 provinces of northern Italy. The final inventory of botanical taxa included 81 species belonging to 34 families, with Fabaceae and Malvaceae the most represented, followed by Euphorbiaceae, Apocynaceae, Combretaceae, and Solanaceae. Plant remedies were used to treat 21 ailment categories, such as fever, internal infections, intestinal and respiratory problems, and pains. The traditional ethnobotanical knowledge of Bissau-Guinean migrants in Italy was associated with gender, with women showing the highest knowledge. In addition, a negative relationship was observed between the maintenance of this knowledge and the number of years migrants have spent in Italy. Overall, a loss of knowledge was observed in the less numerous ethnic groups. However, traditional preparations based on plants from the country of origin are in general well preserved to maintain a good state of health. Our work could help in transferring to the next generation the cultural heritage of Bissau-Guinean people permanently moved to European Countries.

Abstract: This study compares the knowledge of medicinal plants of Bissau-Guinean migrants now established in Italy with the ethnopharmacology still present in their country of origin. We also investigated how traditional ethnobotanical knowledge is changing following the phenomenon of migration from Africa to Europe. The ethnobotanical data were collected during 2017-2018, by interviewing 49 informants belonging to 8 ethnic groups, living in 8 provinces of northern Italy. The final inventory of botanical taxa included 81 species belonging to 34 families, with Fabaceae and Malvaceae the most represented, followed by Euphorbiaceae, Apocynaceae, Combretaceae, and Solanaceae. Plant remedies were used to treat 21 ailment categories, such as fever, internal infections, intestinal and respiratory problems, and pains. The traditional ethnobotanical knowledge of Bissau-Guinean migrants in Italy was associated with gender, with women showing the highest knowledge. In addition, a negative relationship was observed between the maintenance of this knowledge and the number of years migrants have spent in Italy. Overall, a loss of knowledge was observed in the less numerous ethnic groups. However, traditional preparations based on plants from the country of origin are in general well preserved to maintain a good state of health. Our work could help in transferring to the next generation the cultural heritage of Bissau-Guinean people permanently moved to European Countries.This study compares the knowledge of medicinal plants of Bissau-Guinean migrants now established in Italy with the ethnopharmacology still present in their country of origin.

Abstract: The rapid development of innovative technologies, population growth, shifting resource management patterns, and decarbonization challenges are expected to increase the demand for raw materials labeled as critical in the following years. The increasing concerns have led to evaluate the critical raw materials (CRMs) with high economic importance and supply risk. In this context, this paper aims to develop a conceptual methodology to identify CRMs in Turkey. The methodology integrates a multi-criteria decision-making method (MCDM) to provide the raw material criticality matrix regarding various criteria, the EU (European Union) method, which represents supply risk and economic importance indicators, and the time series analysis method, in which dynamic evaluation of materials over time instead of the static indicators. We first provide a Bayesian Best-Worst method (B-BWM) and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) based model for the criticality matrix, which enables evaluations of participated experts to be combined to reveal the weights of the criteria and sub-criteria from a probabilistic point of view without loss of knowledge. The main and sub-criteria include supply risk and economic importance, which are frequently studied in the literature, but also environment, price, secondary production, and socio-economic indicators are evaluated in the criticality matrix. Then, exponential smoothing forecast, one of the Time Series Analysis models, which determine the element criticality in the perspective of future years with the data of import figures of Turkey, is superior to the other models. Finally, with some modifications, the EU criticality methodology is used to quantify the raw materials regarding each material associated with the sector applications and their value-added and supply disruptions. Thus, a comprehensive criticality list integrating the results of the three mentioned methods is important because Turkey's raw materials characterize many sectors. The findings should also interest practitioners and researchers as the detailed assessment of raw material criticality ensures a sufficient database for future studies.

Abstract: The present study investigated the possible effects of proactive form-focused instruction on Iranian EFL learners’ explicit and implicit grammar knowledge improvement in a flipped and a traditional class and also examined the effect of flipped class on explicit and implicit knowledge retention. Two classes were randomly assigned to an experimental (n = 31) and a control (n = 28) group. The former received proactive form-focused instruction through metalinguistic explanation in a flipped class, whereas the latter attended a traditional grammar class. Two implicit and two explicit knowledge tests were used to evaluate the learners’ explicit and implicit grammar knowledge development and retention. A set of pretests and two sets of posttests were administered immediately and four weeks after the last treatment session. Two mixed 3x2 multifactorial ANOVAs and post hoc tests were run to spot the differences in the measures between and within the groups. The results showed that both classes improved significantly in terms of learners’ implicit and explicit grammar knowledge. Furthermore, the experimental group showed a higher rate of knowledge retention. The findings can help and ensure language program designers, educational policymakers, and language teachers to capitalize on flipped courses to teach grammar effectively and help language learners retain both explicit and implicit grammar knowledge longer.

Abstract: Introduction: Hazardous materials (HazMat) training is not a requirement for accreditation of US Emergency Medicine (EM) residencies, nor for EM board certification by the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM). However, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires hospitals train all personnel expected to deal with contaminated patients. This QI project aimed to develop an EM physician-specific HazMat course and evaluate the physician comfort level with HazMat personal protective equipment (PPE) donning and doffing, triage, procedural skills, and decontamination. Method: A four-hour “HazMat for Docs” course was designed at a large urban academic trauma center and offered to second-year EM residents. Additionally, we performed a quantitative survey of a cohort of 72 current and recently graduated EM residents (classes 2019-2024), some of whom had taken the course in person. Our primary outcome was to measure improvement in comfort level with essential HazMat tasks after completing the course. Our secondary outcome was to evaluate the current or recently graduated EM physician's overall comfort levels with managing a HazMat incident, as well as HazMat skills and knowledge retention. Results: A total of 53 responses (73.6%) were obtained. 45.3% of the respondents were male and 54.7% female. 37.8% of the respondents were recent EM graduates, with 20.8% PGY-4, 13.2% PGY-3, 15.1% PGY-2, 13.2% PGY-1. 16/53 (30.2%) had prior EMS experience. EM Physicians were most comfortable with donning and doffing PPE (4.92 on a 7-point scale) and least comfortable with decontamination procedures (2.98/7). After completing the HazMat course, EM physicians increased their comfort level with HazMat decontamination procedures by 8.6% and with organizing a multi-disciplinary ED HazMat response by 10.5%. Conclusion: EM Physician comfort levels with HazMat procedures are low. Increased training aimed at improving physician knowledge, preparedness, and comfort level for such events is necessary and can be accomplished through a short course.

Abstract: Introduction: Chemical exposures can cause direct and indirect injuries to responding medical personnel. Therefore, hospital healthcare providers should be provided with disaster response training that includes identification of chemical hazards, establishment of the hazard zone, personal protective equipment use, decontamination, and chemical injury antidote use. This study evaluates the educational effectiveness of the chemical-mass casualty incident response education module (C-MCIREM) for hospital healthcare providers. Method: This was a retrospective quasi-experimental study. Subjects were hospital providers who enrolled in the C-MCIREM program between May 1, 2021, and July 26, 2022. Subjects were hospital providers from Bucheon, Mokpo, Iksan, Jeonju, and Dae-gu cities in South Korea. Subjects completed pre, post, and three-month knowledge retention and self-assessments of readiness tests, as well as evaluations on tabletop exercises (TTX), and a satisfaction survey (11-point Likert) after the course. The instructors scored teamwork measures via standardized evaluations on TTX throughout the course. The K-paired Sample Friedman test was used to compare samples. Results: 127 respondents were enrolled. The median knowledge score rose from 51/100 (39, 66) to 85.5/100 (73.75, 90) with a median retention score of 74/100 (64, 88) (p<0.001). Participants felt their readiness to respond increased in all facets (all p<0.001) on the post and retention test for the MCI situation. All three hospital teams showed significant increases in teamwork between the median of the 1st and 4th TTX as 27/100 (23.5, 29) and 69/100 (66.75, 69.5) (p<0.05). Participants were overall satisfied (9.1/10 SD 1.13) and would recommend the training to others (9.15/10 SD 1.2). Conclusion: C-MCIREM participants had high satisfaction with a significant increase and persistence in knowledge, improved teamwork, and self-assessed readiness to respond to a chemical mass casualty incident.

Abstract: Introduction: Improving access to emergency health services can reduce morbidity and mortality for patients with acute emergent conditions. The WHO and ICRC developed the Basic Emergency Care course to train frontline providers in a systematic approach to common and treatable life-threatening conditions. This study aims to evaluate the knowledge retention of Rwandan emergency care providers after implementation of this course. Method: A prospective, quasi-experimental, nonrandomized study was conducted at the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (CHUK) in Rwanda. A formal survey was conducted to understand the current composition and training of Rwandan emergency care providers. Baseline and post-course assessments of knowledge were collected via an existing 25 multiple choice question survey tool which is an already established part of the BEC curriculum. Forty providers who care for patients with acute emergent illness were included. Data collected included age, gender, preferred language, as well as information about professional background, knowledge and skills. Providers with both baseline and post-test results were included in the analysis (n=40). Results: Of the 40 Rwandan providers, 47.5% (n=19) male and 52.5% (n=21) female, 26 were nurses, six were doctors, six were prehospital providers, one was both a prehospital provider and nurse, and one was a midwife. The mean age was 36.3. Out of 25, the mean baseline score was 17.8 (SD=3.2) and this significantly increased to a mean posttest score of 21.9 (SD=2.4). 85% (n=34) of providers’ knowledge improved, 2.5% (n=1) of provider’s knowledge stayed the same, and 12.5% (n=5) of providers' knowledge decreased. The difference between the pre and post-test scores was found to be statistically significant, 4.1 (SD=3.4), (P<0.0001). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that implementing the BEC course has significantly improved the emergency provider knowledge base. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the impact of BEC training on patient care and morbidity/mortality outcomes.

Abstract: Introduction: Particular skills are critical when participating in trauma response. Engagement and practice with these skills can help build staff confidence, however, ensuring competency across all staff can prove challenging. Establishing a training utilizing skill stations can positively affect staff experience and confidence measures on predetermined dates to capture all team members is a way to ensure confidence in skills vital for patient care in ED settings. Execution of the “skill station” exercises at measured intervals demonstrated improved confidence in trauma skills by ED staff. Exercises with specific skill-oriented practicum offer low-cost, dynamic training opportunities. Improving confidence and competence in critical trauma-related clinical skills directly improves patient outcomes. Method: Six trauma skill stations were created, aimed at specific skill-based practices. These measured skill competencies include arterial line setup, rapid blood infuser use, defibrillator use, chest tube management, pelvic binder application, and tourniquet application. Competency was reached when participants could effectively perform the skills through teach-back technique. Results: Qualitative feedback demonstrated that nurses felt more confident responding to a patient needing trauma interventions in an ED setting. Nursing staff were more engaged with trauma skills in their scope. All participants were able to appropriately and adequately teach-back the skill with 100% accuracy. Improved knowledge retention will be measured in future training sessions. Pre and post-tests could be utilized to demonstrate more dynamic results. This measurement tool will be utilized in the formal training process moving forward to capture baseline and improvement data more objectively. Conclusion: This low-cost and highly efficient method of strengthening novice nurses’ trauma skills competency and confidence can be utilized across various skills and departments. More confident nurses show improved readiness to respond to a patient in need of trauma interventions.

Abstract: Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the change in knowledge and skill confidence after implementation of a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE) training course during the Russia-Ukraine War. Methods: Pre/post-test study in the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, and Odesa. Fifteen CBRNE courses were conducted over a 3-mo period, August to October 2022. Change in knowledge and skills confidence were evaluated with pre/post-course written exams and practical skill assessments that were observed during the training exercises. Changes were analyzed based on nonparametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank testing. Pre/post self-efficacy surveys were analyzed with McNemar’s test for paired data. Course evaluations were conducted with standardized questions which assessed instruction quality, teaching relevance, knowledge gained, and post-course skills confidence. Results: A total of 523 participants registered and completed 1 of the 15 courses. Overall mean pre-course test score: 57.8% (SD 20.7%); mean post-course test score: 81.4% (SD 11.3%); participants with increasing test scores: 90.7%; mean difference in score (95% confidence interval) 23.6% (21.2%-25.9%), P < 0.0001. Pre/post self-efficacy surveys (4-point Likert scale) noted participants recognized signs and symptoms of a CBRNE incident, and necessary skills to manage CBRNE exposures, P < 0.0001. Conclusions: The implementation of this CBRNE course for front-line providers in Ukraine was successful. To our knowledge, it was the first implementation of a field course during the current Russian-Ukraine war. Future research should evaluate knowledge retention and impact of our innovative Train-the-Trainer model. Further iterations should emphasize expanding the quantity of training equipment and practical skill sessions.

Abstract: Interest in business ecosystems has grown exponentially over the last decade. This article focuses on the operational benefits of business ecosystems by investigating how embeddedness in business ecosystems influences supply chain competence. Specifically, it considers the mediating effect of external knowledge capacities (i.e. absorptive, desorptive and connective capacity). Data from 271 European firms in business ecosystems was collected to test the paper’s hypotheses using regression analysis with bootstrapping. Results indicate that business ecosystem embeddedness does not in itself improve supply chain competence. Rather, the relationship is explained through (i) absorptive and desorptive capacity as direct mediators; and (ii) connective capacity, which enhances supply chain competence indirectly by improving external knowledge retention for absorptive and desorptive capacity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to demonstrate benefits of being embedded in business ecosystems other than in terms of innovation. Newly validated scales for business ecosystem embeddedness and connective capacity are provided.

Abstract: Though virtual reality has repeatedly seen usability improvements through higher fidelity headsets, interacting with small objects has remained an issue due to a reduction in visual acuity. Given the current uptake of virtual reality platforms and the range of real world applications that they may be used for, it is worth considering how such interactions can be accounted for. We propose three techniques for improving the usability of small objects in virtual environments: i) expanding them in place, ii) showing a zoomed-in twin above the original object, and iii) showing a large readout of the object's current state. We conducted a study comparing each technique's usability, induced presence, and effect on short-term knowledge retention in a VR training scenario that simulated the common geoscience exercise of measuring strike and dip. Participant feedback highlighted the need for this research, however simply scaling the area of interest may not be enough to improve the usability of information-bearing objects, while displaying this information in large text format can make tasks faster to complete at the cost of reducing the user's ability to transfer knowledge they've learned to the real world. We discuss these results and their implications for the design of future virtual reality experiences.Though virtual reality has repeatedly seen usability improvements through higher fidelity headsets, interacting with small objects has remained an issue due to a reduction in visual acuity.

Abstract: Purpose Knowledge protection (KP) is one of the main knowledge management (KM) processes that aim to protect the organization’s knowledge from any inside and outside force leakage. In higher education institutions (HEIs), KP is rarely being discussed and covered in contrast to knowledge sharing (KS) in terms of its determinants. The purpose of this paper is to provide a deep analysis of previous research articles from 1980 to 2019 and examine the associated institutional factors on KP determinants within HEIs as a research objective. Design/methodology/approach The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis was a well-established approach for analyzing the systematic literature review methodology. Several articles were published over the past decades collected from 5 different databases, but after the screening, 101 articles were reviewed and only 22 articles were relevant to the research objective. Findings The findings indicated that KP is under academic research topic in KM and has received minimal attention in HEIs compared to KS, which has been frequently studied in HEIs. The literature categorized KP determinants into four areas: technological, organizational structure, behavioral and ethics and organizational culture. It will open the door for academics to investigate further into the factors, theories and models of KP in general and HEIs from a particular perspective. Practical implications As evident from the paper finds, with few pieces of literature covered in this topic, HEIs have to protect the knowledge from any illegal usage or any expert’s knowledge loss after leaving the institutions. This study can help university leaders to understand how the different KP determinants can maximize KP without affecting the KS and develop the KP phenomenon for a strategic fit to enhance their institutions’ safe knowledge usage. Originality/value This is the first research of its type which has extensively examined the literature on KP related to HEIs. Also, this paper provides theoretical and practical insights through understanding the determinants that affect KP practices among academic staff.

Abstract: Diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is mainly clinical. Delayed or missed diagnosis and failure to administer appropriate and timely treatment of ARF leads to rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which could necessitate expensive treatments such as open-heart surgery. Implementation of preventative guidelines depends on availability of trained healthcare workers. As part of the routine support supervision, the Uganda Heart Institute sent out a team to rural eastern Uganda to evaluate health workers' knowledge level regarding management of ARF. BACKGROUND Diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is mainly clinical. Delayed or missed diagnosis and failure to administer appropriate and timely treatment of ARF leads to rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which could necessitate expensive treatments such as open-heart surgery. Implementation of preventative guidelines depends on availability of trained healthcare workers. As part of the routine support supervision, the Uganda Heart Institute sent out a team to rural eastern Uganda to evaluate health workers' knowledge level regarding management of ARF.Health workers from selected health facilities in Tororo district, eastern Uganda, were assessed for their knowledge on the clinical features and role of benzathine penicillin G (BPG) in the treatment and prevention of ARF recurrence. Using the RHD Action Needs assessment tool, we generated and administered a pre-test, then conducted training and re-administered a post-test. Eight months later, health workers were again assessed for knowledge retention and change in practices. Statistical analysis was done using Stata version 15. METHODS Health workers from selected health facilities in Tororo district, eastern Uganda, were assessed for their knowledge on the clinical features and role of benzathine penicillin G (BPG) in the treatment and prevention of ARF recurrence. Using the RHD Action Needs assessment tool, we generated and administered a pre-test, then conducted training and re-administered a post-test. Eight months later, health workers were again assessed for knowledge retention and change in practices. Statistical analysis was done using Stata version 15.During the initial phase, 34 of the 109 (31%) health workers passed the pre-test, indicating familiarity with clinical features of ARF. The level of knowledge of BPG use in ARF was very poor in all the health units [25/109 (22.6%)] but improved after training to 80%, as shown by the chi-squared test ( χ 2 = 0.000). However, retention of this knowledge waned after eight months and was not significantly different compared to pre-training ( χ 2 ≥ 0.2). RESULTS During the initial phase, 34 of the 109 (31%) health workers passed the pre-test, indicating familiarity with clinical features of ARF. The level of knowledge of BPG use in ARF was very poor in all the health units [25/109 (22.6%)] but improved after training to 80%, as shown by the chi-squared test ( χ2 = 0.000). However, retention of this knowledge waned after eight months and was not significantly different compared to pre-training (χ2 ≥ 0.2).A critical knowledge gap is evident among health workers, both in awareness and treatment of ARF, and calls for repetitive training as a priority strategy in prevention. CONCLUSIONS A critical knowledge gap is evident among health workers, both in awareness and treatment of ARF, and calls for repetitive training as a priority strategy in prevention.

Abstract: Accidents involving sports or leisure activities, falls, blows from objects, acts of interpersonal violence, and accidents can all result in dental trauma (also known as traumatic dental injuries [TDIs]). School children are one of the population groups that are highly vulnerable to TDIs. Multiple school-based interventions have been conducted around the world on the prevention and management of TDIs; however, no known scoping review has been conducted to map the evidence. Hence, this study aimed to conduct a scoping review of existing school-based interventions on TDIs. INTRODUCTION Accidents involving sports or leisure activities, falls, blows from objects, acts of interpersonal violence, and accidents can all result in dental trauma (also known as traumatic dental injuries [TDIs]). School children are one of the population groups that are highly vulnerable to TDIs. Multiple school-based interventions have been conducted around the world on the prevention and management of TDIs; however, no known scoping review has been conducted to map the evidence. Hence, this study aimed to conduct a scoping review of existing school-based interventions on TDIs.This scoping review adopted the research design presented by Arksey and O'Malley. Eight research databases-PubMed, SCOPUS, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL Ultimate, AMED (The Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), Child Development & Adolescent Studies, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and SPORTDiscuss-were searched to retrieve literature relevant to the scoping review question. Some of the retrieved literature existed in duplicate and was deduplicated using Rayyan software. Twenty papers that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected and reviewed. METHODS This scoping review adopted the research design presented by Arksey and O'Malley. Eight research databases-PubMed, SCOPUS, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL Ultimate, AMED (The Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), Child Development & Adolescent Studies, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and SPORTDiscuss-were searched to retrieve literature relevant to the scoping review question. Some of the retrieved literature existed in duplicate and was deduplicated using Rayyan software. Twenty papers that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected and reviewed.A total of 526 publications were retrieved from the eight databases searched in this scoping review. Ninety-seven publications were duplicates and were removed. After the two-stage screening of the deduplicated copies, only 20 peer-reviewed journal articles were relevant and included in the review. The selected studies sampled a total of 7152 participants whose ages ranged between 9 and 62 years (mean = 10.56 to 46.5; standard deviation = ±0.97 to ±8.1). The findings obtained from the reviewed journal articles revealed that pupils are at high risk of dental trauma and they are more likely to sustain these injuries during school activities. In addition, inadequate understanding, poor attitudes, and low experiential knowledge of dental trauma were found among educators, parents, and even school pupils. The evidence of long-term knowledge retention and a high knowledge score in the experimental groups buttresses the need for continuous first-aid education on dental trauma. RESULTS A total of 526 publications were retrieved from the eight databases searched in this scoping review. Ninety-seven publications were duplicates and were removed.

The evidence of long-term knowledge retention and a high knowledge score in the experimental groups buttresses the need for continuous first-aid education on dental trauma.The application of multiple educational approaches or modalities in schools will reinforce and promote good first-aid skills and management practices that are essential for preserving traumatized teeth. CONCLUSIONS The application of multiple educational approaches or modalities in schools will reinforce and promote good first-aid skills and management practices that are essential for preserving traumatized teeth.

Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this article is to investigate how organization retain the knowledge of Contract Workforce (CWF) and to understand the associated challenges in this regard. Design/methodology/approach Adopting an inductive approach, 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior managers, project heads and consultants working in leading oil and gas companies across eight countries (USA, Australia, UAE, KSA, Pakistan, UK, Thailand and Russia). Thematic analysis was carried out to analyze the data collected. Findings CWF appears to be a significant source of knowledge attrition and even knowledge loss in the oil and gas sector. There are various risks associated with hiring of CWF, such as hallowing of organizational memory, repeated training of contractors, no knowledge base, workforce shortage among others which can impede the knowledge retention capability of O&G companies in the context of contract workforce. Various knowledge retention strategies for CWF have been revealed, however, there is interplay of various factors such as proportion of CWF deployed, proper resource utilization, cross-functional multi-level teams' involvement and strength of transactional ties. Maintaining strong relationships (Transactional ties) is crucial to maintain a virtual organizational memory (partial knowledge retention) and to follow a adopting a rehired when required policy. Originality/value The knowledge retention issue in the context of CWF has not be addressed in past researches. This article attempts to fill this gap.

Abstract: Critical thinking is identified as a key educational outcome in higher education curricula; however, it is not trivial to support students in building this multifaceted skill. In this study, we evaluated a brief online learning intervention focusing on informal fallacy identification, a hallmark critical-thinking skill. The intervention used a bite-sized video learning approach, which has been shown to promote student engagement. Video-based learning was implemented within a precision teaching (PT) framework, which modulates the exposure of individual learners to the learning material to enable them to build 'fluency' in the targeted skills. In one of the learning conditions, PT was applied synergistically with domain-general problem-based training to support generalisation. The intervention consisted of two learning episodes and was administered to three groups (learning conditions) of 19 participants each: a PT fluency-based training group; a PT + group, where PT was combined with problem-based training; and a self-directed learning control group. All three groups showed comparable improvements in fallacy identification on taught (post-episode tests) and unseen materials (post-intervention assessment), with lower-scoring participants showing higher gains than high-scoring participants. The results of the knowledge retention tests a week later were also comparable between groups. Importantly, in the domain-general fallacy-identification assessment (post-intervention), the two PT groups showed higher improvements than the control group. These findings suggest that the integration of bite-sized video learning technologies with PT can improve students' critical-thinking skills. Furthermore, PT, on its own or combined with problem-based training, can improve their skill to generalise learning to novel contexts. We discuss the educational implications of our findings.Critical thinking is identified as a key educational outcome in higher education curricula; however, it is not trivial to support students in building this multifaceted skill.

Abstract: As we enter a world of blended learning in higher education, an increased need for adaptation of teaching strategies to enhance engagement has been recognised to amplify learning outcomes online. Gamification has been identified as a creative tool to engage the current cohort of learners who are also characteristically tech-savvy. To this end, escape room games have gained considerable traction in medical and pharmacy education to promote learning, critical thinking and teamwork. In this pilot study we describe the implementation of a 60-minute, web-based hepatitis-themed escape room game within a Year 3 Pharmacotherapy unit at Monash University. A total of 418 students participated in this activity. Students' knowledge gain on the topic was assessed through a pre- and post-intervention assessment, whereby a statistically significant improvement was seen in the knowledge score following implementation of the gaming activity (58.66% pre-intervention vs. 72.05% post-intervention, p  < 0.05). The innovative learning activity was also well perceived by the students. Virtual escape room game is a viable pedagogical approach to teach and reinforce clinical concepts among pharmacy students. With the evolving landscape of education and learner demographics, investment in technology- enhanced game-based learning is a promising trajectory to support students' growth in a learner-centered environment. A comparison between virtual escape room game and traditional teaching will further inform effectiveness of the gamification on long term knowledge retention.As we enter a world of blended learning in higher education, an increased need for adaptation of teaching strategies to enhance engagement has been recognised to amplify learning outcomes online.

Abstract: Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) Nevada applied the ECHO virtual hub-and-spoke telementoring model over nine 6-week cohorts (between November 2019 and November 2021) supporting community health workers (CHWs) who advise clients with diabetes or pre-diabetes. This study describes the program implementation, including evaluation data collection efforts. Didactic topics included ‘Intro to Healthy Eating and Easy Wins’ to ‘Grocery Shopping, Cooking Tips, Reading Labels, Meal Plans’ and ‘Reducing Bias and Being a Good Role Model’. Spoke participants signed up to review cases. Seventy-three of the enrolled participants ( n = 100) attended three or more of the six sessions. Spoke participants completed 42 case presentations. The average self-efficacy increased from 2.7 [standard deviation (SD): 1.1] before completing the program to 4.1 (SD: 0.8) after completing the program. Average knowledge scores increased from 71 (SD: 16) before completing the program to 83 (SD: 14) after completing the program. Five group interviews drew actionable feedback that was incorporated into the program. Key elements of the ECHO model were successfully incorporated to support educational goals of a cohort of CHWs in nutritional coaching. Our program evaluation data tracking system shows non-significant but encouraging results regarding self-efficacy improvement and knowledge retention.

Abstract: Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of our ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention bundle implemented by education of the nursing staff, and to describe the tendency of knowledge retention. Research methodology: A prospective, before-and-after study was performed. The ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention bundle was implemented through a single educational intervention of the nursing staff. The risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia over time was estimated using a Cox proportional cause-specific hazard model. Compliance to preventive measures was assessed at three time-points: before education, at three months and 12 months after education. Setting: A 29-bed mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit. Main outcome measures: Ventilator-associate pneumonia incidence densities, the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, and compliance to preventive measures in the pre-implementation and post-implementation periods. Results: We analyzed the data of 251 patients. The incidence density of pneumonia decreased from 29.3/1000 to 15.3/1000 ventilator-days after the implementation of the prevention program. Patients in the post-implementation period had significantly lower risk to develop pneumonia (hazard ratio 0.34, 95 % confidence interval 0.19–0.61, p = 0.001). At 3 months of implementation, a significant improvement was detected to all the individual bundle components. Complete compliance increased from 16.2 % to 62.2 % (p < 0.001). Compliance with bundle components decreased to baseline levels after 12 months of implementation apart from head-of-bed elevation. Conclusion: This study supports existing evidence that educational interventions improve compliance. The gained knowledge was well translated into clinical practice reflected by the decreasing ventilator-associated pneumonia rate. It may be assumed that a refresher educational session within 12 months after implementation is needed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Dub Writing in Marcia Douglas' The Marvellous Equations of the Dread: A Novel in Bass Riddim

Abstract: Michael Veal (2007, 54) "Books leave certain sounds, a certain pacing; mostly they leave the elusive, which is all the story. [...]I claim that writers of Caribbean fiction engage with structures of sound that influence on their formal choices. Using sound as the basis of its critique of historiography, Marvellous displaces the scribal/graphic as a privileged form of knowledge retention and circulation. [...]to enact herstoriography, the novel's form invokes sound as part of this critical intervention. The assertion of the island's indigenous name situates us in a time before time, in which the latter time refers to a beginning calculated by on the terms of Western conquest.10 Recalling Derek Walcott's poem "The Sea is History" (2007), this remix foregrounds the Taino woman and her tribal memory that have been denied a place in History, as there have been no monuments to commemorate her existence or significance. [...]the presence of a Taino woman narrator upends prevailing representations of arrival to the island and the region that have been routinely circulated (and believed) from the vantage point of Europeans on ships. Katherine McKittrick's (2016) work on Black feminist geographies and her articulation of place and social relations helps us understand how mapping the arrival from the perspective of the island's indigenous people shifts the mapping of the world that created a Western (ideologically) dominated world.

Abstract: Taking a deeper look Poor management of EACs The most common reason why an EAC needs to be rescued is improper management of the committee members, adjudicated data, and overall EAC process and workflow. EAC support staff concerns * High rate of turnover * Loss of knowledge between EAC support staff * Delays - not receiving responses within 24 hours * Lack of performance metrics and insights * EAC member surveys report unsatisfactory ratings * Lack of ownership and oversight of core EAC processes 3. Quality concerns * Absence of EAC templates, procedures, or tools for sponsor review * Inadequate record keeping for EAC activities (i.e., manuals, charter, system training, site guidance, meeting minutes, spend reporting) * Inadequate EAC documentation * Poor metrics or EAC performance data * High volume of backlog events that require adjudication * Average adjudication time to reach decision exceeds 10 working days * Average time for EAC vendor to process EAC records exceeds 2.5 working days * No automation of EAC workflow or lack of EAC technology * Sponsor lacks access to EAC performance dashboard * EAC member turnover * High rate of discordance among EAC members * High rate of variability between EAC members uncovered during quality control re-read workflow 4.Event identification obstacles * Challenges with event reporting process * Inadequate event identification workflows * Manual event identification processes * Discovery of missed events * Inability to programmatically detect events or detect events that require re-adjudication * Duplicate events in adjudication output * Lack of clinical and medical oversight of event identification workflow Adjudication technology challenges The adjudication system plays a critical role in the entire adjudication management process and workflow and should be assessed from the perspective of each user on the platform.

Attitudes of an international student cohort to the Quizlet study system employed in an advanced clinical health care review course

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/attitudes-international-student-cohort-quizlet/docview/2801027849/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Computer-based learning applications and mobile technology have transformed many aspects of the educational experience over the last decade, producing software aimed at improving learning efficiency and streamlining the presentation of course materials. One such class of software, purpose-created to take advantage of spaced learning and spaced testing principles, are electronic flashcard applications. We provide a perspective on the novel use of the Quizlet flashcard application in a tertiary educational setting. To reduce cognitive load for international graduate dental students taking a pharmacology review course, we implemented Quizlet, which integrates both spaced learning and self-testing, to improve the student learning experience. This study assessed students’ perceptions of the Quizlet flashcard system in a student cohort comprised of two consecutive years’ classes (n = 51 students in total). Results indicated broad acceptance of Quizlet based on ease of use of the software and ease of study of the material. Our data provide insight into the use of this common software in a professional healthcare tertiary education setting and further demonstrate the successful application of electronic flashcards for a mixed international student cohort. Further research should include an assessment of the impact of flashcard on long-term knowledge retention in this setting.

Abstract: This study examines the effects of technology-enhanced interventions in hospitality curricula using an overarching research hypothesis - Does a course that features multi-model inputs, web-based learning opportunities and interactive communications prepare students well for their internships? Through an exploration of various influences within blended learning, this study unpacks students’ responses to the pedagogical design, technology-enhanced interactions and in turn, assess for their intercultural competencies. The theoretical framework informing this study confirms the hypothesis that these multifaceted classroom activities demonstrated pedagogical effectiveness for knowledge retention. The findings showed that students’ intercultural competences were significantly promoted. Students’ learning interactions also improved due to the processes of video-making, sharing and discussions in the classroom. Moreover, these classroom activities significantly raised students’ intercultural awareness. With regards to the effectiveness of the course for internship preparation, students showed moderate levels of satisfaction. Theoretical and practical contributions to the embedding of ICT within hospitality courses are provided.

Abstract: Background Virtual reality (VR) is considered a promising approach to support learning. An instructional design is essential to optimize cognitive processes. Studies show that VR has unique instructional and pedagogical requirements. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of the modality principle, which was previously validated in 2D classic multimedia, for learning with VR. The modality principle states that multimedia information presented as spoken narration is superior to on‐screen text. Methods A prospective experimental study with two compared conditions of instruction: VR‐based learning guided by on‐screen text (n = 34) versus spoken narration ( n  = 28). Students' cognitive learning experiences were captured by eye‐tracking and electrodermal activity (EDA). In addition, students' knowledge was evaluated using a pre–post knowledge test. Results and Conclusions Overall, there was no significant difference in knowledge retention between the participants who learned with on‐screen text compared to spoken narration. However, results from the eye‐tracking analysis showed that students who learned with the on‐screen text devoted longer visual attention toward important learning activity areas of interest, suggesting a better ability to discern between relevant and irrelevant information. Conversely, students who learned with the spoken narration expressed significantly more EDA peak responses, proposing a higher cognitive load. Implications This study outlines that while learning with VR was effective, the modality principle might not apply to learning with VR. Moreover, the analysis of the learning process suggests even an inverse effect, favouring the provision of instructional scaffolds as on‐screen text. Future research should evaluate this effect on long‐term knowledge retention. Alternate abstract: Lay Description What is already known about this topic? VR can increase learners' engagement and impact their cognitive processing. VR has different instructional requirements than classic multimedia learning material. The modality principle states that audio‐visual is superior to visual‐only information. What this paper adds? This study evaluated the impact of the modality design principle to scaffolded learning with VR. In terms of achievements learning with textual and audio instruction was comparable. Eye‐tracking analysis showed that learning with on‐screen text was characterized by longer visual attention to the important learning objects. Learning with the auditory narration was associated with a higher cognitive load as measured by EDA and more performance errors. In both study conditions, students tended to focus more on the less important information in the learning activity. Implications of the study's findings for practitioners VR‐based simulations are effective to support learning and knowledge gaining. The modality principle is not fully applicable to support learning in VR‐based learning environments. Instructional design should take into consideration that novices often notice the non‐salient information in VR.

Abstract: Objectives We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of our ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention bundle implemented by education of the nursing staff, and to describe the tendency of knowledge retention. Research methodology A prospective, before-and-after study was performed. The ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention bundle was implemented through a single educational intervention of the nursing staff. The risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia over time was estimated using a Cox proportional cause-specific hazard model. Compliance to preventive measures was assessed at three time-points: before education, at three months and 12 months after education. Setting A 29-bed mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit. Main outcome measures Ventilator-associate pneumonia incidence densities, the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, and compliance to preventive measures in the pre-implementation and post-implementation periods. Results We analyzed the data of 251 patients. The incidence density of pneumonia decreased from 29.3/1000 to 15.3/1000 ventilator-days after the implementation of the prevention program. Patients in the post-implementation period had significantly lower risk to develop pneumonia (hazard ratio 0.34, 95 % confidence interval 0.19–0.61, p = 0.001). At 3 months of implementation, a significant improvement was detected to all the individual bundle components. Complete compliance increased from 16.2 % to 62.2 % (p < 0.001). Compliance with bundle components decreased to baseline levels after 12 months of implementation apart from head-of-bed elevation. Conclusion This study supports existing evidence that educational interventions improve compliance. The gained knowledge was well translated into clinical practice reflected by the decreasing ventilator-associated pneumonia rate. It may be assumed that a refresher educational session within 12 months after implementation is needed.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of learning and instruction in the digital age, microlearning provides small, targeted blocks of information to learners to enhance knowledge retention and engagement. As the demand for eLearning increases due to Covid-19 and digitally immersed learners, microlearning allows for discrete, specialized tasks combined into customized learning plans for professional development. An online microlearning course certification with gamification incentivizes participants to earn digital badges. These digital badges are micro-credentials. These digital badges signify competency-based learning through the mastery of each unit. Microlearning courses with Merrill's First Principles of instruction maximize participant knowledge and skills by proposing to solve real-world problems. With this model, learners demonstrate that they learn the material through measurable gains in performance competencies. The literature review explores microlearning and micro-credentialing and a theoretical framework that combines connectivism, Merrill's First Principles of Instruction, and competency-based learning. With the self-paced component of microlearning, participants take ownership of their learning experience and thus, increase their motivation to learn.

Abstract: This study examines the effects of technology-enhanced interventions in hospitality curricula using an overarching research hypothesis-Does a course that features multi-model inputs, web-based learning opportunities and interactive communications prepare students well for their internships? Through an exploration of various influences within blended learning, this study unpacks students’ responses to the pedagogical design, technology-enhanced interactions and in turn, assess for their intercultural competencies. The theoretical framework informing this study confirms the hypothesis that these multifaceted classroom activities demonstrated pedagogical effectiveness for knowledge retention. The findings showed that students’ intercultural competences were significantly promoted. Students’ learning interactions also improved due to the processes of video-making, sharing and discussions in the classroom. Moreover, these classroom activities significantly raised students’ intercultural awareness. With regards to the effectiveness of the course for internship preparation, students showed moderate levels of satisfaction. Theoretical and practical contributions to the embedding of ICT within hospitality courses are provided. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: The overall burden of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affecting the skin is undetermined. Skin conditions are among the top 10 causes of disability worldwide. Affected persons seek treatment at advanced stages of the disease, resulting in morbidity and disability. We developed and evaluated an integrated training intervention for early case detection, referral and management of skin NTDs in two states in Nigeria. BACKGROUND The overall burden of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affecting the skin is undetermined. Skin conditions are among the top 10 causes of disability worldwide. Affected persons seek treatment at advanced stages of the disease, resulting in morbidity and disability. We developed and evaluated an integrated training intervention for early case detection, referral and management of skin NTDs in two states in Nigeria.This was a mixed-methods study using participatory approaches to develop specific skin algorithms and training packages for community and primary level health workers. This supported the identification, referral and clinical diagnosis of suspected cases. We used Kirkpatrick's model to evaluate the training package. METHODS This was a mixed-methods study using participatory approaches to develop specific skin algorithms and training packages for community and primary level health workers. This supported the identification, referral and clinical diagnosis of suspected cases. We used Kirkpatrick's model to evaluate the training package.Participants' knowledge improved after the 2-months intervention. Across both states, knowledge retention appeared more robust for cadres at all levels: state, local government area and primary healthcare. All (100%) participants mentioned that the training assisted them in detecting, referring and managing skin NTDs. Training was understood by participants and training materials were easy to understand. Materials were also effective in educating community members about the symptoms of NTDs and supported referral to facilities for appropriate management. RESULTS Participants' knowledge improved after the 2-months intervention. Across both states, knowledge retention appeared more robust for cadres at all levels: state, local government area and primary healthcare. All (100%) participants mentioned that the training assisted them in detecting, referring and managing skin NTDs. Training was understood by participants and training materials were easy to understand. Materials were also effective in educating community members about the symptoms of NTDs and supported referral to facilities for appropriate management.Community implementers can be trained and supervised to detect people affected by skin NTDs and support appropriate management within the existing patient care pathway. CONCLUSIONS Community implementers can be trained and supervised to detect people affected by skin NTDs and support appropriate management within the existing patient care pathway.

Abstract: Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) Nevada applied the ECHO virtual hub-and-spoke telementoring model over nine 6-week cohorts (between November 2019 and November 2021) supporting community health workers (CHWs) who advise clients with diabetes or pre-diabetes. This study describes the program implementation, including evaluation data collection efforts. Didactic topics included 'Intro to Healthy Eating and Easy Wins' to 'Grocery Shopping, Cooking Tips, Reading Labels, Meal Plans' and 'Reducing Bias and Being a Good Role Model'. Spoke participants signed up to review cases. Seventy-three of the enrolled participants (n = 100) attended three or more of the six sessions. Spoke participants completed 42 case presentations. The average self-efficacy increased from 2.7 [standard deviation (SD): 1.1] before completing the program to 4.1 (SD: 0.8) after completing the program. Average knowledge scores increased from 71 (SD: 16) before completing the program to 83 (SD: 14) after completing the program. Five group interviews drew actionable feedback that was incorporated into the program. Key elements of the ECHO model were successfully incorporated to support educational goals of a cohort of CHWs in nutritional coaching. Our program evaluation data tracking system shows non-significant but encouraging results regarding self-efficacy improvement and knowledge retention.Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) Nevada applied the ECHO virtual hub-and-spoke telementoring model over nine 6-week cohorts (between November 2019 and November 2021) supporting community health workers (CHWs) who advise clients with diabetes or pre-diabetes.

Abstract: Some research projects arrive gracefully at a natural conclusion, such as when a trainee leaves the laboratory. Knowledge retention and transfer is key to any research lab, but can be difficult when a project's lead researcher leaves. Lab notebooks, physical or electronic, are useful resources to restart projects that ended when lab members leave and are busy with their new jobs. Molly Shoichet is a professor of chemical engineering and applied chemistry at the University of Toronto, Canada.

Abstract: The transition to specialization of knowledge within populations could have facilitated the accumulation of cultural complexity in humans. Specialization allows populations to increase their cultural repertoire without requiring that members of that population increase their individual capacity to accumulate knowledge. However, specialization also means that domain-specific knowledge can be concentrated in small subsets of the population, making it more susceptible to loss. Here, we use a model of cultural evolution to demonstrate that specialized populations can be more sensitive to stochastic loss of knowledge than populations without subdivision of knowledge, and that demographic and environmental changes have an amplified effect on populations with knowledge specialization. Finally, we suggest that specialization can be a double-edged sword; specialized populations may have an advantage in accumulating cultural traits but may also be less likely to expand and establish themselves successfully in new demes owing to the increased cultural loss that they experience during the population bottlenecks that often characterize such expansions. This article is part of the theme issue 'Human socio-cultural evolution in light of evolutionary transitions'.The transition to specialization of knowledge within populations could have facilitated the accumulation of cultural complexity in humans.

Abstract: Interpreting an electrocardiogram (ECG) is crucial for every physician. The physician's competency in ECG interpretation needs to be improved at any stage of medical education. The aim of the present study was to review the currently published clinical trials of ECG teaching to medical students and provide suggestions for future works. On May 1, 2022, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ERIC were searched to retrieve relevant articles on clinical trials of ECG teaching to medical students. The quality of the included studies was assessed utilizing the Buckley et al . criteria. The screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal processes were duplicated independently. In case of disagreements, consultation with a third author was put forth. In total, 861 citations were found in the databases. After screening abstracts and full texts, 23 studies were deemed eligible. The majority of the studies were of good quality. Peer teaching (7 studies), self-directed learning (6 studies), web-based learning (10 studies), and various assessment modalities (3 studies) comprised the key themes of the studies. Various methods of ECG teaching were encountered in the reviewed studies. Future studies in ECG training should focus on novel and creative teaching methods, the extent to which self-directed learning can be effective, the utility of peer teaching, and the implications of computer-assisted ECG interpretation (e.g., artificial intelligence) for medical students. Long-term knowledge retention assessment studies based on different approaches integrated with clinical outcomes could be beneficial in determining the most efficient modalities.

Knowledge Retention and Changes in Licensed Chainsaw Workers’ risk awareness

Author: Häggström, Carola1    ; Edlund, Björn11 Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Department of Forest Biomaterials and Technology, Umeå, Sweden (GRID:grid.6341.0) (ISNI:0000 0000 8578 2742)

Abstract: Work with chainsaws is hazardous and felling trees is the activity with the highest risks for injuries and fatalities. While industrial forestry is increasingly mechanized, manual felling is still the main work method for private, small-scale forest owners. During this work, the workers’ safety heavily depends on their skill and safe practice, so training is presumably important for preventing injuries and reducing fatalities. Unfortunately, private forest owners have been difficult to reach with this kind of safety intervention. Moreover, target chainsaw users are not likely to repeat the training very frequently. Hence, the training must both be effective and be so for many years to come. This paper addresses the knowledge retention and self-reported changes in behaviour of 682 chainsaw users who passed the exam for the Swedish chainsaw licence 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9 years previously. Acquisition of the licence resulted in a strong increase in 98% of the participants’ risk awareness and safe work practices. Less than half (45%) of the participants passed a re-test equivalent to the theoretical examination for the chainsaw licence. Private forest owners performed somewhat better than employees did. The main indicator of retained knowledge of safe chainsaw handling was frequency of practice the previous year. After one year, the test results did not deteriorate with additional time. Based on those results, the best practice is to ensure regular usage of the chainsaw and refresher training when the chainsaw has not been used for a year.

Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this two-part study is to systematically review, analyze and critically synthesize the current state of empirical research on knowledge loss induced by organizational member turnover (KLT). Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was conducted based on 91 empirical studies on KLT. Findings Part I of the study contributes to the advancement of KLT scholarship by mapping key developments in empirical research on KLT (publication trends, methodological and theoretical foci, heterogeneity of geographical, industrial and organizational contexts); encapsulating KLT antecedents associated with both voluntary and involuntary turnover; and revealing a broad scope of KLT effects at organizational and unit level. Research limitations/implications This study has limitations related to inclusion/exclusion criteria used for creating the review sample and the “Antecedents–Phenomenon–Outcomes” logic used to synthesize the findings. Originality/value Part I of the study offers a systematic synthesis of KLT empirical research with respect to KLT antecedents, outcomes and factors affecting them.

Abstract: Studies on human anatomy mainly depend on cadaver dissection. New technology devices have progressed to improve anatomy teaching, such as the 3D Anatomage virtual dissection table. There is a shortage and deficiency in information about the uses and benefits of the Anatomage table. The aim of this article was to review and assess the current evidence about the advantages of the Anatomage virtual table in medical education and curricula of medical courses, and its utility in diagnosis. The current study is a comprehensive systematic review. A search was conducted on online medical and scientific databases. Twenty-nine articles relevant to the content of the current research topic were selected. Based on this review, the use of the Anatomage table is valuable for anatomy learning outcomes, and most of the research supported it as an important anatomy tool in addition to cadaveric dissection. The Anatomage table in association with human dissection can improve knowledge retention of anatomy. It is an important tool for understanding organ variation. Anatomage is now considered an important tool for the educational training programs of medical students and residents and for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Anatomage can make the curriculum more interesting and valuable. Utilizing the Anatomage table can help medical and paramedical students and residents by assisting them to understand anatomy in a better way. It will also improve radiological knowledge and facilitate pre-planning for surgeries. Finally, it has a crucial role during exceptional circumstances such as pandemics.Studies on human anatomy mainly depend on cadaver dissection.

Abstract: Students' knowledge retention decreases overtime when experiencing large-group teaching. Engaging class activities improve student learning. We report the rapid changes in teaching methods and measurable learning outcomes on the topic of kidney pharmacotherapy (KP) in a doctor of pharmacy program. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Students' knowledge retention decreases overtime when experiencing large-group teaching. Engaging class activities improve student learning. We report the rapid changes in teaching methods and measurable learning outcomes on the topic of kidney pharmacotherapy (KP) in a doctor of pharmacy program.The KP modules were delivered using two different methods, traditional lecture (TL) (in-person class) and interactive strategies of online learning (ISOL), to fourth-year pharmacy students during the academic years 2019 and 2020, respectively. This study aimed to compare the learning outcomes from TL and ISOL examinations. Students' perceptions regarding their new learning experiences were also explored. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND SETTING The KP modules were delivered using two different methods, traditional lecture (TL) (in-person class) and interactive strategies of online learning (ISOL), to fourth-year pharmacy students during the academic years 2019 and 2020, respectively. This study aimed to compare the learning outcomes from TL and ISOL examinations. Students' perceptions regarding their new learning experiences were also explored.A total of 226 students were included in the study (TL, n = 118; ISOL, n = 108). The median percentage of the overall score from the ISOL examinations was higher than that achieved by the TL class (73% vs. 67%, P = .003). Further analyses revealed similar improvements in most learning outcomes and cognitive domains. A higher proportion of students taught through ISOL achieved scores >80% than those in the TL group (39% vs. 16%, P  80% than those in the TL group (39% vs. 16%, P < .001). The student respondents provided positive feedback regarding activities in the ISOL cohort.The delivery of online KP when integrated with interactive strategies can maintain the outcome-based learning in Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University. Approaches that aid student engagement during teaching and learning become opportunities for the improvement of education adaptability. SUMMARY The delivery of online KP when integrated with interactive strategies can maintain the outcome-based learning in Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University. Approaches that aid student engagement during teaching and learning become opportunities for the improvement of education adaptability.

Abstract: The COVID‐19 outbreak has created turbulence and uncertainty into multiple aspects of life in countries around the world. In China, the pandemic continues to pose a great challenge to the nature of traditional in‐class education in schools. Chinese education has faced the difficult decision of whether to resume in‐person teaching in an unprecedented and time‐pressured manner. To ensure the quality of teaching and learning during this time, this study aims to explore the effectiveness of an “online + in‐person” hybrid teaching model with a new three‐part approach to the hybrid teaching lab, where students prepare for the in‐person lab using virtual simulated experiments and learning modules and debrief their learning afterwards online as well. This approach not only enhances the efficiency during the in‐person lab but also strongly reinforces concepts and laboratory skills by providing a “practice run” before physically attending the lab. A total of 400 medical undergraduates from Dalian Medical University in China were recruited for this study. In an undergraduate molecular biology laboratory course, we observed 200 students in a hybrid teaching model. We evaluated the learning outcomes from the “online + in‐person” hybrid teaching model with a questionnaire survey and assessed the quality of experiment execution, report writing, and group collaboration. Moreover, the 200 students from the hybrid group were evaluated during an annual science competition at the university and compared to 200 students from the competition cohort who had no experience with a hybrid learning model. The comparison data were analyzed using a student's t‐test statistical analysis. The students in the hybrid learning group demonstrated a strong enthusiasm for the model, high amount of time utilizing the online system, and high scores on laboratory evaluation assignments. Approximately 98% of the hybrid learning students reported that they preferred mixed teaching to the traditional teaching mode, and all students scored above 96% on the online laboratory report. Teachers of the course observed that the hybrid group had a noticeably higher level of proficiency in lab skills compared to the previous students. At the Dalian Medical University annual science competition, where we compared our hybrid group to a traditional learning group, scores for both the objective and subjective items showed that the students instructed with the hybrid lab model had superior performance ( p  < 0.05). In the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic, we developed a new three‐part molecular biology laboratory course that strongly improved students' laboratory skills, knowledge retention, and enthusiasm for the course using online learning to improve their learning efficiency and expedite the in‐person laboratory experience. We found that these students performed at a higher level in a combined theoretical/practical science competition compared to the students in traditional in‐person lab courses. Additionally, our model subjectively fostered enthusiasm and excellence in both teachers and students. Further, cultivation of the students' independent learning and creative problem solving skills were emphasized. The exploration of an effective teaching model, such as the one described here, not only provides students with a solid foundation for their future medical studies and career development but also promotes more efficient in‐person laboratory time.

Abstract: The inclusion of music is central to early education pedagogy as an efficient means of conveying information and a mechanism for knowledge retention, yet these tools are generally omitted from higher educational approaches. Drawing on prior studies highlighting how musical assignments successfully supplemented traditional criminal justice coursework, a criminological theory course was redesigned with music as a core component. Musical selections were included and discussed in each class meeting as well as being tied to class assignments within a pilot course. Teaching techniques were refined over several semesters with the revised course framework including more student involvement, somewhat approaching a flipped classroom model whereby the instructor and students equally shared musical selections relevant to course curriculum. The instructor perceived students were more invested in the course. The professor-student dynamic also appeared to become more intimate due to both sharing music about which they were personally passionate. Further, the instructor’s inclusion of crime-specific songs from older musical genres appeared to disrupt students’ stereotypes associating crime with other genres and demographics.

Abstract: Background and Importance High-alert medications (HAMs) have higher risks of causing harm to patients. To prevent this, our hospital pharmacy trained 147 healthcare professionals (HCPs) on this topic using a fun educational tool in puzzle form: PUIzzle (PUI is the French acronym for internal use pharmacy), which has significantly improved short-term knowledge on HAMs. However, its impact on long-term knowledge retention is not known. 1 Aim and Objectives To evaluate PUIzzle’s impact on HCPs’ knowledge retention and its contribution to professional practices. Material and Methods Our monocentric study took place in a 300-bed hospital in Paris region (France) between January and August 2022. No ethical approval for the study was requested. HCPs’ knowledge was assessed with a self-questionnaire administered 3 weeks after the training (3WAT). The first part focused on professional practices. The second part was identical to the pre- and post-training knowledge questionnaire, to compare the scores of the pre-training (PrT), post-training (PoT) and 3WAT questionnaires. The third part had five other questions on HAMs. Results Of the 141 eligible HCPs, 60 completed the 3WAT (31 nurses, 13 pharmacy technicians, 5 paramedical students, 4 caregivers, 6 healthcare students and 1 pharmacist) in a mean time of 3.6 months (σ=1.37), 48 were lost to follow-up and 33 did not respond. Fifty-two (87%) HCPs could situate one of the two HAMs’ location list, and 44 (75%) could identify HAMs on the prescription software. Most changes in practice were observed at the prescribing level (n=31; 52%). HCPs declared being more attentive to HAMs’ labelling. The mean score of PrT, PoT and 3WAT’ second part were respectively 1.1/5 (σ=0.04), 3.1/5 (σ=0.14) and 2.5/5 (σ=0.33). A significant improvement between PrT and 3WAT (p<0.03) and a non-statistical decrease between PoT and 3WAT (p<0.17) were observed. The 3WAT’s third part mean score was identical to the second one (σ=0.27). Conclusion and Relevance PUIzzle’s impact is positive on HCPs’ practices and overall knowledge retention on HAMs. Therefore, our hospital will organise regular training sessions, and this training will be transposed into continuing professional education.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/o-329-operating-management-system-integrated/docview/2788065665/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Introduction Operating Management System (OMS) is a universally validated framework that provides a systematic and consistent approach by managing four risks – People, Plant, Process and Performance for managing the Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) performance and improve quality. A leading Indian petrochemical conglomerate introduced this framework that defines a set of operating requirements setting out a systematic way to improve operations towards building a sustainable organization. We have used protocols for occupational health monitoring, tasked based industrial hygiene monitoring and job specific PPE under the OMS and seek to show the subsequent changes in safety and health-related outcomes. Material and Methods This study seeks to prove how the implementation of OMS has defined changes in People Risk Management through comparison of specific outcomes before and after the introduction of the intervention. These observations are based in the hydrocarbon production and refining business stretching across manufacturing and refining facilities. The implementation process initiated with internalisation of the OMS framework enabled through digital platform. Risk management was reinforced with technical risk analysis and putting in place mitigation measures through the project lifecycle by cross functional competent and experienced teams. In addition, developing a robust risk culture has been a focus, which included enhancing risk management competency among the leadership and the asset facing personnel. Results Health index of the organisation, a composite indicator has moved from 87 to 89 per cent and the Emergency Management System score improved to nearly 94 per cent from 87 per cent subsequent to OMS. There has been an increase in collection of personal monitoring samples for noise (254 from 130) and toxic chemicals (234 from 55). There has been a reduction in the tonnages for Highly Toxic Material Inventory for ammonia, chlorine and hydrofluoric acid. The lost days have reduced from 5822 to 4374. Total 1184 high risk activities as per OH health hazards were identified through Risk assessment which were taken as workplace improvement projects and risk level has been reduce to Moderate and low level by implementing engineering control and 100% PPE compliance. There is significant reduction in LTIFR (per million man-hours) (Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate) to 0.13, year 2021–22 and improvement in uptime of the assets. Conclusion OMS is very useful platform for continual improvement and significant reduction of HSE risk even with expanding businesses and newer challenges to the organization. As the experienced professional superannuate from the workplace and younger generation take charge, the OMS framework helps in knowledge retention and codification of skill and experience.

Abstract: Oncology Nursing Practice To improve overall education and training for oncology nurses, we created new teaching strategies and tested them using surveys and knowledge checks. Simulations with hands-on activities have been proven to help increase nurses' confidence, interest in working with oncology patients, and administering chemotherapy. This year, we added virtual gaming to the curriculum. Due to COVID-19 constraints and limited access to clinical experience, new nurses at our LTACH facility requested more virtual education. This led to the development of virtual gaming to supplement classroom learning and provide an engaging way for nurses to learn about oncology and site-specific policies. In the previous simulation curriculum, oncology nursing topics were covered in a classroom style lecture. The material typically covered in the classroom was adapted to a gaming platform through videos, PowerPoint slides, and interactive questions, with courses like "Intro to Oncology Nursing, Hazardous Medications, + Central Line Care," and "Intro to Chemotherapy Administration for Oncology Nursing." These topics were chosen based on feedback from oncology nurses.. The first group of nurses completed gaming in person with staff to help. Nurses gave feedback, then subsequent groups were allowed to complete the assigned gaming at home. Nurses provided positive feedback on the addition of gaming to the simulation oncology program. Feedback included gaming was interactive, informative, and interesting. Nurses also reported the use of simulation and gaming together increased their level of confidence in safely administering chemo and caring for oncology patients. One nurse said, "Gaming was a nice tool to review materials prior to simulation and then be able to ask questions in person on the day of sim." The addition of gaming resulted in more engagement, less time spent in the classroom, and nurses being more prepared. Nurses were able to repeat games as many times as they wished, so this allowed them to review areas multiple times. The addition of gaming did not result in a decrease in knowledge retention. With the restraints on classroom sizes due to COVID, gaming has allowed more nurses to continue to participate in educational programs while also being able to promote social distancing.

Abstract: This study proposes a mobile application as a new approach for first-year student orientation to promote knowledge of library services using the gamification concept. The application is based on mobile devices with GPS to locate students, allowing them to catch, collect, and battle monsters around the library with questions on library service instructions. To evaluate the learning effectiveness of the approach, we performed a comparative experiment in which the control group used e-learning, while the experimental group used the mobile application of the CMU Journey. We evaluated the pre-and post-test scores, delayed 1-month post-test scores, and intrinsic motivation based on the IMI questionnaire. The results demonstrated that the preference for gamified experience among students can enhance knowledge retention and intrinsic motivation compared to other groups.

Abstract: In this paper, the researchers report an experimental study on conceptual knowledge learning and application through embodied interactions, expecting that bodily movements would facilitate learning in a positive manner. The intervention was enabled by Unity3D and Kinect V2, and taught novice adult learners the concepts of and conversions between binary and decimal numbers. Fifty-three adult participants were recruited, and randomly assigned into the experimental and control groups. During the intervention, participants in the experimental group manipulated and interacted with the learning materials through their body movements enabled by Kinect; while those in the control group learned the same content but interacted using conventional mouse and keyboard. Pre- and posttests results indicated that embodied interactions facilitated conceptual learning for the participating adult learners. However, compared with the mouse interaction, the embodied interactions did not lead to significantly better knowledge retention and application results. The study outcome implies that embodied interactions do not necessarily lead to better learning performances over traditional mouse-based interactions, and the ‘how’ and ‘how much’ may play critical roles for such interventions. Suggestions and challenges in designing learning systems utilizing embodied interactions enabled by novel technologies are provided.

Abstract: The COVID-19 outbreak has created turbulence and uncertainty into multiple aspects of life in countries around the world. In China, the pandemic continues to pose a great challenge to the nature of traditional in-class education in schools. Chinese education has faced the difficult decision of whether to resume in-person teaching in an unprecedented and time-pressured manner. To ensure the quality of teaching and learning during this time, this study aims to explore the effectiveness of an "online + in-person" hybrid teaching model with a new three-part approach to the hybrid teaching lab, where students prepare for the in-person lab using virtual simulated experiments and learning modules and debrief their learning afterwards online as well. This approach not only enhances the efficiency during the in-person lab but also strongly reinforces concepts and laboratory skills by providing a "practice run" before physically attending the lab. A total of 400 medical undergraduates from Dalian Medical University in China were recruited for this study. In an undergraduate molecular biology laboratory course, we observed 200 students in a hybrid teaching model. We evaluated the learning outcomes from the "online + in-person" hybrid teaching model with a questionnaire survey and assessed the quality of experiment execution, report writing, and group collaboration. Moreover, the 200 students from the hybrid group were evaluated during an annual science competition at the university and compared to 200 students from the competition cohort who had no experience with a hybrid learning model. The comparison data were analyzed using a student's t-test statistical analysis. The students in the hybrid learning group demonstrated a strong enthusiasm for the model, high amount of time utilizing the online system, and high scores on laboratory evaluation assignments. Approximately 98% of the hybrid learning students reported that they preferred mixed teaching to the traditional teaching mode, and all students scored above 96% on the online laboratory report. Teachers of the course observed that the hybrid group had a noticeably higher level of proficiency in lab skills compared to the previous students. At the Dalian Medical University annual science competition, where we compared our hybrid group to a traditional learning group, scores for both the objective and subjective items showed that the students instructed with the hybrid lab model had superior performance (p < 0.05). In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a new three-part molecular biology laboratory course that strongly improved students' laboratory skills, knowledge retention, and enthusiasm for the course using online learning to improve their learning efficiency and expedite the in-person laboratory experience. We found that these students performed at a higher level in a combined theoretical/practical science competition compared to the students in traditional in-person lab courses. Additionally, our model subjectively fostered enthusiasm and excellence in both teachers and students. Further, cultivation of the students' independent learning and creative problem solving skills were emphasized. The exploration of an effective teaching model, such as the one described here, not only provides students with a solid foundation for their future medical studies and career development but also promotes more efficient in-person laboratory time.The COVID-19 outbreak has created turbulence and uncertainty into multiple aspects of life in countries around the world.

Abstract: Within the scope of an educational improvement project, the teaching concept of the course hygiene and microbiology at the Goethe-University in Frankfurt was transferred from an organ system-based teaching concept into a case-based teaching concept. Concomitantly, this transformation was qualitatively reviewed to evaluate self-perceived learning success. BACKGROUND Within the scope of an educational improvement project, the teaching concept of the course hygiene and microbiology at the Goethe-University in Frankfurt was transferred from an organ system-based teaching concept into a case-based teaching concept. Concomitantly, this transformation was qualitatively reviewed to evaluate self-perceived learning success.54 participants were included in this qualitative study. 45 students were interviewed in homogeneous focus groups of up to five. Nine physicians were interviewed individually. Following anonymization and transcription, a structured and qualitative text analysis was conducted. METHODS 54 participants were included in this qualitative study. 45 students were interviewed in homogeneous focus groups of up to five. Nine physicians were interviewed individually. Following anonymization and transcription, a structured and qualitative text analysis was conducted.Both groups, students and physicians, prefer a case-based teaching concept in hygiene and microbiology, especially in combination with a hands-on approach to learn practical skills. Students taught with the case-based approach were more satisfied and reported better knowledge retention. The practical elements of the course hygiene and microbiology were positively remembered by all participants. Regardless of the teaching concept, the individual lecturer is considered most essential in shaping motivation. RESULTS Both groups, students and physicians, prefer a case-based teaching concept in hygiene and microbiology, especially in combination with a hands-on approach to learn practical skills. Students taught with the case-based approach were more satisfied and reported better knowledge retention. The practical elements of the course hygiene and microbiology were positively remembered by all participants. Regardless of the teaching concept, the individual lecturer is considered most essential in shaping motivation.Overall, the implementation of a case-based teaching concept with practical elements in the course hygiene and microbiology increases the ability of medical students to understand the relevance of core knowledge and improves self-perceived learning. The fusion of theoretical and clinical contents elements in the course hygiene and microbiology meets the new national medical licensing regulations in Germany and promises to be a sustainable concept for clinical-theoretical subjects like hygiene and microbiology. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the implementation of a case-based teaching concept with practical elements in the course hygiene and microbiology increases the ability of medical students to understand the relevance of core knowledge and improves self-perceived learning. The fusion of theoretical and clinical contents elements in the course hygiene and microbiology meets the new national medical licensing regulations in Germany and promises to be a sustainable concept for clinical-theoretical subjects like hygiene and microbiology.

Abstract: This study investigated the effects of an online module intended to educate dental students about Spanish terms and phrases relevant to a patient appointment. Effects investigated included perceived value of dental Spanish, confidence utilizing Spanish terms in a patient appointment, and degree of knowledge retention. PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES This study investigated the effects of an online module intended to educate dental students about Spanish terms and phrases relevant to a patient appointment. Effects investigated included perceived value of dental Spanish, confidence utilizing Spanish terms in a patient appointment, and degree of knowledge retention.This study utilized pre- and postsurvey data collected from three classes at one US dental institution (D2-D4) via an online measure accompanying the virtual educational module. Questions assessed degree of accurate knowledge retained, level of confidence, perceived value of dental Spanish, language proficiency, and year in school. METHODS This study utilized pre- and postsurvey data collected from three classes at one US dental institution (D2-D4) via an online measure accompanying the virtual educational module. Questions assessed degree of accurate knowledge retained, level of confidence, perceived value of dental Spanish, language proficiency, and year in school.Predoctoral dental students in three cohorts participated in the study (97% and 87% pre/post-test response rate, respectively). Most students reported dental Spanish to be beneficial and necessary. However, the intervention did not influence students' perceived value of dental Spanish. Students who disagreed that dental Spanish was valuable performed significantly worse on the postintervention knowledge assessment when compared to those students who positively reported value of dental Spanish. The intervention significantly increased confidence levels overall regarding use of dental Spanish in a patient appointment. Significant knowledge acquisition occurred for each of the components assessed. RESULTS Predoctoral dental students in three cohorts participated in the study (97% and 87% pre/post-test response rate, respectively). Most students reported dental Spanish to be beneficial and necessary. However, the intervention did not influence students' perceived value of dental Spanish. Students who disagreed that dental Spanish was valuable performed significantly worse on the postintervention knowledge assessment when compared to those students who positively reported value of dental Spanish. The intervention significantly increased confidence levels overall regarding use of dental Spanish in a patient appointment. Significant knowledge acquisition occurred for each of the components assessed.A brief online educational intervention can effectively increase dental students' knowledge of and confidence utilizing Spanish terms commonly employed during a patient appointment. Perceived value of dental Spanish is high and impacts students' knowledge retention but is not affected by education alone. CONCLUSION(S) A brief online educational intervention can effectively increase dental students' knowledge of and confidence utilizing Spanish terms commonly employed during a patient appointment. Perceived value of dental Spanish is high and impacts students' knowledge retention but is not affected by education alone.

Abstract: In this paper, the researchers report an experimental study on conceptual knowledge learning and application through embodied interactions, expecting that bodily movements would facilitate learning in a positive manner. The intervention was enabled by Unity3D and Kinect V2, and taught novice adult learners the concepts of and conversions between binary and decimal numbers. Fifty-three adult participants were recruited, and randomly assigned into the experimental and control groups. During the intervention, participants in the experimental group manipulated and interacted with the learning materials through their body movements enabled by Kinect; while those in the control group learned the same content but interacted using conventional mouse and keyboard. Pre- and posttests results indicated that embodied interactions facilitated conceptual learning for the participating adult learners. However, compared with the mouse interaction, the embodied interactions did not lead to significantly better knowledge retention and application results. The study outcome implies that embodied interactions do not necessarily lead to better learning performances over traditional mouse-based interactions, and the ‘how’ and ‘how much’ may play critical roles for such interventions.

Abstract: The anatomy curriculum has undergone considerable reductions in class time, resulting in decreased student anatomical knowledge retention and confidence during their surgical rotations. To counter this deficit in anatomy knowledge, a clinical anatomy mentorship program (CAMP) was developed by fourth-year medical student leaders and staff mentors in a near-peer teaching fashion prior to the surgical clerkship. This study analyzed the impact this program had on third-year medical students (MS3s) self-assessed anatomical knowledge and confidence in the operating room on the Breast Surgical Oncology rotation after this near-peer program. BACKGROUND The anatomy curriculum has undergone considerable reductions in class time, resulting in decreased student anatomical knowledge retention and confidence during their surgical rotations. To counter this deficit in anatomy knowledge, a clinical anatomy mentorship program (CAMP) was developed by fourth-year medical student leaders and staff mentors in a near-peer teaching fashion prior to the surgical clerkship. This study analyzed the impact this program had on third-year medical students (MS3s) self-assessed anatomical knowledge and confidence in the operating room on the Breast Surgical Oncology rotation after this near-peer program.A single-center prospective survey study was performed at an academic medical center. Pre- and post-program surveys were administered to all students who participated in the CAMP and rotated on the breast surgical oncology (BSO) service during the surgery clerkship rotation. A control group of individuals who did not rotate on the CAMP was established, and this group was administered a retrospective survey. A 5-point Likert scale was used to assess surgical anatomy knowledge, confidence in the operating room, and comfort in assisting in the operating room. Control group versus post-CAMP intervention group and pre- versus post-CAMP intervention groups survey results were compared using the Student's t-test with a p -value of <0.05 statistically significant. METHODS A single-center prospective survey study was performed at an academic medical center. Pre- and post-program surveys were administered to all students who participated in the CAMP and rotated on the breast surgical oncology (BSO) service during the surgery clerkship rotation. A control group of individuals who did not rotate on the CAMP was established, and this group was administered a retrospective survey. A 5-point Likert scale was used to assess surgical anatomy knowledge, confidence in the operating room, and comfort in assisting in the operating room. Control group versus post-CAMP intervention group and pre- versus post-CAMP intervention groups survey results were compared using the Student's t-test with a p-value of <0.05 statistically significant.All CAMP students rated their surgical anatomy knowledge ( p < 0.01), confidence in the operating room ( p < 0.01), and comfort in assisting in the operating room ( p < 0.01) as greater than those who did not participate in the program. Additionally, the program improved the ability of third-year medical students to prepare for operating room cases going into their third-year breast surgical oncology clerkship ( p < 0.03). RESULTS All CAMP students rated their surgical anatomy knowledge (p < 0.01), confidence in the operating room (p < 0.01), and comfort in assisting in the operating room (p < 0.01) as greater than those who did not participate in the program. Additionally, the program improved the ability of third-year medical students to prepare for operating room cases going into their third-year breast surgical oncology clerkship (p < 0.03).This near-peer surgical education model appears to be an effective way to prepare third-year medical students for the breast surgical oncology rotation during the surgery clerkship by improving anatomic knowledge and student confidence. The program can serve as a template for medical students, surgical clerkship directors, and other faculty interested in efficiently expanding surgical anatomy at their institution. CONCLUSIONS This near-peer surgical education model appears to be an effective way to prepare third-year medical students for the breast surgical oncology rotation during the surgery clerkship by improving anatomic knowledge and student confidence. The program can serve as a template for medical students, surgical clerkship directors, and other faculty interested in efficiently expanding surgical anatomy at their institution.

Abstract: Obstetric ultrasound has become a routine part of antenatal care in many parts of the world including low income settings. However, there is a shortage of radiologists and sonographers to perform routine obstetric scans in many areas especially in the rural settings of low income countries, despite having equipment available to do this. As a result, Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) has been suggested to bridge this gap by training other health workers such as midwives to perform basic obstetric ultrasound as part of their clinical care. BACKGROUND Obstetric ultrasound has become a routine part of antenatal care in many parts of the world including low income settings. However, there is a shortage of radiologists and sonographers to perform routine obstetric scans in many areas especially in the rural settings of low income countries, despite having equipment available to do this. As a result, Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) has been suggested to bridge this gap by training other health workers such as midwives to perform basic obstetric ultrasound as part of their clinical care.It was a prospective cohort pilot study in which trained midwives in point of care obstetric ultrasound were followed up at 6 months post training to assess their knowledge retention. Eleven trained midwives were purposively selected and followed up for knowledge retention. These were trained for 6 weeks and were given a knowledge assessment immediately after training, then given an assessment at 6 months following training. Data was analyzed using SPSS. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare assessments and perceived knowledge as well as Spearman correlation to test the relationship between the number of scans performed and exam assessments, knowledge and exam assessments, and number of scans and knowledge. METHODS It was a prospective cohort pilot study in which trained midwives in point of care obstetric ultrasound were followed up at 6 months post training to assess their knowledge retention. Eleven trained midwives were purposively selected and followed up for knowledge retention. These were trained for 6 weeks and were given a knowledge assessment immediately after training, then given an assessment at 6 months following training. Data was analyzed using SPSS. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare assessments and perceived knowledge as well as Spearman correlation to test the relationship between the number of scans performed and exam assessments, knowledge and exam assessments, and number of scans and knowledge.There were eleven midwives, all female with an average age of 42.3 years. The mean exam score (out of 50) was 44.2 at the end of the training and 42.9 at 6-months follow up. The midwives demonstrated higher perceived knowledge at the end of the training when compared to the 6-months follow up. However, this perceived higher knowledge was not statistically significant when correlated with the exam scores either at the end of the training or at the follow up of 6 months. RESULTS There were eleven midwives, all female with an average age of 42.3 years. The mean exam score (out of 50) was 44.2 at the end of the training and 42.9 at 6-months follow up. The midwives demonstrated higher perceived knowledge at the end of the training when compared to the 6-months follow up. However, this perceived higher knowledge was not statistically significant when correlated with the exam scores either at the end of the training or at the follow up of 6 months.This pilot study has demonstrated that training midwives in point of care obstetric ultrasound can result into acceptable levels of knowledge retention that assist the midwives to apply this knowledge when making routine clinical decisions in relation to pregnant women. CONCLUSION This pilot study has demonstrated that training midwives in point of care obstetric ultrasound can result into acceptable levels of knowledge retention that assist the midwives to apply this knowledge when making routine clinical decisions in relation to pregnant women.

Abstract: Comprehensive education regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) pathogenesis, vaccination, and patient counseling are not routinely included in the medical school curriculum; consequently, student and provider knowledge, especially concerning head and neck pathology, remains low. The objective of this study was to demonstrate long-term retention of HPV knowledge and positive attitudes towards HPV vaccination after attending our novel HPV workshop, with a focus on knowledge of oropharyngeal cancer. A follow-up survey was administered to medical students 1.5 years after the initial completion of the workshop. HPV vaccination records from the student-led clinic were collected from the immunization information system. Awareness that HPV causes oropharyngeal cancer was present in 33% of medical students pre-curriculum; immediate and long-term post-curricular awareness of this association remained at 90% or higher ( p < 0.0001). Comfort with HPV counseling, having enough information to recommend the vaccine, and knowledge of HPV malignancies, symptoms, transmission, and vaccination schedule remained persistently elevated over pre-curriculum scores ( p < 0.05). Long-term knowledge scores were also higher than a control group of medical students at the same stage of training who had never participated in the workshop ( p < 0.05). HPV vaccination rates at the medical school’s student-run clinic also increased after the curriculum, from an average of 1.89 HPV vaccines given per clinic to 3.55 ( p = 0.001). This study demonstrates that knowledge and positive attitudes were maintained 1.5 years after participating in this HPV curriculum during students’ preclinical years of medical school. Additionally, an increase in HPV vaccination rates occurred at a student-led clinic, indicating a positive clinical impact on the curriculum.

Abstract: Knowledge retention (KR) is when ideas developed over time in the human brain are retained, for enhanced efficiency and effectiveness of job performance. KR is fundamental in every organisation. KR implies the ways through which the organisations grow, thus resulting in having a competitive advantage other their competitors. Therefore, retaining the individuals that carry diverse expertise in the organisation is important, because it helps to transform the knowledge economy. However, the issues of improper organisation of tasks, loss of experienced employees, the influx of young employees, thus resulting to transfer problem from one department/unit to another, low productivity causing a delay in operational excellence and achievement of timeous job specification, non-viability of the organisation, has made many staff members resign from their present organisation to join other institutions or organisations due to lack of KR. This study investigates KR for enhanced organisational growth in higher education institutions (HEIs). The qualitative research approach made use of the interpretive content analysis. The qualitative survey design made use of an unstructured monkey survey questionnaire in collecting data from respondents across different HEIs in Africa. The purposive and convenient sampling technique selected HEIs across Africa. The rationale behind selecting HEIs across Africa was due to the nature of activities that surrounds KR in transformative organisational growth and the ability to have a quick respondent’s response under the study being investigated. Results indicate that the understanding of KR was not uniform among respondents due to different contexts, fields of expertise, and the nature of work performed. Findings further indicate that KR has helped respondents to create new knowledge, strive to perform tasks in workplace learning, fostered and equipped individuals in their career pursuit, self-development, and deepen research drive. Different mechanism of memorising and keeping short notes, attending different courses, and helping others to solve their problem gives someone the experiences to always remember, and the tools of desktop computers, laptop, tablets, CD-ROM, emails, social media, flash drive, and YouTube are prevalent in support of KR among individuals. Diverse sets of print to electronic sources of information were used to support KR among respondents. Factors such as virus, lack of structures, no specific projects, lack of affirming organisational policy, environmental factors, electricity power supply, and lack of good reading facilities affected the individuals/staff members in their attempt to retain knowledge across sample HEIs. The study recommends attractive income, suitable provision of structure, favourable working environment, self-development opportunities, non-discriminatory treatment to staff, and opened organisational culture, which will enforce staff members to stay and be willing to retain their knowledge/potentials for the organisational growth in HEIs.

Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between take-home (open-book) examinations (THE) and in-class (closed-book) examinations (ICE) on academic performance and student wellbeing. Two social science courses (one bachelor and one master) were included in the study. In the first cohort (2019), students from both courses performed an ICE, whereas students in the second cohort (2020) performed a THE. Four to six months following course completion, students were approached to fill out a survey pertaining to their academic performance and wellbeing during the course, and to complete a test measuring knowledge retention on the course materials. No significant differences were found between the ICE and THE cohorts in academic performance and knowledge retention for either the bachelor or the master students. Bachelor students who completed a THE in 2020 reported significantly lower wellbeing in comparison to their peers completing the ICE a year earlier. The implications of the results in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: Simulated learning has been practiced for decades and was a key element in remote learning during the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Continuing healthcare education courses for clinicians have incorporated surgical simulators to enable relief from the time constraints encountered in the operating room and provide a more relaxed environment in which to practice complex surgical procedures. Educational research studies show that the implementation of such applications in pedagogy have improved knowledge retention, increased clinician confidence, provided easier access to educational materials, and reduced levels of anxiety about learning. This review highlights the benefits and limitations of surgical simulators. Based on the evidence and current trends, simulated learning signifies a fundamental shift in higher education that is transforming healthcare academic institutions and offering significant potential for continuing dental education.Simulated learning has been practiced for decades and was a key element in remote learning during the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract: Abstract Comprehensive education regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) pathogenesis, vaccination, and patient counseling are not routinely included in the medical school curriculum; consequently, student and provider knowledge, especially concerning head and neck pathology, remains low. The objective of this study was to demonstrate long-term retention of HPV knowledge and positive attitudes towards HPV vaccination after attending our novel HPV workshop, with a focus on knowledge of oropharyngeal cancer. A follow-up survey was administered to medical students 1.5 years after the initial completion of the workshop. HPV vaccination records from the student-led clinic were collected from the immunization information system. Awareness that HPV causes oropharyngeal cancer was present in 33% of medical students pre-curriculum; immediate and long-term post-curricular awareness of this association remained at 90% or higher ( p  < 0.0001). Comfort with HPV counseling, having enough information to recommend the vaccine, and knowledge of HPV malignancies, symptoms, transmission, and vaccination schedule remained persistently elevated over pre-curriculum scores ( p  < 0.05). Long-term knowledge scores were also higher than a control group of medical students at the same stage of training who had never participated in the workshop ( p  < 0.05). HPV vaccination rates at the medical school’s student-run clinic also increased after the curriculum, from an average of 1.89 HPV vaccines given per clinic to 3.55 ( p  = 0.001). This study demonstrates that knowledge and positive attitudes were maintained 1.5 years after participating in this HPV curriculum during students’ preclinical years of medical school. Additionally, an increase in HPV vaccination rates occurred at a student-led clinic, indicating a positive clinical impact on the curriculum.

Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between take-home (open-book) examinations (THE) and in-class (closed-book) examinations (ICE) on academic performance and student wellbeing. Two social science courses (one bachelor and one master) were included in the study. In the first cohort (2019), students from both courses performed an ICE, whereas students in the second cohort (2020) performed a THE. Four to six months following course completion, students were approached to fill out a survey pertaining to their academic performance and wellbeing during the course, and to complete a test measuring knowledge retention on the course materials. No significant differences were found between the ICE and THE cohorts in academic performance and knowledge retention for either the bachelor or the master students. Bachelor students who completed a THE in 2020 reported significantly lower wellbeing in comparison to their peers completing the ICE a year earlier. The implications of the results in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic are discussed.

Abstract: In team-based learning (TBL), single best answer questions (SBAQs) are traditionally used because immediate computer-assisted feedback facilitates team discussions. Recent improvements in digital marking systems and criticisms of non-analytical strategies in SBAQs have prompted the consideration of very short answer questions (VSAQs) as an alternative to SBAQs. We aim to compare the effect of VSAQs and SBAQs on peer elaboration and knowledge retention in TBL. Introduction In team-based learning (TBL), single best answer questions (SBAQs) are traditionally used because immediate computer-assisted feedback facilitates team discussions. Recent improvements in digital marking systems and criticisms of non-analytical strategies in SBAQs have prompted the consideration of very short answer questions (VSAQs) as an alternative to SBAQs. We aim to compare the effect of VSAQs and SBAQs on peer elaboration and knowledge retention in TBL.Twenty-four second-year students from the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine participated in a mixed-methods study that included a randomised controlled crossover trial with two intervention arms (TBL-VSAQs and TBL-SBAQs). Two TBL sessions were conducted, with one topic covered each. Students were randomly allocated into six teams of four members. Individual and team scores and completion times were measured, and students were surveyed on their TBL experience. A follow-up quiz on the same topics was administered two weeks later to assess knowledge retention. Materials and Methods Twenty-four second-year students from the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine participated in a mixed-methods study that included a randomised controlled crossover trial with two intervention arms (TBL-VSAQs and TBL-SBAQs). Two TBL sessions were conducted, with one topic covered each. Students were randomly allocated into six teams of four members. Individual and team scores and completion times were measured, and students were surveyed on their TBL experience. A follow-up quiz on the same topics was administered two weeks later to assess knowledge retention.Individuals scored lower for VSAQs than SBAQs in the second TBL topic (7.17 ± 1.52 versus 8.25 ± 1.48; p  = 0.046), while findings in other metrics were non-significant. Follow-up quiz scores showed no significant difference in knowledge retention, although effect size and power were low. Students perceived VSAQs as more authentic and challenging, though most preferred the continued use of SBAQs for TBL.

Abstract: Comprehensive education regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) pathogenesis, vaccination, and patient counseling are not routinely included in the medical school curriculum; consequently, student and provider knowledge, especially concerning head and neck pathology, remains low. The objective of this study was to demonstrate long-term retention of HPV knowledge and positive attitudes towards HPV vaccination after attending our novel HPV workshop, with a focus on knowledge of oropharyngeal cancer. A follow-up survey was administered to medical students 1.5 years after the initial completion of the workshop. HPV vaccination records from the student-led clinic were collected from the immunization information system. Awareness that HPV causes oropharyngeal cancer was present in 33% of medical students pre-curriculum; immediate and long-term post-curricular awareness of this association remained at 90% or higher (p < 0.0001). Comfort with HPV counseling, having enough information to recommend the vaccine, and knowledge of HPV malignancies, symptoms, transmission, and vaccination schedule remained persistently elevated over pre-curriculum scores (p < 0.05). Long-term knowledge scores were also higher than a control group of medical students at the same stage of training who had never participated in the workshop (p < 0.05). HPV vaccination rates at the medical school's student-run clinic also increased after the curriculum, from an average of 1.89 HPV vaccines given per clinic to 3.55 (p = 0.001). This study demonstrates that knowledge and positive attitudes were maintained 1.5 years after participating in this HPV curriculum during students' preclinical years of medical school. Additionally, an increase in HPV vaccination rates occurred at a student-led clinic, indicating a positive clinical impact on the curriculum.Comprehensive education regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) pathogenesis, vaccination, and patient counseling are not routinely included in the medical school curriculum; consequently, student and provider knowledge, especially concerning head and neck pathology, remains low.

Using Augmented Reality to Train a Diverse Group of Undergraduate Engineering Students on Makerspace Tools

Abstract: Training offerings for undergraduate engineering students vary widely depending on staffing, culture, and associated coursework. That is, sometimes training is minimal or nonexistent, may come from a peer, or may come from a TA, instructor, or staff member. In industry, AR has been shown to be a promising way to train and teach users step-by-step procedural tasks, such as learning how to use a tool or machine. AR has also been used as a teaching tool in the classroom and has been shown to improve student knowledge retention and achievement. This thesis investigates the effectiveness of an AR training tutorial on undergraduate engineering student learning of makerspace tools as compared to the traditional TA-led demonstration. Additionally, this thesis investigates if AR is a more inclusive teaching tool for URM engineering students. A group of undergraduate ME students were trained on the power drill/driver with a TAled demonstration and an AR tutorial using the Microsoft HoloLens. Students were given a preand post-survey that asked questions about their power drill/driver knowledge, self-efficacy, and feelings about the tutorial. Students also completed a mini-fabrication assignment using the power drill/driver after completing the tutorial. While both tutorials resulted in a statistically significant increase in student learning, there was no difference in the increase between the two tutorials. URM students learned more than non-URM students from both tutorials, but this may be because they had less prior power drill/driver knowledge. URM students preferred the TA tutorial and non-URM students learned more with the AR tutorial, again, likely because the of the difference in prior knowledge. Understanding how different trainings affect the learning of different student populations is important when developing learning materials for the classroom.

Abstract: Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of gamification strategies on pharmacy department education via post-module assessment scores and satisfaction survey results. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial performed at Texas Children’s Hospital from September 2022 to February 2023. All pharmacy department employees during the specified time frame were included for eligibility. Inability to complete all assigned tasks within the study time frame was the only criteria for exclusion. Study participants underwent simple randomization into two groups: a control group receiving education via traditional modules and an intervention group receiving education via gamified modules. Three educational modules were chosen for gamification. After module completion, employees were given a one-time assessment test with a minimum passing score of 80%. Satisfaction surveys were distributed to participants after each module. The primary endpoint was post-module assessment scores. The secondary endpoint was satisfaction survey scores. Results: Seventy-two participants were included in the study. The study was comprised of both pharmacists and technicians, 55% and 17% respectively. The gamification group experienced higher median post-module assessment scores in two of three modules (p<0.0001). Study participants in the gamification responded more favorably on the satisfaction survey across all three modules. A difference in overall median satisfaction scores between the groups was noted for two of the five satisfaction survey questions. The gamification group had a median survey response of 5, or strongly agree, as compared to the control group’s median survey response of 4, or agree, in answer to the statements on module engagement and enjoyment. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the positive impact of gamification on pharmacy department personnel’s academic performance. Gamification strategies may be useful tools to improve user engagement when completing assigned academic modules. This study echoes previous findings of the benefits of this novel method of education delivery. Future studies are needed to further which elements of gamification have the most impact, as well as the degree of knowledge retention.

Are Classical Assessments Offering Adequate Insight into Post-Pandemic Teaching Methods?

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/are-classical-assessments-offering-adequate/docview/3174808481/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Educators must continuously assess and adjust to maximize the amount of information students retain. One way to evaluate teaching effectiveness is thru pre- and post-semester assessments. Factors such as individual willingness to participate can affect the validity of these assessments. Our hypothesis was that students will more actively participate in a group activity compared with written pre- and post-semester assessments. In this study, we evaluated 3 different types of pre- and post-assessments to assess knowledge retention and participation. Participation decreased as the semester progressed resulting in only 31 of 57 students who completed all 6 of the assessments. There was an interaction (P < 0.001) between the type (individual, team, or activity) and time of assessment. The percentage of correct answers increased (P < 0.001) between pre-semester (average 32.92 ± 1.58) and post-semester assessments (average 47.54 ± 1.58). There was a correlation (P = 0.04) between the final course grade and the post-semester individual written assessment. In conclusion, participation throughout the semester is a major issue in assessing teaching quality and knowledge retention and the utilization of group activities does not appear to impact that participation. However, the best assessment for knowledge learned remains the classical written individual assessment.

Abstract: Retention of information is essential for transfer of knowledge from one course to another. Human anatomy and physiology (A&P), offered as a 2-semester course at Notre Dame of Maryland University, is a foundational prerequisite for many health-related programs. For this study the researcher attempted to quantify the knowledge retention decline in the transition from human A&P I to human A&P II. Two cohorts of female traditional college students were administered a cumulative final exam immediately on completion of human A&P I. One cohort (CS1) was given the same test 48 days later. A second cohort (CS2) was given the same test 48 days and 144 days later. There was a significant decline in retention of information in CS1, however, CS2 exhibited no significant decline at either 48 days or 144 days. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between both cohorts on the initial test, an indication that both cohorts were equivalently prepared. Further study is required to understand the disparity in retention decline between the 2 cohorts.

Abstract: The use of experiential learning in agricultural courses within postsecondary institutions has become increasingly important as educators seek to provide students with a meaningful education increasing knowledge retention and success. Hands-on, experiential learning activities within animal sciences have previously been used to provide students with experiences that increase performance in courses and overall knowledge and skill development. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the influence that experiential learning laboratory lessons had on students enrolled in an introduction to animal science lecture course at the University of Georgia. Researchers used a quasi-experimental study, placing students in either an experiential learning or review group to determine if students who learned through experiential learning lessons retained more content knowledge than those who did not. Summative assessment scores were used to examine overall and content-related performance between the groups. Although there was no statistical significance between the groups, researchers determined that students in experiential learning activities performed slightly above or equal to those who received only review. Researchers identified recommendations for future studies, which include replicating the study with modifications and repeating the study with two introductory courses simultaneously. Additionally, researchers recommended practitioners use experiential learning to complement traditional lectures and to increase knowledge and practical skills.

Abstract: Since pre-internship medical students appeared inefficient in acquiring fundamental knowledge in large classes, a hybrid instructional method of problem-and-lecture-based learning (PLBL) was designed to leverage the complementary strengths of PBL in reasoning under minimal guidance and LBL in immediate knowledge retention. We improved PBL (IPBL) in its instructional process and grading in a way that's feasible in large classes, divided in IPBL almost 50 students into 7-10 squads as a figure simulating student counts in classic PBL class to strive for each squad member to achieve the same level of knowledge, and applied IPBL to about half of the instructional contents while LBL to another half for their complementary strengths. In this case, PLBL led to more number of test questions correctly answered by all students in a class, more students in higher test score buckets, and higher student perception scores on the methodology. PLBL facilitates fundamental knowledge acquisition in large classes within 50 students prior to medical internships.

Abstract: Infographics can improve understanding and enhance critical thinking skills in readers. However, while research has been done on the importance of infographics, a gap exists regarding how creating infographics enhances student engagement and knowledge retention in higher education. Therefore, this study used a mixed-methods approach to analyze undergraduate responses after creating an infographic. Of the 189 students, 71% agreed that creating an infographic helped them retain, examine, and analyze information more thoroughly, and 62% intended to use the infographic process again. These results suggest that it is advantageous to educate students on how to create infographics to learn and convey information.

Learning with Virtual Reality Simulations: Direct versus Vicarious Instructional Experience

Author: Dubovi, Ilana

Abstract: As virtual reality (VR) technologies have been increasingly adopted in the educational field, careful consideration and evaluation of instructional modes to support learning with VR are needed. This study focuses on evaluation of two instructional modes: direct interaction and manipulation of the VR learning environment; and the vicarious approach of observing how a novice peer and an expert learn with VR. An experimental design was utilized with two comparison conditions: direct VR interaction (n = 72) and the vicarious approach (n = 69). Participants' knowledge and emotional engagement were evaluated via self-report questionnaires. Results showed that though learning with the direct VR condition was associated with more intense emotional engagement, there was no significant difference in knowledge gains between the two study conditions. The findings suggest that each of the two instructional modes has specific instructional affordances and that the cognitive and emotional components of learning via VR should be further explored. Since learning vicariously through observing the dialogue between an expert and a peer can have immediate knowledge gains comparable to the direct VR interaction, there is an effective and more accessible opportunity for VR-based learning. Future research should evaluate this instructional effect on knowledge retention.

Abstract: This study examined the impact of Quizlet, a digital learning tool, on the English collocation learning achievement and knowledge retention of Thai first-year students, focusing on the usage of 'do', 'make' and 'take'. It also explored students' attitudes towards using Quizlet. The participants were 76 first-year students from a private university in Bangkok, Thailand. The research was carried out during the first semester of the 2022 academic year using an achievement test and a questionnaire to gauge the learning differences and attitudes towards Quizlet. The statistical analysis included frequency and descriptive statistics and a paired-samples t-test to measure the difference in learning outcomes between Quizlet and the Grammar Translation Method (GTM). The study found that there was a statistically significant difference (p <0.001) in knowledge retention after one month between students who learned with Quizlet and those who learned with GTM. It also revealed high student satisfaction with Quizlet, especially regarding its implementation, design, and content applicability to real life.

Abstract: The worked example effect has been well documented within the framework of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), which suggests that teaching with examples would be superior to engaging in unguided problem solving, particularly for novices, as using worked examples would reduce their cognitive load, compared to solving problems, thus facilitating knowledge retention. This paper, using multiple-step mathematics problems, reports an experiment investigating the micro level of the worked example effect on learning solution steps, from the perspective of cognitive load and challenge (as a relevant affective, motivational factor), testing the worked example effect with a transfer test. The results favoured worked examples on both the retention and transfer tests after learning and showed that using worked examples would reduce cognitive load and impose less challenge on each step during learning.

Examining the Effectiveness of Implementing a Stay Interview Process to Impact Retention of Information Technology Staff in Higher Education

Author: Fullem, Michelle R

Publication info: Fullem, Michelle R. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/examining-effectiveness-implementing-stay/docview/3174773351/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Talent supply and demand is a concern in many key positions in all industries, including higher education. Understanding what attracts and retains IT staff is important for organizations, particularly in a tight labor market. Institutions that experience high turnover in Information Technology (IT) staff positions risk impacting student services, research, and day-to-day administration with the loss of knowledge and experience. Often, institutions are unable to launch major initiatives or meet financial goals due to poor talent management strategies to retain staff.The focus of this dissertation was to examine the strategy of a stay interview process intervention to better understand why IT staff stay at an institution. A stay interview is a tool used by institutions to gather data from long-term employees to understand what keeps them engaged and provides them the incentive to keep coming back daily. My two guiding questions that led the process of systematic inquiry and exploration of a stay interview included: (1) What is the efficacy of stay interviews in gauging IT employees' job and organizational satisfaction? (2) Does the stay interview process provide specific actions/ideas that IT leaders can implement to strengthen employee engagement and retention in our organization? These inquiry questions played a significant role in my Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycle and helped reveal the effectiveness of the stay interview tool to drive positive change in my IT department. The key findings illustrated that if implemented correctly, stay interviews can provide institutions with ideas for improvement, and show staff their feedback is important, and their service is valued. This inquiry discovered that a main value gained from the stay interview tool is providing an opportunity for our IT staff to share their perspectives, experiences, and motivations and uncover factors that contribute to increased engagement and retention. However, this process does require time and resources to implement effectively and may be met with resistance from employees and supervisors. By adopting best practices and acting on the feedback received, institutions can successfully implement stay interviews and reap the benefits of employee feedback in improving retention and creating a more satisfied and engaged workforce.

Abstract: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, schools were forced to close their doors and alternative learning environments had to be established (Wyse et al., 2020). Most districts addressed this issue by creating virtual learning environments (Kaffenberger, 2021). The creation, adoption, and navigation of this new virtual environment created a plethora of opportunities for learning loss. Traditionally, learning loss is defined as any loss of knowledge and/or skills or reversal in academic progress, commonly due to gaps or discontinuities in a student's education (Cooper et al., 1996). Researchers studied the effects of learning loss and its impact on the preceding academic gap school year. These findings support the learning losses identified as a result of the alternative learning environments created by the COVID-19 pandemic (Patarapichayatham et al., 2021). When students entered school post-pandemic, districts were faced with addressing the increased academic challenges as a result of virtual and hybrid instruction which appeared to be not as effective as in person schooling (Harmey & Moss, 2021). The altered academic environment had a different impact on students' learning experiences particularly on student growth in ELA and mathematics (Patarapichayatham et al., 2021). In research presented by Bielinski et al. (2020), these challenges were the result of the COVID learning loss, decreased in-person attendance, and the need to adapt to varying learning environments. According to some studies, students returning to school post-pandemic after exposure to virtual learning fell below grade level for every month that they were not exposed to in-person learning (Harmey & Moss, 2021). Pre-pandemic learning, pandemic learning, and post-pandemic learning are three distinct experiences. This study explored the effects of the three learning environments on the reading levels of fourth-grade students in a suburban district.

Southern Rio Grande Rift Kinematics and Geochronology, Big Bend Fold Geometry, and the Use of Real Data in Geoscience Education: Contributions to the Understanding of Big Bend Geology and to Public Geoscientific Literacy

Author: Jessica Moore Kelsch

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/southern-rio-grande-rift-kinematics-geochronology/docview/3174769816/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: The Big Bend region of Trans-Pecos Texas preserves a rich record of Rio Grande rifting and Laramide-age contraction that provide intrigue to national and state park visitors and field trips for undergraduate geology students. Despite its well-exposed geologic record, the Big Bend region remains an underutilized natural laboratory for studying these two tectonic events. This dissertation combines structural studies of Rio Grande rift and Laramide structures with public outreach and geoscience education studies focused on the Big Bend region. In Chapter 2, existing extensional-kinematic studies from parts of this region are compiled with new fault kinematic and U-Pb geochronologic data from normal and strike-slip fault surfaces across the Sunken Block and Black Gap grabens of the southern Rio Grande rift. These data delineate an early and long-lived NE-SW orientation of principal stretch (S1) lasting from at least 30.1+3.1 Ma to at least 13.7+0.9 Ma. Clockwise rotation of S1 to NW-SE followed the early orientation after 13.7+0.9 Ma, agreeing with a widely cited regional clockwise shift in tension and extension at ~10 Ma reported in the northern Rio Grande rift and the Basin and Range province. The locations documenting this progressive rotation of S1 in the southern Rio Grande rift also suggest that later faulting narrows and is constrained to the Sunken Block graben. Chapter 3 focuses on a footwall syncline under a Laramide thrust fault that is exposed in cross-section in a cliff wall at the end of the Dog Canyon trail in Big Bend National Park. This structure provides an opportunity to test fold models and is also societally relevant because it is a popular hiking trail for park visitors. Structural analysis reveals evidence of three deformation events preserved in minor structures within the folded rock. First and second in this geologic history were orthogonal flexure and horizontal contraction related to fault-propagation folding in front of and under the west-southwest-verging Santiago thrust fault. The third deformational event was horizontal extension interpreted to be associated with late Cenozoic Rio Grande rifting. This geologic history and an explanation of the structural analysis behind it are presented as a panel to be installed by the National Park Service as an interpretive wayside exhibit in front of the cliff on the Dog Canyon trail. Chapter 4 presents a geoscience education study, involving undergraduate students of all majors in core-science geology classes at two universities near the Big Bend region. For this study, students interacted with either locally or globally sourced geoscientific data within in-class quantitative exercises and were surveyed to query the outcomes of their engagement, knowledge-retention, critical-thinking skill, and perceptions of the relevance of the exercise topics to human society. The group exposed to local data returned higher scores and rankings than those exposed to global data after four of the five exercises, indicating a lead in each of those outcomes but most clearly in critical-thinking skill and in their perception of the relevance of the geoscientific topic.

Abstract: This study investigated Chemistry students' performance and retention (knowledge and understanding, knowledge and application, perception and attitude) in Organic Chemistry in three Senior High Schools (SHSs) within Tamale Metropolis in Ghana. Collaborative learning models were employed as intervention strategies. Quasi-experimental design was adopted for the study. The target population for the study was third year SHS Chemistry students. Two intact classes were used as control and experimental groups in each school. The research instruments were self-constructed Organic Chemistry Achievement Test (OCAT) and Students' Attitude and Perception Questionnaire (SAPQ). The Organic Chemistry Achievement Test data was analysed using t-test statistics whilst Students' Attitude and Perception Questionnaire data was analysed using descriptive statistics. The study revealed a 34.04% improvement in post-test mean scores on both knowledge and understanding, and knowledge and application due to the intervention. The study again revealed a significant improvement of (20%) in students' perceptions and attitudes towards Organic Chemistry due to the intervention. A statistically significant improvement of 25% in confidence level among students, towards Organic Chemistry, was recorded. Collaborative teaching and learning approaches were judged effective for ameliorating SHS learners, academic achievement and knowledge retention in Organic Chemistry concepts and were recommended for teaching and learning at SHS.

Abstract: This research study examined the implementation of an extended reality (XR) lab on a community college campus to facilitate student and faculty access to immersive learning resources. The study, conducted during one skills day, involved 46 students and was designed to understand if integrating immersive VR into emergency medical technician (EMT) education could enhance learner confidence and motivation, develop problem-solving and analytical thinking skills, and thus connecting the classroom learning with real-world application. The majority of participants reported increased motivation and engagement, alongside improvements in learning outcomes like knowledge retention and skill development. Applying the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model revealed performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions as key determinants of VR adoption in EMT education. While no significant overall performance enhancement was observed, VR training showed potential to boost motivation, confidence, and specific performance aspects. Furthermore, student perceptions towards VR in EMT education were largely positive, thereby suggesting its utility in immersive scenario training, skill acquisition in a risk-free environment, enhancing learner engagement, and real-world situational preparedness. VR demonstrated promise as a transformative tool in EMT education, necessitating further research to fully exploit its potential in diverse learning environments.

The Effect of Gamified Training on Retention, Knowledge, and Confidence: A Longitudinal Experimental Study

Author: II Patrick Michael Damon

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of gamified training in cybersecurity concepts on individuals not employed in information technology roles compared to traditional pieces of training. As the world becomes increasingly connected technologically, so too do the cyber vulnerabilities increase, and it is essential for all types of users, not just those in information technology, to avoid or detect vulnerabilities and potential cybersecurity incidents. This study was guided by the novel 7GOALS framework, built upon the existing PDCA framework. This study also utilizes the foundations provided by gamification theory and self-determination theory while introducing research on learning styles and how individuals have traditionally learned best. The study involved a pre-test, training, post-test, and one more test 30 days after the post-test to examine participants' knowledge, retention, and confidence. For this study, 115 individuals participated in the first component and 71 returned to perform the final test, exceeding the 54 participants that were needed for all components of the study. It was found that gamified training provides more significant increases in knowledge and retention but followed similar trends to traditional training regarding confidence. No relation was found between the level of knowledge and confidence as the control group had an alpha of over 0.05. A link was also found between knowledge and confidence where the gamified experiment component had a larger power with a rate of 0.735 with a smaller long-term confidence growth of 0.396 compared to the control group's 0.533. Future studies would benefit from increasing the length of the study and the number of participants and adjusting different variables within the gamified pieces of training to determine which are most related to the trainee's success. Ultimately, the study results implicate that engaged, gamified training would be more effective than traditional training for non-technical users.

Abstract: Financial Literacy is one of the subject areas taught in Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS) courses which is not graduation requirement for high school students across Pennsylvania. The problem of practice I addressed is that Greensburg Salem High School (GSHS) students are graduating without the financial literacy knowledge and skills to become successfully independent adults. Three inquiry questions that guided my dissertation in practice are: (1) "How is student financial literacy knowledge impacted by a simulation activity compared to the Next Gen Personal Finance (NGPF) curriculum and teaching practices?"; (2) "What are the teacher's perceptions of implementing the simulation activity compared to the standard curriculum/practices?"; and (3) "Was the teacher able to implement the Budget Project simulation activity with high levels of fidelity?" Two GSHS Financial Literacy classes participated in the inquiry project: one group of students completing a new Budget Project simulation activity and the other group completing the standard NGPF Budgeting Unit. Measures included a student pre/post survey to assess their financial literacy knowledge, an individual interview with the intervention classroom teacher, and observations of intervention implementation via a fidelity checklist. The descriptive statistics from the survey and fidelity data, combined with the codes from the teacher interview, revealed positive results in both the intervention teacher and the students. Students had higher financial literacy knowledge retention and understanding after completing the Budget Project, and the teacher reported ease of use and productive experiences with students. Future implications include modifying the GSHS Financial Literacy curriculum to include more simulation activities, including the Budget Project, and enhancing professional development for educators teaching financial literacy.

Abstract: This dissertation describes strategies instructional designers can use to foster essential processing when designing multimedia instruction with different combinations of the use and non-use of the modality and segmenting principles described by Clark and Mayer (2016). This study investigated the main effects of segmenting and modality, and different combinations of the use and nonuse of the modality and segmenting principles, on recall and transfer test scores on gear instruction. The results from this study provide insight into how the use of one or more principles impacted overall, recall, and transfer learning outcomes. The results of the study revealed a lack of significant main effects for modality and segmenting on the overall, recall, and transfer posttest scores. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences observed among the four groups: control, modality, segmenting, and segmenting & modality. These findings suggest that the utilization of modality and segmenting principles did not improve learning outcomes compared to not using any principle, and employing both principles together did not yield superior results compared to using modality or segmenting alone. These results are inconsistent with a considerable body of prior research; however, they do not imply disregarding all previous research in the field. It should be noted that the sample size consisted of only 71 participants, which was a small sample size. The brevity of the treatment duration and the presence of ceiling effects may have influenced the findings of this research. The observed ceiling effects can potentially be attributed to several factors, including the simplicity of the test items used in the instrument, administering the instrument immediately after the instructional intervention, the effectiveness of the instructional intervention itself, and participants' existing knowledge prior to the study. Future studies could utilize a larger sample size, select more complex instructional topics, and incorporate more rigorous instruments. These improvements would have facilitated a more accurate assessment of the impact of the modality and segmenting principles on learning outcomes. Moreover, exploring the effect of the modality and segmenting principles on delayed transfer would have provided valuable insights into their long-term effectiveness in promoting knowledge retention and transfer.

Building a Solid Foundation: Succession Planning Practices Improving Knowledge Management and Employee Retention within Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)

Author: Hatcher, Shanika D

Publication info: Hatcher, Shanika D. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/building-solid-foundation-succession-planning/docview/3174764456/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: The business management problem addressed in this study results from the need for succession planning practices in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). This systematic qualitative review examined which succession planning practices improve knowledge management and employee retention within HEIs. Despite the growing number of baby boomer retirements and the unexpected exit of key leaders, succession planning is still not a top priority for HEI leaders. Additionally, a loss of knowledge occurs when leaders and employees retire or leave the organization unexpectedly before sharing knowledge to prepare the next generation of leaders. Knowledge not transferred throughout an organization leads to lower productivity and employee morale, often leading to lower employee retention. Through a qualitative systematic review process, this dissertation provides an overview of the research problem, a theoretical framework, a literature landscape review, and a description of the methods utilized during the study review process. The review discusses the findings from the thematic coding process and a synthesis of the literature, identifying which succession planning practices improve knowledge management and employee retention. Based on the thematic findings, this study's recommendations include: (1) HEI Presidents and Boards of Trustees should incorporate succession planning into HEIs' vision, (2) HEIs should implement a robust Human Resource Management, (HRM) process to integrate succession planning into their practices, and (3) HEI succession planning and organizational culture must be aligned for succession planning to be effective.

An Actionable Strategy to Retain Baby Boomers’ Valuable Knowledge in a Public Sector Organisation

Author: Salih, Abdel Wahid Mohamed

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/actionable-strategy-retain-baby-boomers-valuable/docview/3170696006/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Background: 80% of the organisation's local staff will retire by 2029 - 34 out of 42 local staff employees are over 55 years old, i.e., baby boomers (PSM 2019). The high numerical representation of baby boomers in the workplace raises the potential risk of losing their knowledge and experience (Rudolph et al., 2015). The imbalanced age diversity in the workplace is embedded in that: 80% are baby boomers, and only 20% are generation X, generation Y, and generation Z. As an HR manager, I am challenged to keep my workforce competitive, considering a wide variety of factors to manage a multi-generational workforce with a central aim to build an effective succession plan to retain valuable knowledge of retirees before they leave (Ackermann and Eden 2011). Aims of the Investigation: The objective of the intervention was to deepen insight and understanding of potential risks in boomers' acute retirement, particularly as the leading cause of valuable knowledge loss in the workplace. So, the research aims to find solutions both to the immediate problem of valuable knowledge loss, and the long-term problem of an age-imbalanced workforce, and provide learning opportunities for the action research community by practising resolution processes. Design the Methodological Approach: The action research was a comprehensive methodology from a pragmatic perspective that involved employees as participants. The participatory democratic action research is adopted through investigating, planning, and designing intervention actions. Action research group (ARG) created of 8 members to supervise all research cycles agreed and discuss the results of data analysis. The data were collected in the investigation cycle to understand better the boomers' valuable knowledge loss, impact, and potential resolutions. Participants' data were collected in the questionnaire and interviews during the planning cycle to develop best-suited intervention actions in the workplace context. Two focused group discussions and five meetings of the action research group were valuable sources of information and learning. Findings: ARG identified and discussed their perceptions in investigating the problem and planning the actions. ARG reflected on their learning, gained insights into their practices and discussed results that facilitated agreement about the resolution framework. Investigation results were a deeper insight into the multi-causes and effects of the problem in the workplace. Participants' perceptions provided quality data to improve intervention actions' design and the implementation roadmap. The participatory process enabled participants to improve their work conditions while practising this action research process. However, the practical outcomes of my research are embedded in the proposed solutions, i.e., the document policy presented and considered by the organisation’s top management. Implications: The research implications were from three perspectives: The first-person implications enhanced my understanding of the problem, the workplace, employees, the research and life. The second-person implications develop participants' understanding and knowledge, which improved their professional and daily life practices. The third-person implications provide actionable knowledge for organisations with similar problems and workplace contexts. Limitations: The time available for this study has not been able to await the final approval to implement the intervention actions and evaluate the results. I and ARG submitted the research project in terms of document policy to address a real problem in the workplace. Future research should consider that the final approval for implementing the intervention actions involves agreeing to profound structural and political changes in the workplace. Therefore, the implementation and evaluation are planned as multi-step processes and objectives.

Abstract: 《博物志》是中國歷史上第一本以博物為名的著作，反映了當時博物之學的發展和成就，在中國博物之學中具有經典里程碑意義。本文以張華《博物志》為研究對象，研究其書如何建構博物知識系統。第一部分釐清《博物志》所在的學術脈絡，與西方自然博物概念區分，了解中國博物之學以認知世界，解除未知恐懼為宗旨的人文關懷，以及博物君子以廣博知識承擔穩定秩序的責任。第二部分考察《博物志》的成書背景，魏晉時期受到世變的刺激，使過去的知識的正確性備受質疑，對世界認知的失落使秩序面臨崩解，激起張華補全知識系統，以導正萬物位置的著書動機。為理解《博物志》的性質，必須區分志怪小說與博物小說的不同，了解《博物志》對前代學術的繼承，與專記怪異的志怪有一定的區別。第三部分探究《博物志》的書寫依據與原則，從其徵引的資料可知其以儒學為主要的知識來源，並發覺《博物志》的書寫受數術概念影響，逐漸脫離神治萬物的氛圍，因此強化博物的用物與文史傳統傾向，然後理解《博物志》命名類物的特色。第四部分探討《博物志》書寫的知識，了解其呈現的世界圖景，含藏著神話地理系統與人文地理系統的融會與角力。最後探究《博物志》的人文知識類型，重視物與人之間的交際，確立中國博物之學至《博物志》以人為核心繫聯萬物的知識建構原則。

Abstract: This study evaluated the prototype game Immuno-Defender , a 3D action game that teaches players about the human immune system. The pilot study assessed the feasibility of combining multiple qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate a learning game. Six participants took part in a remote playtesting session with the investigator, which was book-ended with a pre and post test to assess knowledge acquisition and a self-assessment of player experience using a shortened version of the Player Experience Inventory (PXI). Participants then completed a delayed posttest to assess knowledge retention. Qualitative analysis included observation, retrospective, interview, and a player performance assessment. Results showed that participants increased their knowledge assessment scores (t = 5.59, df = 5, p-value of 0.002) and the four that completed the delayed posttest retained their knowledge (t = 5.64, df = 3, p-value of 0.011). Qualitative findings revealed the strengths and weaknesses of the game’s current design and provided insights for the next iteration of development.

Examining the Effectiveness of Implementing a Stay Interview Process to Impact Retention of Information Technology Staff in Higher Education

Author: Fullem, Michelle R.

Publication info: Fullem, Michelle R. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/examining-effectiveness-implementing-stay/docview/3132884564/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Talent supply and demand is a concern in many key positions in all industries, including higher education. Understanding what attracts and retains IT staff is important for organizations, particularly in a tight labor market. Institutions that experience high turnover in Information Technology (IT) staff positions risk impacting student services, research, and day-to-day administration with the loss of knowledge and experience. Often, institutions are unable to launch major initiatives or meet financial goals due to poor talent management strategies to retain staff. The focus of this dissertation was to examine the strategy of a stay interview process intervention to better understand why IT staff stay at an institution. A stay interview is a tool used by institutions to gather data from long-term employees to understand what keeps them engaged and provides them the incentive to keep coming back daily. My two guiding questions that led the process of systematic inquiry and exploration of a stay interview included: (1) What is the efficacy of stay interviews in gauging IT employees’ job and organizational satisfaction? (2) Does the stay interview process provide specific actions/ideas that IT leaders can implement to strengthen employee engagement and retention in our organization? These inquiry questions played a significant role in my Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycle and helped reveal the effectiveness of the stay interview tool to drive positive change in my IT department. The key findings illustrated that if implemented correctly, stay interviews can provide institutions with ideas for improvement, and show staff their feedback is important, and their service is valued. This inquiry discovered that a main value gained from the stay interview tool is providing an opportunity for our IT staff to share their perspectives, experiences, and motivations and uncover factors that contribute to increased engagement and retention. However, this process does require time and resources to implement effectively and may be met with resistance from employees and supervisors. By adopting best practices and acting on the feedback received, institutions can successfully implement stay interviews and reap the benefits of employee feedback in improving retention and creating a more satisfied and engaged workforce.

Abstract: O presente trabalho final de mestrado procurou perceber o quê e como se tem abordado o problema relacionado à partilha e retenção do conhecimento em funcionários no fim de carreira, para isso o estudo foi norteado pelas seguintes questões: Questão de pesquisa 1-Qual o padrão e evolução dos estudos sobre Partilha e retenção de conhecimento em fim de carreira no período de 2016 - 2022? Questão de pesquisa 2- Quais os mecanismos usados no processo de partilha e retenção do conhecimento? Questão de pesquisa 3-Quais as limitações e sugestões de investigações futuras dos estudos? Para respondê-las realizou-se uma revisão sistemática da literatura científica, entre os anos 2016 a 2022, nas bases de dados Scopus, WoS e Emerald . A partilha de conhecimentos é tida como um processo de aprendizagem das organizações. Os conhecimentos estão distribuídos nas formas explícita e tácita e sendo esta última considerada de difícil codificação, conversão e explicitação e é tida como fonte de vantagem competitiva para aquelas organizações que a sabem gerir. A literatura demonstra que diversos fatores podem influenciar positiva ou negativamente o processo de partilha e retenção do conhecimento, como a confiança, a estrutura organizacional e a cultura organizacional. Os resultados encontrados sugerem a importância das organizações incorrerem em práticas de partilha e retenção de conhecimento através da adoção dos mecanismos de partilha e retenção do conhecimento com vista a minimizar o impacto da perda do conhecimento proveniente do fim de carreira dos funcionários seniores das organizações. Estes achados corroboram com a tendência já presente na literatura académica. Alternate abstract: This work sought to understand what and how the problem related to knowledge sharing and retention in employees at the end of their careers has been addressed. To this end, the study was guided by the following questions: Research question 1-What is the standard and evolution of studies on Sharing and retaining knowledge at the end of your career, in the period 2016 - 2022? Research question 2- What mechanisms are used in the knowledge sharing and retention process? Research question 3-What are the limitations and suggestions for future investigation of the studies? To answer them, a systematic review of the scientific literature was carried out, between the years 2016 and 2022, in the Scopus, WoS and Emerald data bases. Knowledge sharing is seen as a learning process for organizations. Knowledge is distributed in explicit and tacit forms and the latter is considered difficult to codify, convert and make explicit and is seen as a source of competitive advantage for those organizations that know how to manage it. The literature demonstrates that several factors can positively or negatively influence the process of sharing and retaining knowledge, trust, organizational structure, organizational culture. The results found suggest the importance of organizations engaging in knowledge sharing and retention practices through the adoption of knowledge sharing and retention mechanisms to minimize the impact of the loss of knowledge resulting from the end of the career of the organizations senior employees. These findings corroborate the trend already present in academic literature.

Alternate abstract: This thesis explores the integration of metaverse and Virtual Reality technologies into remote employee onboarding processes within a multinational company. It primarily aims to design and implement a metaverse-based solution for remote onboarding and to evaluate its effectiveness in enhancing the employee experience, particularly in terms of engagement and knowledge retention. The study presents a detailed account of the solution's development and an empirical analysis of it. The study employed a Between Subjects Design, comparing traditional remote onboarding methods with the newly developed metaverse-based approach across two distinct groups of recently hired employees who accomplished the same onboarding tasks. Significant findings from the study include an improvement in the sense of social presence and interaction among employees onboarded via the metaverse, indicating a more engaging and interactive environment. Additionally, the research revealed a strong link between the level of immersion experienced in the metaverse and an increase in employee engagement, suggesting that deeper immersion directly enhances employee involvement. Furthermore, the study noted a positive relationship between the sense of electronic closeness in the virtual environment and knowledge retention, emphasizing the importance of perceived connectedness in effective virtual learning. The study concludes that the metaverse can substantially enhance remote onboarding, offering transformative potential for future work environments.

Abstract: Com as inovações tecnológicas e a crescente transformação digital, as organizações sentem a necessidade de gerir os seus processos de negócio e de assegurar a retenção e a consolidação do conhecimento. A presente dissertação é o resultado de uma iniciativa empresarial desenvolvida no Departamento de Qualidade e Sustentabilidade da Efacec centrada na gestão dos seus processos de negócio, e na procura de contributos para a sua melhoria. Após uma cuidada análise dos processos existentes, identificaram-se como problemas mais significativos a prática de uma taxonomia complexa e pouco clara de classificação dos processos de negócio, a dificuldade sentida pelos clientes internos na localização de documentação associada aos processos existentes e a ausência de indicadores de desempenho para monitorizar estes processos. Utilizando como apoio o modelo de referência Process Classification Framework e ferramentas de Lean e de Qualidade, foram definidas e implementadas diversas propostas de melhoria ao nível da estrutura de classificação dos processos de negócio, da plataforma de gestão e da normalização dos processos. Como resultados da melhoria da gestão visual e do conhecimento da plataforma Gestão de Processos, salientam-se os ganhos de usuabilidade e de partilha do conhecimento organizacional e a redução do tempo de procura dos documentos. A melhoria da normalização dos processos através da criação de uma instrução operacional para a emissão, revisão e formação de documentação emitida no sistema de gestão de documentos apoia a gestão do conhecimento e ajuda na eliminação da documentação obsoleta. Além da criação da IO, a divulgação de um manual consulta de indicadores de processos permite que os responsáveis pelos processos controlem e monitorizem eficazmente os seus processos com base nos indicadores sugeridos pela Process Classification Framework que permitem o futuro benchmarking . Todas as melhorias contribuíram para enaltecer a cultura da melhoria contínua e melhorar a gestão dos processos de negócio da Efacec. Alternate abstract: With technological innovations and increasing digital transformation, organizations feel the need to manage their business processes and ensure knowledge retention and consolidation. This dissertation is the result of a business initiative developed in the Quality and Sustainability Department of Efacec focused on the management of its business processes, and the search for contributions to their improvement. After a careful analysis of the existing processes, the most significant problems were identified as the practice of a complex and unclear taxonomy of business process classification, the difficulty felt by internal customers in locating documentation associated with existing processes and the absence of performance indicators to monitor these processes. Using the Process Classification Framework reference model as support, several proposals for improvement were defined and implemented in terms of the business process classification structure, the management platform and the standardization of processes. As a result of the improvement of the visual management and knowledge of the Process Management platform, the gains in usability and sharing of organizational knowledge and the reduction of the time to search for documents are highlighted. Improving the standardization of processes through the creation of an operational instruction for the issuance, review and training of issued documentation in the document management system supports knowledge management and helps in the elimination of obsolete documentation. In addition to the creation of the IO, the dissemination of a manual consultation of process indicators allows process owners to effectively control and monitor their processes based on the indicators suggested by the Process Classification Framework that allow future benchmarking . All the improvements contributed to enhance the Efacec’s continuous improvement culture and improve their business processes management.

Abstract: Employee retention is important for an organization’s financial sustainability and essential for maintaining high levels of productivity. Without implementing retention strategies for employees, organizations can face high turnover rates. The Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) Malaysia provides several development programmes to prepare a labour market for different economic sectors that can help employees to stay and progress in organizations. The education sector is affected by the loss of knowledge when employees decided to leave their institutions. Hence, this study aims to contribute to the body of knowledge on succession planning practices, knowledge management, and employee retention. This study has examined the relationships between succession planning practices (selection of a successor, leadership development, succession planning programmes, involvement of top leaders, and technology advancement) and employee retention within the public HEIs in Malaysia. The loss of an experienced leader without a suitable replacement can immediately affect an organization negatively. Therefore, this study examined the mediating role of knowledge management in the relationship between succession planning practices and employee retention. A Quantitative method was used for data analysis. Survey was used as an instrument to gather data online and face to face from 300 valid respondents in four selected Malaysian Technical University Network (MTUN): University Malaysia Pahang (UMP), University Tun Hussain Onn Malaysia (UTHM), University Technical Malaysia Melaka (UTeM) and University Malaysia Perlis (UniMap). Simple random sampling was used to distribute the questionnaires to academic and non-academic staff. The Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLSSEM) was used to test the hypotheses. The results indicated that succession planning practices are positively related to employee retention. The findings provide evidence that knowledge management plays a mediating role between succession planning and employee retention. The importance of succession planning practices and the vital role of knowledge management is practical contribution for HEIs. This study conclude that the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia must grant full power to public Higher Education Institutions to implement succession planning practices.

Abstract: Public and policy demands to address police training are prominent in modern policing. While existing research has highlighted the gaps of inclusive topics and content dosage to meet reasonable expectations of knowledge or competency, there is a significant gap in policing research on evidence-based training methods. Specifically, the evaluation of police recruit training methods and the impact to student knowledge gain, retention, and application of concepts. This study is designed as two, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of 152 police recruit participants. These participants are divided into control and treatment groups for in-person and online instructional methods and again into subgroups for traditional and integrated learning. These four groups are defined as: Group 1: In-Person Traditional; Group 2: Online Traditional; Group 3: In-Person Integrated; and Group 4: Online-Integrated. For all participants, four tests were administered to measure changes in knowledge gain and retention. Panel data within a weighted stratification model evaluated changes within groups and differences among groups. Integrated learning groups performed best overall for knowledge gain and longer retention of content. In-person Integrated (Group 3) had highest scoring for immediate knowledge gain and continued retention throughout the experiment. Knowledge retention decreased immediately for in-person traditional (Group 1) participants. These findings have direct impacts to the current practices of traditional police training during basic academies. Furthermore, additional details on student engagement during the experiment indicate additional expectations of recruit learners. Outcomes from this RCT inform practitioners how to deliver critical topics (e.g., communication skills) and measure officer knowledge and retention. The outcomes inform agencies on training development practices for future in-service and/or field training programming that reinforces concepts and critical skills.

Abstract: Η παρούσα εργασία διερευνά διεξοδικά την πρακτικότητα και την αποτελεσματικότητα της ενσωμάτωσης της βιωματικής μάθησης στη δευτεροβάθμια εκπαίδευση. Εστιάζει κυρίως στην εξέταση των πλεονεκτημάτων της ενσωμάτωσης μεθοδολογιών βιωματικής μάθησης στο πρόγραμμα σπουδών της δευτεροβάθμιας εκπαίδευσης και στην αξιολόγηση του αντικτύπου της σε κρίσιμες πτυχές όπως η συμμετοχή των μαθητών, η διατήρηση της γνώσης και τα συνολικά μαθησιακά αποτελέσματα. Η μελέτη χρησιμοποιεί μια μεικτή ερευνητική προσέγγιση, πραγματοποιώντας ερωτηματολόγια και συνεντεύξεις για τη συλλογή δεδομένων από εκπαιδευτικούς και διευθυντές εκπαιδευτικών μονάδων, με στόχο την απόκτηση ολοκληρωμένων γνώσεων για τα οφέλη και τις προκλήσεις που σχετίζονται με την εφαρμογή της βιωματικής μάθησης στη δευτεροβάθμια εκπαίδευση. Η βιωματική μάθηση αναγνωρίζεται όλο και περισσότερο στην εκπαιδευτική θεωρία και πρακτική για τις δυνατότητές της να παρέχει στους μαθητές πρακτικές εμπειρίες από τον πραγματικό κόσμο που προάγουν μια βαθύτερη κατανόηση και δημιουργούν άμεσες συνδέσεις με το αντικείμενο. Η έρευνα αυτή συμβάλλει σημαντικά στο υπάρχον σύνολο γνώσεων σχετικά με τη βιωματική μάθηση και τη συνάφειά της στα πλαίσια της δευτεροβάθμιας εκπαίδευσης. Το εισαγωγικό τμήμα θέτει τα θεμέλια για τη μελέτη παρέχοντας θεμελιώδεις πληροφορίες βασικού περιεχομένου το σκεπτικό της έρευνας και μια σαφώς διατυπωμένη δήλωση του προβλήματος. Σκιαγραφούνται οι στόχοι της μελέτης, θέτοντας τους συγκεκριμένους στόχους προς επίτευξη, ενώ η σημασία της έρευνας τονίζει τις πιθανές επιπτώσεις της στις εκπαιδευτικές πρακτικές και στους διάφορους ενδιαφερόμενους φορείς στον τομέα της δευτεροβάθμιας εκπαίδευσης. Η βιβλιογραφική ανασκόπηση αναλύει κριτικά προηγούμενες επιστημονικές εργασίες που σχετίζονται με τη βιωματική μάθηση στη δευτεροβάθμια εκπαίδευση. Εμβαθύνει στις εννοιολογικές βάσεις της βιωματικής μάθησης και διευκρινίζει τα θεωρητικά πλαίσια που υποστηρίζουν την αποτελεσματικότητά της. Επιπλέον, η ανασκόπηση συνθέτει εμπειρικές μελέτες, υπογραμμίζοντας τα ευρήματά τους σχετικά vi με τον αντίκτυπο της βιωματικής μάθησης στις μαθησιακές εμπειρίες και τα ακαδημαϊκά επιτεύγματα των μαθητών, ρίχνοντας έτσι φως τόσο στα οφέλη όσο και στα μειονεκτήματα αυτής της προσέγγισης. Το κεφάλαιο της μεθοδολογίας της έρευνας παρέχει μια περιεκτική εξήγηση του επιλεγμένου ερευνητικού σχεδιασμού μικτής μεθόδου. Αναλυτικά η διαδικασία επιλογής των συμμετεχόντων, τα ειδικά εργαλεία συλλογής δεδομένων που χρησιμοποιούνται (έρευνες για μαθητές και εκπαιδευτικούς και ερωτηματολόγια και για τους δύο), τις διαδικασίες συλλογής δεδομένων και τις τεχνικές ανάλυσης δεδομένων που εφαρμόζονται, διασφαλίζοντας την συνεκτικότητα και συνέπεια της ερευνητικής διαδικασίας. Τα αποτελέσματα του ερευνητικού κεφαλαίου παρουσιάζουν μια ενδελεχή ανάλυση των δεδομένων που συλλέχθηκαν, παρουσιάζοντας τις απόψεις διευθυντών και εκπαιδευτικών για διάφορες διαστάσεις της βιωματικής μάθησης. Αυτό περιλαμβάνει τη διερεύνηση των επιπέδων συμμετοχής των μαθητών, την αξιολόγηση της διατήρησης και της εφαρμογής της γνώσης και τη συλλογή γνώσεων σχετικά με τις συνολικές μαθησιακές εμπειρίες τους. Επιπλέον, αυτή η ενότητα εμβαθύνει στις στάσεις, τις πεποιθήσεις και τις προκλήσεις που αντιμετωπίζουν οι εκπαιδευτικοί κατά την ενσωμάτωση της βιωματικής μάθησης στις διδακτικές τους πρακτικές. Συμπερασματικά, η εργασία ενοποιεί τα ευρήματα της έρευνας, αναδεικνύοντας τα οφέλη και τις πιθανές προκλήσεις της ενσωμάτωσης της βιωματικής μάθησης στη δευτεροβάθμια εκπαίδευση. Οι συνέπειες για την πρακτική υπογραμμίζουν πώς οι εκπαιδευτικοί και οι υπεύθυνοι χάραξης πολιτικής μπορούν να αξιοποιήσουν αυτές τις γνώσεις για να βελτιώσουν τις μεθόδους διδασκαλίας και το σχεδιασμό προγραμμάτων σπουδών σε περιβάλλοντα δευτεροβάθμιας εκπαίδευσης. Η έρευνα σκιαγραφεί επίσης συστάσεις για μελλοντικές μελέτες, αναγνωρίζοντας τους περιορισμούς της μελέτης, παρέχοντας παράλληλα μια ολοκληρωμένη διερεύνηση του ρόλου της βιωματικής μάθησης στη δευτεροβάθμια εκπαίδευση. Γεφυρώνοντας το χάσμα μεταξύ της εκπαιδευτικής θεωρίας και της πρακτικής εφαρμογής, αυτή η έρευνα στοχεύει να συμβάλει στη συνεχή εξέλιξη της παιδαγωγικής και να εμπλουτίσει τις εκπαιδευτικές εμπειρίες των μαθητών της δευτεροβάθμιας εκπαίδευσης.

Abstract: The rise of the internet has dramatically increased the rate at which we produce digital information. However, due to the ephemeral nature of the web, much of this information is lost because it goes offline as quickly as it comes online. As a result, web archives were established to preserve and make information accessible in perpetuity. However the traditional approach of accessing information within these, were one uses the URL of the archived resource, is both prone to loss of knowledge due to forgotten URLs, as well as no longer sufficient to meet modern expectations for ease of access to information. Expectations like searchability and question-answering, which modern users have acquired through daily use of search engines, due to the way these features provide a more natural and easier way to express and satisfy an information need. Thus Web Archives increasingly exercise efforts to provide users with new access methods to it’s archived content, one such example is the PortugueseWeb Archive which offers full-text search. In thisworkwe propose a Time-aware Multi-document Extractive Question-Answering approach over the Portugueseweb archive, capable of independently answering questions without the need for user specified reference documents, selecting those instead by searching through the millions of archived documents. This approach is achieved by combining two components: 1) a time-aware semantic search component which retrieves candidate reference documents; 2) an ensemble of transformer-based extractive QA models, which collaborate on both the selection of the best reference document, and on the selection of the answer from within it. We also present ArquiWIZ, a prototype implementing our proposed approach over a subset of the Portuguese web archive’s data. Finally, to evaluate our proposed solution we introduce Arquivo.pt-QA, an extractive Single and Multi document QA evaluation set, focused on Portuguese archived news articles originating from the PortugueseWeb Archive. Alternate abstract: O crescimento da internet aumentou dramaticamente a velocidade a que produzimos informação. No entanto, devido à natureza efêmera da web, muitas desta informação é perdida porque fica offline tão rapidamente quanto é posta online. Por esta razão, para preservar para sempre o acesso a esta informação, foram criados arquivos web. No entanto, a abordagem tradicional de acesso à informação nestes arquivos, que envolve o uso do URL do recurso arquivado, é tanto suscetível à perda de conhecimento por URLs esquecidas, como já não é suficiente para as expectativas currentes de facilidade de acesso à informação. Expectativas estas de funcionalidades como pesquisa e perguntasrespostas, algo que os usuários atuais tem vindo a adquirir do uso diário de motores de busca, devido à forma como estas oferecem maneiras mais naturais e fáceis de expressar e satisfazer necessidades de informação. Portanto, os Arquivos da Web estão cada vez mais a dedicar tempo e esforços ao desenvolvimento de novos métodos de acesso ao seu conteúdo arquivado, sendo um exemplo disso o Arquivo daWeb Português, que oferece pesquisa por texto. Neste trabalho propomos, para o Arquivo da Web Portuguesa, uma abordagem de Perguntas e Respostas (QA) Extrativas Multi-documentos com consideração pela componente temporal, capaz de responder a perguntas de forma independente sem necessitar de documentos de referencia identificados pelo utilizador, selecionando estes atravez de pesquisa entre os milhões de documentos arquivados. Esta abordagem resulta da combinação de dois componentes: 1) um componente de pesquisa semântica com consideração pela componente temporal, que pesquisa por candidatos a documentos de referência; 2) um conjunto de modelos de QA extrativos baseados em transformers, que colaboram tanto na seleção do melhor documento de referência quanto na seleção da resposta a partir deste. Apresentamos também o ArquiWIZ, um protótipo que implementa nossa abordagem proposta sobre um subconjunto dos dados do Arquivo daWeb Portuguesa. Por fim, para avaliar a solução proposta, introduzimos o Arquivo.pt-QA, um evaluation set para QA extrativo tanto para modalidade de documento singular como para Multi-documentos. Este é focado em artigos de notícias portugueses arquivados no Arquivo daWeb Portuguesa.

The Effects of Learning Environments on Fourth-Grade Reading Scores in a Suburban School District: Pre-Pandemic, Virtual, and Post-Pandemic

Abstract: Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, schools were forced to close their doors and alternative learning environments had to be established (Wyse et al., 2020). Most districts addressed this issue by creating virtual learning environments (Kaffenberger, 2021). The creation, adoption, and navigation of this new virtual environment created a plethora of opportunities for learning loss. Traditionally, learning loss is defined as any loss of knowledge and/or skills or reversal in academic progress, commonly due to gaps or discontinuities in a student’s education (Cooper et al., 1996). Researchers studied the effects of learning loss and its impact on the preceding academic gap school year. These findings support the learning losses identified as a result of the alternative learning environments created by the Covid-19 pandemic (Patarapichayatham et al., 2021). When students entered school post-pandemic, districts were faced with addressing the increased academic challenges as a result of virtual and hybrid instruction which appeared to be not as effective as in person schooling (Harmey & Moss, 2021). The altered academic environment had a different impact on students’ learning experiences particularly on student growth in ELA and mathematics (Patarapichayatham et al., 2021). In research presented by Bielinski et al. (2020), these challenges were the result of the Covid learning loss, decreased in-person attendance, and the need to adapt to varying learning environments. According to some studies, students returning to school post-pandemic after exposure to virtual learning fell below grade level for every month that they were not exposed to in-person learning (Harmey & Moss, 2021). Pre-pandemic learning, pandemic learning, and post-pandemic learning are three distinct experiences. This study explored the effects of the three learning environments on the reading levels of fourth-grade students in a suburban district.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 IEEE Engineering Informatics Conference Start Date: 2023, Nov. 22 Conference End Date: 2023, Nov. 23 Conference Location: Melbourne, Australia Augmented reality (AR) is a recent technology with applications in multiple sectors, including the healthcare industry. AR incorporates (or overlays) digital or computer-generated data such as audio, video, images, and contact or haptic sensations into a real-time setting. Innovations in augmented reality can assist medical personnel in diagnosing, treating, and operating on patients more precisely. However, healthcare differs from other disciplines because it focuses on something that is unique, unpredictable, simultaneously extremely complex, and fragile: The Human Body. This paper aims to comprehend the application of augmented reality and visualizations in medical and healthcare education and practice. The novelty of the paper is that in addition to providing an overview of recent successful augmented reality applications in healthcare, we emphasize that educational use of these in the present form (or after appropriate adaptation) provide benefits to teachers, students and working healthcare professionals. some of the key benefits are fast learning and better knowledge retention.

Abstract: Purpose: Organisational learning drives tourism organisations towards more sustainable tourism. Digital transformation also provides opportunities for sustainable tourism development. This study aims to combine these perspectives and explore how digital transformation enables organisational learning to contribute to sustainable tourism, following organisational learning theory (OLT). Design/methodology/approach: Based on a critical realist paradigm, this study focuses on developing an in-depth understanding of organisational learning in tourism organisations. Thirty qualitative interviews with tourism organisations participating in an executive development programme (EDP) show how tourism organisations create, retain and transfer knowledge. Findings: This study demonstrates that the EDP initiates knowledge creation through content transmission and exchange, triggers knowledge retention through utilisation of digital technologies and reinforces digitalisation through data value creation. Furthermore, this study enables knowledge transformation as implementation, which contributes to the three pillars of sustainable tourism and facilitates the development of networks encouraging sustainable tourism. Originality/value: This study identifies approaches that enable economic, social and environmentally sustainable tourism development by facilitating collaborations via digital transformation, digital technologies that guide guest streams, online mobility offers and online environmental awareness campaigns that reduce environmental impacts. Thus, this study strengthens OLT and has implications for organisational learning and tourism policymakers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: Background : PBL (problem based learning) is new active learning educational strategy that has been extensively tested and used in recent years. Patan Academy of Health Sciences (PAHS) is one of medical schools from Nepal, a Low Income Country (LIC) implementing PBL for undergraduate medical education. This study aims to compare PAHS students' understanding and knowledge retention when taught through PBL and lecture-based classes and compare students' perceptions of PBL and lectures in medical education. Methods : This is a cross-sectional study of medical students of a PBL based medical school in Nepal, a non-Western low-income country. Ethical approval was given by the institutional research committee of the Patan Academy of Health Sciences. Understanding and knowledge retention was assessed with 50 vignette-based multiple-choice questions, half of which were taught through PBL sessions, and the remaining half were taught in didactic lectures during basic science years of medical school. A separate pre-validated perception questionnaire was used to assess students' preferences regarding PBL and lectures. Results : Out of 107 students, 99 participated in the understanding and knowledge retention questionnaires and 107 completed perception questionnaires. Understanding and knowledge retention of students was found to be the same for topics taught by PBL and lectures, with median scores of 17 and s16, respectively. PBL were mostly preferred for the physiology (59.81%), pathology (51.40%) and pharmacology (53.27%) concepts, and lectures were mostly preferred for the anatomy (78.50%), biochemistry (45.79%), and microbiology (42.99%) topics. Students wanted the same concepts to be taught through both PBL and lectures, especially for anatomy. Conclusions : Understanding and knowledge retention is the same for topics taught by either PBL or lectures during the basic science years of undergraduate medical education. Students prefer PBL for physiology, pathology, and pharmacology-related concepts, conventional didactic lecture for physiology and microbiology, and a combination of lecture and PBL sessions for anatomy.

Author: Alenezi, Abdullah    

Publication info: Alenezi, Abdullah. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/teacher-perspectives-on-ai-driven-gamification/docview/3020728065/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: This study delves into the insights and experiences of teachers regarding the influence of AI-driven gamification on student motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes. Through qualitative research methods, teacher perspectives are explored to unravel the multifaceted aspects of AI-enhanced gamification within educational settings. The study identifies several significant themes, including positive perceptions of AI-driven gamification, challenges in implementation, elevated motivation and engagement, enhanced learning experiences, improved learning outcomes, and the complexities of assessing long-term effects. The findings underscore the transformative potential of AI-driven gamification, as educators highlight its ability to create democratic, effective, and transformative learning environments. Nevertheless, the study also uncovers challenges related to professional development, technical glitches, and curriculum alignment in the implementation of this innovative approach. Moreover, the study reveals a resounding consensus among teachers regarding the positive impact of AI-driven gamification on student motivation, participation, and learning experiences. Teachers emphasize how AI-driven gamification can turn ordinary learning into enjoyable and meaningful journeys, offering students autonomy and real-time feedback. Furthermore, teachers believe that AI-driven gamification contributes to improved learning outcomes, fostering a deeper understanding of subject matter, knowledge retention, and enhanced problem-solving skills. Despite these short-term gains, teachers acknowledge the need for longitudinal studies to comprehensively assess the long-term effects of AI-driven gamification on learning outcomes. Alternate abstract: У цьому дослідженні розглядаються погляди та досвід викладачів щодо впливу гейміфікації на основі штучного інтелекту на мотивацію учнів, залучення та результати навчання. За допомогою якісних методів досліджується сприйняття вчителями освітніх установ цього підходу, розкриваються багатогранні аспекти гейміфікації, розширеної ШІ. У дослідженні визначено кілька важливих тем: позитивне сприйняття гейміфікації на основі штучного інтелекту, проблеми з його впровадженням, підвищена мотивація та залученість учнів, покращений досвід навчання, покращені результати навчання та складність оцінювання довгострокових ефектів. Отримані результати виявляють трансформаційний потенціал гейміфікації на основі ШІ, оскільки викладачі підкреслюють її здатність створювати демократичні, ефективні та трансформаційні навчальні середовища. Дослідження також розкриває проблеми, пов’язані з професійним розвитком, технічними збоями та узгодженням навчального плану під час впровадження цього інноваційного підходу. Крім того, дослідження виявило значний консенсус серед викладачів щодо позитивного впливу гейміфікації за допомогою штучного інтелекту на мотивацію студентів, участь і досвід навчання. Викладачі наголошують на тому, що гейміфікація на основі штучного інтелекту може перетворити звичайне навчання на приємні та змістовні подорожі, пропонуючи учням автономію та зворотний зв’язок у реальному часі. Крім того, вчителі вважають, що гейміфікація, на основі штучного інтелекту позитивно впливає на результати навчання, сприяючи глибшому розумінню предмета, засвоєнню знань і вдосконаленню навичок вирішення проблем. Незважаючи на ці короткострокові досягнення, вчителі визнають необхідність лонгітюдних досліджень для всебічної оцінки довгострокових результатів гейміфікації за допомогою ШІ на результати навчання.

Abstract: This study is an interdisciplinary research that sought to explore knowledge loss risks interdependently in relation to the knowledge management (KM) and human resource management (HRM) disciplines in South African state-owned companies (SOCs). This study highlighted the significant role of knowledge-based HRM systems, which will naturally enhance the management capacity of tacit knowledge to mitigate risks and assist SOCs to deliver on a developmental mandate, as well as ensure their survival and the economic growth of developing nations. The paper aims to explore the connection between KM and HRM practices for the effective management of enterprise tacit knowledge loss risks using the SOCs of South Africa as a case. This study is a mixed methods research project, using the exploratory sequential design as a research strategy. Data were collected qualitatively through interviews with 20 purposively nominated human resource managers, and survey data was collected randomly from 25% (145 of the 585 responses) of the workers employed in SOCs. Qualitative data were analysed thematically using Atlas.ti and Statistical data were analysed using SAS and exploratory factor analysis. The relationship between HRM and KM practices in lessening the risks inherent in tacit knowledge loss, mainly from voluntary turnover, is underdeveloped in many South African SOCs. The study established that the role of HRM in supporting KM is limited and underdeveloped in many SOCs, largely because they are lagging in key structures and knowledge-centric cultures, behaviours and HRM practices to drive the effective management of company knowledge. This study assists HRM executives and KM practitioners to develop knowledge-driven HRM practices in order to mitigate risks from the loss of tacit knowledge, whilst ensuring sustained performance in public enterprises. The study and proposed strategies seek to influence the discourse, policies, practices and theories on KM and HRM praxis in companies to mitigate the risks associated with the loss of tacit knowledge.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing (IWAIIP) Conference Start Date: 2023, Dec. 1 Conference End Date: 2023, Dec. 2 Conference Location: Yogyakarta, Indonesia Catastrophic forgetting is an unavoidable phenomenon that arises when a previously learned model undergoes further training on a target dataset. When an event occurs, there is a loss of knowledge from past training, whether it be a partial or complete loss. In this study, there are two interconnected contributions. This research presents the introduction of a novel dataset for the purpose of examining the occurrence of catastrophic forgetting. The dataset was generated by employing a generative language model using an existing sentiment analysis dataset known as Sentiment140. The experiment yielded findings indicating that the created dataset exhibits distribution shifts in comparison to the original dataset. The present study involves the examination of two distinct language models, namely BERT and DistilBERT, which possess varying numbers of parameters. Moreover, the utilization of this information lends itself to the examination of domain adaptation. The occurrence of this phenomenon can be attributed to the domain shift that takes place between the two datasets.

Abstract: Background: Older adults are at risk of falls, which increases further in care home environments. Due to the complexity of care home residents’ conditions and an increasing ageing population, it is important for care staff to have knowledge and understanding in falls awareness, prevention, and management in order to support their residents. Literature searches identified that barriers to care staff implementing falls prevention strategies included the limited knowledge of staff and insufficient resources (including lack of staff training). There is scarce research regarding methods to deliver training to care staff, however emerging research in Virtual Reality (VR) as a training method had promise due to increased knowledge retention, and application into practice. No VR research in care home staff had been conducted at the time of commencing this project. Stakeholder patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) determined that VR as a training method had potential value. Aim: To develop and test the feasibility of a proof-of-concept Virtual Reality (VR) training programme for care home staff in falls awareness and prevention. Methods: A multi-phase project, including two research phases and one technology development phase, based on the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions (Skivington et al., 2021). An initial exploratory qualitative research phase (Phase I) was undertaken to guide the design and content of the training. A development phase followed this to create the falls awareness experience (FAE) proof-of-concept, utilising user-centred design with iCASE collaborator Sentireal. Following the development phase, a second research study was conducted (Phase II) - a mixed methods study exploring the feasibility of the proof-of-concept, obtaining additional feedback for further development of the VR training programme. Findings: Engagement, immersion and enjoyment were key factors for acceptability of a training method. The FAE suited the learning styles of care staff, and VR was accepted as a training method. Utilisation of a case study resident increased empathy to the resident experience. Feedback for development included additional locations, scenarios, and interactable items. Barriers and facilitators of acceptability and adoption were identified. Conclusions: Identifying a potentially effective method of training for a complex intervention may influence the creation of future training programmes for care homes: to assist in increasing care staff knowledge, retention of information, and application of knowledge into practice. This in turn may improve the quality of care delivered and resident outcomes. Additional research is required to develop the proof-of-concept into a minimum viable prototype, and feasibility tested further.

Escape Cardiac Arrest in Pregnancy: An Experimental Education Approach in a Concurrent Maternal and Neonatal Emergency Response

Author: Torres, Ivy

Publication info: Torres, Ivy. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/escape-cardiac-arrest-pregnancy-experimental/docview/2926379343/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: This dissertation investigates the pressing issue of education in cardiac arrest during pregnancy, an emergency of life-threatening significance that necessitates a coordinated response from maternal and neonatal healthcare teams. The study encompasses three primary chapters, each addressing a crucial facet of this intricate scenario. In the chapter titled "Cardiac Arrest in Pregnancy: A Scoping Review on Knowledge and Confidence in a Maternal & Neonatal Response," an extensive examination of existing literature illuminated substantial knowledge gaps in the resuscitation of pregnant individuals, a concern that has persisted for over a decade. These gaps encompass critical domains, including a dearth of high-quality research with a heavy reliance on limited experimental designs, small sample sizes that curtail the generalizability of findings, a lack of comprehensive comparisons among various teaching strategies for enhancing knowledge and confidence, an emphasis on short-term outcomes without adequate longitudinal assessments of knowledge retention and clinical impact, a need for tailored education programs catering to diverse healthcare professionals, and a scarcity of research on collaborative learning experiences, particularly concerning neonatology teams. These identified gaps offer valuable opportunities for future research aimed at fortifying the evidence base, refining educational approaches, and ultimately enhancing the management of cardiac arrest during pregnancy and neonatal resuscitation. This manuscript underscores the pressing need to expand educational initiatives beyond obstetrical units and to foster interdisciplinary collaboration among healthcare teams.The chapter titled, "Escaping PowerPoint: Enhancing Knowledge, Satisfaction, and Self-Confidence in Cardiac Arrest in Pregnancy," introduces an innovative teaching strategy known as the Virtual Escape Room (VER). The randomized controlled study compares the effectiveness of this virtual gamified approach with a traditional online PowerPoint method in improving knowledge acquisition, learner satisfaction, and self-confidence. The findings demonstrate the statistically significant superiority of the VER in enhancing these critical outcomes, highlighting the potential of immersive learning experiences in healthcare education. Notably, the data reveal a substantial increase in mean scores from the knowledge pre-test ( M = 59.58, SD = 16.30) to the knowledge post-test ( M = 68.24, SD = 17.42), t (64) = 5.635, p < .001 . The assessment tools employed included a knowledge quiz and The National League for Nursing (NLN) Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence instruments. The chapter titled "Puzzling Out the Correlates of Learner Engagement and Exploring Motivational States within a Virtual Escape Room," delves into the intricate aspects of learner engagement within the gamified learning environment of the VER. It uncovers the relationships between engagement, learner satisfaction, and specific engagement components such as enjoyment, creative thinking, and dominance. This manuscript underscores the multifaceted nature of engagement and highlights the imperative need for further research to achieve a more profound comprehension of its role in shaping learning outcomes. The study employed the Gameful Experience Scale (GAMEX) and the Telic/Paratelic State Measure (TPSI) instrument. Notably, statistically significant positive correlations were observed, including r = 0.346 ( p = 0.005) between the Enjoyment Score and knowledge post-test, r = 0.305 ( p = 0.013) between the Creative Thinking Score and knowledge post-test, and r = 0.255 ( p = 0.04) between the Dominance Score and knowledge post-test. Additionally, a significant interaction effect emerged between the T/PSI score (pre vs. post) and the educational intervention (VER vs. control group). T/PSI score increased from 35.83 (SD = 8.67) before the intervention to 38.86 (SD = 9.91) after the intervention, indicating a substantial change. In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference in T/PSI scores before and after the traditional PowerPoint intervention for the control group, where the mean scores changed from 35.89 (SD = 7.02) to 35.57 (SD = 7.94). These findings strongly suggest that the VER condition contributes to a paratelic state among participants when compared to the control condition. This dissertation underscores the paramount importance of effective education in managing cardiac arrest during pregnancy, given the persistent knowledge gaps among resuscitation teams. The introduction of the VER as an innovative educational strategy represents a significant advancement in addressing these deficits. Furthermore, the exploration of engagement and motivational states within the gamified learning environment offers valuable insights into the complexities of learner engagement, paving the way for more effective educational strategies in healthcare settings. Ultimately, these findings have the potential to empower healthcare teams, potentially reducing maternal mortality rates and improving neonatal outcomes in the face of this critical emergency.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 IEEE International Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics (SOLI) Conference Start Date: 2023, Dec. 11 Conference End Date: 2023, Dec. 13 Conference Location: Singapore The report investigates catastrophic forgetting (CF) in the context of continual learning using neural networks for image classification tasks. The study employs simple and small networks on datasets like the MNIST and split-CIFAR10, observing the immediate loss of knowledge when networks switch jobs. While findings align with some existing literature, severe forgetting is attributed to increased jobs, smaller networks, and lack of interleaved training. Notably, a more extensive network with a pretraining dataset exhibits more gradual forgetting, suggesting potential mitigation. A technique involving separate classifiers for each task is proposed, though practicality hinges on task awareness and classifier availability. The report recommends further exploration, suggesting experiments with more extensive networks pre-trained on diverse datasets and hybrid latent representations from classification and reconstruction models. The potential of the VAE is highlighted, as is empirically analyzing forgetting across different task numbers in split datasets.

Abstract: With the recent COVID-19 pandemic and necessary stay-at-home guidelines, the efficiency and effectiveness of online learning is more important than ever before. Knowledge retention during online lectures is directly related to the cognitive load faced by students. Cognitive load is concerned with the cognitive resources used during learning. It is directly related to the demand on an individual’s working memory—a limited resource which is heavily taxed by high task demands or split attention This thesis examines the effects of webcam use during an online lecture, specifically looking at whether webcam use by a participants’ peers causes enough cognitive and perceptual load to split the participant’s attention and therefore reduce knowledge retention. An analysis between three levels of webcam activity, high, medium, and low, and two levels of lecture difficulty were conducted. Ninety-six participants were collected and asked to complete an informed consent and a demographics form. Participants then watched two 15-minute prerecorded video lectures in one of the three webcam conditions mentioned above before completing two knowledge retention exams. A multivariate ANOVA between the three webcam conditions and two lecture difficulty conditions found no significant main effects or interaction on knowledge retention scores. In addition, no correlations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) self-report activity levels and knowledge retention scores were found under any combination of conditions.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW) Conference Start Date: 2023, Dec. 4 Conference End Date: 2023, Dec. 4 Conference Location: Shanghai, China Data annotated by humans is a source of knowledge by describing the peculiarities of the problem and therefore fueling the decision process of the trained model. Unfortunately, the annotation process for subjective natural language processing (NLP) problems like offensiveness or emotion detection is often very expensive and time-consuming. One of the inevitable risks is to spend some of the funds and annotator effort on annotations that do not provide any additional knowledge about the specific task. To minimize these costs, we propose a new model-based approach that allows the selection of tasks annotated individually for each text in a multi-task scenario. The experiments carried out on three datasets, dozens of NLP tasks, and thousands of annotations show that our method allows up to 40% reduction in the number of annotations with negligible loss of knowledge. The results also emphasize the need to collect a diverse amount of data required to efficiently train a model, depending on the subjectivity of the annotation task. We also focused on measuring the relation between subjective tasks by evaluating the model in single-task and multi-task scenarios. Moreover, for some datasets, training only on the labels predicted by our model improved the efficiency of task selection as a self-supervised learning regularization technique.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE Physical inactivity is a significant contributor to many acute and chronic medical conditions. While the dangers of physical inactivity (PA) are well understood and physicians have the desire to address them, a lack of education in exercise prescription (ERx) may be a barrier to properly prescribing exercise to patients. The aim of this research was to determine the effectiveness of an ERx medical education lecture and provide evidence for the need for formal ERx education among students and physicians in training with a secondary goal of further exploring medical student and resident habits and beliefs about PA and ERx. METHODS A one-hour education session was developed based on the American College of Sports Medicine principles of ERx. Pre- and postsurveys were administered immediately before and after the curriculum session to Wayne State University School of Medicine medical students and residents to assess perceived ERx knowledge level and confidence levels for prescribing aerobic and resistance exercise to patients. Virtual curriculum sessions were held over Zoom. RESULTS A total of 144 presurvey and 119 postsurvey results were analyzed. The mean perceived ERx knowledge level significantly increased from 4.67/10 ± 1.98 to 7.35/10 ± 1.56 ( P  < .001). Mean confidence level discussing PA with patients, ability to answer exercise-related questions, confidence level in ability to prescribe aerobic exercise, and ability to prescribe resistance exercise significantly increased in all groups and overall ( P  < .001) CONCLUSION A one-hour session to educate medical students and residents on how to write an ERx improved perceived knowledge and confidence in this subject matter. Although further study is needed to determine long-term knowledge retention and the impact on ERx behavioral practice in a patient care setting, this study provides preliminary evidence to justify its inclusion as a regular component of the medical school curriculum.

Abstract: Preservation of knowledge by an organization is critical for ongoing success. The knowledge transfer between retirees and their entity's remaining employees offers a unique opportunity to retain knowledge. Employers that engage with employees prior to their retirement can allow for a longer and more productive knowledge transfer process. The aim of our research has been to learn how to make knowledge exchanges successful by considering methods. Managers should consider new efforts for knowledge-continuity management. Multiple surveys were designed to determine the extent of knowledge-loss risk associated with retirees, the prevalence of informal and formal knowledge-transfer practices and the effectiveness of knowledge transfer for knowledge continuity. Results showed that organizations perceive significant knowledge-loss risk with the impending wave of retirements from an aging workforce and that many are not proactively approaching this opportunity. Organizations are leveraging only a few knowledge-transfer approaches and not leveraging technology for tacit knowledge transfers to occur. The data indicate that there is considerable room for improvement in knowledge-transfer practices - and our research offers practical implications for effective knowledge-transfer activities.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData) Conference Start Date: 2023, Dec. 15 Conference End Date: 2023, Dec. 18 Conference Location: Sorrento, Italy Intrusion Detection System is a strategic analytical tool for the security of organizations and institutions. Among existing approaches, distributed and collaborative intrusion detection approaches are particularly effective since they combine data analysis from multiple sources to provide increased model robustness. Although many state-of-the-art approaches have the ability to adapt to evolving environments and incoming data, they are subject to catastrophic forgetting of past knowledge. At the same time, recent works in lifelong continual anomaly detection showcase the merit of simultaneous adaptation and knowledge retention. However, lifelong methods are thus far limited to the analysis of a single data source and do not provide distributed and collaborative learning capabilities. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a novel distributed continual learning intrusion detection framework with collaborative experience replay. The system is built from independent Detection Nodes and a Continual Learning Center. While the nodes are in charge of data selection and intrusion detection, the Continual Learning Center implements a collaborative replay strategy, performs model updates, and broadcasts the most recent model to the nodes. The separation of responsibilities allows for the decomposition of the system into task-oriented services, leading to a modular, flexible, and scalable architecture. An extensive evaluation involving popular network intrusion detection datasets shows the potential of our framework and the improvement in detection performance that can be achieved with the collaborative replay strategy.

Abstract: Background: Older adult care organizations face challenges today due to high personnel turnover and pandemic-related obstacles in conducting training and competence development programs in a time-sensitive and fit-for-purpose manner. Digital microlearning is a method that attempts to meet these challenges by more quickly adapting to the educational needs of organizations and individual employees in terms of time, place, urgency, and retention capacity more than the traditional competency development methods. Objective: This study aimed to determine if and how an app-based digital microlearning intervention can meet older adult care organizations’ personnel competency development needs in terms of knowledge retention and work performance. Methods: This study assessed the use of a digital microlearning app, which was at the testing stage in the design thinking model among managerial (n=4) and operational (n=22) employees within 3 older adult care organizations. The app was used to conduct predetermined competency development courses for the staff. Baseline measurements included participants’ previous training and competency development methods and participation, as well as perceived needs in terms of time, design, and channel. They then were introduced to and used a digital microlearning app to conduct 2 courses on one or more digital devices, schedules, and locations of their own choice during a period of ~1 month. The digital app and course content, perceived knowledge retention, and work performance and satisfaction were individually assessed via survey upon completion. The survey was complemented with 4 semistructured focus group interviews, which allowed participants (in total 16 individuals: 6 managerial-administrative employees and 10 operational employees) to describe their experiences with the app and its potential usefulness within their organizations. Results: The proposed advantages of the digital microlearning app were largely confirmed by the participants’ perceptions, particularly regarding the ease of use and accessibility, and efficiency and timeliness of knowledge delivery. Assessments were more positive among younger or less experienced employees with more diverse backgrounds. Participants expressed a positive inclination toward using the app, and suggestions provided regarding its potential development and broader use suggested a positive view of digitalization in general. Conclusions: Our results show that app-based digital microlearning appears to be an appropriate new method for providing personnel competency development within the older adult care setting. Its implementation in a larger sample can potentially provide more detailed insights regarding its intended effects.

Abstract: Background: The potential of popular culture as a tool for knowledge delivery and enhancing engagement in education is promising but not extensively studied. Furthermore, concerns exist regarding learning fatigue due to increased reliance on videoconferencing platforms following the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure effective web-based teaching sessions that maintain attention spans and enhance understanding, innovative solutions are necessary. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the use of specific popular culture case studies to enhance student engagement in a web-based near-peer teaching session. Methods: We delivered a web-based teaching session to undergraduate medical students in the United Kingdom. The session included clinical vignettes and single-best-answer questions using characters from “The Simpsons” television show as patient analogies for various causes of jaundice. A pre-post survey, employing a 7-point Likert scale, was distributed to gather data from participants. Results: A total of 53 survey responses were collected. Participants reported significantly improved understanding of jaundice after the session compared to before the session (median 6, IQR 5-6 vs median 4, IQR 3-4.5; P <.001). The majority of participants agreed that the inclusion of “The Simpsons” characters enhanced their knowledge and made the teaching session more memorable and engaging (memorability: median 6, IQR 5-7; engagement: median 6, IQR 5-7). Conclusions: When appropriately integrated, popular culture can effectively engage students and improve self-perceived knowledge retention. “The Simpsons” characters can be used pedagogically and professionally as patient analogies to deliver teaching on the topic of jaundice.

Developing knowledge protective capacity through retention practices in South African state-owned companies

Author: Phaladi, Malefetjane P    

Publication info: Phaladi, Malefetjane P. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/developing-knowledge-protective-capacity-through/docview/2915858218/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Background: Extant knowledge management (KM) literature has established the importance of human resource management (HRM) practices and their relationship in support of the effective management of organisational tacit knowledge, albeit at a theoretical level. This study attempts to address this research gap by empirically exploring and focusing on specific HRM retention practices in support of knowledge transfer and retention efforts in the context of South African state-owned companies (SOCs). Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the extent to which HRM retention practices help to develop knowledge protection capacities in ensuring effective mitigation of enterprise tacit knowledge loss in South African SOCs. Method: This study used an exploratory sequential mixed methods research (MMR) design to investigate knowledge retention practices in South African SOCs. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 20 human resource managers and a survey with 585 randomly selected respondents, achieving a 25% response rate. Results: South African SOCs lack knowledge-driven retention strategies, which could reduce labour turnover and knowledge loss risks. These issues include success management, incentive schemes, job rotation, post-retirement knowledge contracting, counter-offers and job shadowing. If unaddressed, these issues could threaten organisational performance and economic sustainability. Conclusion: Insofar as human resource retention practices are concerned, this study concludes that they are not knowledge-driven, thus not helping SOCs in building the necessary capacities and capabilities for the protection of enterprise-specific knowledge assets. Contribution: This study sought to close a gap in research and practice linking human resource retention and knowledge protective strategies to address knowledge loss risks in SOCs.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) Conference Start Date: 2023, Oct. 1 Conference End Date: 2023, Oct. 6 Conference Location: Paris, France Co-speech gestures are a key channel of human communication, making them important for personalized chat agents to generate. In the past, gesture generation models assumed that data for each speaker is available all at once, and in large amounts. However in practical scenarios, speaker data comes sequentially and in small amounts as the agent personalizes with more speakers, akin to a continual learning paradigm. While more recent works have shown progress in adapting to low-resource data, they catastrophically forget the gesture styles of initial speakers they were trained on. Also, prior generative continual learning works are not multimodal, making this space less studied. In this paper, we explore this new paradigm and propose C-DiffGAN: an approach that continually learns new speaker gesture styles with only a few minutes of per-speaker data, while retaining previously learnt styles. Inspired by prior continual learning works, C-DiffGAN encourages knowledge retention by 1) generating reminiscences of previous low-resource speaker data, then 2) crossmodally aligning to them to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We quantitatively demonstrate improved performance and reduced forgetting over strong baselines through standard continual learning measures, reinforced by a qualitative user study that shows that our method produces more natural, style-preserving gestures.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) Conference Start Date: 2023, Oct. 1 Conference End Date: 2023, Oct. 6 Conference Location: Paris, France While recent developments in text-to-image generative models have led to a suite of high-performing methods capable of producing creative imagery from free-form text, there are several limitations. By analyzing the cross-attention representations of these models, we notice two key issues. First, for text prompts that contain multiple concepts, there is a significant amount of pixel-space overlap (i.e., same spatial regions) among pairs of different concepts This eventually leads to the model being unable to distinguish between the two concepts and one of them being ignored in the final generation. Next, while these models attempt to capture all such concepts during the beginning of denoising (e.g., first few steps) as evidenced by cross-attention maps, this knowledge is not retained by the end of denoising (e.g., last few steps). Such loss of knowledge eventually leads to inaccurate generation outputs.To address these issues, our key innovations include two test-time attention-based loss functions that substantially improve the performance of pretrained baseline text-to-image diffusion models. First, our attention segregation loss reduces the cross-attention overlap between attention maps of different concepts in the text prompt, thereby reducing the confusion/conflict among various concepts and the eventual capture of all concepts in the generated output. Next, our attention retention loss explicitly forces text-to-image diffusion models to retain cross-attention information for all concepts across all denoising time steps, thereby leading to reduced information loss and the preservation of all concepts in the generated output. We conduct extensive experiments with the proposed loss functions on a variety of text prompts and demonstrate they lead to generated images that are significantly semantically closer to the input text when compared to baseline text-to-image diffusion models.

The Effect of Gamified Training on Retention, Knowledge, and Confidence: A Longitudinal Experimental Study

Author: Damon, Patrick Michael, II

Publication info: Damon, Patrick Michael, II. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effect-gamified-training-on-retention-knowledge/docview/2915518022/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of gamified training in cybersecurity concepts on individuals not employed in information technology roles compared to traditional pieces of training. As the world becomes increasingly connected technologically, so too do the cyber vulnerabilities increase, and it is essential for all types of users, not just those in information technology, to avoid or detect vulnerabilities and potential cybersecurity incidents. This study was guided by the novel 7GOALS framework, built upon the existing PDCA framework. This study also utilizes the foundations provided by gamification theory and self-determination theory while introducing research on learning styles and how individuals have traditionally learned best. The study involved a pre-test, training, post-test, and one more test 30 days after the post-test to examine participants' knowledge, retention, and confidence. For this study, 115 individuals participated in the first component and 71 returned to perform the final test, exceeding the 54 participants that were needed for all components of the study. It was found that gamified training provides more significant increases in knowledge and retention but followed similar trends to traditional training regarding confidence. No relation was found between the level of knowledge and confidence as the control group had an alpha of over .05. A link was also found between knowledge and confidence where the gamified experiment component had a larger power with a rate of .735 with a smaller long-term confidence growth of .396 compared to the control group’s .533. Future studies would benefit from increasing the length of the study and the number of participants and adjusting different variables within the gamified pieces of training to determine which are most related to the trainee's success. Ultimately, the study results implicate that engaged, gamified training would be more effective than traditional training for non-technical users.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Conference Start Date: 2023, Oct. 18 Conference End Date: 2023, Oct. 21 Conference Location: College Station, TX, USA Traditional teaching methods often need help engaging students and effectively fostering active participation and knowledge retention. There is a growing need for innovative educational tools to address this challenge that can enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. Educational games have gained significant attention as an effective method to improve motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes in educational settings. This paper introduces Metabuleiro, a digital multiplayer board game developed as a gamified learning tool. While initially focused on teaching metabolism, obesity, and a healthy diet, Metabuleiro's versatility allows its application in various subjects. The objective is to provide teachers with a unique and engaging resource that enhances student engagement and promotes effective learning. Experts collaboratively developed Metabuleiro from computer science and biomedical science. The game combines elements of board games and quizzes to offer a collaborative and competitive learning experience. Careful consideration was given to the game's features, mechanics, and components to ensure an effective learning environment while maintaining an enjoyable gameplay experience. Throughout the development process, feedback from teachers at different educational levels was collected and incorporated into the game's revisions. The final version of Metabuleiro received positive evaluations from teachers, demonstrating high satisfaction and intentions to integrate the educational game or similar tools into their classes. This positive feedback highlights Metabuleiro's potential as an effective educational tool for enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes. Furthermore, the game's adaptability allows it to be applied across various fields of study, making it a valuable resource for educators seeking to incorporate game-based learning and active educational methodologies in their classes. To further enhance our understanding of the game's educational benefits, future research can explore direct feed-back from students and evaluate the impact of Metabuleiro on academic performance. Such research would provide additional insights into the game's effectiveness and validate its use as an educational tool.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW) Conference Start Date: 2023, Oct. 2 Conference End Date: 2023, Oct. 6 Conference Location: Paris, France In this work, we improve the generative replay in a continual learning setting. We notice that in VAE-based generative replay, the generated features are quite far from the original ones when mapped to the latent space. Therefore, we propose modifications that allow the model to learn and generate complex data. More specifically, we incorporate the distillation in latent space between the current and previous models to reduce feature drift. Additionally, a latent matching for the reconstruction and original data is proposed to improve generated features alignment. Further, based on the observation that the reconstructions are better for preserving knowledge, we add the cycling of generations through the previously trained model to make them closer to the original data. Our method outperforms other generative replay methods in various scenarios.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 IEEE International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT) Conference Start Date: 2023, Oct. 26 Conference End Date: 2023, Oct. 29 Conference Location: Venice, Italy In the field of graph-generated text, one of the core issues commonly explored is how to maintain the structural information of the graph to the maximum extent and reduce the problem of knowledge loss during training. Current research has mainly focused on exploring the ability of models to learn graph structures by increasing model size and refining the graph representation. In contrast, our work emphasizes the importance of perceiving and exploring edges in the graph itself. Edges provide a wide variety of structures to the graph structure, offering it freedom and diversity. Therefore, improving the model's ability to perceive edges could potentially enhance the task metrics of graph generation for text. To address this, we propose a graph-generated text model MKGS that maintains the original structure of the knowledge graph, effectively reducing knowledge loss during the learning process. Our approach achieves this at three levels: reorganizing the knowledge sequence as input to the model, enhancing edge perception during processing, and incorporating a graph rational activation function at the output. We validate our method using the Kg-to-text benchmark dataset WebNLG, where MKGS achieves a score of 66.22%. Additionally, the model exhibits fewer syntactic errors and produces smoother expressions in the generated text.

Southern Rio Grande Rift Kinematics and Geochronology, Big Bend Fold Geometry, and the Use of Real Data in Geoscience Education: Contributions to the Understanding of Big Bend Geology and to Public Geoscientific Literacy

Author: Kelsch, Jessica Moore

Abstract: The Big Bend region of Trans-Pecos Texas preserves a rich record of Rio Grande rifting and Laramide-age contraction that provide intrigue to national and state park visitors and field trips for undergraduate geology students. Despite its well-exposed geologic record, the Big Bend region remains an underutilized natural laboratory for studying these two tectonic events. This dissertation combines structural studies of Rio Grande rift and Laramide structures with public outreach and geoscience education studies focused on the Big Bend region. In Chapter 2, existing extensional-kinematic studies from parts of this region are compiled with new fault kinematic and U-Pb geochronologic data from normal and strike-slip fault surfaces across the Sunken Block and Black Gap grabens of the southern Rio Grande rift. These data delineate an early and long-lived NE-SW orientation of principal stretch (S1) lasting from at least 30.1+3.1 Ma to at least 13.7+0.9 Ma. Clockwise rotation of S1 to NW-SE followed the early orientation after 13.7+0.9 Ma, agreeing with a widely cited regional clockwise shift in tension and extension at ~10 Ma reported in the northern Rio Grande rift and the Basin and Range province. The locations documenting this progressive rotation of S1 in the southern Rio Grande rift also suggest that later faulting narrows and is constrained to the Sunken Block graben. Chapter 3 focuses on a footwall syncline under a Laramide thrust fault that is exposed in cross-section in a cliff wall at the end of the Dog Canyon trail in Big Bend National Park. This structure provides an opportunity to test fold models and is also societally relevant because it is a popular hiking trail for park visitors. Structural analysis reveals evidence of three deformation events preserved in minor structures within the folded rock. First and second in this geologic history were orthogonal flexure and horizontal contraction related to fault-propagation folding in front of and under the west-southwest-verging Santiago thrust fault. The third deformational event was horizontal extension interpreted to be associated with late Cenozoic Rio Grande rifting. This geologic history and an explanation of the structural analysis behind it are presented as a panel to be installed by the National Park Service as an interpretive wayside exhibit in front of the cliff on the Dog Canyon trail. Chapter 4 presents a geoscience education study, involving undergraduate students of all majors in core-science geology classes at two universities near the Big Bend region. For this study, students interacted with either locally or globally sourced geoscientific data within in-class quantitative exercises and were surveyed to query the outcomes of their engagement, knowledge-retention, critical-thinking skill, and perceptions of the relevance of the exercise topics to human society. The group exposed to local data returned higher scores and rankings than those exposed to global data after four of the five exercises, indicating a lead in each of those outcomes but most clearly in critical-thinking skill and in their perception of the relevance of the geoscientific topic.

Abstract: As we enter a world of blended learning in higher education, an increased need for adaptation of teaching strategies to enhance engagement has been recognised to amplify learning outcomes online. Gamification has been identified as a creative tool to engage the current cohort of learners who are also characteristically tech-savvy. To this end, escape room games have gained considerable traction in medical and pharmacy education to promote learning, critical thinking and teamwork. In this pilot study we describe the implementation of a 60-minute, web-based hepatitis-themed escape room game within a Year 3 Pharmacotherapy unit at Monash University. A total of 418 students participated in this activity. Students' knowledge gain on the topic was assessed through a pre- and post-intervention assessment, whereby a statistically significant improvement was seen in the knowledge score following implementation of the gaming activity (58.66% pre-intervention vs. 72.05% post-intervention, p < 0.05). The innovative learning activity was also well perceived by the students. Virtual escape room game is a viable pedagogical approach to teach and reinforce clinical concepts among pharmacy students. With the evolving landscape of education and learner demographics, investment in technology- enhanced game-based learning is a promising trajectory to support students' growth in a learner-centered environment. A comparison between virtual escape room game and traditional teaching will further inform effectiveness of the gamification on long term knowledge retention.

Abstract: The study aimed to conduct a systematic literature review to identify the trends, impacts, and challenges of mobile microlearning (MML) research. Using five academic databases from the fields of social science, engineering, and medical science as search sources, 26 scholarly articles, published between 2015 and 2020, were retrieved. The study applied a content analysis method to analyze and synthesize the data with three focal points: (a) research purposes and publication sources; (b) research settings, including learning domains, contexts, research methods, measures, and participants; and (c) research outcomes, advantages, and challenges of MML based on the reviewed literature. Results indicated that the mixed-method approach has become a trend in MML studies and MML has been widely applied in both formal and informal settings, especially in the just-in-time workplace learning. In terms of advantages, MML not only enhanced learners' achievement and motivation but also improved skills and knowledge retention. Some deficiencies of MML that were identified included the need for further investigation on meaningful designs of microcontents to fit into small screen mobile devices and issues of usability. The paper discusses implications for researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: This qualitative meta-synthesis sought to identify and uncover the challenges that Higher Education Institutions experience when implementing and maintaining a succession management program. Through a blended-theory approach, the theoretical framework combined Human Capital Theory (Schultz, 1961), Transformational Leadership Theory (Downton, 1973), and Organizational Knowledge Creation Theory (Nonaka, 1994) to understand the data analysis and results. The central research question guided the meta-synthesis, "How do existing succession planning strategies and knowledge retention practices support the administrative branch of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)?" Additionally, four sub-questions were developed to bolster the analysis. The selection of studies used in our meta-synthesis is purposefully chosen and rigorously evaluated through an article reduction analysis and further refined by two subject matter experts as raters in the final selection stage. Eleven studies were synthesized with 100% rater reliability, and a thorough analysis was conducted using NVivo 12, revealing four (4) thematic categories, including eight (8) subthemes and twenty-six (26) open codes. The findings show the barriers to implementing a succession management program and the core competencies required to create a successful succession management program.

Abstract: Registered nurses (RNs) working in today's healthcare environment must consistently learn new knowledge and skills, keep abreast of practice changes, and implement strategies to improve patient outcomes. However, healthcare organizations face significant challenges as they attempt to facilitate efficient training. Nursing professional development practitioners miss opportunities to leverage learner motivation, which drives investment, knowledge retention, and practice application. Gamification, which strategically embeds game elements and mechanics into an educational design to boost motivation, offers a potential solution. It aims to increase learner engagement by presenting learners with challenges, tracking their progress, and offering feedback, ultimately leading to knowledge retention and application. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine whether gamification leads to increases in motivation to learn and knowledge levels for RNs. Specifically, the study focused on RNs who did not have previous cardiac monitoring experience. The study used flow theory and self-determination theory to optimally incorporate gamification. A quasi-experimental posttest-only design with a comparison group allowed for comparisons among RNs who completed a traditional ECG course with those who completed a gamified ECG course. The comparison group contained 66 eligible participants who completed the survey and the experimental group contained 64 participants. Post-course surveys were electronically distributed to registered nurses who completed either the traditional or the gamified version of the ECG course. Research instruments included a demographic survey, the Flow Perceptions Questionnaire (a self-reporting motivational survey), and an ECG knowledge test. Additionally, RNs who completed the gamified version were administered a short survey measuring the motivational effects of included game elements and mechanics. Two hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to identify differences between the comparison and experimental groups when controlling for age and current patient care environment. The first indicated the addition of the variable class type to the prediction of ECG test scores was statistically significant ([delta]R[superscript 2] = 0.116, p <0.001). Therefore, the experimental group scored statistically significantly higher than the comparison group. The second hierarchical multiple regression suggested the addition of the variable class type to the prediction of Flow Perceptions Questionnaire scores was not statistically significant ([delta]R[superscript 2] = 0.006, p = 0.397). Thus, no significant differences were discovered between the two groups specific to learner motivation. In fact, the comparison group reported higher motivation levels than the experimental group. The proposed theoretical framework effectively guided the ECG course's gamification design; however, since anticipated learner motivation scores were not achieved, minor adjustments might be warranted. Game mechanics and game elements, specifically selected for the gamified ECG course based on learner personas, were mostly rated as promoting higher motivation levels. Future research must be conducted to improve sample diversity, control, and motivation measurement, in addition to exploring qualitative data, longitudinal outcomes, and gamification's various technological sophistication levels.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 21st International Conference on Emerging eLearning Technologies and Applications (ICETA) Conference Start Date: 2023, Oct. 26 Conference End Date: 2023, Oct. 27 Conference Location: Stary Smokovec, Slovakia This paper delves into the longstanding debate surrounding the efficacy of open-book versus closed-book examinations in the context of higher education, with a specific focus on courses within the domains of Information Science and Humanities. The choice between these two examination formats has significant pedagogical implications, as it shapes the learning experience, assesses the depth of understanding, and influences student outcomes. To elucidate the advantages and drawbacks of each approach, this study employs a mixed-methods research design, incorporating quantitative data from student performance metrics and qualitative insights from surveys and interviews. The authors examine these two phenomena in a hybrid learning environment, which has proven to be a resulting effective tool for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. They explore how the cognitive demands and assessment criteria differ between these two modes of examination, considering the distinctive nature of disciplines within Information Science and Humanities. In Information Science, open-book exams are often regarded as aligned with real-world scenarios, reflecting the accessibility of information resources in professional contexts in the post-COVID era. In contrast, closed-book exams emphasize memory recall and analytical reasoning skills. We investigate whether these distinctions translate into varied learning outcomes, student satisfaction, and long-term knowledge retention. Within the Humanities subjects, where critical thinking, analysis, and interpretation are paramount, the debate between open-book and closed-book exams gains further complexity. We examine how each format influences the development of critical thinking skills, the ability to synthesize and apply knowledge, and the cultivation of a deep understanding of complex texts and concepts. Additionally, this paper explores the role of technology and digital resources in shaping the dynamics of open-book exams, and whether this evolution in the accessibility of information has altered the outcomes in Information Science courses compared to Humanities courses. The findings from this study provide valuable insights for educators, curriculum designers, and administrators in Information Science and Humanities programs, helping them make informed decisions about the most appropriate examination format for their courses. By considering the unique characteristics of these disciplines, the research contributes to the ongoing conversation surrounding assessment methods in higher education and offers a nuanced perspective on the open-book versus closed-book examination dilemma.

Abstract: Smart City is recognized as a potential approach to address serious urban issues such as traffic, pollution, energy use, and waste management. Therefore, it is vital to evaluate how smart cities are in order to put these methods into practice. To offer advice on these matters, numerous reports are created, and one of which is Smart City Index (SCI). The Institute for Management Development (IMD) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design collaborate on SCI every year (SUTD). The report evaluates how locals view the buildings and technological applications that are available in their towns. Although the study offers a thorough examination of the cities for evaluation, the city clusters should be more sensitive and not be created using strict clustering techniques. In order to address this problem, the clustering algorithms namely K-Medoids, Fuzzy C-Means, and K-Means, which outperform hard clustering approaches in terms of robustness to vagueness and knowledge retention, are used. The main goal of this study is to categorize cities using a scientific manner (clustering algorithms) based on SCI data and to present how the chosen approaches work for dealing with the associated problems. The primary innovation of the present study is the use of clustering techniques in reports where the indexes are used. The results indicate that grouping the cities on the basis of their smart indicators would not be as effective as using the three clustering techniques that are suggested in this paper. These results add to the analysis of the dynamic capacities of smart cities and highlight the sustainability of these tactics.

Abstract: Purpose Organisational learning drives tourism organisations towards more sustainable tourism. Digital transformation also provides opportunities for sustainable tourism development. This study aims to combine these perspectives and explore how digital transformation enables organisational learning to contribute to sustainable tourism, following organisational learning theory (OLT). Design/methodology/approach Based on a critical realist paradigm, this study focuses on developing an in-depth understanding of organisational learning in tourism organisations. Thirty qualitative interviews with tourism organisations participating in an executive development programme (EDP) show how tourism organisations create, retain and transfer knowledge. Findings This study demonstrates that the EDP initiates knowledge creation through content transmission and exchange, triggers knowledge retention through utilisation of digital technologies and reinforces digitalisation through data value creation. Furthermore, this study enables knowledge transformation as implementation, which contributes to the three pillars of sustainable tourism and facilitates the development of networks encouraging sustainable tourism. Originality/value This study identifies approaches that enable economic, social and environmentally sustainable tourism development by facilitating collaborations via digital transformation, digital technologies that guide guest streams, online mobility offers and online environmental awareness campaigns that reduce environmental impacts. Thus, this study strengthens OLT and has implications for organisational learning and tourism policymakers.

Abstract: Physical inactivity is a significant contributor to many acute and chronic medical conditions. While the dangers of physical inactivity (PA) are well understood and physicians have the desire to address them, a lack of education in exercise prescription (ERx) may be a barrier to properly prescribing exercise to patients. The aim of this research was to determine the effectiveness of an ERx medical education lecture and provide evidence for the need for formal ERx education among students and physicians in training with a secondary goal of further exploring medical student and resident habits and beliefs about PA and ERx. OBJECTIVE Physical inactivity is a significant contributor to many acute and chronic medical conditions. While the dangers of physical inactivity (PA) are well understood and physicians have the desire to address them, a lack of education in exercise prescription (ERx) may be a barrier to properly prescribing exercise to patients. The aim of this research was to determine the effectiveness of an ERx medical education lecture and provide evidence for the need for formal ERx education among students and physicians in training with a secondary goal of further exploring medical student and resident habits and beliefs about PA and ERx.A one-hour education session was developed based on the American College of Sports Medicine principles of ERx. Pre- and postsurveys were administered immediately before and after the curriculum session to Wayne State University School of Medicine medical students and residents to assess perceived ERx knowledge level and confidence levels for prescribing aerobic and resistance exercise to patients. Virtual curriculum sessions were held over Zoom. METHODS A one-hour education session was developed based on the American College of Sports Medicine principles of ERx. Pre- and postsurveys were administered immediately before and after the curriculum session to Wayne State University School of Medicine medical students and residents to assess perceived ERx knowledge level and confidence levels for prescribing aerobic and resistance exercise to patients. Virtual curriculum sessions were held over Zoom.A total of 144 presurvey and 119 postsurvey results were analyzed. The mean perceived ERx knowledge level significantly increased from 4.67/10 ± 1.98 to 7.35/10 ± 1.56 ( P  < .001). Mean confidence level discussing PA with patients, ability to answer exercise-related questions, confidence level in ability to prescribe aerobic exercise, and ability to prescribe resistance exercise significantly increased in all groups and overall ( P  < .001). RESULTS A total of 144 presurvey and 119 postsurvey results were analyzed. The mean perceived ERx knowledge level significantly increased from 4.67/10 ± 1.98 to 7.35/10 ± 1.56 (P < .001). Mean confidence level discussing PA with patients, ability to answer exercise-related questions, confidence level in ability to prescribe aerobic exercise, and ability to prescribe resistance exercise significantly increased in all groups and overall (P < .001).A one-hour session to educate medical students and residents on how to write an ERx improved perceived knowledge and confidence in this subject matter. Although further study is needed to determine long-term knowledge retention and the impact on ERx behavioral practice in a patient care setting, this study provides preliminary evidence to justify its inclusion as a regular component of the medical school curriculum. CONCLUSION A one-hour session to educate medical students and residents on how to write an ERx improved perceived knowledge and confidence in this subject matter. Although further study is needed to determine long-term knowledge retention and the impact on ERx behavioral practice in a patient care setting, this study provides preliminary evidence to justify its inclusion as a regular component of the medical school curriculum.

Abstract: K-12 schools around the world are striving to practice equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) principles to provide effective learning opportunities for all students. At the classroom level, differentiated instruction (DI) is a teaching approach that addresses student diversities. This research focuses on important aspects of teacher training on equitable and inclusive strategies, being its long-term impact and teacher candidates’ (TCs’) retention of acquired knowledge and skills. This paper addresses the following research questions: 1) How do TCs implement DI in their school practicum after the training in the teacher education courses ends? 2) What challenges do TCs encounter upon implementing DI? 3) What are TCs’ long-term goals and aspirations of DI? and 4) What are effective strategies in EDI training in teacher education courses? The paper adopts a qualitative approach in which the data sources include a survey and semi-structured interviews conducted eight weeks after the end of a DI-focused course in the Teacher Education program. TCs’ responses highlighted how they implemented DI in their practicum, indicating retention of the acquired knowledge and skills. TCs also detailed how they plan on implementing EDI strategies in their future classrooms. This paper proposes a general framework for successful training of educators on EDI principles and practices such as DI. The framework’s essential elements are: 1) explicit and intentional training approach, 2) engaging trainees in reflective practice, 3) contextualization, specificity, and relevance of the training tasks, 4) providing ongoing feedback, and 5) collaboration and resource sharing among participants.

Abstract: Knowledge management is widely acknowledged as key to achieving competitive advantages and technological advancement in times of crisis. While a few studies have shown that COVID-19 affects the amount of knowledge loss, it also opens opportunities for new knowledge to be created and shared. This study investigated the effect that COVID-19 has on the loss of knowledge during a pandemic and the role of digital transformation has in the creation of new knowledge, which is essential as a reference for constructing a sustainable knowledge management system in times of crisis. A systematic methodological framework and bibliographic analysis on knowledge management and COVID-19 were employed from peer-reviewed journal papers published between 2019 and 2022 to highlight research trends and future directions. Results showed that knowledge creation and knowledge loss during pandemic have not been adequately studied, and the SECI model illustrated that knowledge creation can prevent and minimise knowledge loss. Effective governance, technology and digital transformation with the presence of social accountability and environmental sustainability are vital for producing innovative solutions from multiple perspectives sustainable knowledge management. Future research is needed to better assess how developing countries particularly manage knowledge creation, knowledge loss and digital transformation in times of crisis.

Active-Stakeholder Perspectives on the Alignment and Coherence of an Emi Academic Writing Course: A Curriculum-Analysis Case Study in a Japanese University

Author: Lees, David Peter

Publication info: Lees, David Peter.

Abstract: This research reports on a curriculum analysis of an English Medium Instruction (EMI) introductory academic writing course (nominally referred to as the E-AW course) operating in a Japanese university. Routine surveys conducted by the university concerning the E-AW course commonly reported lower-than-hoped degrees of attainment, knowledge retention, and perception of learning value. To examine suitability for function, this research explored student and instructor perceptions of the internal alignment or ‘fitness’ of the E-AW course and its external ‘fit’ – or coherence – with other courses in the wider curriculum. This exploration was based on principles theorised from the Constructive Alignment (CA) framework, chiefly (i) Clarity of Knowledge, (ii) Authenticity/Relevance of Knowledge, and (iii) Bridging of Knowledge. Finally, suggestions were provided for future curriculum development based on the research findings and a holistic understanding of formative environmental and institutional factors. The research employed a convergent mixed methods design, which provided the flexibility to collect and explore data on plural research objects – i.e., the E-AW course and its fit within its curriculum – from enrolled students and course instructors. Student-participants completed the Constructive Alignment Learner Experience Questionnaire (CALEQ) (n = 397) focused on the E-AW’s internal alignment, and volunteers further responded to an Email Questionnaire (n = 8) inquiring into their perception of external coherence between the E-AW’s learning objectives and other courses. The final stage gathered, via SemiStructured Interviews (n = 6), perspectives from E-AW course instructors on the course’s internal fitness and its external curricula fit. All three stages provided ‘slices’ of knowledge from both groups of participants, which converged to depict perspectives on the E-AW course’s alignment and coherence, and resulted in the following findings. First, students and instructors considered the E-AW to be well-aligned internally. Second, however, students and instructors were unsure whether the E-AW’s targeted skillset (i.e., deductive logical structure and citation conventions) was coherently utilised or referenced in the wider curriculum. Identified reasons for thislack of external coherence included: (i) a lack of official connection for skills taught between distinct courses; (ii) a lack of communication between the instructors of said courses; (iii) the potential decrease in comprehension due to the use of English via EMI; and (iv) the potential for the ‘academic writing’ skillset to be subsumed by the ‘language’ in which it is taught. Accordingly, the study recommends the following regarding development of the E-AW course-in-curriculum. First, curricula should be constructed considering the coherent connection across course boundaries of skillsets and knowledge. Second, coherence between course administrators and instructors ought to be fostered through communication. Third, institutions in non-English-speaking nations operating EMI courses should emphasise the transferability of skills and knowledge taught in those courses.

Abstract: Financial Literacy is one of the subject areas taught in Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS) courses which is not graduation requirement for high school students across Pennsylvania. The problem of practice I addressed is that Greensburg Salem High School (GSHS) students are graduating without the financial literacy knowledge and skills to become successfully independent adults. Three inquiry questions that guided my dissertation in practice are: 1) How is student financial literacy knowledge impacted by a simulation activity compared to the Next Gen Personal Finance (NGPF) curriculum and teaching practices?; 2) What are the teacher’s perceptions of implementing the simulation activity compared to the standard curriculum/practices?; and 3) Was the teacher able to implement the Budget Project simulation activity with high levels of fidelity? Two GSHS Financial Literacy classes participated in the inquiry project: one group of students completing a new Budget Project simulation activity and the other group completing the standard NGPF Budgeting Unit. Measures included a student pre/post survey to assess their financial literacy knowledge, an individual interview with the intervention classroom teacher, and observations of intervention implementation via a fidelity checklist. The descriptive statistics from the survey and fidelity data, combined with the codes from the teacher interview, revealed positive results in both the intervention teacher and the students. Students had higher financial literacy knowledge retention and understanding after completing the Budget Project, and the teacher reported ease of use and productive experiences with students. Future implications include modifying the GSHS Financial Literacy curriculum to include more simulation activities, including the Budget Project, and enhancing professional development for educators teaching financial literacy.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) Conference Start Date: 2023, Oct. 8 Conference End Date: 2023, Oct. 11 Conference Location: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Due to the point cloud’s irregular and unordered geometry structure, conventional knowledge distillation technology lost a lot of information when directly used on point cloud tasks. In this paper, we propose Feature Adversarial Distillation (FAD) method, a generic adversarial loss function in point cloud distillation, to reduce loss during knowledge transfer. In the feature extraction stage, the features extracted by the teacher are used as the discriminator, and the students continuously generate new features in the training stage. The feature of the student is obtained by attacking the feedback from the teacher and getting a score to judge whether the student has learned the knowledge well or not. In experiments on standard point cloud classification on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets, our method reduced the information loss of knowledge transfer in distillation in 40x model compression while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the education system, including problem-based learning (PBL), which is the main curriculum model in medical education. Social interaction and acquisition of knowledge and skills are one of the challenges in online learning during a pandemic. This study evaluated the use of the flipped classroom in the PBL curriculum of medical education. This study used mixed-methods design with a concurrent approach. The data collection technique was secondary data collection in the form of data from the block learning evaluation form. The evaluation form contains statements regarding the quality of the learning process, in the form of Likert scales. At the end of the form, there was a fill-in/essay question for more in-depth exploration. The quantitative data were analysed using descriptive univariate analysis, meanwhile, the qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis techniques. Unbalanced learning load on the block, block learning management, and knowledge retention in block learning were considered lacking in flipped classroom block implementation. The management of time delays, a stage for students to be ready, a step to lessen psychological stress, and the use of media to generate different learning experiences are particular areas that need improvement.

Abstract: Critical thinking is identified as a key educational outcome in higher education curricula; however, it is not trivial to support students in building this multifaceted skill. In this study, we evaluated a brief online learning intervention focusing on informal fallacy identification, a hallmark critical-thinking skill. The intervention used a bite-sized video learning approach, which has been shown to promote student engagement. Video-based learning was implemented within a precision teaching (PT) framework, which modulates the exposure of individual learners to the learning material to enable them to build 'fluency' in the targeted skills. In one of the learning conditions, PT was applied synergistically with domain-general problem-based training to support generalisation. The intervention consisted of two learning episodes and was administered to three groups (learning conditions) of 19 participants each: a PT fluency-based training group; a PT + group, where PT was combined with problem-based training; and a self-directed learning control group. All three groups showed comparable improvements in fallacy identification on taught (post-episode tests) and unseen materials (post-intervention assessment), with lower-scoring participants showing higher gains than high-scoring participants. The results of the knowledge retention tests a week later were also comparable between groups. Importantly, in the domain-general fallacy-identification assessment (post-intervention), the two PT groups showed higher improvements than the control group. These findings suggest that the integration of bite-sized video learning technologies with PT can improve students' critical-thinking skills. Furthermore, PT, on its own or combined with problem-based training, can improve their skill to generalise learning to novel contexts. We discuss the educational implications of our findings.

Abstract: Parasitic infections are declining in Japan, resulting in fewer hours of parasitology instruction in medical laboratory science and medical schools. However, there are growing concerns that the parasite identification skills of medical laboratory technologists and the diagnostic skills of physicians may be compromised as a result. Effective teaching methods are required to improve the identification of parasites in pre-graduate education. We therefore adopted a new teaching method: the blended learning method, in 2018. This method combined the e-learning and jigsaw methods, which had already been implemented separately in 2017. This study aimed to evaluate the pedagogical effectiveness of this blended learning approach compared to that of 2017 in teaching parasitology practice to students enrolled in the Department of Medical Laboratory Science. The results show that the median score for the practical test was 83.3 points for the blended learning lessons, which was not significantly different from the scores for jigsaw or e-learning lessons. However, blended learning had the lowest percentage of failures on the practical test, at 10.7%. Additionally, the microscopic image test results indicate a significant memory retention effect. From the questionnaire results, 94.7% of the students were satisfied with their practice. In conclusion, the blended learning did not significantly improve parasite identification skills, but it may reduce the number of failures, suggesting a knowledge retention effect and a high level of satisfaction with this practice.

Abstract: The Online Periodic Table of Elements (Ptable) is a Wikipedia-linked periodic table that displays a list of chemical elements organized by atomic number, electronic configuration, and recurring chemical properties. Elements are listed in reading order, increasing in atomic number, in their most basic form. The current study seeks to assess the impact of Ptable on students' understanding of trends in the properties of chemical elements. A mixed research strategy was used in this study. Chemistry students in grade eight (senior two) were selected to participate in this study. The sample size was 46 participants, with 38 students and 8 chemistry teachers chosen at random from two secondary schools in Bugesera District, in Rwanda. Interviews were used to collect qualitative data, which was then analyzed using discourse and interpretive analysis approaches. While quantitative data were collected by giving students achievement tests (pre- and post-test) and questionnaires, descriptive statistics were used to analyze them using a Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). According to the findings of this study, there was a statistical difference in student performance between the pre-and post-test, but no statistical difference between male and female students' academic performance. It was also discovered that students were pleased with the use of Ptable, which improved their learning and knowledge retention about trends in the properties of chemical elements. Teachers mentioned that Ptable is effective to teach trends in the properties of chemical elements. Among the difficulties noted were a slow internet connection and a limited number of computers.

Abstract: Aim/Purpose: This paper describes a technologies education model for introducing Simulation Learning and Extended Reality (XR) solution creation skills and knowledge to students at the tertiary education level, which is broadly applicable to higher education-based contexts of teaching and learning. Background: This work is made possible via the model's focus on advancing knowledge and understanding of a range of digital resources, and the processes and production skills to teach and produce playable educational digital content, including classroom practice and applications. Methodology: Through practice-based learning and technology as an enabler, to inform the development of this model, we proposed a mixed-mode project-based approach of study within a transdisciplinary course for Higher Education students from the first year through to the post-graduate level. Contribution: An argument is also presented for the utility of this model for upskilling Pre-service Teachers' (PSTs) pedagogical content knowledge in Technologies, which is especially relevant to the Australian curriculum context and will be broadly applicable to various educative and non-Australian settings. Findings: Supported by practice-based research, work samples and digital projects of Simulation Learning and XR developed by the authors are demonstrated to ground the discussion in examples; the discussion that is based around some of the challenges and the technical considerations, and the scope of teaching digital solutions creation is provided. Recommendations for Practitioners: We provide a flexible technologies teaching and learning model for determining content for inclusion in a course designed to provide introductory Simulation Learning and XR solution creation skills and knowledge. Recommendation for Researchers: The goal was to provide key criteria and an outline that can be adapted by academic researchers and learning designers in various higher education-based contexts of teaching and inclusive learning design focused on XR. Impact on Society: We explore how educators work with entities in various settings and contexts with different priorities, and how we recognise expertise beyond the institutional interests, beyond discipline, and explore 'what is possible' through digital technologies for social good and inclusivity. Future Research: The next step for this research is to investigate and explore how XR and Simulation Learning could be utilised to accelerate student learning in STEM and HASS disciplines, to promote knowledge retention and a higher level of technology-enhanced learning engagement.

Abstract: Active learning with student engagement has been demonstrated to improve knowledge retention and improve learning in graduate education. Nurse anesthesia education has traditionally been taught using lecture with slide presentations without considering student centered learning. Much attention has been given to active learning strategies to promote student engagement and content retention, yet little information exists regarding student preferences for in higher level graduate nursing courses. This mixed-methods study aimed to examine student learning preferences for seven different instructional methodologies; traditional lecture, a problem-based learning exercise, reading with workbook assignments, development of cognitive aids, game-based learning, practice questions, and a case study, as well as to which were best to learn by. Students prefer game-based learning, practice questions, and assigned reading with workbooks over lecture and other active learning exercises and reported game-based learning and workbooks from assigned readings as easiest to methods by which to learn.

Abstract: This experiment utilized advanced visualization technology for the delivery of an introductory remote sensing lesson in an undergraduate geography course. Given the numerous immersive visualization solutions available, it is now possible to leverage the capabilities of augmented, mixed, and virtual reality (AR, MR, and VR) technology in a classroom learning environment. For instructors, it is important to understand how advanced visualization technologies can enhance the learning experience and enable greater knowledge retention. To validate the use of an AR sand table/sandbox in a group academic setting, approximately 400 participants were evaluated to assess the impact on students' retention of both foundational and practical remote sensing concepts. This work represents a between-subjects design with two AR sand table experimental groups (instructor sand table interaction, and student sand table interaction) and one control group with no sand table exposure. The use of the AR sand table in a classroom environment was found to improve retention of foundational remote sensing knowledge and elevate the assessment performance for subjects identified as lower performers.

Specifications Grading Is an Effective Approach to Teaching Biochemistry

Abstract: Specifications grading is a relatively recent approach to assessing student learning. In this approach, students make progress toward completion of a course by demonstrating mastery of specific skills or material. The assessment tools are short, frequent exercises that can be attempted multiple times until mastered. This contrasts with the traditional, exam-based assessment of student learning. There are multiple benefits to the specifications grading-based strategy, including reduced test anxiety, better knowledge retention, and increased flexibility. In this study, specifications grading was implemented into an upper-level biochemistry course at a private, liberal arts university. The student cohort consisted almost exclusively of junior and senior biochemistry, biology, and chemistry majors. Students earned points for demonstrating mastery on each of 12 short quizzes in addition to points earned from laboratory exercises and on the cumulative final exam. Student attitudes were assessed using three surveys that were administered at the beginning, middle, and end of the course. The survey results indicated that the students had overall favorable opinions of the specifications grading approach and its use in this course. A comparison of student performance on the quizzes to their performance on the final exam showed that the students learned and retained the course material. Combining the survey and performance data, we demonstrated that the students' perceptions of their learning correlated well with their performances on the specifications grading tools. Together, these results indicated that specifications grading is an effective approach to assessing student learning and to maintaining student enthusiasm in an upper-level biochemistry course.

Humanizing Mathematics Education: Quantitative and Arithmetic Argumentation of Indigenous Cultural Practices

Author: Huencho, Anahí; Chandía, Eugenio

Abstract: Dehumanized and globalized mathematics education in the last centuries has led to established learning processes disconnected from indigenous knowledge. The effect of cognitive imperialism, given the systematic negation of the language and the culture, has as a disastrous consequence of the gradual and systematic loss of knowledge and indigenous reasoning. Thus, recognizing, appreciating and updating it turns into a task and challenge for the teaching and learning of math in the intercultural classroom. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to focus on analyzing the mathematical reasoning of the indigenous student while encoding and decoding an historic numeric registry artifact called "püron" (knot in the Mapuche language). The study was conducted in three schools on Mapuche territory of Araucanía Region in Chile, using the Participatory Action Research method. The results show that encoding/decoding quantities helps indigenous students to recognize structures and to establish a numeration system close to the historically reported cultural practices of the Mapuche people. Moreover, it extends the mathematical quantitative structure and reasoning to an arithmetic one seen in the present day cultural practices such as the measurement of fields for planting. Thus, the experience contributes to the students' linguistic awareness of "Mapudungun" (Mapuche language) in a numeration system framework.

Abstract: This study examined the impact of Quizlet, a digital learning tool, on the English collocation learning achievement and knowledge retention of Thai first-year students, focusing on the usage of ‘do’, ‘make’ and ‘take’. It also explored students’ attitudes towards using Quizlet. The participants were 76 first-year students from a private university in Bangkok, Thailand. The research was carried out during the first semester of the 2022 academic year using an achievement test and a questionnaire to gauge the learning differences and attitudes towards Quizlet. The statistical analysis included frequency and descriptive statistics and a paired-samples t-test to measure the difference in learning outcomes between Quizlet and the Grammar Translation Method (GTM). The study found that there was a statistically significant difference (p <.001) in knowledge retention after one month between students who learned with Quizlet and those who learned with GTM. It also revealed high student satisfaction with Quizlet, especially regarding its implementation, design, and content applicability to real life.

Abstract: Educators need design strategies to support medical students' motivation in online environments. Prompting students to frame a learning activity as preparing them to attain their life goals (e.g., helping others) via their clinical practice, a strategy called 'life goal framing', may enhance their autonomous motivation, learning strategy use, and knowledge retention. However, for students with low perceived competence for learning (PCL), life goal framing may have an adverse effect. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to test the effectiveness of life goal framing and the moderating effect of students' PCL. Introduction Educators need design strategies to support medical students' motivation in online environments. Prompting students to frame a learning activity as preparing them to attain their life goals (e.g., helping others) via their clinical practice, a strategy called 'life goal framing', may enhance their autonomous motivation, learning strategy use, and knowledge retention. However, for students with low perceived competence for learning (PCL), life goal framing may have an adverse effect. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to test the effectiveness of life goal framing and the moderating effect of students' PCL.First- and second-year medical students across four Canadian universities ( n = 128) were randomized to receive a version of an online module with an embedded prompt for life goal framing, or one without. Students' motivation, learning strategy use, and knowledge retention were assessed. Differences between conditions on each outcome were estimated using Bayesian regression. Methods First- and second-year medical students across four Canadian universities (n = 128) were randomized to receive a version of an online module with an embedded prompt for life goal framing, or one without. Students' motivation, learning strategy use, and knowledge retention were assessed. Differences between conditions on each outcome were estimated using Bayesian regression.Students' PCL was a moderator for autonomous motivation but no other outcomes. The prompt did not have a statistically significant effect on any outcome, even for learners with high PCL, except for a small effect on link-clicking behaviour. Results Students' PCL was a moderator for autonomous motivation but no other outcomes. The prompt did not have a statistically significant effect on any outcome, even for learners with high PCL, except for a small effect on link-clicking behaviour.The results of this study suggest that learners' autonomous motivation is influenced by how they make meaning of instruction in terms of their future life goals and their present confidence. We cannot recommend life goal framing as an effective design strategy at this point, but we point to future work to increase the benefit of life goal framing for learners with high confidence. Discussion The results of this study suggest that learners' autonomous motivation is influenced by how they make meaning of instruction in terms of their future life goals and their present confidence. We cannot recommend life goal framing as an effective design strategy at this point, but we point to future work to increase the benefit of life goal framing for learners with high confidence.

Abstract: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a spectrum of clinically and pathologically heterogenous neurodegenerative dementias. Clinical and anatomical variants of FTD have been described and associated with underlying frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology, including tauopathies (FTLD-tau) or TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). FTD patients with predominant degeneration of anterior temporal cortices often develop a language disorder of semantic knowledge loss and/or a social disorder often characterized by compulsive rituals and belief systems corresponding to predominant left or right hemisphere involvement, respectively. The neural substrates of these complex social disorders remain unclear. Here, we present a comparative imaging and postmortem study of two patients, one with FTLD-TDP (subtype C) and one with FTLD-tau (subtype Pick disease), who both developed new rigid belief systems. The FTLD-TDP patient developed a complex set of values centered on positivity and associated with specific physical and behavioral features of pigs, while the FTLD-tau patient developed compulsive, goal-directed behaviors related to general themes of positivity and spirituality. Neuroimaging showed left-predominant temporal atrophy in the FTLD-TDP patient and right-predominant frontotemporal atrophy in the FTLD-tau patient. Consistent with antemortem cortical atrophy, histopathologic examinations revealed severe loss of neurons and myelin predominantly in the anterior temporal lobes of both patients, but the FTLD-tau patient showed more bilateral, dorsolateral involvement featuring greater pathology and loss of projection neurons and deep white matter. These findings highlight that the regions within and connected to anterior temporal lobes may have differential vulnerability to distinct FTLD proteinopathies and serve important roles in human belief systems.Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a spectrum of clinically and pathologically heterogenous neurodegenerative dementias.

Abstract: Mathematical manipulatives and the concrete–representational–abstract (CRA) instructional approach are common in elementary classrooms, but their use declines significantly by high school. This paper describes a mixed methods study focused on knowledge retention and perceptions of students in a high school Algebra I inclusion class after a lesson on square roots using a novel algebra manipulative. Twenty-five students in a high school Algebra I inclusion class engaged in an interactive lesson on square roots paired with the manipulative to support their conceptual understanding. Participants completed a pretest, a post-treatment questionnaire, and a delayed post-test. The two-sample t test showed a significant difference in students’ pretest–post-test scores. However, conventional content analysis of the questionnaires showed that most students did not believe the CRA instructional approach supported their learning. Implications include increased use of manipulatives to teach abstract algebraic topics to support students’ conceptual understanding and destigmatizing the use of manipulatives in secondary mathematics classrooms.

Abstract: Employee retention is vital for employee morale, knowledge retention, performance, and cost savings. Although the City of Fort Worth municipality has generally experienced above-average employee turnover and attrition, an interesting case is the municipality’s Customer Care Contact Center, which has experienced high employee retention. The problem this study addressed was the lack of knowledge of employee perceptions concerning organizational climate factors that influenced employee retention at the City of Fort Worth Contact Center. The researcher used this knowledge to provide actionable recommendations for the City of Fort Worth on organizational climate factors to increase employee retention citywide. Therefore, this qualitative case study examined employee perceptions of organizational climate factors that influenced employee retention at the City of Fort Worth Customer Care Contact Center, generated knowledge on how to improve organizational climate factors, and provided actionable recommendations that could be used in other departments across the city to increase retention. This qualitative case study was conducted by administering online questionnaires, follow-up interviews, and a focus group that resulted in the qualitative data analysis from 22 employees, which consisted of 16 customer service representatives (CSRs) and six leaders. This research study included the following research questions: RQ1. What are the employee perceptions of the organizational climate factors that influence employee retention at the City of Fort Worth Customer Care Contact Center? RQ2. How can the City of Fort Worth use those organizational climate factors to increase employee retention citywide? This study followed the Braun and Clarke (2006) six-step thematic data analysis process of coding and analyzing themes, and data from all three data instruments were triangulated to improve credibility and reliability. The key findings were six themes that described the organizational climate factors that influenced employees to stay at their jobs. The first five themes focused on the following factors influencing employee perceptions, behaviors, and outcomes: work-life balance and well-being, supervisor quality and effectiveness, teamwork, development and advancement opportunities, and empowerment and accountability. The sixth theme focused on specific retention strategies, such as encouraging self-care and leading by example. Aligning with Herzberg’s two-factor motivation-hygiene theory and social exchange theory (SET), used as the theoretical framework, findings indicated that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors must be present, desired by employees, and perceived as valued to maintain employee satisfaction, improve performance, and employee retention. Implications for business included the opportunity to implement recommended strategies in other departments within the City of Fort Worth to encourage more motivated, engaged, and satisfied employees, which may lead to higher retention rates and organizational cost savings due to the potential reduction in recruitment costs. The research study revealed that quality leadership was a key component for creating a climate that fostered employee motivation and satisfaction: a prerequisite for increased employee retention. On this basis, future research should examine the ability of leadership development programs to expand leadership skills that foster healthy organizational climate factors in the workplace. Other recommendations for future research included determining if the civil service departments, such as police and fire, could apply the results successfully. In addition, build upon this research study by using mixed methods to determine more precise measurements for each factor, then create qualitative follow-up interviews and focus group open-ended questions based on the survey results. Furthermore, review exit interviews for more concrete evidence to determine actual reasons for leaving the organization instead of relying on participants’ future speculation.

Investigating the Role of Collective Trauma Among Afghan Refugees: A Transformative Mixed Methods Study

Author: Kirsch, Jaclyn Elizabeth

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/investigating-role-collective-trauma-among-afghan/docview/2878972263/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Although higher levels of mental health concerns among refugees and other forced migrant populations have received considerable attention, there is a dearth of literature exploring the concept of collective trauma and its impact on mental health outcomes among this population. Afghan refugees have been found to experience high levels of individual trauma that negatively impact their mental health, but there is a lack of understanding of the impact of collective trauma experiences on mental health outcomes. Guided by the Social Determinants of Mental Health (SDMH) Framework integrated with Historical Trauma Theory and Intersectionality, this multiple-manuscript dissertation explores the phenomenon of collective trauma among the Afghan refugee population in resettlement spaces. This dissertation uses data from a community-based participatory project that followed a transformative mixed methods study design developed in partnership with the Afghan refugee diaspora in Central Ohio. This exploratory mixed methods study began with a community survey ( N = 173) eliciting information on mental health, individual trauma, collective trauma, and post-migration difficulties, followed by a second phase of focus group discussions ( N = 36). In the first study, a scoping review was conducted to examine the current state of literature on the concept of collective trauma in the forced migration context. Following the guidelines established by Arksey & O'Malley (2005), the scoping review examined 19 articles were found that met review criteria. Six major themes were identified: (1) exploration of collective trauma; (2) impacts of collective trauma: (3) intergenerational trauma; (4) resilience and resistance; (5) practice and policy failures of the West; (6) solutions to healing. Results support the inclusion of collective trauma in future research on forced migration populations and advocate for interventions that work to heal collective trauma experiences. The second study uses quantitative data from the transformative mixed methods study to identify the frequency of collective trauma events and symptoms and investigate the sociodemographic differences among Afghan refugees on well-being outcomes postmigration. Results revealed high levels of collective trauma experienced by participants (N = 173). The most common experiences included “loss of knowledge about our culture as a result of the education give to our children”, “loss of land”, “losing our traditional values”, and “loss of respect by our children for traditional ways”. In addition, the most common collective trauma symptoms included “sadness or depression”, “anxious or nervousness”, and “loss of sleep”. Collective trauma experiences varied across different demographic strata. For example, women, Afghans who spent time in displacement and on military basses, ethnic minorities within the Afghan population, those with limited English, those with precarious visa statuses, and those with lower income showed an increased likelihood of experiencing higher levels of collective trauma symptoms and mental health concerns. Building off the findings of the second study that points to high levels of collective trauma among this population, the third study uses mixed methods results to investigate the role of collective trauma on Afghan refugee mental well-being and explore how collective trauma experiences among Afghans are associated with mental well-being within the post-migration context. Using hierarchical multiple regression, quantitative results showed a good model fit and that increased collective trauma is positively associated with negative mental health outcomes. Qualitative results corroborated a majority of the quantitative findings with three major themes: (1) impacts of collective trauma in the post-resettlement context; (2) post-migration stress: too little support, not enough opportunity; and (3) collective solutions for collective trauma. Findings from this study point to the need for the inclusion of collective trauma in future research on refugee mental health and the development of interventions that target collective trauma experiences to increase well-being among Afghan refugees in the post-resettlement context. This dissertation’s implications apply to social work research, practice, and policy. Future research should include the development of a scale to measure collective trauma and developing and implementing community-grounded interventions that target collective trauma. Advocacy for policies that support the passage of the Afghan Adjustment Act and for increased support for refuges post-resettlement is needed by social workers.

Abstract: Purpose Retaining critical knowledge is relevant for all organizations, knowledge-intensive ones in particular. Failure to do so can, in the worst case, lead to an organization being unable to act. Acknowledging the role of context in this regard, the purpose of this paper is to examine knowledge retention (KR) in the banking sector of a developing country. A particular focus is placed on exploring various contextual factors that influence the retention of critical knowledge taking into consideration the setting. Design/methodology/approach Following a qualitative research design, semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior managers from private and public banks in Pakistan. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Findings The findings suggest that the existence of a collectivist society, gender differences, few job opportunities, power distance and the late IT Boom are vital factors to be considered regarding KR in the setting studied. The findings are summarized in a conceptual framework that highlights critical factors of KR to be studied in a broader context and which are viewed as relevant for informing future research in this underdeveloped area of knowledge management (KM). Research limitations/implications The data were collected from a small number of individuals working in different banks in only one country. Future studies should consider research designs across multiple organizations involving more people representing different roles, functions and age groups. Originality/value Existing KM research has emphasized the role of context while research on KR is underdeveloped in this regard. By exploring different contextual factors this study advances current understanding in the KM domain.

Abstract: Meaningful learning occurs when learners actively connect new information to prior knowledge, leading to benefits in engagement and knowledge retention and transfer. Consequently, STEM courses increasingly seek to employ such practices in their programs. Currently, little is known about students’ beliefs regarding the value of meaningful learning and which formats promote it. However, insight into the student perspective is essential to effectively (re)design courses to support this type of learning. We surveyed a large cohort of biosciences students (N = 321) to determine which class formats (lectures, workshops, practicals) and delivery modes (online, face-to-face) they believe maximise opportunities for meaningful learning. Likert scale questions and inductive thematic analysis of open-ended questions showed students believe meaningful learning is most likely during in-person workshop or practical sessions, mainly through knowledge application, problem solving, and interaction with peers and educators. By contrast, students view inadequate opportunities to check understanding, lack of engagement or challenge, and difficulty interacting with peers and educators as barriers to meaningful learning. These findings provide a framework for educators to increase opportunities for students to engage in meaningful learning in their courses.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/great-resignation-quiet-quitting-as-post-pandemic/docview/2871352696/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Purpose: COVID-19 pandemic aftermaths include the emergence of new tendencies, such as the Quiet Quitting, and continuation of trends such as the Great Resignation, both of which have multiple knowledge-related impacts on individual, organizational and even national level. The aim of this paper is to show the mechanisms behind the Quiet Quitting and the Great Resignation from individual and organizational perspectives. Understanding them is the first step to developing remedies and building business resilience. Methodology: The paper uses systems thinking approach to analyse the phenomena of the Quiet Quitting. Causal loop diagrams are used to show the mechanisms behind those tendencies, their antecedents and the impact they have on several aspects of business operation and management. Findings: The Quiet Quitting and the Great Resignation are multifaceted phenomena and pose several knowledge-related dangers to organizations, including disturbed knowledge flows, knowledge loss, diminished efficiency, lost informal friendship networks, and knowledge leakage to competition. Causal loop diagram indicates that complicated relations between various elements may produce surprising and unexpected outcomes. It presents also opportunities to use leverage points in order to substantially reduce negative outcomes. Research limitations: The paper is of a conceptual nature. In order to transform causal loop diagrams into full systems thinking models extensive data is required. Hence this paper is intended as a basis for further research. Practical implications: The understanding of mechanisms behind the Great Resignation and the Quiet Quitting is crucial for managers trying to develop strategies that would tackle those problems. The papers shows what leverage points can be used to mitigate risks of their adverse impact on business organizations. Originality/value: The Great Resignation and the Quiet Quitting are often perceived as results of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet data suggest they remain strong also in the post-pandemic business reality. The paper offers a holistic approach to those phenomena using individual and organisational perspectives. It provides important insights into their nature, which can be useful to numerous stakeholders, including knowledge workers, managers and business owners.

Abstract: This paper reviews the management and organization studies literature underpinning the construct of knowledge loss. It proposes that five clusters of knowledge loss influence the capacity of organizations to retain their valuable organizational knowledge. Such clusters include hanging, fading, disengaging, dissolving, and vanishing. To overcome the disruptive consequences of knowledge loss, this paper proposes five potential organizational interventions including reminding, refreshing, re-acquiring, re-building, and re-inventing. This paper discusses the implications for theory and managerial practice in the context of the knowledge management literature and provides directions to future research.

Abstract: Systematic knowledge management is a decisive competitive advantage. While large companies can successfully implement knowledge management through dedicated people, tools, and processes, this topic poses major challenges for small and medium-sized enterprises. In this paper, we present the results of a qualitative study of knowledge management practices in different small and medium-sized enterprises. The results show that while on the one hand employees are aware of the importance of strategic knowledge management, on the other hand knowledge management is insufficiently implemented in the companies. Further, we also found that the potential of digital knowledge management is currently untapped. Consequently, there is a threat of knowledge loss due to staff turnover against the backdrop of demographic change and changing employment patterns. This likely loss of knowledge threatens the competitiveness and viability of the small and medium sized companies. Based on our findings, the article concludes with actionable recommendations for companies and future research tasks.

Abstract: This study aims to put forward measuring scales for two central concepts - vulnerabilities and knowledge risks - and identify the factors composing the two constructs. The research presented in this paper is part of a larger project investigating knowledge vulnerabilities and risks appearing in knowledge processes of organizations. In this sense, a new ontology developed by Brătianu et al. (2022) was used to design an instrument for measuring risks and vulnerabilities related to knowledge processes in organizations. Organizational knowledge dynamics perspective (Brătianu et al., 2022) was used to group knowledge risks typologies into the following clusters: knowledge creation, knowledge acquisition, knowledge loss, knowledge sharing, knowledge use, emotional knowledge dynamics, spiritual knowledge dynamics. Examples of knowledge risks belonging to such clusters may include a knowledge risk of non-creation and a knowledge risk of bad timing (for knowledge creation cluster), knowledge spillover or knowledge forgetting (for knowledge loss), as well as knowledge hiding and knowledge hoarding (for knowledge use). Our study fills a gap in the literature by suggesting a scale for measuring knowledge risks and grouping them by factor, and also a scale for measuring vulnerabilities and grouping them by type of vulnerabilty by means of principal components analysis. Current state of knowledge on vulnerabilities and knowledge risks comprises mainly theoretical approaches. Also, most studies do not discuss the concepts of knowledge risks and vulnerabilities together. The main novelty of our study lies in its quantitative approach to analysing knowledge-related vulnerabilities and risks. For this purpose, a questionnaire was applied to a sample of employees comprising both managers and non-managers from Romanian organizations. The factors resulted after having applied the principal components analysis have provided a clearer picture of the constructs of vulnerabilities and knowledge risks, leading to a deeper understanding of knowledge processes and their risks.

Building Knowledge Absorptive Capacity in South African Public Companies Through Recruitment Practices

Author: Phaladi, Malefetjane Phineas11 Durban University of Technology, South Africa

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/building-knowledge-absorptive-capacity-south/docview/2871350574/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Most state-owned companies (SOCs) in South Africa are in a perpetual struggle to recruit human resources and replenish their intangible knowledge asset losses that are largely due to high employee turnover. The study is interdisciplinary in nature, presenting a strong link between recruitment practice, employee turnover, knowledge loss and knowledge absorptive capacity. The research project used a mixed methods exploratory sequential design by gathering in-depth qualitative data through interviews with 20 human resource managers in 9 SOCs. Survey data was collected from a 25% response rate to the 585 distributed questionnaires. The survey instrument was tested for reliability with a Cronbach's alpha at 0.94. The qualitative data extracted through the interviews were analyzed thematically using Atlas.ti software, whilst the quantitative data were analysed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS). The findings revealed that due to increased human resources mobility, human resource management (HRM) establishments in many SOCs were in a perpetual struggle to fill vacancies in mission-critical areas. Knowledge-loss induced by human resource attrition was a serious challenge in most SOCs. On a positive note, the study revealed that recruitment practices were knowledge-driven, largely because they supported SOCs in the sourcing of the required company-specific human and knowledge resources, albeit some extant challenges. The study concluded that HRM recruitment practices build knowledge absorptive capacity in South African SOCs.

Abstract: There is increasing evidence that tacit knowledge is "the important strategic resource that assists in accomplishing a task (Woo, 2004)." According to Haughton (2021), Knowledge is a valuable asset, and managing that knowledge is now recognised as a significant contributor to organizations in the current business climate'. When people with expertise leave a job, the organization often loses critical tacit knowledge because the person did not pass it on to others. This knowledge gap can be costly and time-consuming or impossible to replace (Leonard, 2014). However, government institutions and agencies are known to be not good when it comes to knowledge management (KM) implementation and thus often suffer knowledge loss when employees/people with expertise leave a job, retire, or pass away. A qualitative study was conducted in one of the government agencies which has recently embarked on KM initiatives to find out what their strategies and challenges are in preventing knowledge loss. The study used the Knowledge Management Capability Assessment Tool (KM CAT) theory to assess KM initiatives in the agency. The data was collected by purposefully interviewing senior officials/managers in the agency's KM directorate. Despite the results of the study revealing that there are several challenges experienced by the agency in its endeavour to implement an effective and efficient KM process and strategy to help stem the tight against loss of knowledge, there are signs of good improvement. However, the agency needs to be resolute in its adoption of a systematic approach to KM to ensure the full utilisation of the organisation's knowledge base, coupled with the potential of individual skills, competencies, thoughts, innovations, and ideas to create a more efficient and effective organisation.

Abstract: Purpose - Organizational knowledge loss (OKL) is an urgent problem in the field of knowledge management because it can have a negative impact on intellectual capital and leads to significant competitive disadvantages for the companies concerned. In academic research, this phenomenon is considered a consequence of knowledge risks, especially when experts possess valuable knowledge and leave a knowledge-intensive organization. However, a basic understanding of the conceptual structure of OKL remains elusive. Methodology-Io address the existing knowledge gap, we conducted a bibliometric analysis based on a network and factor-oriented approach to identify the key themes, contexts, and patterns of OKL. For this purpose, we obtained bibliometric data from the Web of Science and the Scopus databases. Using the advanced bibliometrics package Biblioshiny in R, we conducted performance analysis and science mapping. Findings - Based on our four research questions, we present the following key findings: First, we find that annual science production in the field of OKL research over the period 2004 to 2023 peaks in 2022. Second, we found that absorptive capacity (AC) is increasingly becoming a central theme in OKL research. Third, the average citation rate per year for OKL research has declined noticeably since 2020. Fourth, the most influential publications in OKL research deal with AC in the context of strategic alliances. Research limitations - This study focuses solely on researching the conceptual structure and thus does not consider the intellectual and social structure of OKL. Practical implications - In view of the results obtained, we recommend that future research work should further investigate the relationship between OKL as a focus of organizational forgetting and AC as a learning ability in an innovation environment. Originality/value - This paper is insightful, as it reveals the conceptual structure and thematic evolution of OKL and directs research interest to the field of learning organizations.

Abstract: This research study examined the implementation of an extended reality (XR) lab on a community college campus to facilitate student and faculty access to immersive learning resources. The study, conducted during one skills day, involved 46 students and was designed to understand if integrating immersive VR into emergency medical technician (EMT) education could enhance learner confidence and motivation, develop problem-solving and analytical thinking skills, and thus connecting the classroom learning with real-world application. The majority of participants reported increased motivation and engagement, alongside improvements in learning outcomes like knowledge retention and skill development. Applying the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model revealed performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions as key determinants of VR adoption in EMT education. While no significant overall performance enhancement was observed, VR training showed potential to boost motivation, confidence, and specific performance aspects. Furthermore, student perceptions towards VR in EMT education were largely positive, thereby suggesting its utility in immersive scenario training, skill acquisition in a risk-free environment, enhancing learner engagement, and real-world situational preparedness. VR demonstrated promise as a transformative tool in EMT education, necessitating further research to fully exploit its potential in diverse learning environments.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health concern worldwide, affecting over 500,000 individuals. Despite great progress towards its elimination, many healthcare providers have substantial knowledge gaps and are unaware of and do not follow current screening guidelines. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to decrease the incidence of preventable cervical cancer among Wahiawā Center for Community Health patients by increasing the rate of guideline-adherent screening. To achieve this, the project had two objectives: (1) increase awareness and understanding of cervical cancer screening and management guidelines among providers, medical assistants, and patient service representatives, and (2) increase patient understanding of pelvic exams, cervical cytology, human papillomavirus testing, and human papillomavirus’ link to cervical cancer. A multi-pronged approach was employed, consisting of two tailored educational presentations, a “cheat sheet,” a patient education handout, and a demonstration of the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology management website. Post-tests were administered immediately after participation in the educational presentations and 8 weeks later. The response rate ranged from 35% to 67%. Providers, medical assistants, and patient service representatives showed high accuracy immediately after participation in the educational presentations and high knowledge retention after 8 weeks. However, some knowledge loss was observed, particularly regarding cervical cancer screening intervals. The proxy measure for patient understanding indicated that the patient education handout was effective. Due to the long natural history of cervical cancer, long-term surveillance of clinic data is needed to assess the project’s impact on cervical cancer incidence.

Abstract: The main objective of environmental education is to promote pro-environmental behaviors; increasing knowledge and understanding are the first steps. Active learning plays a crucial role in increasing engagement levels and achieving positive behavioral development. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a wildlife-friendly farming curriculum, including active learning, presented to 223 students aged 13–15 years from ten middle schools in Garut Regency, Indonesia, from June to September 2019. Using pre- and post-questionnaires, we found that knowledge retention and understanding increased if students completed an exercise that involved an active discussion with parents and if the class was engaged (monitored via WhatsApp groups) in an active learning experiment. Key concepts regarding wildlife-friendly farming, such as mutual benefits for wildlife and humans, the provision of ecosystem services by animals, and the use of organic farming, were more frequent if students discussed the program with parents or if they were engaged during the experiment. We found evidence that student engagement via active learning increased knowledge retention and understanding of wildlife-friendly farming. Similar approaches should be used to promote wildlife-friendly farming approaches from even younger ages and should be tested with other projects aimed at producing pro-environmental behaviors.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are poised to revolutionize education by offering immersive and interactive learning experiences. This research comprehensively evaluates the educational applications of AR and VR, specifically emphasizing their impact on student motivation, learning outcomes, engagement, and overall learning experiences. The analysis explores how AR and VR can improve student learning, knowledge retention, and skill acquisition by systematically reviewing existing the literature from diverse educational domains, including K-12 education, higher education, STEM education, professional training, and lifelong learning. Additionally, the research investigates the pivotal role of AR and VR in fostering immersive and interactive learning environments, unveiling how these technologies promote active learning, collaboration, and critical thinking through simulations and interactive experiences. The evaluation considers the potential of AR and VR beyond traditional classroom settings in distance education and assesses the feasibility of virtual classrooms, web-based learning environments, and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).

Abstract: The digitization of classrooms has enormously changed teaching during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The rapid introduction of tablet classes subsequently raised questions about potential learning outputs, as only a few studies had produced quite contradicting outcomes. Consequently, our study was set up to monitor cognitive learning outcomes of conventional and digital teaching interventions by explicitly paying attention to short- and long-term knowledge retention rates. Both modules covered the very same classroom content in focusing on the curricular content of the forest ecosystem. Subjects were eighth-graders from seven Bavarian secondary schools (analog: n = 74; digital: n = 225). We analyzed the knowledge gained by applying a multiple-choice questionnaire (online, 25 items) in a pre–post-retention design. For the statistical analyses SPSS was used, and a Rasch analysis was based on the ACERQuest software (Version 2.1). The Rasch calibration of the ad hoc knowledge items assured solid scores ( Rel = 0.72). Both interventions significantly increased knowledge (analog and digital: p < 0.001; Cohen’s d : d analog = 0.59, d digital = 0.42) compared to the pre-test scores. Even after 6–9 weeks, there was no significant drop in the acquired knowledge scores (analog: p = 0.619; digital: p = 0.092) compared to the immediate post-test observed. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the knowledge levels reached after both interventions. The knowledge scores showed typical learning profiles of earlier studies including its consistency even after several weeks. Since no significant differences appeared for the knowledge gain of both groups, the kind of teaching seemingly does not originate any influence independent of participation in the digital or analog module. The same seems to be valid for notebook entry options.

Exploring the influence of mobile AR learning environment intervention on college students’ learning outcomes and learning experience

Author: Wonaphotimuke, Anantaya11 North Carolina State University, US

Publication info: Wonaphotimuke, Anantaya. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/exploring-influence-mobile-ar-learning/docview/2868254740/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) technology has gained increasing attention within educational spaces, such as museums and academic institutions due to advancements in computing power and technology. AR technology affords learning activities that would be impractical to implement in physical environments by allowing superimposed additional information on to the real world (Steffen et al., 2019). Recent works have shown that AR technology has a significant potential to engage learners, elicit situational interest, and increase learning performance among learners due to the novelty that the technology brings in. However, there are opportunities for research on the novelty and the use of AR technology for learning from a design perspective that can be add to the corpus of literature in Design. Thus, this dissertation studies the influence of a mobile AR learning environment intervention on college students' learning outcomes and learning experience. This dissertation involves two stages: (1) prototype design and pilot study; and (2) intervention sessions. In the first stage, through various design methods (e.g., artifactcontent and task analyses, prototyping, and usability testing), the researcher developed a working prototype of a mobile AR learning environment. This environment consisted of ten learning experiences in total, and utilized different interactive strategies to present information that aligned with learning content in relation to the learning task for each concept. In the second stage, the data were collected during intervention sessions, where 57 undergraduate college students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: control (using traditional learning media: textbook) vs. AR intervention (using mobile AR learning environment along with traditional learning media). During intervention sessions, participants were asked to learn a theoretical concept via 15 pages of reading, either with or without the mobile AR learning environment. Video and screen recordings were administered during the learning activity. Both groups answered a pre-activity survey and a pre-test of comprehension prior to the learning activity. After completing the learning activity, both groups answered a post-test of comprehension, a post-activity survey based on an adapted Situational Interest (SI) survey and Augmented Reality Immersion (ARI) survey, and a retention test. Lastly, both groups participated in a semi-structured interview.Findings did not suggest any difference in comprehension between the two conditions. While participants in the control group had greater learning gains on average, comprehension results were not statistically significant. In terms of knowledge retention, while participants in the AR intervention group had greater retention scores on average, findings did not suggest any difference in retention score between the two conditions as retention results were not statistically significant. The interaction analysis suggested that participants in the control group exhibited more frequent note-taking behaviors than the AR intervention group, which might have resulted in overall better performance in the comprehension test. However, participants in the AR intervention spent significantly more time to complete the learning tasks, and they exhibited multitasking behaviors where there was a need to switch learning-related tasks between different learning materials and tools.Findings also suggested that the use of mobile AR learning environments can trigger situational interest, positive affective responses, and immersion in terms of attraction, time investment, focus and attention, more than traditional learning materials (textbook). Lastly, findings indicated that novelty, usability of technology and design of the mobile AR learning environment, interaction, motivating factors (e.g., goal), and comprehension are all contributing factors to the experiential aspect of the learning process.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 42nd Chinese Control Conference (CCC) Conference Start Date: 2023, July 24 Conference End Date: 2023, July 26 Conference Location: Tianjin, China Data-driven model plays an important role in monitoring wastewater treatment processes (WWTPs). However, since online data-driven models only focus on modeling the current operational status, it is a challenge to determine an appropriate model to guarantee the prediction performance for WWTPs with multiple operational conditions. Therefore, an interval type-2 fuzzy neural network with multi-gradient learning (MGL-IT2FNN) is proposed for modeling WWTPs in this paper. First, a condition detection mechanism is designed to detect the switching points of operational conditions of WWTPs. This mechanism can guide the learning process of IT2FNN. Second, when operational condition switching occurs, a multi-gradient optimization algorithm is developed to adjust the parameters of IT2FNN, which is able to balance the previous knowledge retention ability and the learning ability of new operational conditions. Third, MGL-IT2FNN is employed to capture the operational features under different conditions. Finally, the presented MGL-IT2FNN is applied to monitor the total nitrogen removal of WWTPs with multiple operational conditions. The experiment signifies that the accuracy and effectiveness of MGL-IT2FNN are greatly outstanding in WWTP modeling.

Just-In Time, on the Go Learning: Investigating the Impact of a Novel Question-Based Microlearning Program for Medical Professionals

Author: Ramaiah, Sarah Deepthi

Abstract: Health professionals spend significant years in training and after training continue to learn to perform procedures, study terminologies, engage in collaborative learning, and knowledge retention. An innovative model is needed that emphasizes just-in-time instruction with focused intervention that is flexible and accessible. A survey conducted by a premier American medical society revealed the need for an innovative educational program for its members; thus, the medical society launched a question-based microlearning program as an exclusive membership benefit.  This mixed methods, three-article dissertation investigated the formative design of the microlearning program, experiences of content experts in question bank development, and implementation of the program. Further, this study examined the effectiveness of the microlearning program and the difference in the learning experiences and engagement between the microlearning program and traditional online courses. The content experts were surveyed, and results established that the experience of the content experts played a crucial role in the development of rich case-based and practical question banks for the microlearning program. The analysis of the historical pretest to posttest change scores of 339 participants indicated an improvement in the overall performance of participants from the pre- to posttests. Early career participants enrolled in more question banks when compared with participants with more experience in the field. This validated that the question-based microlearning program appealed to early career professionals as a suitable learning modality. There was no relationship between geographic location, primary profession, or career stage of participants on the improvement in their change scores. Finally, analyses of survey responses from participants enrolled in a traditional eLearning course and the microlearning program established that the question-based microlearning intervention was an effective, flexible, and convenient modality. Participants reported they favored the question-based microlearning program over the traditional modality for their current and future learning needs. Results indicated a greater improvement in the change scores of participants in the question-based microlearning program compared to the change scores of the same participants in the traditional eLearning course. The studies provide quantitative and qualitative analyses on the advantages, flexibility, and effectiveness of the question-based microlearning program as a learning modality for medical professionals.

The Effect of Medication Information Delivery Format on Cognitive Load and Knowledge Retention of Informal Caregivers

Author: McPherson, Mary Lynn

Publication info: McPherson, Mary Lynn. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effect-medication-information-delivery-format-on/docview/2862039898/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Informal caregivers (IFCs) are tasked with many responsibilities in patient care, including medication management. Many IFCs feel ill-prepared for this responsibility, and it is incumbent on health care professionals to provide education and ensure IFCs competence in medication management. One common strategy is to provide a medication information leaflet to the IFC to prepare them for this role. Designing medication information leaflets using sound educational principles, such as an infographic designed according to the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML), may optimize knowledge retention and decrease cognitive load for IFCs. The purpose of this randomized, experimental study was to investigate the impact of medication information delivery format on immediate retention of medication information and cognitive load of IFCs of patients with a serious illness. Using purposive sampling, 120 IFCs who have provided some element of medication management for patients diagnosed with a serious illness, including patients who may have been receiving hospice or palliative care services were recruited. Study participants were randomly assigned in either the experimental group or the control group. The experimental group viewed an infographic on the medication hydromorphone, followed by a knowledge quiz, and a self-assessment of cognitive load. This was followed by a second infographic on hydroxyzine, the quiz, and cognitive load assessment. The control group went through the same steps but viewed a text-only medication leaflet. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, independent samples t-test, one-way analysis of variance, and one-way multivariate analysis of variance. Statistically significantly higher quiz scores were observed among those who viewed the infographics than those who viewed text-only medication leaflets, indicating better immediate knowledge retention of medication information. Those who viewed the infographic also had statistically significantly lower intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load, and higher germane cognitive load. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that infographics prepared using the CTML result in better and more efficient learning. Limitations of this research include use of nonprobability sampling, examining only two medications that are commonly used in serious illness, and lack of systematic randomization. Additional research is needed to continue determining best practices for instructing and supporting IFCs in medication management.

Abstract: This thesis's purpose was to gain a deeper understanding of how organizations create knowledge retention (KR), both proactively (day-to-day basis) and reactively (when an employee decides to resign), to avoid knowledge loss. A qualitative multiple case study was conducted through semi-structured interviews, with eight respondents from eight different organizations. An analytical model based on Levy’s (2011) KR framework and Nonaka and Takeuchi's (1995) knowledge spiral model was developed as a tool to understand the KR process in practice. The study found that all studied organizations worked proactively to retain knowledge, either structured or unstructured. The respondents with a structured, proactive KR process did not apply a reactive KR process, showing that they are more prepared for handling potential knowledge loss when employees resign. The respondents that did not apply a structured, proactive KR process applied a reactive knowledge retention process, where the main explanation for this was lack of time or unawareness of the process. Furthermore, no clear groups emerged in the empirical material as the companies faced different challenges at each stage of the analytical model. Lastly, the study concludes that these findings could be particularly relevant for organizations seeking to conduct KR processes to avoid losing valuable knowledge.

A Mobile Augmented Reality Thunderstorm Training Technique to Enhance Aviation Weather Theory Knowledge Curricula

Author: Wang, Kexin    

Publication info: Wang, Kexin. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/mobile-augmented-reality-thunderstorm-training/docview/2859422845/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: In the year 2020, 1,157 General Aviation (GA) accidents happened, of which 210 were fatal. Research suggests that some of these accidents are due to ineffective training in weather theory such as inconsistent program setup and reliance on 2D materials. Weather theory knowledge includes fundamental principles underlying various weather phenomena. This knowledge equips pilots with the ability to distinguish and effectively respond to diverse weather conditions they may encounter during flights. Inadequate training can lead to a poor level of competence in weather theory and impact pilot decision making. Research shows that most aviation programs focus on interpreting weather reports instead of teaching theory. In addition, current training usually occurs with 2D materials such as text, images, or video. For GA pilot students, it might be difficult to map 2D information into a 3D mental model and often resulting in discrepancies between course material and real-world situations.  Extended Reality (XR) technologies, encompassing virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) offer capabilities to address these problems. High-fidelity simulators can provide aircraft movements according to a pilot’s input. However, such simulators are aircraft specific, costly to build and run, and difficult to access for pilot students. Compared to high-fidelity simulators, XR simulators are low-cost and can cover a range of aircraft. However, XR simulators often use head mounted displays (HMDs) to provide an immersive experience that still may not be affordable for pilot students. Despite an HMD-based simulator, a mobile-based XR system is even lower-cost and more accessible to students. Among the different XR systems running on mobile devices such as phone or tablet, mobile AR stands out due to its ability to provide both rotational and translational movement (6-DoF), while mobile VR is limited to rotational transformation only (3-DoF).  Mobile AR presents immersive content through commodity devices such as smartphones and tablets and can use 2D printed markers to ensure accurate registration of virtual content. Numerous studies have found that mobile AR systems can improve knowledge retention, reduce cognitive load, facilitate collaboration, increase motivation, and engage students in learning new skills. However, the rendering capabilities, camera tracking, and screen size on mobile devices may limit AR’s usability in complex phenomena and interactions. For example, weather topics such as thunderstorms have a lot of movement occurring inside the cloud, which can affect flight safety. Implementing a thunderstorm into an AR experience requires a realistic appearance, effective visual cues, and scenario activities to teach proper flight safety. To date, there has not been research on how to implement these into a mobile AR system. As a result, a new solution is needed. The research presented in this thesis studies the development and implementation of a thunderstorm simulation using AR deployed on mobile devices as a means to improve the teaching of GA pilot students.  To create a thunderstorm’s volumetric appearance, a particle system was implemented along with specialized shaders. Assessments and scenarios were then developed to provide specific experiences aimed at teaching pilot decision skills. To overcome limitations in the computational power of mobile devices, different viewing perspectives, specialized image targets, and user interfaces (UI) were also implemented to lower the rendering overhead, maintain stable tracking, and provide a smooth user experience. To better understand the application’s performance, a technical evaluation was performed to study the rendering and tracking performance of the application across different devices. For the purposes of this thesis, AR on a commodity device will be referred to as mobile AR.

Abstract: Registered nurses (RNs) working in today's healthcare environment must consistently learn new knowledge and skills, keep abreast of practice changes, and implement strategies to improve patient outcomes. However, healthcare organizations face significant challenges as they attempt to facilitate efficient training. Nursing professional development practitioners miss opportunities to leverage learner motivation, which drives investment, knowledge retention, and practice application. Gamification, which strategically embeds game elements and mechanics into an educational design to boost motivation, offers a potential solution. It aims to increase learner engagement by presenting learners with challenges, tracking their progress, and offering feedback, ultimately leading to knowledge retention and application.The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine whether gamification leads to increases in motivation to learn and knowledge levels for RNs. Specifically, the study focused on RNs who did not have previous cardiac monitoring experience. The study used flow theory and self-determination theory to optimally incorporate gamification. A quasi-experimental posttest-only design with a comparison group allowed for comparisons among RNs who completed a traditional ECG course with those who completed a gamified ECG course. The comparison group contained 66 eligible participants who completed the survey and the experimental group contained 64 participants. Post-course surveys were electronically distributed to registered nurses who completed either the traditional or the gamified version of the ECG course. Research instruments included a demographic survey, the Flow Perceptions Questionnaire (a self-reporting motivational survey), and an ECG knowledge test. Additionally, RNs who completed the gamified version were administered a short survey measuring the motivational effects of included game elements and mechanics.Two hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to identify differences between the comparison and experimental groups when controlling for age and current patient care environment. The first indicated the addition of the variable class type to the prediction of ECG test scores was statistically significant (ΔR2 = .116, p <.001). Therefore, the experimental group scored statistically significantly higher than the comparison group. The second hierarchical multiple regression suggested the addition of the variable class type to the prediction of Flow Perceptions Questionnaire scores was not statistically significant (ΔR2 = .006, p = .397). Thus, no significant differences were discovered between the two groups specific to learner motivation. In fact, the comparison group reported higher motivation levels than the experimental group.The proposed theoretical framework effectively guided the ECG course's gamification design; however, since anticipated learner motivation scores were not achieved, minor adjustments might be warranted. Game mechanics and game elements, specifically selected for the gamified ECG course based on learner personas, were mostly rated as promoting higher motivation levels. Future research must be conducted to improve sample diversity, control, and motivation measurement, in addition to exploring qualitative data, longitudinal outcomes, and gamification's various technological sophistication levels.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Conference Start Date: 2023, June 17 Conference End Date: 2023, June 24 Conference Location: Vancouver, BC, Canada Data-free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) has gained popularity recently, with the fundamental idea of carrying out knowledge transfer from a Teacher neural network to a Student neural network in the absence of training data. However, in the Adversarial DFKD framework, the student network's accuracy, suffers due to the non-stationary distribution of the pseudo-samples under multiple generator updates. To this end, at every generator update, we aim to maintain the student's performance on previously encountered examples while acquiring knowledge from samples of the current distribution. Thus, we propose a meta-learning inspired framework by treating the task of Knowledge-Acquisition (learning from newly generated samples) and Knowledge-Retention (retaining knowledge on previously met samples) as meta-train and meta-test, respectively. Hence, we dub our method as Learning to Retain while Acquiring. Moreover, we identify an implicit aligning factor between the Knowledge-Retention and Knowledge-Acquisition tasks indicating that the proposed student update strategy enforces a common gradient direction for both tasks, alleviating interference between the two objectives. Finally, we support our hypothesis by exhibiting extensive evaluation and comparison of our method with prior arts on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Knowledge loss due to the exit of experienced employees with critical knowledge results in significant financial and nonfinancial impacts on employees and organizational competitiveness. Business leaders are interested in finding strategies to initiate and reinforce employee knowledge sharing to prevent business failure. Grounded in social cognitive theory, the purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore strategies business leaders in Nigerian oil and gas public sector agencies use to initiate and reinforce knowledge sharing among employees to prevent knowledge loss. The participants were five business leaders in Nigerian oil and gas public sector agencies who successfully initiated and reinforced knowledge sharing among employees. Data were collected through semistructured interviews and a review of organizational documents. Thematic analysis yielded four themes: develop structured mentoring, institute a knowledge-sharing culture, establish open and effective communication, and provide leadership support. A key recommendation is for business leaders to utilize the employee handbook to assist in knowledge sharing. The implications for positive social change include the potential to increase intellectual capital among employees, boost efficiency and overall productivity, and reduce the learning curve cost attributed to employee replacement, resulting in cost savings that organizations can channel toward social projects for the benefit of the host community.

Plant-based traditional foods and beverages of Gumare Village, Botswana

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/plant-based-traditional-foods-beverages-gumare/docview/2848922603/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: The consumption of traditional and indigenous foods and beverages varies across different ethnic communities and is often influenced by geographical location. However, the diversity of edible plants is rapidly declining due to climate change, leading to a loss of knowledge about useful plants used by different communities before the plant itself becomes extinct. This research investigated the edible plant types and investigated the processing steps of plant-based traditional foods/dishes and beverages of Gumare village, located in the catchment area of the Okavango Delta in the northwest of Botswana. Questionnaire interviews and focus group discussions (FGD) were used to collect data. The study identified 52 wild and 19 domesticated edible plants used in the preparation of traditional foods/dishes and beverages of Gumare village. Maize, sorghum, millets, beans, melon, watermelon, pumpkin, bottle gourd and sweet potato are widely used domesticated crops. The wild edible plants are either directly used after minor processing or as recipes in traditional dishes and/or as an inoculum in the fermentation, as a substrate in traditional beverages and some as medicinal plants. However, some taboos and food safety challenges were observed in the use of certain plants. The study highlighted a decline in the use of traditional foods/dishes and beverages, particularly among the young generation. The youth indicated that they have a low interest in gathering traditional foods and beverages due to the time-consuming nature during harvesting and the labour-intensive processing. In addition, they indicated the dangers of attacks by wild animals from veld by reptiles (for example snakes and pythons) and alligators (crocodiles) from rivers during the harvesting of raw materials used in traditional foods and dishes. For the communities, the diverse edible wild plants documented are a source of nutrients and bioactive compounds such as dietary fibers, phenolics, terpenes, essential oils, carotenoids, and alkaloids that help to combat malnutrition and for use as traditional medicines to support health and wellness. In conclusion, the significant diversity of wild edible plants and domesticated crops in Gumare village, likely due to its location in the catchment area of the Okavango Delta, plays a crucial role in diet diversification and can contribute to food and nutrition security. However, for most wild edible plants of Botswana, information on their nutrient and bioactive compounds are still limited. This study provides baseline information for further chemical investigation and development of resources in the formulation of functional foods and nutraceuticals.

Abstract: This dissertation describes strategies instructional designers can use to foster essential processing when designing multimedia instruction with different combinations of the use and non-use of the modality and segmenting principles described by Clark and Mayer (2016). This study investigated the main effects of segmenting and modality, and different combinations of the use and nonuse of the modality and segmenting principles, on recall and transfer test scores on gear instruction. The results from this study provide insight into how the use of one or more principles impacted overall, recall, and transfer learning outcomes. The results of the study revealed a lack of significant main effects for modality and segmenting on the overall, recall, and transfer posttest scores. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences observed among the four groups: control, modality, segmenting, and segmenting & modality. These findings suggest that the utilization of modality and segmenting principles did not improve learning outcomes compared to not using any principle, and employing both principles together did not yield superior results compared to using modality or segmenting alone. These results are inconsistent with a considerable body of prior research; however, they do not imply disregarding all previous research in the field. It should be noted that the sample size consisted of only 71 participants, which was a small sample size. The brevity of the treatment duration and the presence of ceiling effects may have influenced the findings of this research. The observed ceiling effects can potentially be attributed to several factors, including the simplicity of the test items used in the instrument, administering the instrument immediately after the instructional intervention, the effectiveness of the instructional intervention itself, and participants' existing knowledge prior to the study. Future studies could utilize a larger sample size, select more complex instructional topics, and incorporate more rigorous instruments. These improvements would have facilitated a more accurate assessment of the impact of the modality and segmenting principles on learning outcomes. Moreover, exploring the effect of the modality and segmenting principles on delayed transfer would have provided valuable insights into their long-term effectiveness in promoting knowledge retention and transfer.

Abstract: Education mediated by simulation is a widely used method for teaching basic life support (BLS). The American Heart Association recommends protocols based on scientific evidence to reduce sequelae and mortality. We aimed to assess learning and retention of knowledge of BLS in students of the first semester of the medical course using teaching methods of dialogic expository class (group 1), expository and demonstrative class (group 2), and the two previous methodologies associated with simulated practice (group 3), and after 3 months, memory retention. BACKGROUND Education mediated by simulation is a widely used method for teaching basic life support (BLS). The American Heart Association recommends protocols based on scientific evidence to reduce sequelae and mortality. We aimed to assess learning and retention of knowledge of BLS in students of the first semester of the medical course using teaching methods of dialogic expository class (group 1), expository and demonstrative class (group 2), and the two previous methodologies associated with simulated practice (group 3), and after 3 months, memory retention.This was an experimental, prospective, randomized study. Participants were assessed in terms of performance in theoretical and simulated practical tests, satisfaction with training (Likert scale), and knowledge retention. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was an experimental, prospective, randomized study. Participants were assessed in terms of performance in theoretical and simulated practical tests, satisfaction with training (Likert scale), and knowledge retention.The practical test results were analyzed by two experienced observers. Students had 20% progression in knowledge and 80% retention of knowledge after 3 months of exposure comparing the theoretical pre- and posttest. The students in group 3 performed better than the others ( P = 0.007) in the posttest. With the simulated practice, the knowledge acquired was maintained after 3 months with a mean performance of 90%, but in the test of the infant age group, there was a loss of learning retention by 10%. There was no difference of the results between the two evaluators ( P < 0.001). The training was positively assessed by the participants.

Impact of a Spanish-language cardiovascular health education session on knowledge retention in the Latinx adult community

Author: Santoyo-Cuellar, Felipe11 Georgetown University, Nursing, US

Publication info: Santoyo-Cuellar, Felipe. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/impact-spanish-language-cardiovascular-health/docview/2847029344/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Heart disease remains a major cause of death worldwide, and is highly prevalent among Latinx populations, affecting 52.3% of adult men and 42.7% of adult women, in the United States due in part to healthcare disparities. To address this, it is important to study the effectiveness of heart disease education among Latinx adults to improve their understanding and application of knowledge. While printed materials are often used for patient education, they may not effectively meet the needs of all patient populations. This project aims to examine the impact of a Spanish-language cardiovascular disease education program on the adult Latinx community in Maricopa County, Arizona. The study will evaluate knowledge retention through pre- and post-education intervention tests and assess participant satisfaction through a survey. The project was presented to key stakeholders using the Rosswurm and Larrabee framework to ensure feasibility. The education session included three segments: cardiovascular disease information, interpretation of food labels, and how to modify traditional Latin cuisine in a heart healthy way. The pre- and post-test used the Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors Knowledge Level (CARRFKL) Scale with 28 true or false questions. The satisfaction survey consisted of five questions using a Likert scale. A paired samples t-test was used to compare knowledge percentage correct pre- to post-education intervention. Percentage correct among the participants that completed the pre and post-test (n = 26) increased significantly from 87.0% (SD = 7.7) correct pre to 97.9% (SD = 3.4) correct post, with statistical significance, p < .001. The satisfaction survey (n = 29) displayed overall favorable results with the education session materials and presentation. Providing culturally and linguistically tailored education sessions in patients' preferred languages can improve knowledge retention and promote understanding of health promotion in cardiovascular disease.

Captioning and Repetition for Chinese Students' Immediate and Delayed Retention of English-Speaking Multimedia Lessons

Author: Liu, Yinan

Publication info: Liu, Yinan. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/captioning-repetition-chinese-students-immediate/docview/2844982264/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Background Studies: Captioning and repetition are widely used multimedia instructional devices for non-native students. Generally, studies in this area have tended to focus on second language literacy skills rather than on learning new content knowledge. Additionally, posttests were administered immediately after the treatments, while the delayed influences of captioning and repetition have never been investigated. Objectives: This paper addressed these research gaps in two separate studies. More specifically, this study attempted to examine the influences of captioning and repetition on non-native students' immediate and relayed retention. Methods: In Study One, three captioning conditions; word-by-word captions, closed captions, and no-captions; were compared to examine their efficacies in immediate and delayed content knowledge retention on 82 Chinese university students. To address the limitations in Study One as the multimedia lesson was short and played only once, Study Two incorporated captioning and two repetition types in its design. One hundred and eleven Chinese university students watch a video lesson in one of four captioning and repetition conditions. Results: The statistical analyses of Study One indicated that there were no significant differences in both immediate and delayed retention test scores across the three captioning condition. Similarly, in Study Two, there were no significant differences in retention tests scores across the four captioning and repetition conditions. Findings: Neither the availability of captions nor the repetition types had any impact on the Chinese students' immediate or delayed content knowledge retention, which lent support to existing studies. Based on the research results, the limitations and future study possibilities are discussed.

Abstract: This study examines the effects of technology-enhanced interventions in hospitality curricula using an overarching research hypothesis -- Does a course that features multi-model inputs, web-based learning opportunities and interactive communications prepare students well for their internships? Through an exploration of various influences within blended learning, this study unpacks students' responses to the pedagogical design, technology-enhanced interactions and in turn, assess for their intercultural competencies. The theoretical framework informing this study confirms the hypothesis that these multifaceted classroom activities demonstrated pedagogical effectiveness for knowledge retention. The findings showed that students' intercultural competences were significantly promoted. Students' learning interactions also improved due to the processes of video-making, sharing and discussions in the classroom. Moreover, these classroom activities significantly raised students' intercultural awareness. With regards to the effectiveness of the course for internship preparation, students showed moderate levels of satisfaction. Theoretical and practical contributions to the embedding of ICT within hospitality courses are provided.

Building a Solid Foundation: Succession Planning Practices Improving Knowledge Management and Employee Retention Within Higher Education Institutions (HEIS)

Author: Hatcher, Shanika D.

Publication info: Hatcher, Shanika D. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/building-solid-foundation-succession-planning/docview/2840132547/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: The business management problem addressed in this study results from the need for succession planning practices in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). This systematic qualitative review examined which succession planning practices improve knowledge management and employee retention within HEIs. Despite the growing number of baby boomer retirements and the unexpected exit of key leaders, succession planning is still not a top priority for HEI leaders. Additionally, a loss of knowledge occurs when leaders and employees retire or leave the organization unexpectedly before sharing knowledge to prepare the next generation of leaders. Knowledge not transferred throughout an organization leads to lower productivity and employee morale, often leading to lower employee retention. Through a qualitative systematic review process, this dissertation provides an overview of the research problem, a theoretical framework, a literature landscape review, and a description of the methods utilized during the study review process. The review discusses the findings from the thematic coding process and a synthesis of the literature, identifying which succession planning practices improve knowledge management and employee retention. Based on the thematic findings, this study’s recommendations include: (1) HEI Presidents and Boards of Trustees should incorporate succession planning into HEIs’ vision (2) HEIs should implement a robust Human Resource Management (HRM) process to integrate succession planning into their practices, and (3) HEI succession planning and organizational culture must be aligned for succession planning to be effective.

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple nodes to perform local computations and collaborate to complete machine learning tasks without centralizing private data of nodes. However, the frequent model gradients upload/download operations required by the framework result in high communication costs, which have become the main bottleneck for federated learning as deep models scale up, hindering its performance. In this paper, we propose a two-layer accumulated quantized compression algorithm (TLAQC) that effectively reduces the communication cost of federated learning. TLAQC achieves this by reducing both the cost of individual communication and the number of global communication rounds. TLAQC introduces a revised quantization method called RQSGD, which employs zero-value correction to mitigate ineffective quantization phenomena and minimize average quantization errors. Additionally, TLAQC reduces the frequency of gradient information uploads through an adaptive threshold and parameter self-inspection mechanism, further reducing communication costs. It also accumulates quantization errors and retained weight deltas to compensate for gradient knowledge loss. Through quantization correction and two-layer accumulation, TLAQC significantly reduces precision loss caused by communication compression. Experimental results demonstrate that RQSGD achieves an incidence of ineffective quantization as low as 0.003% and reduces the average quantization error to 1.6 ×  10 - 5 . Compared to full-precision FedAVG, TLAQC compresses uploaded traffic to only 6.73% while increasing accuracy by 1.25%.

Abstract: Introduction Doctors have a legal requirement and duty of care to ensure patients are enabled to make an informed decision about their treatment, including discussion of the benefits, risks and alternatives to a procedure. A patient-centred approach to consent has been firmly established in Ireland, and fundamental to this is the ability to engage in a dialogue that offers comprehensible information to patients. Telemedicine has revolutionised the way we can deliver care to patients in the modern era of computers, tablets, and smartphones, and its use has been rapidly expanded. Novel digital strategies to improve the informed consent process for surgical procedures have been increasingly under investigation over the last 10–15 years and may offer a low cost, accessible and tailored solution to consent for surgical interventions. Within vascular surgery, superficial venous interventions have been associated with a high number medicolegal claims and also represents an area within the specialty with rapidly evolving technology and techniques. The ability to communicate comprehensible information to patients has never been greater. Thus, the author’s aim is to explore whether it is feasible and acceptable to deliver a digital health education intervention to patients undergoing endovenous thermal ablation (EVTA) to supplement the consent process. Methods This is a prospective, single centre, randomised controlled, feasibility trial recruiting patients with chronic venous disease deemed suitable to undergo EVTA. Patients will be randomised to receive either standard consent (SC) or a newly developed digital health education tool (dHET). The primary outcome is feasibility; assessing the recruitment and retention rate of participants and assessing acceptability of the intervention. Secondary outcomes include knowledge retention, anxiety and satisfaction. This feasibility trial is designed to recruit 40 patients, which will allow for a moderate dropout rate. This pilot study will inform the authors of the appropriateness of an adequately powered multicentre trial. Discussion To examine the role of a digital consent solution for EVTA. This may improve and standardise the consent dialogue with patients and may have the potential to reduce claims related to poor consent processes and disclosure of risks. Ethical committee reference Ethical approval has been sought and received from both the Bon Secours Hospital and RCSI (202109017), on 14 May 2021 and 10 October 2021, respectively.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/intellectual-optimization-k-anonymity-model/docview/2832826528/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Concerns of security as well as privacy are the chief obstacles which have prevented the public cloud’s extensive adoption in Intel IT as well as across the industry. Generally, IT organizations are quite reluctant to store sensitive as well as valuable data in infrastructures which are out of their control. The technique of anonymization is employed by enterprises to raise the security of the public cloud’s data whilst facilitating the data’s analysis as well as application. The procedure of data anonymization will modify how the data is either employed or published in such a way that it will prevent the key information’s identification. The privacy issues are addressed using k-anonymity. However, the issue of selecting the variables for anonymization and suppression of variables without the loss of knowledge is an optimization problem. To address the selection of variables for anonymization and suppression, metaheuristic algorithms are used. Diverse research groups have successfully utilized the River Formation Dynamics (RFD) metaheuristic to handle numerous problems of discrete combinatorial optimization. Even so, this metaheuristic has never been adapted for use in domains of continuous optimization. To mitigate the local minima problem, hybridization of the algorithms is proposed. In this work, a modified K-Anonymity technique’s proposal has been given by using the Modified Hill Climbing (MHC) optimization, the RFD-MHC optimization, the RFD-PSO optimization, the RFD-MHC suppression as well as the RFD-PSO suppression. Furthermore, proposal for a suppression technique has also been given in this work. Experiments demonstrated that the RFD-PSO optimization has higher classification accuracy in the range of 6.73% to 8.55% when compared to manual K-anonymization. The work has also given better trade off for security analysis and data utility effectiveness.

Abstract: Purpose: This quality improvement project aimed to impact participants' knowledge, knowledge retention, and confidence levels about yoga as a complementary treatment option for adolescents with depression. Background: The American Psychiatric Association identifies depression as an episode of depressed mood or anhedonia lasting at least two weeks in which appetite, sleep, energy, and concentration can be affected, causing significant functional impairment. Calming yogic techniques' psychological and physical effects can promote self-discipline, sensory withdrawal, relaxation, and emotional regulation helpful for adolescents with depression. Methods: This quality improvement utilized a quantitative approach to measure knowledge and confidence levels using a pretest and posttest questionnaire followed by a posttest four weeks later to measure knowledge retention and confidence. The online surveys contained open-ended questions for providers to identify barriers to referrals and their perceived utility of the presentation. Results: A total of 15 participants between 18 and 45 years old were recruited from the monthly staff meeting and completed all three surveys. Pretests and posttests showed an overall improvement in knowledge following the educational session. Additionally, the subsequent posttest administered at the following monthly meeting showed no statistically significant change in knowledge compared to the initial posttest. Outcomes also show that the participants' confidence level in the benefits of yoga significantly increased after the informational PowerPoint presentation. Conclusions: Data analysis from the results of this QI project supports the implementation of education to improve their overall knowledge about the benefits of yoga for adolescents with depression.

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) mobile guide applications offer unprecedented potential for immersive visitor experiences and in-depth knowledge retention to promote cultural learning at large-scale heritage sites, but, despite their significant development, the literature underexplores these applications for World Heritage sites, especially the serial properties that are spatially dispersed in various locations but configured as a single property. This paper describes a framework (blueprint) for the development of an XR mobile guide application focused on serial properties. By incorporating interactive XR and edutainment features, it explores a way to comprehensively reveal the interconnections between the heritage attributes of the subcomponent of the serial properties and their larger, cross-cultural context vis-à-vis the Outstanding Universal Values. To this end, at the Seowon, the UNESCO World Heritage site in Korea, we analyzed user interactions with a prototype of the XR application to identify user preferences and areas for improving the framework.

Advancement of an Inhouse Aerospace Vehicle Design Synthesis System Through the Introduction of a Novel Database-Knowledgebase System and by Improving the Geometry and Aerothermodynamic Disciplinary Processes

Author: Atchison, Samuel

Publication info: Atchison, Samuel. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/advancement-inhouse-aerospace-vehicle-design/docview/2828633821/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Throughout the years of aerospace vehicle design, the process in which a vehicle is designed has drastically improved from being primarily developed through trial and error, to using sophisticated synthesis systems. While the trial-and-error process had its uses with providing the fundamental knowledge of how aircraft behave and can be designed, the increase in knowledge and technology allowed the possibility of more vehicle configurations to be explored without the need to build each one. This increase should have led to a revolution of vehicle designs, and while there have been some novel ones, it seems that the general design of aerospace vehicles has begun to stagnate. In short, as our knowledge of aerospace vehicle design has increased, the design freedom for new vehicles has decreased. One possible reason for this contradictory situation is that as the knowledge of a specific vehicle configuration grew, it reduced the need or the want to explore beyond it. Keeping the same configuration, or at least close to it, reduces the risk involved with its design, but other vehicle configurations that may potentially prove to be more beneficial are left unexplored. Another possible reason is that the full knowledge from each vehicle design is not completely passed down from generation to generation. While the knowledge of design has generally increased over the years, this issue with knowledge retention keeps designers from reaching their full potential by having to redesign past vehicles and configurations. These issues are especially prevalent for high-speed aerospace vehicles. The Aerospace Vehicle Design (AVD) Laboratory has been tackling these issues for many years, and their solution was the Aerospace Vehicle Design Synthesis (AVDS) system. This synthesis system provides a generic design methodology to open up the solution space topographies and allow more unconventional vehicle configurations to be explored. Each generation of AVD researchers has improved upon this system to increase its capabilities, and the research presented herein introduces the author’s contribution. First, to further help the knowledge retention issue, the Vehicle Configuration Compendium (VCC) is introduced. This compendium is a self-contained parametric library that combines a comprehensive database and knowledgebase of past-to-present aerospace vehicles to aid design engineers by making the past always available. The power of this system was shown within a NASA-funded study regarding hypersonic commercial transportation, with two of the vehicle verification studies out of seven provided herein. Lastly, to improve the capabilities of AVDS to increase the solution space topographies, improvements of the geometry and aerothermodynamic disciplinary processes were accomplished. For the geometry disciplinary process, a parametric 3D modeling software was used in conjunction with AVDS to generate models that could be used for method and synthesis verification, synthetic data, and to use more complex scaling methods to explore more possibilities within a solution space. For the aerothermodynamics disciplinary process, a method was developed to calculate the structural index parameter, a parameter that can be used during conceptual design to represent the structural and aerothermal effects that the vehicle may experience. This method was verified against historic data from when it was originally developed, and new maps were generated to visualize how the parameter is affected by temperature, cruise time, and TPS material. These improvements to AVDS with the VCC and the disciplinary methods, will assist future researchers in their quest of aerospace vehicle design.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new integrated framework for short-term time series forecasting used as decision logic support in Energy Management Systems (EMS). The proposed framework defines data preprocessing, forecast model training, and adaptation techniques. For data preprocessing, Gaussian and Kalman filtering were used in offline learning on historical data and online (real-time) forecasting. Optimal parametrisation for both filters was selected based on the forecast accuracy. Next, a multiple-input, single-output forecast model based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was tuned for each device. The forecast horizon is single-step, and chaining of predictions was used for longer horizons. Finally, the best model was adapted to the changes in the time series data. A significant drop was observed in the forecast accuracy on the past data after adapting the model to the new data using a naive approach. Due to this drop, a novel sample rehearsal selection strategy for adaptation of the model is proposed and compared to other different strategies. All the techniques are demonstrated based on the examples of forecasting multivariate time series for different household devices: a water heater, a refrigerator and an HVAC device. The use of data preprocessing improved the forecast accuracy by up to 56% compared to no preprocessing. Moreover, by introducing a sample rehearsal, knowledge retention was improved by up to 76.6% compared to the naive approach, and by up to 62% compared to the random selection of samples.

Exploring the Influence of Mobile AR Learning Environment Intervention on College Students’ Learning Outcomes and Learning Experience

Author: Wonaphotimuke, Anantaya

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) technology has gained increasing attention within educational spaces, such as museums and academic institutions due to advancements in computing power and technology. AR technology affords learning activities that would be impractical to implement in physical environments by allowing superimposed additional information on to the real world (Steffen et al., 2019). Recent works have shown that AR technology has a significant potential to engage learners, elicit situational interest, and increase learning performance among learners due to the novelty that the technology brings in. However, there are opportunities for research on the novelty and the use of AR technology for learning from a design perspective that can be add to the corpus of literature in Design. Thus, this dissertation studies the influence of a mobile AR learning environment intervention on college students’ learning outcomes and learning experience. This dissertation involves two stages: (1) prototype design and pilot study; and (2) intervention sessions. In the first stage, through various design methods (e.g., artifactcontent and task analyses, prototyping, and usability testing), the researcher developed a working prototype of a mobile AR learning environment. This environment consisted of ten learning experiences in total, and utilized different interactive strategies to present information that aligned with learning content in relation to the learning task for each concept. In the second stage, the data were collected during intervention sessions, where 57 undergraduate college students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: control (using traditional learning media: textbook) vs. AR intervention (using mobile AR learning environment along with traditional learning media). During intervention sessions, participants were asked to learn a theoretical concept via 15 pages of reading, either with or without the mobile AR learning environment. Video and screen recordings were administered during the learning activity. Both groups answered a pre-activity survey and a pre-test of comprehension prior to the learning activity. After completing the learning activity, both groups answered a post-test of comprehension, a post-activity survey based on an adapted Situational Interest (SI) survey and Augmented Reality Immersion (ARI) survey, and a retention test. Lastly, both groups participated in a semi-structured interview. Findings did not suggest any difference in comprehension between the two conditions. While participants in the control group had greater learning gains on average, comprehension results were not statistically significant. In terms of knowledge retention, while participants in the AR intervention group had greater retention scores on average, findings did not suggest any difference in retention score between the two conditions as retention results were not statistically significant. The interaction analysis suggested that participants in the control group exhibited more frequent note-taking behaviors than the AR intervention group, which might have resulted in overall better performance in the comprehension test. However, participants in the AR intervention spent significantly more time to complete the learning tasks, and they exhibited multitasking behaviors where there was a need to switch learning-related tasks between different learning materials and tools.Findings also suggested that the use of mobile AR learning environments can trigger situational interest, positive affective responses, and immersion in terms of attraction, time investment, focus and attention, more than traditional learning materials (textbook). Lastly, findings indicated that novelty, usability of technology and design of the mobile AR learning environment, interaction, motivating factors (e.g., goal), and comprehension are all contributing factors to the experiential aspect of the learning process.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 Joint International Conference on Digital Arts, Media and Technology with ECTI Northern Section Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering (ECTI DAMT & NCON) Conference Start Date: 2023, March 22 Conference End Date: 2023, March 25 Conference Location: Phuket, Thailand The increasing need for diverse living environments continues to be driven by rapid economic growth and a significant improvement of people's living standards. As one of the five pillars of an industrial economy, the construction industry has undergone more dynamic development than many other industries. However, construction companies still suffer from many problems, such as knowledge loss, inefficient collaboration, and low competitiveness. These challenges require organisations to systematically manage their knowledge and facilitate collaboration among stakeholders. Knowledge can be shared and developed by means of an effective knowledge transfer system and construction companies can enjoy high returns by collaborating in innovative construction projects, thereby enabling them to acquire a lasting competitive advantage. However, there appears to be a lack of research and analysis of the factors that affect the transfer of knowledge in collaborative and innovative construction projects. Therefore, the aim of this study is to define the related influential factors based on a systematic review of the literature (SRL). A search of the Scopus database from 2013 to 2022 yielded 162 articles, nine of which were selected to address the research problem. The analytical results of the SLR indicate that the key factors that affect the transfer of knowledge and collaboration in innovative architectural projects include the working environment, communication among project members, partners and social capital, talent training, team culture, and leadership, which are also the driving force for the development of these projects.

Abstract: Interpreting an electrocardiogram (ECG) is crucial for every physician. The physician's competency in ECG interpretation needs to be improved at any stage of medical education. The aim of the present study was to review the currently published clinical trials of ECG teaching to medical students and provide suggestions for future works. On May 1, 2022, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ERIC were searched to retrieve relevant articles on clinical trials of ECG teaching to medical students. The quality of the included studies was assessed utilizing the Buckley et al . criteria. The screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal processes were duplicated independently. In case of disagreements, consultation with a third author was put forth. In total, 861 citations were found in the databases. After screening abstracts and full texts, 23 studies were deemed eligible. The majority of the studies were of good quality. Peer teaching (7 studies), self-directed learning (6 studies), web-based learning (10 studies), and various assessment modalities (3 studies) comprised the key themes of the studies. Various methods of ECG teaching were encountered in the reviewed studies. Future studies in ECG training should focus on novel and creative teaching methods, the extent to which self-directed learning can be effective, the utility of peer teaching, and the implications of computer-assisted ECG interpretation (e.g., artificial intelligence) for medical students. Long-term knowledge retention assessment studies based on different approaches integrated with clinical outcomes could be beneficial in determining the most efficient modalities.Interpreting an electrocardiogram (ECG) is crucial for every physician.

Abstract: Purpose Virtual reality (VR) technologies have been gaining popularity in training and development in many fields to promote embodied training. However, its adoption in management has been slow and rigorous empirical research to understand its impact on learning and retention is scarce. Thus, this paper aims to examine the benefits of VR technologies for management training. Design/methodology/approach Through a longitudinal experiment comparing VR platforms and a traditional video platform, this study examines two as yet unexplored benefits of VR technologies vis-à-vis management training – the cognitive outcome and affective reaction of the training experience over time. Findings This study finds that, for cognitive outcomes, immediate gains are similar across video and VR platforms, but subsequent knowledge retention is significantly higher for VR platforms. In terms of affective reaction, VR platforms generate significantly more enjoyment, which carries over to two weeks later, and is partially associated with higher knowledge retention. Practical implications This study has implications for management and human resource trainers and system designers interested in integrating VR for training and development purposes. Originality/value This study makes a unique contribution by unpacking the long-term benefits of an embodied training system, as well as identify a possible link between cognitive outcomes and affective reaction.

Abstract: The first article in this issue, “Harnessing Virtual Reality for Management Training: A Longitudinal Study” by Haber, Xu, and Priya ((2023), forges a new frontier in management training methods. The study shows that immediate gains in cognitive outcomes are similar across video and VR platforms, but subsequent knowledge retention is significantly higher for VR platforms. [...]VR technologies can be used for management training to improve knowledge retention and generate more enjoyment in the training experience. [...]Inclusive Workplace Practices: Understanding Disability-Assistance Animal Stereotype-Bias Signals” by McPherson and Loafman (2023) explores a less-examined area of workplace inclusivity: disability-assistance animals.

Abstract: Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) Nevada applied the ECHO virtual hub-and-spoke telementoring model over nine 6-week cohorts (between November 2019 and November 2021) supporting community health workers (CHWs) who advise clients with diabetes or pre-diabetes. This study describes the program implementation, including evaluation data collection efforts. Didactic topics included 'Intro to Healthy Eating and Easy Wins' to 'Grocery Shopping, Cooking Tips, Reading Labels, Meal Plans' and 'Reducing Bias and Being a Good Role Model'. Spoke participants signed up to review cases. Seventy-three of the enrolled participants (n = 100) attended three or more of the six sessions. Spoke participants completed 42 case presentations. The average self-efficacy increased from 2.7 [standard deviation (SD): 1.1] before completing the program to 4.1 (SD: 0.8) after completing the program. Average knowledge scores increased from 71 (SD: 16) before completing the program to 83 (SD: 14) after completing the program. Five group interviews drew actionable feedback that was incorporated into the program. Key elements of the ECHO model were successfully incorporated to support educational goals of a cohort of CHWs in nutritional coaching. Our program evaluation data tracking system shows non-significant but encouraging results regarding self-efficacy improvement and knowledge retention.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/knowledge-loss-induced-organizational-member/docview/2821970462/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this two-part study is to systematically review, analyze and critically synthesize the current state of empirical research on knowledge loss induced by organizational member turnover (KLT). Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was conducted based on 91 empirical studies on KLT. Findings: Part I of the study contributes to the advancement of KLT scholarship by mapping key developments in empirical research on KLT (publication trends, methodological and theoretical foci, heterogeneity of geographical, industrial and organizational contexts); encapsulating KLT antecedents associated with both voluntary and involuntary turnover; and revealing a broad scope of KLT effects at organizational and unit level. Research limitations/implications: This study has limitations related to inclusion/exclusion criteria used for creating the review sample and the "Antecedents-Phenomenon-Outcomes" logic used to synthesize the findings. Originality/value: Part I of the study offers a systematic synthesis of KLT empirical research with respect to KLT antecedents, outcomes and factors affecting them.

Abstract: Computer-based learning applications and mobile technology have transformed many aspects of the educational experience over the last decade, producing software aimed at improving learning efficiency and streamlining the presentation of course materials. One such class of software, purpose-created to take advantage of spaced learning and spaced testing principles, are electronic flashcard applications. We provide a perspective on the novel use of the Quizlet flashcard application in a tertiary educational setting. To reduce cognitive load for international graduate dental students taking a pharmacology review course, we implemented Quizlet, which integrates both spaced learning and self-testing, to improve the student learning experience. This study assessed students' perceptions of the Quizlet flashcard system in a student cohort comprised of two consecutive years' classes (n = 51 students in total). Results indicated broad acceptance of Quizlet based on ease of use of the software and ease of study of the material. Our data provide insight into the use of this common software in a professional healthcare tertiary education setting and further demonstrate the successful application of electronic flashcards for a mixed international student cohort. Further research should include an assessment of the impact of flashcard on long-term knowledge retention in this setting.

HOW NEUROSCIENCE AND BRAIN-BASED LEARNING THEORY CAN ENHANCE SKILL DEVELOPMENT OF STUDENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION

Author: Riccardi, Mark11 Purdue Global University

Publication info: Riccardi, Mark. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/how-neuroscience-brain-based-learning-theory-can/docview/2816154654/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Simulations are highly effective learning tools based on the foundations of neuroscience, brain-based learning theory, and neuropedagogy. Simulations and gamifications result in greater student involvement and knowledge retention than conventional instruction. In 2018, a pilot program was launched in the Emergency and Disaster Management program at American Military University in which traditional readings, lectures, and text were replaced with simulations. Various student performance measures were analyzed and showed improvement over the traditional method of instruction, and it was concluded that these improvements were due to the nature of the simulations. The greater use of simulations in education will enhance the quality of instruction and develop students' cognitive skills.

Abstract: This study compares the knowledge of medicinal plants of Bissau-Guinean migrants now established in Italy with the ethnopharmacology still present in their country of origin. We also investigated how traditional ethnobotanical knowledge is changing following the phenomenon of migration from Africa to Europe. The ethnobotanical data were collected during 2017–2018, by interviewing 49 informants belonging to 8 ethnic groups, living in 8 provinces of northern Italy. The final inventory of botanical taxa included 81 species belonging to 34 families, with Fabaceae and Malvaceae the most represented, followed by Euphorbiaceae, Apocynaceae, Combretaceae, and Solanaceae. Plant remedies were used to treat 21 ailment categories, such as fever, internal infections, intestinal and respiratory problems, and pains. The traditional ethnobotanical knowledge of Bissau-Guinean migrants in Italy was associated with gender, with women showing the highest knowledge. In addition, a negative relationship was observed between the maintenance of this knowledge and the number of years migrants have spent in Italy. Overall, a loss of knowledge was observed in the less numerous ethnic groups. However, traditional preparations based on plants from the country of origin are in general well preserved to maintain a good state of health. Our work could help in transferring to the next generation the cultural heritage of Bissau-Guinean people permanently moved to European Countries.

Abstract: Registered nurses (RNs) working in today’s healthcare environment must consistently learn new knowledge and skills, keep abreast of practice changes, and implement strategies to improve patient outcomes. However, healthcare organizations face significant challenges as they attempt to facilitate efficient training. Nursing professional development practitioners miss opportunities to leverage learner motivation, which drives investment, knowledge retention, and practice application. Gamification, which strategically embeds game elements and mechanics into an educational design to boost motivation, offers a potential solution. It aims to increase learner engagement by presenting learners with challenges, tracking their progress, and offering feedback, ultimately leading to knowledge retention and application. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine whether gamification leads to increases in motivation to learn and knowledge levels for RNs. Specifically, the study focused on RNs who did not have previous cardiac monitoring experience. The study used flow theory and self-determination theory to optimally incorporate gamification. A quasi-experimental posttest-only design with a comparison group allowed for comparisons among RNs who completed a traditional ECG course with those who completed a gamified ECG course. The comparison group contained 66 eligible participants who completed the survey and the experimental group contained 64 participants. Post-course surveys were electronically distributed to registered nurses who completed either the traditional or the gamified version of the ECG course. Research instruments included a demographic survey, the Flow Perceptions Questionnaire (a self-reporting motivational survey), and an ECG knowledge test. Additionally, RNs who completed the gamified version were administered a short survey measuring the motivational effects of included game elements and mechanics. Two hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to identify differences between the comparison and experimental groups when controlling for age and current patient care environment. The first indicated the addition of the variable class type to the prediction of ECG test scores was statistically significant (Δ R 2 = .116, p <.001). Therefore, the experimental group scored statistically significantly higher than the comparison group. The second hierarchical multiple regression suggested the addition of the variable class type to the prediction of Flow Perceptions Questionnaire scores was not statistically significant (Δ R 2 = .006, p = .397). Thus, no significant differences were discovered between the two groups specific to learner motivation. In fact, the comparison group reported higher motivation levels than the experimental group. The proposed theoretical framework effectively guided the ECG course’s gamification design; however, since anticipated learner motivation scores were not achieved, minor adjustments might be warranted. Game mechanics and game elements, specifically selected for the gamified ECG course based on learner personas, were mostly rated as promoting higher motivation levels. Future research must be conducted to improve sample diversity, control, and motivation measurement, in addition to exploring qualitative data, longitudinal outcomes, and gamification’s various technological sophistication levels.

Abstract: This qualitative meta-synthesis sought to identify and uncover the challenges that Higher Education Institutions experience when implementing and maintaining a succession management program. Through a blended-theory approach, the theoretical framework combined Human Capital Theory (Schultz, 1961), Transformational Leadership Theory (Downton, 1973), and Organizational Knowledge Creation Theory (Nonaka, 1994) to understand the data analysis and results. The central research question guided the meta-synthesis, “How do existing succession planning strategies and knowledge retention practices support the administrative branch of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)?” Additionally, four sub-questions were developed to bolster the analysis. The selection of studies used in our meta-synthesis is purposefully chosen and rigorously evaluated through an article reduction analysis and further refined by two subject matter experts as raters in the final selection stage. Eleven studies were synthesized with 100% rater reliability, and a thorough analysis was conducted using NVivo 12, revealing four (4) thematic categories, including eight (8) subthemes and twenty-six (26) open codes. The findings show the barriers to implementing a succession management program and the core competencies required to create a successful succession management program.

Abstract: Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) is a newborn resuscitation training program designed to reduce neonatal mortality in low- and middle-income countries. However, skills decay after initial training is a significant barrier to sustained impact. BACKGROUND Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) is a newborn resuscitation training program designed to reduce neonatal mortality in low- and middle-income countries. However, skills decay after initial training is a significant barrier to sustained impact.To test whether a mobile app, HBB Prompt, developed with user-centred design, helps improve skills and knowledge retention after HBB training. OBJECTIVE To test whether a mobile app, HBB Prompt, developed with user-centred design, helps improve skills and knowledge retention after HBB training.HBB Prompt was created during Phase 1 of this study with input from HBB facilitators and providers from Southwestern Uganda recruited from a national HBB provider registry. During Phase 2, healthcare workers (HCWs) in two community hospitals received HBB training. One hospital was randomly assigned as the intervention hospital, where trained HCWs had access to HBB Prompt, and the other served as control without HBB Prompt (NCT03577054). Participants were evaluated using the HBB 2.0 knowledge check and Objective Structured Clinical Exam, version B (OSCE B) immediately before and after training, and 6 months post-training. The primary outcome was difference in OSCE B scores immediately after training and 6 months post-training. METHODS HBB Prompt was created during Phase 1 of this study with input from HBB facilitators and providers from Southwestern Uganda recruited from a national HBB provider registry. During Phase 2, healthcare workers (HCWs) in two community hospitals received HBB training. One hospital was randomly assigned as the intervention hospital, where trained HCWs had access to HBB Prompt, and the other served as control without HBB Prompt (NCT03577054). Participants were evaluated using the HBB 2.0 knowledge check and Objective Structured Clinical Exam, version B (OSCE B) immediately before and after training, and 6 months post-training. The primary outcome was difference in OSCE B scores immediately after training and 6 months post-training.Twenty-nine HCWs were trained in HBB (17 in intervention, 12 in control). At 6 months, 10 HCW were evaluated in intervention and 7 in control. In intervention and control respectively, the median OSCE B scores were: 7 vs. 9 immediately before training, 17 vs. 21 immediately after training, and 12 vs. 13 at 6 months after training. Six months after training, the median difference in OSCE B scores was -3 (IQR -5 to -1) in intervention and -8 (IQR -11 to -6) in control (p = 0.02). RESULTS Twenty-nine HCWs were trained in HBB (17 in intervention, 12 in control). At 6 months, 10 HCW were evaluated in intervention and 7 in control. In intervention and control respectively, the median OSCE B scores were: 7 vs. 9 immediately before training, 17 vs. 21 immediately after training, and 12 vs. 13 at 6 months after training. Six months after training, the median difference in OSCE B scores was -3 (IQR -5 to -1) in intervention and -8 (IQR -11 to -6) in control (p = 0.02).HBB Prompt, a mobile app created by user-centred design, improved retention of HBB skills at 6 months. However, skills decay remained high 6 months after training. Continued adaptation of HBB Prompt may further improve maintenance of HBB skills. CONCLUSION HBB Prompt, a mobile app created by user-centred design, improved retention of HBB skills at 6 months. However, skills decay remained high 6 months after training. Continued adaptation of HBB Prompt may further improve maintenance of HBB skills.

Abstract: Introduction: Pediatric residency programs often do not include a point of care ultrasound (POCUS) curriculum. We analyzed a novel POCUS curriculum for pediatric residents that incorporated an online question bank (QB), in addition to a traditional teaching model of didactic instruction and hands-on learning experience. Methods: Four high-yield POCUS topics were chosen: Focused Assessment by Sonography for Trauma (FAST), soft tissue, lung, and cardiac . Residents completed online multiple-choice quizzes before and after each of four in-person learning sessions, taught by ultrasound faculty and fellows. At the end of the academic year participants completed a knowledge retention quiz. Confidence surveys were administered to participants throughout the course of the study. Differences in means were compared by Student's t-test. Results: Learners demonstrated post-intervention score improvement for each of the four modules. Retention testing demonstrated retained improvement for the soft tissue and cardiac modules, but not for the FAST module. Self-reported confidence increased across all four topics. Conclusion: A multimodal POCUS curriculum utilizing a combination of an online QB and in-person teaching demonstrated lasting knowledge for pediatric trainees.Introduction: Pediatric residency programs often do not include a point of care ultrasound (POCUS) curriculum.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces Abstracts and Workshops (VRW) Conference Start Date: 2023, March 25 Conference End Date: 2023, March 29 Conference Location: Shanghai, China Virtual Reality (VR) is frequently used in various educational contexts since it could improve knowledge retention compared to traditional learning methods. However, distraction is an unavoidable problem in the educational VR environment due to stress, mind-wandering, unwanted noise/sounds, irrelevant stimuli, etc. We explored the combination of EEG and eye gaze data to detect student distractions in an educational VR environment. We designed an educational VR environment and trained three machine learning models (CNN-LSTM, Random Forest and SVM) to detect distracted students. Our preliminary study results show that Random Forest and CNN-LSTM provide better accuracy (98%) compared to SVM.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 11th International Conference on Information and Education Technology (ICIET) Conference Start Date: 2023, March 18 Conference End Date: 2023, March 20 Conference Location: Fujisawa, Japan Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and compulsory social distancing, researchers in educational fields started to investigate alternatives to face-to-face (F2F) training methods with greater focus, such as video conferencing (VC) and virtual reality (VR) applications. This study investigated the differences between VC, VR and F2F training conditions by evaluating the level of body ownership and agency perceived by trainees. An electrical circuit repair task and multiple surveys were used to gather data from 106 participants in the form of four dependent variables: a circuit knowledge test, task completion rate, number of the subtasks completed by failing participants, and test phase duration. The study included two visits by each participant to measure knowledge retention while there were no training and surveys in Visit 2. Results showed significantly higher circuit learning and knowledge retention scores in F2F and VR conditions than in VC. Also, regarding the retention of knowledge, participants had significantly better knowledge retention in Visit 1 than Visit 2. The authors hope the results of this study enable training developers to enhance the learning process in computer mediated communications.

The Impact of Braden Scale Education on Nurses’ Knowledge Regarding Its Use

Author: Leahy, Diep Hoang

Abstract: The Braden Scale is a widely used assessment tool to predict the pressure injury risks and prevent pressure injuries in patients. The nurses’ knowledge of how to use the Braden Scale is essential to facilitate the effectiveness of this tool and to properly reduce inconsistencies among nurses’ skin assessment and the Braden scores. The senior management team in a 260-bed hospital in California recently decided to implement a quality improvement (QI) project on the use of the Braden Scale. This QI project aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational course that focused on improving the registered nurses’ (RNs) knowledge regarding the use of the Braden Scale. The QI project’s design incorporated a series of pretest surveys, an intervention, and then immediate posttest and six weeks post-test surveys on a convenience sample. The RNs on the ICU and telemetry units at the project hospital were able to volunteer for the project. The project used a short educational session that lasted about 10 to 15 minutes and was delivered mostly to individual nurses during their morning breaks or lunch breaks. This QI project found that the individual nurse barriers to implement EBP changes may be modified and improved through educational training. In general, there were the most improvements in the scores between the pre-educational survey and the immediate post educational survey. There were also great improvements from the pre-educational survey to the six-weeks post educational survey. There were several limitations to this QI project including convenience sample, small sample size of 63 RNs, the short duration of the project leading to unknown long term knowledge retention, and the bias of immediate recall of information. The project’s educational technique provided a chance for the educator to customize the material to meet the learner’s needs and delivered a significant improvement for post educational survey scores. This educational technique is recommended for future nursing education that involves EBP changes.

Impact of a Spanish-Language Cardiovascular Health Education Session on Knowledge Retention in the Latinx Adult Community

Author: Santoyo-Cuellar, Felipe

Publication info: Santoyo-Cuellar, Felipe. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/impact-spanish-language-cardiovascular-health/docview/2808153242/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Heart disease remains a major cause of death worldwide, and is highly prevalent among Latinx populations, affecting 52.3% of adult men and 42.7% of adult women, in the United States due in part to healthcare disparities. To address this, it is important to study the effectiveness of heart disease education among Latinx adults to improve their understanding and application of knowledge. While printed materials are often used for patient education, they may not effectively meet the needs of all patient populations. This project aims to examine the impact of a Spanish-language cardiovascular disease education program on the adult Latinx community in Maricopa County, Arizona. The study will evaluate knowledge retention through pre- and post-education intervention tests and assess participant satisfaction through a survey. The project was presented to key stakeholders using the Rosswurm and Larrabee framework to ensure feasibility. The education session included three segments: cardiovascular disease information, interpretation of food labels, and how to modify traditional Latin cuisine in a heart healthy way. The pre- and post-test used the Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors Knowledge Level (CARRFKL) Scale with 28 true or false questions. The satisfaction survey consisted of five questions using a Likert scale. A paired samples t-test was used to compare knowledge percentage correct pre- to post-education intervention. Percentage correct among the participants that completed the pre and post-test (n = 26) increased significantly from 87.0% (SD = 7.7) correct pre to 97.9% (SD = 3.4) correct post, with statistical significance, p < .001. The satisfaction survey (n = 29) displayed overall favorable results with the education session materials and presentation. Providing culturally and linguistically tailored education sessions in patients' preferred languages can improve knowledge retention and promote understanding of health promotion in cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 IEEE World Engineering Education Conference (EDUNINE) Conference Start Date: 2023, March 12 Conference End Date: 2023, March 15 Conference Location: Bogota, Colombia There are learning barriers with traditional textbooks, students often do not read the textbook, the contents are outdated, or the cost is exorbitant. There is a need for modern knowledge sources to replace the traditional textbook to engage learners and develop deeper levels of cognition and knowledge retention. This paper introduces zyBooks in a beginning programming course. The course was previously designed to utilize the Python language with activities in an Integrated Development Environment (IDLE). The new design utilizes zyBooks focusing on initial programming concepts. In the design, students use Python to program a data analytics project in a Project-Based Learning (PBL) framework and zyBooks to learn basic programming skills through practical application. The utilization of zyBooks as a modernized source of knowledge resulted in increased achievement of student outcomes and increased student satisfaction with the learning methodology.

Design We prospectively surveyed a patient cohort using a paired analysis pre and post education with initial evaluation visit. Knowledge retention among waitlist patients was assessed with annual waitlist visit.One hundred four patients received paired surveys to assess the baseline knowledge and effectiveness of education. Forty-three patients received a single survey with their annual waitlist evaluation to assess knowledge retention. Paired survey showed mixed results, with no statistically significant improvement in the kidney donor profile index domain. Significant improvement was seen in the hepatitis C virus-positive donor domain and the Public Health Service (PHS) increased-risk donor domain. For the waitlist cohort, overall knowledge retention ranged from excellent to fair, with a decline in knowledge for the PHS increased-risk donor domain.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 20th Learning and Technology Conference (L&T) Conference Start Date: 2023, Jan. 26 Conference End Date: 2023, Jan. 26 Conference Location: Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Introduction: Diabetes therapeutic education assists patients in taking responsibility for self-management of their condition, and technology support systems promote this education. In this study, we introduce augmented reality (AR) as an instructional tool to supplement therapeutic education for diabetic patients. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate two educational approaches used within the clinic: Augmented reality (AR) and traditional educational methods. The objective is to determine which one has a better impact on nutrition knowledge improvement by using the Nutritional Diabetes Knowledge Survey (NKS) score. Method: A total of 65 children and adolescent patients with Type 1 Diabetes, aged 10-16 years old, currently receiving healthcare services at the KAMC-R nutrition diabetes clinic, were invited to choose type of education for Carbohydrate counting (AR or traditional education method) and complete a diabetes nutrition knowledge survey before the education and after. The difference between scores with a higher percentage change indicate better diabetes nutrition knowledge. Results: We discovered that the children who participated in the study had an average level of knowledge regarding nutrition (a mean of 8.98 out of a score of 23). This suggests that diabetic patients require therapeutic education. When the findings of the pre-knowledge questionnaire and the post-knowledge questionnaire were compared, it was discovered that the children learned more about carbohydrate dietary choices by watching AR videos with a p-value

Abstract: Conference Title: 2023 4th International Conference on Advancements in Computational Sciences (ICACS) Conference Start Date: 2023, Feb. 20 Conference End Date: 2023, Feb. 22 Conference Location: Lahore, Pakistan Software engineering, in general, and Global Software Engineering (GSE), in particular, face challenges such as handling communication and collaboration issues and inappropriate knowledge management. It is difficult to ensure availability of right knowledge at the right time to the right person during software engineering activity. The knowledge needs to be shared across the organization but limitations of knowledge sharing tools or dispersed knowledge sharing media and improper handling of tacit knowledge makes it more challenging to share knowledge. Significant amount of communication during software engineering process takes place via emails and discussion forums. Decisions taken during planning activities are also communicated through emails. These emails and the discussions do not necessarily cover the rationale behind a decision or approach adopted. This leaves a substantial portion of shared knowledge as tacit. Mostly, due to undefined tacit knowledge handling procedures, organizations suffer with the loss of critical knowledge and information. One way to handle this loss of knowledge is to store every information in knowledge repository but this can increase the size of the knowledge repository. This paper presents a three step approach to identify tacit knowledge in the written communication such that the organizations can save the tacit knowledge for future use. The presented approach does not only extract up to 57% of tacit knowledge but also indicates that only 20% of the whole communication need to be externalized hence saving 80% capacity of the knowledge repository, if every communication was to be preserved as potential tacit knowledge.

Abstract: In this paper, the researchers report an experimental study on conceptual knowledge learning and application through embodied interactions, expecting that bodily movements would facilitate learning in a positive manner. The intervention was enabled by Unity3D and Kinect V2, and taught novice adult learners the concepts of and conversions between binary and decimal numbers. Fifty-three adult participants were recruited, and randomly assigned into the experimental and control groups. During the intervention, participants in the experimental group manipulated and interacted with the learning materials through their body movements enabled by Kinect; while those in the control group learned the same content but interacted using conventional mouse and keyboard. Pre- and posttests results indicated that embodied interactions facilitated conceptual learning for the participating adult learners. However, compared with the mouse interaction, the embodied interactions did not lead to significantly better knowledge retention and application results. The study outcome implies that embodied interactions do not necessarily lead to better learning performances over traditional mouse-based interactions, and the 'how' and 'how much' may play critical roles for such interventions. Suggestions and challenges in designing learning systems utilizing embodied interactions enabled by novel technologies are provided.

The Effect of the Modality Principle to Support Learning with Virtual Reality: An Eye-Tracking and Electrodermal Activity Study

Author: Liberman, Liat; Dubovi, Ilana

Publication info: Liberman, Liat; Dubovi, Ilana. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/effect-modality-principle-support-learning-with/docview/2794821378/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Background: Virtual reality (VR) is considered a promising approach to support learning. An instructional design is essential to optimize cognitive processes. Studies show that VR has unique instructional and pedagogical requirements. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of the modality principle, which was previously validated in 2D classic multimedia, for learning with VR. The modality principle states that multimedia information presented as spoken narration is superior to on-screen text. Methods: A prospective experimental study with two compared conditions of instruction: VR-based learning guided by on-screen text (n = 34) versus spoken narration (n = 28). Students' cognitive learning experiences were captured by eye-tracking and electrodermal activity (EDA). In addition, students' knowledge was evaluated using a pre-post knowledge test. Results and Conclusions: Overall, there was no significant difference in knowledge retention between the participants who learned with on-screen text compared to spoken narration. However, results from the eye-tracking analysis showed that students who learned with the on-screen text devoted longer visual attention toward important learning activity areas of interest, suggesting a better ability to discern between relevant and irrelevant information. Conversely, students who learned with the spoken narration expressed significantly more EDA peak responses, proposing a higher cognitive load. Implications: This study outlines that while learning with VR was effective, the modality principle might not apply to learning with VR. Moreover, the analysis of the learning process suggests even an inverse effect, favouring the provision of instructional scaffolds as on-screen text. Future research should evaluate this effect on long-term knowledge retention.

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) is based on modeling students’ behavior sequences to obtain students’ knowledge state and predict students’ future performance. The KT task aims to model students’ knowledge state in real-time according to their historical learning behavior, so as to predict their future learning performance. Online education has become more critical in recent years due to the impact of COVID-19, and KT has also attracted much attention due to its importance in the education field. However, previous KT models generally have the following three problems. Firstly, students’ learning and forgetting behaviors affect their knowledge state, and past KT models have yet to exploit this fully. Secondly, the input of traditional KT models is mainly limited to students’ exercise sequence and answers. In the learning process, students’ answering performance can reflect their knowledge level. Finally, the context of students’ learning sequence also affects their judgment of the knowledge state. In this paper, we combined educational psychology theories to propose enhanced learning and forgetting behavior for contextual knowledge tracing (LFEKT). LFEKT enriches the features of exercises by introducing difficulty information and considers the influence of students’ answering behavior on the knowledge state. In order to model students’ learning and forgetting behavior, LFEKT integrates multiple influencing factors to build a knowledge acquisition module and a knowledge retention module. Furthermore, LFEKT introduces a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture the contextual relations of learned sequences. From the experimental results, it can be seen that LFEKT had better prediction performance than existing models on four public datasets, which indicates that LFEKT can better trace students’ knowledge state and has better prediction performance.

Beer & Blogs: Scientific Knowledge in American Craft Beer

Author: Ellis, Aaron David

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/beer-amp-blogs-scientific-knowledge-american/docview/2792180793/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: This dissertation investigates the ways in which knowledge is shared and tested within the online brewing community. The study is structured as a series of standalone chapters, similar to the blog posts common in the brewing community, which provide an in-depth examination of the various aspects of knowledge production and dissemination within this community. Chapter 2 presents the background and history of scientific brewing in the United States, exploring the factors that have contributed to its dominance as a form of brewing knowledge in the country. This includes a discussion of the impact of Prohibition and the role of one individual in the development of brewing education in the US. Chapter 3 focuses on the methods used by brewers to create new knowledge, with a particular emphasis on the process of reverse-engineering beer styles. This chapter draws on the researcher's own experiences with this method, as well as the feedback and support provided by the online brewing community throughout the process. Chapter 4 examines the large community of knowledge producers and knowledge bases where knowledge is shared, stored, and presented online. By studying the top ten most popular brewing education blogs, the chapter identifies shared characteristics of these blogs and the relationship between a more scientific layout and blog popularity. Chapter 5 delves into the peer review process within the brewing community, and the emotional responses to different types of knowledge (disputed, undisputed, and new). This chapter seeks to understand how brewers handle the rapidly changing landscape of small-scale brewing knowledge. The dissertation concludes with a reflection on the power of the scientific method and knowledge-producing communities within the brewing community. I compare the online brewing community to other online craft groups. Through these comparisons, I discuss how internet-based knowledge communities can resist prohibitions and thrive after communal knowledge loss. The study also examines the ways in which these online models support a form of knowledge revival within the craft brewery community.

Abstract: Though virtual reality has repeatedly seen usability improvements through higher fidelity headsets, interacting with small objects has remained an issue due to a reduction in visual acuity. Given the current uptake of virtual reality platforms and the range of real world applications that they may be used for, it is worth considering how such interactions can be accounted for. We propose three techniques for improving the usability of small objects in virtual environments: i) expanding them in place, ii) showing a zoomed-in twin above the original object, and iii) showing a large readout of the object's current state. We conducted a study comparing each technique's usability, induced presence, and effect on short-term knowledge retention in a VR training scenario that simulated the common geoscience exercise of measuring strike and dip. Participant feedback highlighted the need for this research, however simply scaling the area of interest may not be enough to improve the usability of information-bearing objects, while displaying this information in large text format can make tasks faster to complete at the cost of reducing the user's ability to transfer knowledge they've learned to the real world. We discuss these results and their implications for the design of future virtual reality experiences.

Abstract: Project Purpose This project aimed to develop and implement newborn screening (NBS) education for expectant parents/caregivers and evaluate the workflow and outcomes of the education provided during prenatal visits at a large obstetrical/gynecological practice in New Jersey. Methodology Purposive sampling was used to recruit expectant patients/parents at 31-33 and 35-37 weeks of pregnancy for this quality improvement project. More specifically, a NBS educational video was administered to patients between 31-33 weeks of pregnancy, and an educational assessment during a 35-37-week prenatal care visit was administered to evaluate NBS education knowledge gained and retained after viewing the video. A comparison group included completion of the same post-educational questionnaire provided to patients during their 35-37-week visit who had not viewed the video. Results A total of nine participants completed the assessment questionnaire. One participant received education and subsequently completed the questionnaire, and all answers were correct. This participant and one other who did not receive education were the only individuals who answered all items correctly. Twelve participants watched the educational video but were not assessed later for knowledge retention. Implications for Practice The addition of a mandatory NBS education prompt in the electronic medical record, required continuing education for obstetrical providers during license renewal, and providing more specific guidelines from professional organizations may close educational gaps. To improve project site sustainability, NBS education should be provided by distributing a pamphlet and video QR code during the diabetes screen visit.Keywords: Education, Prenatal; Care, Prenatal; Newborn Screening

Abstract: Aalborg Universitet begyndte at lege med planerne om at lave en digitaliseret indleve-ringsproces for universitetets ph.d.-afhandlin-ger i 2012. Universitetet havde i flere år oplevet et tab af viden, fordi der ikke var en central opsamling af afhandlinger fra universitetets ph.d.-studerende, og dette medførte, at når de ph.d.-studerende søgte videre i deres karriere, gik vigtig viden tabt. Alternate abstract: Aalborg University started playing with the plans to create a digitized submission process for the university's PhD theses in 2012. For several years, the university had experienced a loss of knowledge because there was no central collection of theses from the university's PhD students, and this meant that when the PhD students moved on in their careers, important knowledge was lost.

Abstract: Background: The anatomy curriculum has undergone considerable reductions in class time, resulting in decreased student anatomical knowledge retention and confidence during their surgical rotations. To counter this deficit in anatomy knowledge, a clinical anatomy mentorship program (CAMP) was developed by fourth-year medical student leaders and staff mentors in a near-peer teaching fashion prior to the surgical clerkship. This study analyzed the impact this program had on third-year medical students (MS3s) self-assessed anatomical knowledge and confidence in the operating room on the Breast Surgical Oncology rotation after this near-peer program. Methods: A single-center prospective survey study was performed at an academic medical center. Pre- and post-program surveys were administered to all students who participated in the CAMP and rotated on the breast surgical oncology (BSO) service during the surgery clerkship rotation. A control group of individuals who did not rotate on the CAMP was established, and this group was administered a retrospective survey. A 5-point Likert scale was used to assess surgical anatomy knowledge, confidence in the operating room, and comfort in assisting in the operating room. Control group versus post-CAMP intervention group and pre- versus post-CAMP intervention groups survey results were compared using the Student’s t-test with a p -value of <0.05 statistically significant. Results: All CAMP students rated their surgical anatomy knowledge ( p < 0.01), confidence in the operating room ( p < 0.01), and comfort in assisting in the operating room ( p < 0.01) as greater than those who did not participate in the program. Additionally, the program improved the ability of third-year medical students to prepare for operating room cases going into their third-year breast surgical oncology clerkship ( p < 0.03). Conclusions: This near-peer surgical education model appears to be an effective way to prepare third-year medical students for the breast surgical oncology rotation during the surgery clerkship by improving anatomic knowledge and student confidence. The program can serve as a template for medical students, surgical clerkship directors, and other faculty interested in efficiently expanding surgical anatomy at their institution.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of different immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) technological approaches in teaching and learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Specifically, this paper explores the passive iVR and interactive iVR in a real authentic learning context as didactic possibilities compared to the conventional method of listening, consisting of audio-only listening exercises. The study was conducted using university students of B1 level EFL classes. The dependent variables considered in the study were Knowledge Retention, Presence, User Satisfaction, Cybersickness, and Preferred Technology. Results indicated that users showed significant satisfaction and preference for using this technology for learning, revealing enjoyment and motivation which are vital factors when learning a foreign language. However, no significant differences were found between learning via traditional listening exercises or the virtual system. Correlation tests were conducted between the questionnaire subscales to understand better which elements can influence learning. The study concludes that using iVR-based learning tools to learn a foreign language as an alternative to audio listening can only produce a broader positive impact and greater motivation. The results also suggest that iVR can be a valuable tool in the education field for knowledge transfer and motivation when learning foreign languages.

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence in recent years has promoted the use of chatbot technology in sustainable education. Many studies examined the effect of chatbots on learning outcomes. However, scant studies summarized the effectiveness of chatbots in education. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of chatbot-assisted learning on various components and how different moderator variables influenced the effectiveness. This study, through a meta-analysis, reviewed 32 empirical studies with 2201 participants published between 2010 and 2022. The results showed that chatbot technology exerted a medium-to-high effect on overall learning outcomes regardless of moderator variables, i.e., intervention duration, chatbot roles, and learning content. In terms of learning components, chatbots could significantly improve explicit reasoning, learning achievement, knowledge retention, and learning interest despite negative findings in critical thinking, learning engagement, and motivation. Future research could expand chatbot research by including different learning components.

Abstract: A lack in patient knowledge of warfarin therapy is associated with poor adherence. This knowledge gap may result in a lower INR Time in Therapeutic Range (TTR). To investigate association between patient anticoagulation knowledge and warfarin control. Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative (MAQI 2 ) is a Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan sponsored consortium of six anticoagulation management services. Patients prescribed warfarin at two MAQI 2 sites completed a voluntary Oral Anticoagulation Knowledge (OAK) questionnaire at warfarin initiation and 6-month follow-up. The results of 20 OAK questions and TTRs (excluding 1st month post-initiation) were compared using chi-square tests, t-tests and multivariate analysis adjusting for SAMe-TT 2 R 2 and days on warfarin. Of 1836 surveys distributed at warfarin initiation, 481 (26.2%) patients completed the baseline questionnaire (within 1 month post-initiation): mean OAK score: 14.6 ± 3.4. Of those, 147 (30.6%) completed 6-month follow-up surveys (OAK: 12.7 ± 5.8). Patients with TTR ≥ 70% at baseline scored higher on OAK tests than patients with TTR < 70% in unadjusted analyses (15.1 ± 3.2 v. 14.2 ± 3.5, p = 0.003) and adjusted analysis (p = 0.020). There was no unadjusted or adjusted difference in OAK scores at 6-month follow-up between patients with TTR ≥ 70% and TTR < 70%. For patients who completed baseline and follow-up surveys, there was a decrease of 2.4 points in OAK score between baseline and 6-month follow up (p < 0.001). Higher baseline, but not follow-up, OAK score is associated with better warfarin control and average OAK scores decreased between baseline and follow-up. Further studies are needed to determine what type of patient education may improve patient knowledge retention and warfarin control.

Abstract: Computer-based learning applications and mobile technology have transformed many aspects of the educational experience over the last decade, producing software aimed at improving learning efficiency and streamlining the presentation of course materials. One such class of software, purpose-created to take advantage of spaced learning and spaced testing principles, are electronic flashcard applications. We provide a perspective on the novel use of the Quizlet flashcard application in a tertiary educational setting. To reduce cognitive load for international graduate dental students taking a pharmacology review course, we implemented Quizlet, which integrates both spaced learning and self-testing, to improve the student learning experience. This study assessed students' perceptions of the Quizlet flashcard system in a student cohort comprised of two consecutive years' classes (n = 51 students in total). Results indicated broad acceptance of Quizlet based on ease of use of the software and ease of study of the material. Our data provide insight into the use of this common software in a professional healthcare tertiary education setting and further demonstrate the successful application of electronic flashcards for a mixed international student cohort. Further research should include an assessment of the impact of flashcard on long-term knowledge retention in this setting.Computer-based learning applications and mobile technology have transformed many aspects of the educational experience over the last decade, producing software aimed at improving learning efficiency and streamlining the presentation of course materials.
