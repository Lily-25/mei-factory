INTRODUCTION Cardiopulmonary auscultation is an important skill for medical professionals with deficiencies being well documented with broad implications on healthcare. Providing ideal bedside auscultatory teaching presents many difficulties. Simulation has been used as a means to improve cardiac auscultatory training and circumvent some of these limitations.We studied the use of Harvey © simulation in teaching cardiac murmurs and whether there was improvement in short term knowledge, as well as testing long term knowledge retention, as measured through a standardized test. From 2014-2019, 124 medical students in their 2 nd and 3 rd year of school (during the clinical portion of medical school curriculum) rotating through an Internal Medicine rotation completed a 2 hour training course on cardiac auscultation using Harvey © to identify six common cardiac murmurs. The session contained a pretest, didactic session, and posttest. METHODS We studied the use of Harvey © simulation in teaching cardiac murmurs and whether there was improvement in short term knowledge, as well as testing long term knowledge retention, as measured through a standardized test. From 2014-2019, 124 medical students in their 2 nd and 3 rd year of school (during the clinical portion of medical school curriculum) rotating through an Internal Medicine rotation completed a 2 hour training course on cardiac auscultation using Harvey © to identify six common cardiac murmurs. The session contained a pretest, didactic session, and posttest.124 students participated in the auscultatory training session. Of them, 42 (34%) underwent the session a second time at an average of 1.29 months from their first session. There was statistically significant improvement between tests. Notably, the most often missed murmurs were mitral stenosis and benign (innocent) flow murmur. RESULTS 124 students participated in the auscultatory training session. Of them, 42 (34%) underwent the session a second time at an average of 1.29 months from their first session. There was statistically significant improvement between tests. Notably, the most often missed murmurs were mitral stenosis and benign (innocent) flow murmur.As shown in our study, simulation based cardiac auscultatory education is feasible and likely beneficial in medical education as it can be delivered to a large group of trainees and overcomes the challenges of bedside teaching.

    "Abstract": "Since a blended learning continuing education course may appeal to busy healthcare professionals because the primary content can be learned online while an in-person component can hone clinical skills, the current study assessed knowledge retention in a sample of healthcare professionals who participated in a nationwide sexual assault forensic examiner blended learning course (12-week online course and 2-day in-person patient simulation). Participants' characteristics, motivation, and external barriers were collected through a pre-course web-based survey. Participants' knowledge was assessed through pretests and posttests for 12 modules and a 3-month post-course examination. Using repeated measures analysis of variance, the study examined whether participants retained their knowledge at the 3-month follow-up point. Multiple linear regression was used to explore the factors associated with knowledge retention. The findings indicate a modest knowledge loss 3 months after the blended learning course. Still, some participants experienced less knowledge retention than others. Post-course activities, such as a brief refresher course, may be useful to help participants maintain their knowledge gains.

Multiple linear regression was used to explore the factors associated with knowledge retention. The results found a knowledge score from 77.92 percent to 68.83 percent correct. The findings indicate that participants who were interested in the blended learning course because of the 2-day patient simulation were more likely to retain knowledge. Learners with more years of experience also had slightly higher knowledge retention. Conversely, participants who were interested in becoming a sexual assault forensic examiner because of a sexual assault experience had lower knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "This experimental study examined the design and effectiveness of embodied interactions for learning. The researchers designed a digital learning environment integrating body joint mapping sensors to teach novice learners Chinese characters, and examined whether the embodied interaction would lead to greater knowledge acquisition in language learning compared to the conventional mouse-based interaction. Fifty-three adult learners were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The study adopted a pretest, an immediate posttest, and a delayed posttest on knowledge acquisition. Although higher scores were found for the embodied interaction group in both posttests, only the delayed posttest showed a statistically significant group difference. The findings suggested that active embodied actions lead to better knowledge retention compared with the passive visual embodiment. The body-moving process works as an alternative and complementary encoding strategy for character understanding and memorization by associating the semantic meaning of a character with the construction of a body posture.",

    "Abstract": "Automatic assessment and evaluation of team performance during collaborative tasks is key to the research on learning analytics and computer-supported cooperative work. There is growing interest in the use of gaze-oriented cues for evaluating the collaboration and cooperativeness of teams. However, collecting gaze data using eye-trackers is not always feasible due to time and cost constraints. In this paper, we introduce an automated team assessment tool based on gaze points and joint visual attention (JVA) information drawn from computer vision solutions. We evaluated team collaborations in an undergraduate anatomy learning activity (N = 60, 30 teams) as a test user study. The results indicate that higher JVA was positively associated with student learning outcomes (r[subscript (30)] = 0.50, p < 0.005). Moreover, teams who participated in two experimental groups and used interactive 3D anatomy models, had higher JVA (F[subscript (1,28)] = 6.65, p < 0.05) and better knowledge retention (F[subscript (1,28)] = 7.56, p < 0.05) than those in the control group. Also, no significant difference was observed based on JVA for different gender compositions of teams. The findings from this work have implications in learning sciences and collaborative computing by providing a novel joint attention-based measure to objectively evaluate team collaboration dynamics.",

    "Abstract": "Mobile devices have penetrated all spheres of human activities, including education. Previous research has shown that smartphones are becoming widely used in learning as they can improve knowledge retention and increase student engagement. The purpose of this study was to discuss students’ perception of the use of a mobile application aimed at learning new English vocabulary and phrases and describe its strengths and weaknesses as perceived by the students. In total, 28 university students answered a pen and paper questionnaire survey after experiencing the app during one semester. Overall, the students’ agreement to the positive aspects displayed in the questionnaire prevailed over their disagreement or neutral opinions. The mobile app helped students prepare for the final achievement test, learning was accessible from anywhere and at any time, students appreciated the corrective feedback and would opt for the implementation of the mobile app in other courses taught at the faculty. On the other hand, as the findings indicate, the students reported that the app was not very supportive regarding communication performance; they did not find the teachers’ notifications encouraging and they did not use the pronunciation support much, which was caused by various factors, such as offering students words and phrases without context or not testing all the items in the final credit test. The findings of this study contribute to the existing knowledge of students’ perceptions of the use of mobile apps for learning purposes.",

The study points to center on the development of the workers through supporting the competitive edge. This could be done by legitimate utilize of past information and encounter which is procured and shared among the individuals of an organization. Leaders also play an imperative part within the Knowledge Sharing and Retaining but Transformational Leaders does not make an energetic environment through which they can offer assistance to form sound learning handle. It is since Transformational Leaders frequently don’t know almost the conduct and states of mind of the representatives, their needs and wishes. This study is quantitative and close-ended questions were utilized to expound the relationship of the factors. Information was collected from a test estimate of 200 respondents of the telecommunication sector. The regression technique was used to test the hypothesis relationship. The findings of this study show that Knowledge Sharing, Knowledge Retention has a significant positive relation with Employee Development and Sustainable Competitive Advantage mediates significantly between them. While, Transformational Leadership does not significantly moderate the relation between Knowledge Sharing, Knowledge Retention, and Sustainable Competitive Advantage. Further, it describes limitations and the direction for the future.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Simulation education can benefit healthcare providers (HCPs) by providing opportunities to practice complex neonatal-resuscitation tasks in low-stake environments. To our knowledge, no study investigated the role of growth mindset on longitudinal performance on neonatal resuscitation before and after simulation-based training. Objectives: This study examines whether 1) the RETAIN digital/table-top simulators facilitate HCPs' neonatal resuscitation knowledge gain, retention, and transfer and 2) growth mindset moderates HCPs' longitudinal performance in neonatal resuscitation. Methods: Participants were n = 50 HCPs in a tertiary perinatal center in Edmonton, Canada. This longitudinal study was conducted in three stages including 1) a pretest and a mindset survey, immediately followed by a posttest using the RETAIN digital simulator from April to August 2019; 2) a 2-month delayed posttest using the same RETAIN neonatal resuscitation digital simulator from June to October 2019; and 3) a 5-month delayed posttest using the low-fidelity table-top neonatal resuscitation digital simulator from September 2019 to January 2020. Three General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) repeated-measure analyses investigated HCPs' performance on neonatal resuscitation over time and the moderating effect of growth mindset on the association between test time points and task performance. Results: Compared with their pretest performance, HCPs effectively improved their neonatal resuscitation knowledge after the RETAIN digital simulation-based training on the immediate posttest ( Est = 1.88, p < 0.05), retained their knowledge on the 2-month delayed posttest ( Est = 1.36, p < 0.05), and transferred their knowledge to the table-top simulator after 5 months ( Est = 2.01, p < 0.05). Although growth mindset did not moderate the performance gain from the pretest to the immediate posttest, it moderated the relationship between HCPs' pretest and long-term knowledge retention (i.e., the interaction effect of mindset and the 2-month posttest was significant: Est = 0.97, p < 0.05). The more they endorsed a growth mindset, the better the HCPs performed on the posttest, but only when they were tested after 2 months. Conclusions: Digital simulators for neonatal resuscitation training can effectively facilitate HCPs' knowledge gain, maintenance, and transfer. Besides, growth mindset shows a positive moderating effect on the longitudinal performance improvement in simulation-based training. Future research can be conducted to implement growth-mindset interventions promoting more effective delivery of technology-enhanced, simulation-based training and assessment.Background: Simulation education can benefit healthcare providers (HCPs) by providing opportunities to practice complex neonatal-resuscitation tasks in low-stake environments. To our knowledge, no study investigated the role of growth mindset on longitudinal performance on neonatal resuscitation before and after simulation-based training.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Blended learning is an emerging trend across many educational settings, adopting the purposeful integration of traditional face-to-face and online teaching to establishing an engaging learning experience for the students. Blended learning provides an ideal platform for the implementation of reusable learning objects (RLOs) as a pedagogical tool to support classroom instruction. Design/methodology/approach: This study had conducted a quasi-experiment followed by semi-structured interviews to determine if a blended learning approach using RLOs can enhance students' learning in an undergraduate engineering computer-aided design (CAD) module. This study involved learners studying engineering in two different academic years. Findings: Students from the first year were taught using traditional face-to-face teaching approach. The cohort of students from the subsequent year adopted a blended learning approach: face to face and access to a series of RLOs. The analysis revealed statistical evidence that the use of blended learning had a significant impact on the students' end of term exam grades in the CAD module in comparison to the students who undertook traditional face-to-face teaching approach. The qualitative findings highlighted the positive impact of RLOs on students' learning behaviour, engagement and knowledge retention. Originality/value: This study provided empirical evidence of the benefits of using RLOs as a blended learning tool in engineering domain. From a theoretical perspective, the findings highlighted the importance of good instructional design and sound theoretical underpinning of the pedagogical strategy. From a practical point of view, this study informed academics on how to improve learner's academic achievement using RLOs.",

    "Abstract": "Experiential learning is fundamental to agricultural education. Current literature indicates some methods of pedagogically implementing experiential learning are more effective than others. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of reflection type and abstraction order on content knowledge and content knowledge retention when teaching experientially. This research experiment was conducted with secondary school students enrolled in agriscience courses. The findings of this study indicated neither the method in which students reflected nor the order in which they received abstraction affected students' ability to attain content knowledge. However, when analyzing student content knowledge retention, a statistically significant interaction effect indicated reflection type and abstraction order were dependent upon one another. It is recommended those who are interested in knowledge retention outcomes should implement purposeful reflection-on-action techniques when delivering abstract conceptualization prior to an experience.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To safely care for their newborn patients, health-care professionals (HCP) must undergo frequent training to improve and maintain neonatal resuscitation knowledge and skills. However, the current approach to neonatal resuscitation simulation training is time and resource-intensive, and often inaccessible. Digital neonatal resuscitation simulation may present a convenient alternative for more frequent training. Method: Fifty neonatal HCPs participated in the study (44 female; 27 nurses, 3 nurse practitioners, 14 respiratory therapists, 6 doctors). This study was conducted at a tertiary perinatal center in Edmonton, Canada from April-August 2019, with 2-month (June-October 2019) and 5-month (September 2019-January 2020) follow-up. Neonatal HCPs were recruited by volunteer sampling to complete a demographic survey, pre-test (baseline knowledge), two digital simulation scenarios (intervention), and post-test (knowledge acquisition). Two months later, participants repeated the post-test (knowledge retention). Five months after the initial intervention, participants completed a post-test using a table-top simulation (knowledge transfer). Longitudinal analyses were used to compare participants' performance over time. Results: Overall the proportion of correct performance increased: 21/50 (42%) passed the pre-test, 39/50 (78%) the post-test, 30/43 (70%) the 2-month post-test, and 32/40 (80%) the 5-month post-test. GLMM and GEE analyses revealed that performance on all post-tests was significantly better than the performance on the pre-test. Therefore, training with the RETAIN digital simulation effectively improves, maintains, and transfers HCPs' neonatal resuscitation knowledge. Conclusions: Digital simulation improved, maintained, and helped transfer HCPs' neonatal resuscitation knowledge over time. Digital simulation presents a promising approach for frequent neonatal resuscitation training, particularly for distance-learning applications.Purpose: To safely care for their newborn patients, health-care professionals (HCP) must undergo frequent training to improve and maintain neonatal resuscitation knowledge and skills.

    "Abstract": "Financial Accounting is one of the specialised subjects in the Nigerian senior secondary school curriculum. It is no gain saying that without apposite comprehension of the subject, the goals of its inclusion in the curriculum might not be fully accomplished. Hence, the researchers are in quest of appropriate instructional strategies that entail students’ active participation and improve students’ learning outcomes (attitude and retention) through practice-oriented research. Consequently, this research determined the effectiveness of guided discovery instructional strategy, in relation to a conventional lecture, on learning outcomes of students in Financial Accounting concepts. This study adopted a nonrandomized pretest, posttest, control group quasiexperimental design with a 2 × 2 × 3 factorial design. 147 secondary school students in level 5 were selected from eight secondary schools in the northern part of a Southwestern state, Nigeria. The research instruments used were Teachers’ Instructional Guides on Guided Discovery, Students’ Attitude to Financial Accounting Questionnaire ( r  = 0.89) and a 30-item Financial Accounting Retention Test ( r  = 0.83). The analyzed data affirmed that the treatment improved students’ attitude ( F (1,134) = 344.935; p < 0.05 ; η 2  = 0.720) and retention ( F (1,134) = 385.431; p < 0.05 ; η 2  = 0.742) of accounting concepts. This study recommended that teachers should utilize the guided discovery strategy to develop attitudes and knowledge retention of learners in Financial Accounting.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The integration of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in preclerkship medical education is currently popular and based on the notion that POCUS may improve diagnostic and procedural skills in medical students. However, empirical evidence demonstrating that POCUS can enhance clinical skills in preclerkship students has been lacking. We sought to evaluate anatomical sonographic knowledge and ultrasound generation capabilities associated with the implementation of a 3-h echocardiography training camp led by 2 emergency physicians and using a flipped classroom design. Methods: Preclerkship students from the University of Ottawa (n = 32) were recruited to participate. A flipped classroom model was adopted, providing students with a 3-chaptered peer-designed, expert validated ultrasound manual before the workshop, to maximize scanning times (2 h of reading). A pretest Likert-type design was used to assess student perception of the ultrasound tool. Similarly, a pretest/post-test model was used to assess sonographic anatomical identification. In addition, a subsequent Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) test was done 3 weeks after the hands-on session, to evaluate image generation (4 cardiac views: parasternal long, parasternal short, subxiphoid, and apical 4 chambers), understanding of knobology and structural labeling. Results: For the sonographic anatomy, there was a statistically significant increase ( P  < .001) between pretest (average = 12.12) and post-test (average = 18.85). The OSCE, which also ascertained knowledge retention, found that 81% of students were able to generate all 4 cardiac views perfectly, 6% were able to obtain 3 views, 10% obtained 2 views and 3% successfully generated a single view. The most challenging scan to generate was the apical 4-chamber view. Conclusion: The positive outcomes stemming from this study reinforces the notion that formal curricular integration of POCUS at the preclerkship level has tangible benefits for medical students.",

Mitigation strategies to deal with turnover tend to disrupt and increase workloads for developers. In this work, we suggest that through code review recommendation we can distribute knowledge and mitigate turnover with minimal impact on the development process. We evaluate review recommenders in the context of ensuring expertise during review, Expertise, reducing the review workload of the core team, CoreWorkload, and reducing the Files at Risk to turnover, FaR. We find that prior work that assigns reviewers based on file ownership concentrates knowledge on a small group of core developers increasing risk of knowledge loss from turnover by up to 65%. We propose learning and retention aware review recommenders that when combined are effective at reducing the risk of turnover by −29% but they unacceptably reduce the overall expertise during reviews by −26%. We develop the Sofia recommender that suggests experts when none of the files under review are hoarded by developers, but distributes knowledge when files are at risk. In this way, we are able to simultaneously increase expertise during review with a $\\Delta$ Expertise of 6%, with a negligible impact on workload of $\\Delta$ CoreWorkload of 0.09%, and reduce the files at risk by $\\Delta$ FaR −28%. Sofia is integrated into GitHub pull requests allowing developers to select an appropriate expert or “learner” based on the context of the review. We release the Sofia bot as well as the code and data for replication purposes.",

BACKGROUND The basic role of teaching at any degree of training is to bring a rudimentary change within the student. To facilitate the method of information transmission, educators ought to apply acceptable teaching strategies that best suit specific objectives and outcomes. Identifying the best method through comparison of problem-based learning (PBL) and the lecture method; so as to improve students' overall academic performance appear to be important.The aim of the study was to undertake comparison between problem-based and lecture-based learning methodologies for immediate knowledge retention of nursing students at Dire Dawa University. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to undertake comparison between problem-based and lecture-based learning methodologies for immediate knowledge retention of nursing students at Dire Dawa University.Quantitative research method which used a pre-experimental two group pretest and post-test research design was employed to identify effective teaching methods for immediate knowledge retention on 38 nursing students from June 1 to June 15, 2019. The students were grouped randomly into problem-based learning and lecture methods. The pretest-posttest analysis was done after an intervention made: a two-hour lecture and four-hour problem-based learning accordingly. Content validity ratio and content validity index was conducted for authentication of instruments and Cronbach alpha was computed to verify its reliability. A paired t -test was conducted to identify mean score change, and p<0.05 was cut off value to determine if there is a significant mean change in the posttest.

    "Abstract": "Background: The basic role of teaching at any degree of training is to bring a rudimentary change within the student. To facilitate the method of information transmission, educators ought to apply acceptable teaching strategies that best suit specific objectives and outcomes. Identifying the best method through comparison of problem-based learning (PBL) and the lecture method; so as to improve students’ overall academic performance appear to be important. Objective: The aim of the study was to undertake comparison between problem-based and lecture-based learning methodologies for immediate knowledge retention of nursing students at Dire Dawa University. Methods: Quantitative research method which used a pre-experimental two group pretest and post-test research design was employed to identify effective teaching methods for immediate knowledge retention on 38 nursing students from June 1 to June 15, 2019. The students were grouped randomly into problem-based learning and lecture methods. The pretest-posttest analysis was done after an intervention made: a two-hour lecture and four-hour problem-based learning accordingly. Content validity ratio and content validity index was conducted for authentication of instruments and Cronbach alpha was computed to verify its reliability. A paired t -test was conducted to identify mean score change, and p< 0.05 was cut off value to determine if there is a significant mean change in the posttest. Result: Both methods showed significant knowledge score improvement (t=13.6, p< 0.001) for lecture-based method and (t=11.302, p< 0.001) for problem-based learning. But as compared to the lecture method, problem-based learning has little effect on students’ immediate knowledge retention, and 63.2% of the nursing students prefer the lecture method as the best teaching method. Conclusion: The lecture method is the best teaching method for immediate knowledge retention for nursing students; it is also the most preferred method of teaching method by the students.",

Participation in classroom discussions has been observed to improve student comprehension and performance. In our contemporary tertiary educational context, student participation is characterised in mainly two forms; in-class discussions and online forums. Both forms of participation generate voluminous amounts of knowledge. However, the present difficulty in capturing and analysing these forms of participation leads to loss of knowledge and insights, which otherwise could be very useful. This study aims to analyse ways to improve data capture as well as data analysis of discussions. In this paper, we take a survey-based approach to study the students’ perception of classroom discussions in terms of three components namely effective learning, technology support and grading. Based on the analysis of the survey results, we propose the design of a tool and the administrative requirements needed for in-class participation data capture and analysis. We present our results in the form of a framework for tool design and challenges to be addressed when using technology during class discussions.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2020 22nd Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality (SVR) Conference Start Date: 2020, Nov. 7 Conference End Date: 2020, Nov. 10 Conference Location: Porto de Galinhas, Brazil There are many uses for virtual reality (VR) in education, and there is a consensus about its contribution in the teaching and learning processes. However, the majority of the studies assess the effectiveness of an individual learning in VR, and there is a need to explore more on the effects of VR using different levels of immersion and collaboration. This paper presents an experiment to investigate knowledge transfer in a group-based learning game. We introduce a VR serious game to support teaching and learning processes in neuroanatomy health education. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 23 students to jointly assess learning, knowledge retention, and sense of presence. As a control condition, grouped students assembled a physical model of the human brain, while in the experimental condition, a virtual brain was assembled. In each group, one participant assembled the brain, while the others observed and verbally collaborated in a group-based learning strategy. Results shown high mean scores in the virtual condition. When comparing the knowledge test performance before and immediately after the experiment, we found significant difference only for the virtual condition. The same can be observed for retention. Because of the promising results achieved and motivated by the need of more engaging new tools for remote learning – fully used in quarantine conditions, such as the current one because of the Covid-19 pandemic – we conducted a pilot user study to evaluate the learning effect of a remote version of our collaborative VR game.",

    "Abstract": "Background Laboratory diagnostic testing service delivery and compliance with international standards for laboratory quality are directly influenced by laboratory workforce competency. Many hospital laboratories in constrained resource settings such as Cambodia struggle to cope with the training needs of laboratory professionals in an environment of competing healthcare development priorities. Resource-limited countries need an adaptable and effective approach to provide laboratory professionals with job-specific quality oversight training to ensure the accuracy, timeliness, and reliability of diagnostic services. Case presentation Here, we describe the results of an in-service training and mentoring program conducted with the Cambodia Ministry of Health at 12 tertiary-level hospital laboratories to drive improvements in laboratory quality management systems toward ISO 15189 accreditation, which demonstrated significant progress between baseline and outcome audits in a concurrent study. This case study describes the program, and evaluates how the four primary activities, including actionable gap assessments and planning, centralized and in situ training curriculum, in-person mentoring, and remote tele-mentoring via video communication technologies, contributed towards quality improvement in the participating laboratories. We evaluated participant responses to Likert scale and free response questions from program and training evaluation surveys, and we used thematic analysis to develop a model of best practices within the program’s four primary activities to inform future training approaches. Of these activities, participants agreed most highly that in-person visits and planning based on gap assessments contributed to their learning and ability to improve laboratory operations. Tele-mentoring was rated lowest by participants, who were critical of excessive group dialogue and distraction during web-conferencing; however, feedback suggests both in-person and remote mentoring contribute to continuing education, accountability to action, and peer collaboration and problem solving to improve workforce efforts toward improved quality management systems. Conclusions We recommend here a package of in-service training activities for laboratory quality management system improvement initiatives in resource constrained settings that includes needs-based curricula and personalized action plans for participants; interactive and on-site training workshops; and in-person mentoring, complemented with well managed and regular tele-mentoring that focuses on knowledge retention, accountability to goals, and collaborative problem solving. Our model presents an adaptable approach to human resource development for quality improvement in medical laboratories.",

    "Abstract": "Background The objective of the study described in this article was to examine whether, and to what extent, Australian public hospitals use knowledge terminology, i.e. a body of knowledge-related terms, on their websites. The paper also discusses the difference in the level of such communication between large and small hospitals, the factors affecting the use of the knowledge-related terms in the communication and the similarities/differences between the use of knowledge terms in Australian public hospitals and large/small companies in Australia. Methods 151 Australian public hospitals were included in the research sample: 51 large and 100 small hospitals. Using the method of content analysis, websites mentioning knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, knowledge implementation, and knowledge retention were identified, along with the number of these mentions. Descriptive statistics and chi square test of independence were used to provide answers to four research questions. Results Of the 151 hospitals included in the sample, 30 had no website and 62 (50 small and 12 large) had a single page website. The study found that there are differences between Australian public hospitals regarding the level of their knowledge communication on their websites, both between small and large hospitals and between the individual hospitals within the large and small hospital groups. Conclusions A well-known saying goes “For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of”. Effective communication of knowledge-related terminologies to both internal and external stakeholders, i.e. the parties who access the websites, is therefore an indication of a knowledge focus in the public hospitals. Large hospitals are generally more active in communicating knowledge terms, although there are some exceptions.

    "Abstract": "Spaced education (SE) is a learning strategy that can improve long-term knowledge retention. Inspired by the concept of SE, we conducted a mixed methods study of a smartphone application (app) as a platform of SE. Objectives were to: (phase 1 quantitative) estimate the extent to which weekly alerts on the app can stimulate medical residents to visit the app, (connection of phases) identify participants for a second qualitative phase, and (phase 2 qualitative) describe factors, from the resident perspective, which influence sustainable participation in SE, and describe strategies for improvement of the app. Methodology and methods: phase-1 design was pre-experimental, phase-2 design was qualitative descriptive (deductive-inductive thematic analysis). Results: We observed a stimulating effect of weekly alerts for the first two months of the one-year study. Per participant, alert visits varied from 0 to 34 (mean = 1.7, SD = 4.5) and total page visits varied from 1 to 442 (mean = 28.3, SD = 61.4). Barriers and facilitators to sustainable participation in SE fell into five dimensions: user-related factors, information content factors, mobile app design factors, alert system factors, and service factors. Four strategies for app improvement were described. In conclusion, we propose five dimensions pertaining to potential predictors of sustainable participation in SE to deliver clinical information.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Lack of accountability demands in university business administration may be as a result of less attention given to genuine learning approach in university education. This study was undertaken to assess the causal effects of task-based approach to learning risk management on effective business decision making and outcome appraisal of universities in Nigeria. Method: The study was a true experimental design study aimed at Knowledge and Learning Management (KALM) in universities for enforcing business accountability. The population included 250 undergraduate final year students of educational management in public universities in Cross River State, Nigeria for 2017/2018 session. The sample consisted of 120 subjects purposely selected. A researcher constructed instrument was validated and had a reliability coefficient of 0.88 obtained using cronbach's alpha method. Three research questions and one hypothesis guided the study. Data was analysed using mean, percentage and independent t-test analysis. Results: The results showed that task-based approach produced improvement in knowledge after learning risk management. Male and female students learned risk management in the same way for university business decision making and outcome evaluation. Discussion and conclusion: Based on the result above, task-based approach to learning risk management guaranteed development of knowledge and cognitive skills of university students in university business opportunities. The implication of this finding was that students' learning motivation and task sharing towards knowledge retention in university business outcome could not have been achieved unless something urgent was done to address the issue in a timely manner. Therefore, university management should be able to pay particular attention to genuine learning of task processes and task strategies in risk management. More so, university teachers should be aware of the benefits of integrating learning stages of pre-task, task cycle and post task in enhancing quality decision making choices in university business offers.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the long-term retention of anatomical knowledge from 180 students after various repetition activities. The retention of anatomical knowledge was assessed by multiple-choice tests at five different points in time: before and after a course in Functional Anatomy, before and after repetition activities that occurred 14 weeks after this course, and 28 weeks after this course to establish long-term retention. Students were divided into five groups: one without any repetition activity, one with a restricted repetition activity (the multiple-choice test), and three groups that were offered repetition activities (traditional lecture, e-learning module, and small group work in the dissection room). During all three repetition activities the same information was conveyed, and this content was not revisited in other courses for the duration of the study. The results showed that students who did not engage in a repetition activity scored significantly lower on the long-term retention test compared to all other groups (ANCOVA: P = 0.0001). Pair-wise comparison with estimated means showed that the other four groups, regardless of the type of repeating activity, did not differ in the amount of knowledge they retained during any of the five assessments (P = 0.008, P = 0.0001, P = 0.001, and P = 0.0001, respectively). This study suggests that the type of repetition activity has no effect on knowledge retention both immediately following the activity and in the long term. It is concluded that the repetition of anatomical knowledge in any form is beneficial for students and will likely improve student outcomes in a curriculum that builds on prior knowledge.",

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review approach was used to synthesize current theoretical and empirical studies on organizational forgetting. Findings: The review and synthesis of the literature revealed that the organizational forgetting literature is fragmented, with studies conducted across disparate fields and using different methodologies; two primary modes (i.e. accidental and purposeful) and three foci (i.e. knowledge depreciation, knowledge loss and unlearning) define current organizational forgetting literature; and the factors that influence organizational forgetting can be grouped into four clusters related to individuals, processes, tools and organizational context. Research limitations/implications: This literature review has limitations related to time span coverage and journal article accessibility. Originality/value: This paper offers an integrative view of organizational forgetting that proposes a holistic and multilevel research approach and systematic synthesis of organizational forgetting research.",

    "Abstract": "Liberal arts programs encompass a range of academic disciplines, and their effectiveness relies not only on what these disciplines are, but also on how they are integrated. The natural sciences are one important component of liberal arts programs that may be difficult to assimilate with the rest of the curriculum. In this paper, the topic of neglected tropical diseases is provided to illustrate an innovative approach to bridging transdisciplinary connections across and through disparate academic disciplines. This approach is supported by evidence from prior studies demonstrating the effectiveness of transdisciplinary teaching at promoting creativity, knowledge retention, and student motivation.",

    "Abstract": "The cyclic format of the undergraduate physics curriculum depends on students' ability to recall and utilize material covered in prior courses in order to reliably build on that knowledge in later courses. However, there is evidence to suggest that people often do not retain all, or even most, of what they learned previously. How much information is retained appears to be dependent on the individuals' approach to learning as well as the style of instruction. In particular, there is evidence to suggest that active engagement techniques in the classroom can improve students' retention of the material over time. Here, we report the findings of a longitudinal investigation of students' retention of conceptual understanding as measured by the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE) following a first-semester, calculus-based introductory physics course, which features significant active engagement in both lecture and recitation. By administering the FMCE at the end of a first-semester physics course and again at the beginning of the subsequent second-semester physics course, we examine students' knowledge retention over time periods ranging from 1 to 15 months. We find that the shift in students' FMCE scores between these two courses is positive but corresponds to a small effect size, indicating that students retained effectively all of their conceptual learning (as measured by the FMCE). This finding largely persists even as the length of the gap between the two courses increases. We also find that, when breaking out students' performance on individual questions, the majority of students maintain their score on individual questions. Averaged over all questions, roughly a fifth of the students switched their answers from right to wrong or wrong to right on any given item.",

    "Abstract": "Aim/Purpose: We aimed to investigate the circumstances under which Kahoot! (a Game-based Student Response System (GSRS)) increases junior and senior Information Science university students' learning and knowledge retention beyond that of traditional teaching methods. We also explored whether the positive learning impacts of Kahoot! vary as a function of student subject knowledge (i.e., junior vs senior students). Background: The effectiveness of game-based student response systems (GSRSs) as learning tools in the classroom remains unclear, given inconsistent findings across educational research. Kahoot! enhances secondary and tertiary students' attention and motivation during class, but its effectiveness on learning and retention of course knowledge may vary depending on situational and individual factors. In New Zealand universities, students spend three years studying towards a Bachelor's degree, majoring in subject(s) of their choice. By the end of their third year of study, students are eligible to graduate with a sound knowledge of their chosen major. Thus, first-year students (referred to as \"junior students\") and third-year students (\"senior students\") may differ in terms of their learning styles and their ability and willingness to integrate Kahoot! use into their course work and revision. It is hypothesised that differences in subject knowledge between junior versus senior students will influence the perceived effectiveness of Kahoot!. Methodology: Thirteen first-year (\"junior\") and fourteen third-year (\"senior\") Information Science students (total n = 27), who used Kahoot! in seven lectures (for 30 minutes per lecture) were interviewed about their perception of Kahoot!'s effectiveness. We conducted a mixed-methods case study of students' interview transcripts, demographic records and student scores, where thematic (content) analysis was used to analyse interview responses. Then, we quantified themes for a one-way ANCOVA, with student subject knowledge predicting Kahoot!'s effectiveness, when controlling for students' duration of tertiary study and study habits (i.e., hours dedicated to course work per week) as potential confounders. Contribution: This study addresses the conflict in existing literature around whether GSRSs improve student learning beyond traditional teaching methods. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows GSRSs (namely Kahoot!) use improves, or at least, supplements tertiary students' learning and knowledge retention of lecture content. This study also reveals how student characteristics (i.e., accumulated tertiary experience) and their subject knowledge influence the effectiveness of Kahoot! as a learning tool. Findings: Kahoot!'s use increased students' learning and knowledge retention, among other positive impacts (e.g., attention and engagement). However, the perceived learning impact of Kahoot! was greater for senior students. Senior students found Kahoot! more useful for learning new knowledge and revising previously acquired knowledge. On the other hand, while junior students also experienced positive learning impacts using Kahoot!, they reported concerns regarding limited and shallow content coverage, and the time-consuming and distracting nature of the platform. Recommendations for Practitioners: Educators should take care to ensure GSRSs are appropriately implemented to support rather than replace traditional teaching methods (e.g., \"chalk and talk\" style presentations, PowerPoint use). In addition, lecturers using GSRSs should clearly inform students about the examinable content and their expectations for performance in formal assessments. Recommendations for Researchers: The positive impact of Kahoot! use on students' learning and knowledge retention may be due to stronger interactions and engagement during class. Researchers should more closely explore how student-lecturer interactions and in-depth discussions following GSRS use influence learning. Thus, there is a need to reevaluate Malone's (1980) intrinsic motivation theory in relation to the \"interactive\" or \"enjoyability\" components experienced during Kahoot! use. Impact on Society: The positive impacts of Kahoot! use on student learning vary for junior and senior students. However, our findings indicate that both cohorts of students benefit from 15-minute Kahoot! sessions at the end of a lecture or course unit, allowing them to test their knowledge and revise* previously taught material. Kahoot! provides a comfortable platform that allows students to ask and answer questions without embarrassment. More experienced students can also evaluate their learning by creating their own Kahoot! quizzes and providing feedback to the lecturers. Overall, Kahoot! use could have a positive impact on teaching and learning globally. Future Research: Beyond the recommendation for researchers above, future research should explore how differences in lecturers' teaching styles and students' self-regulation of learning impact Kahoot!'s effectiveness as a learning tool.",

    "Abstract": "Background The feedback given to students plays an important role in their efficiency related to learning practical skills. In the present study, diverse feedback modalities have been investigated. Our hypothesis is that individualized and unsupervised video feedback can produce a similar learning experience as performing practical skills in an oral and maxillofacial surgery setting with conventional direct expert feedback (control group). Methods This prospective, randomized, controlled, and blinded study compared direct expert feedback (DEF), individualized video feedback (IVF) and unsupervised video feedback (UVF). The participants were fourth-year dental students from University Goethe in Frankfurt. The students were assigned to one of the three feedback methods ( n = 20 per group) using simple randomization. All participants watched an instruction video for an interdental (‘Ernst’) ligature and periphery venous catheterization. Next, the students were video recorded performing the tasks by themselves (pre-test). Following this, every student received feedback using one of the above-mentioned feedback modalities. The participants then performed the same task again while being video recorded (post-test) to measure the acquired competence. Six weeks later, the students participated in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) to evaluate their long-term knowledge retention. All examiners were blinded regarding the students’ instructional approach and their affiliation in terms of the learning group. Results For the interdental ligature, we found significant improvements in performance in each feedback modality group between the pre-test and post-test ( p < 0.001). UVF had the strongest effect on performance time. The comparison between each group in the post-test showed no significant differences between the three groups. Conclusion This study showed that IVF and UVF can be considered an alternative or adjunct to conventional methods (i.e. DEF) when learning procedural skills in oral and maxillofacial surgery. However, DEF showed to be the most effective method of feedback and therefore preferable in teaching.",

Previous researches have investigated the effects of VM in conceptual understanding in science inquiry learning. However, the utility of VM in collaborative inquiry learning remains unclear. Besides, as there is little research on the learning process, we still do not understand the cognitive experience of students when using VM for collaborative inquiry learning. To explore the impact of VM in collaborative inquiry learning on both the learning outcome and the learning process, this study was designed to compare the effects of physical manipulatives (PM) and VM from students' performance level and cognitive level in an authentic class. For performance level, we examined both the instant group learning results and individual long-term knowledge retention. For cognitive level, we investigated the cognitive load and task involvement of the students. In this study, we conducted a quasi-experiment and distributed the cognitive load scale. 53 primary students in two comparable classes participated in the study. The findings indicated that students using VM perform better both in instant group results and individual knowledge retention than the students interacting with PM. As for the cognitive level, students using VM also reported a higher level of task involvement.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the relations among knowledge sharing (KS), intellectual capital (IC), absorptive capacity (AC), innovation (IN) and organizational performance (OP). Design/methodology/approach This paper empirically tests a model that uses structural equation modeling (SEM) based on a partial least squares (PLS). The sample is composed of 351 Brazilian and 135 Portuguese enterprises. They are micro, small and medium enterprises. Findings The results show that: the relation between KS and AC is partially mediated by IC; the relation between IC and IN is partially mediated by AC and the relation between KS and IN is mediated by AC and IC or both. There are relations among KS, IC, AC, IN and OP. Research limitations/implications The study does not control for industry effects and technological differences among the firms. Practical implications The use of KS mitigates the loss of knowledge associated to employees' retirement or job changes. The knowledge appropriation by the organization (turning human capital (HC) into structural capital (SC)), the knowledge achieved from connections (relational capital, RC) and the trust embedded in an organization's relation with employees are important for AC and IN. Moreover, KS can positively influence all elements of IC. OP depends directly on IN and indirectly on the others constructs. Originality/value This study is relevant because it explores the relations among KS, IC, AC, IN and OP in one model. Moreover, it focuses on small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) with data from two countries.",

    "Abstract": "Orthopaedic surgery is underrepresented in the United Kingdom medical school curriculum, with an average of less than 3 weeks of exposure over the five-year degree. This study evaluates the effectiveness of high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) and physical model simulation in teaching undergraduate orthopaedic concepts. BACKGROUND Orthopaedic surgery is underrepresented in the United Kingdom medical school curriculum, with an average of less than 3 weeks of exposure over the five-year degree. This study evaluates the effectiveness of high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) and physical model simulation in teaching undergraduate orthopaedic concepts.A modified randomised crossover trial was used. Forty-nine students were randomly allocated to two groups, with thirty-three finishing the six-week follow-up assessment. All undergraduate medical students were eligible for inclusion. Both groups were given introductory lectures, before completing a pre-test with questions on the principles of fracture fixation and osteotomy. Each group then received a lecture on these topics with the same content, but one was delivered with VR and the other with physical models. Both groups completed the post-course assessments. Knowledge was assessed by way of questionnaire immediately before, immediately after, and six-weeks after. METHODS A modified randomised crossover trial was used.

Knowledge was assessed by way of questionnaire immediately before, immediately after, and six-weeks after.In the VR group, participants improved their post-training score by 192.1% (U=32; p <0.00001). In the physical models group, participants improved their post-training scores by 163.1% (U=8.5; p <0.00001). Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in the total means of post-training test scores between the VR and the physical models study groups (U=260.5; p =0.4354). RESULTS In the VR group, participants improved their post-training score by 192.1% (U=32; p<0.00001). In the physical models group, participants improved their post-training scores by 163.1% (U=8.5; p<0.00001). Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in the total means of post-training test scores between the VR and the physical models study groups (U=260.5; p=0.4354).Both VR and physical models represent valuable educational adjuncts for the undergraduate medical curriculum. Both have demonstrated improvements in immediate and long-term knowledge retention of key orthopaedic concepts. CONCLUSION Both VR and physical models represent valuable educational adjuncts for the undergraduate medical curriculum. Both have demonstrated improvements in immediate and long-term knowledge retention of key orthopaedic concepts.",

    "Abstract": "Each year, millions of individuals participate in emergency management training courses. Training opportunities are plentiful and offered by a variety of governmental, public and private providers, in a variety of locations and teaching environments, using a multitude of different topics, styles and methodologies. Training opportunities are vast and often designed to support a broad audience of learners, including those seeking to attain new skills as well as those seeking to retrain or change career. Yet, despite the abundant opportunities for training, including education, instruction, exercises and drills (including training on how to train), in the period following the activation of the emergency operations centre, when the time has come to implement the tools and actions taught, there remain problems. With all this training available, what exactly are workers learning and what are they forgetting? This paper will look at the need for an evolution in traditional emergency management training methods, such as what is working, what is not working, and how methods could evolve to enhance training engagement, increase knowledge retention, and improve worker performance.Each year, millions of individuals participate in emergency management training courses.

As experienced personnel leave and new personnel are introduced, a lack of sufficient knowledge retention introduces inefficiency in project development. This paper focuses on the issues of corporate knowledge loss due to personnel turnover and introduces a project model to be used both as a tool for increased knowledge retention and as an organizational method for new and existing researchers. Using detailed model-based systems engineering architecture and a V-Model life-cycle, we capture data developed during the project's decision-making process including major designs, costs, and risks.",

Buscou-se conhecer a atividade de trabalho dos membros por meio de observaçöes da atividade real e entrevistas. Em seguida, foram realizados workshops com o intuito de efetuar um mapeamento da experiencia dos seus participantes e de definir as carencias em termos de competencia, em cada um dos setores do projeto. Os resultados mostram que a compreensäo e o mapeamento do conhecimento tácito permitiram identificar as principais necessidades de qualificaçâo no projeto e criar perspectivas de contrataçâo específicas. Ao mesmo tempo, esta pesquisa mostra a necessidade de articulaçâo entre os conceitos de competencia oriundos da Ergonomia da Atividade e da Gestäo do Conhecimento Tácito.

Alternate abstract: This study aimed to map the tacit knowledge of members of a university team responsible for building an off-road vehicle, known as BAJA, to identify the needs of a team with high turnover among its members and to propose alternatives for the knowledge retention. We sought to know the members work activity through observations of the actual activity and interviews. Workshops were then conducted to map the experience of its participants and to define the skills shortages in each of the project sectors. The results show that understanding and mapping tacit knowledge made it possible to identify the main qualification needs in the project and create specific hiring perspectives. At the same time, this research shows the need for articulation between the concepts of competence from Activity Ergonomics and Tacit Knowledge Management.",

    "Abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) has received increasing attention in the research literature as a fundamental pedagogical tool that can enhance learning at most educational levels. In academic contexts, this technology permits the superimposing of three-dimensional images onto the real environment. Although AR has been found to enhance learning in the academic environment, no systematic review of it has been conducted to identify, evaluate, and summarize empirical findings on its advantages and challenges in e-learning contexts. Hence, a systematic review of the research literature was conducted on the use of AR in e-learning contexts, with a focus on the key benefits and challenges related to its adoption and implementation. Electronic searches on databases, including Springer, Science Direct, EBSCO, and Google Scholar, were performed to retrieve relevant journal articles; 28 studies were included after they were screened using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The key benefits of using AR in e-learning included support of kinesthetic (tactile) learning, collaborative learning, distance/remote learning, learner-centered learning, and creative learning. Studies also reported that AR enhanced students’ engagement, motivation, attention/focus, interactivity, verbal participation, concentration, knowledge retention, and spatial abilities, as well as information accessibility. The findings suggest that challenges associated with AR in e-learning include information and cognitive overload, lack of experience in using the technology, resistance from teachers, complex technology, costly technology, and technical issues, such as connectivity problems.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Orthopaedic surgery is underrepresented in the United Kingdom medical school curriculum, with an average of less than 3 weeks of exposure over the five-year degree. This study evaluates the effectiveness of high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) and physical model simulation in teaching undergraduate orthopaedic concepts. Methods: A modified randomised crossover trial was used. Forty-nine students were randomly allocated to two groups, with thirty-three finishing the six-week follow-up assessment. All undergraduate medical students were eligible for inclusion. Both groups were given introductory lectures, before completing a pre-test with questions on the principles of fracture fixation and osteotomy. Each group then received a lecture on these topics with the same content, but one was delivered with VR and the other with physical models. Both groups completed the post-course assessments. Knowledge was assessed by way of questionnaire immediately before, immediately after, and six-weeks after. Results: In the VR group, participants improved their post-training score by 192.1% (U=32; p < 0.00001). In the physical models group, participants improved their post-training scores by 163.1% (U=8.5; p < 0.00001). Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in the total means of post-training test scores between the VR and the physical models study groups (U=260.5; p =0.4354). Conclusion: Both VR and physical models represent valuable educational adjuncts for the undergraduate medical curriculum. Both have demonstrated improvements in immediate and long-term knowledge retention of key orthopaedic concepts.",

INTRODUCTION The integration of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in preclerkship medical education is currently popular and based on the notion that POCUS may improve diagnostic and procedural skills in medical students. However, empirical evidence demonstrating that POCUS can enhance clinical skills in preclerkship students has been lacking. We sought to evaluate anatomical sonographic knowledge and ultrasound generation capabilities associated with the implementation of a 3-h echocardiography training camp led by 2 emergency physicians and using a flipped classroom design.Preclerkship students from the University of Ottawa (n = 32) were recruited to participate. A flipped classroom model was adopted, providing students with a 3-chaptered peer-designed, expert validated ultrasound manual before the workshop, to maximize scanning times (2 h of reading). A pretest Likert-type design was used to assess student perception of the ultrasound tool. Similarly, a pretest/post-test model was used to assess sonographic anatomical identification. In addition, a subsequent Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) test was done 3 weeks after the hands-on session, to evaluate image generation (4 cardiac views: parasternal long, parasternal short, subxiphoid, and apical 4 chambers), understanding of knobology and structural labeling. METHODS Preclerkship students from the University of Ottawa (n = 32) were recruited to participate. A flipped classroom model was adopted, providing students with a 3-chaptered peer-designed, expert validated ultrasound manual before the workshop, to maximize scanning times (2 h of reading). A pretest Likert-type design was used to assess student perception of the ultrasound tool. Similarly, a pretest/post-test model was used to assess sonographic anatomical identification. In addition, a subsequent Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) test was done 3 weeks after the hands-on session, to evaluate image generation (4 cardiac views: parasternal long, parasternal short, subxiphoid, and apical 4 chambers), understanding of knobology and structural labeling.For the sonographic anatomy, there was a statistically significant increase ( P  < .001) between pretest (average = 12.12) and post-test (average = 18.85). The OSCE, which also ascertained knowledge retention, found that 81% of students were able to generate all 4 cardiac views perfectly, 6% were able to obtain 3 views, 10% obtained 2 views and 3% successfully generated a single view. The most challenging scan to generate was the apical 4-chamber view. RESULTS For the sonographic anatomy, there was a statistically significant increase (P < .001) between pretest (average = 12.12) and post-test (average = 18.85).

    "Abstract": "Some supply chain leaders in the transportation sector lack the succession planning strategies needed to fill leadership positions. The failure to create succession planning strategies will negatively impact an organization's supply chain through tacit knowledge loss. Grounded in the social exchange theory, the purpose of this qualitative exploratory single-case study was to explore the succession planning strategies transportation industry supply chain business leaders use to fill organizational leadership positions to reduce tacit knowledge loss. The participants consisted of 6 supply chain leaders working in the Northeastern region of the United States who successfully utilize succession planning strategies to fill leadership positions and retain tacit knowledge. Data were obtained utilizing semistructured face-to-face interviews, interview notes, as well as internal company documents. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the information. Three themes emerged: address the potential loss of tacit knowledge, leaders tend to do more with fewer people, and succession planning. A key recommendation is expanded implementation of staged retirement plans and using independent contractors. The implication for positive social change includes the overall enhancement of employee lifestyles via increased social and economic standing within their workplace and the community.

    "Abstract": "Introduction One purpose of the hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (HOCPR) program is to simplify CPR instruction to encourage more bystanders to take action during cardiac arrest. Although the program has been successfully implemented in traditional classroom settings, the utility of large-scale training events has not been well-explored. We hypothesized that CPR knowledge and comfort levels would increase through a large-scale, multi-community HOCPR training event. We also explored what effect this training event had on perceived barriers to bystander-performed CPR. Methods A convenience sample participated in HOCPR training on a single day across 10 Texas cities. A sub-sample completed training questionnaires, including a five-item CPR pre- and post-test. A follow-up questionnaire was conducted two years after the event. The primary outcome of interest was the difference in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) knowledge and comfort level between pre- and post-event questionnaires. Demographic contributions were also assessed. Results A total of 4,253 participants were trained, 1,416 were enrolled upon submitting matching pre- and post-event questionnaires, and 101 (14%) submitted follow-up questionnaires. Mean knowledge scores increased from pre-training (2.7 ± 1.6 standard deviation (SD)) to post-training (4.7 ± 0.76 SD) (p < 0.001). Follow-up test scores (3.8 ± 1.1 SD) remained higher than pre-test scores (p < 0.001). Comfort with HOCPR increased from 59% (95% confidence interval (CI) 56 - 61) to 96% (95% CI 95 - 97). Pre- and post-knowledge scores differed significantly by education level (p < 0.001), ethnicity (p < 0.001), and income (p < 0.001). Education contributed significantly to comfort at both pre- (p = 0.015) and post-training (p = 0.026), but ethnicity and income did not. Before training, the most common barrier to performing CPR was lack of knowledge 59% (95% CI 55 - 62); after training, the most common barrier was fear of causing harm 34% (95% CI 29 - 40). Conclusions This study demonstrated that medical students were successfully able to conduct large-scale HOCPR training that improved CPR knowledge and comfort levels among participants across multiple metropolitan areas. Knowledge retention remained higher at two-years for participants of a follow-up questionnaire. Medical students can use the experiences from this training event as a template to organize similar large-scale training events in the future.",

One of the main considerations underlying this achievement is how to improve long-term knowledge retention. Research projects often involve experiential learning; this paper discusses how Semestre i, a project/challenge-based learning initiative, improved the students’ long-term retention of knowledge. Having participated in this project for two years, the students involved showed a higher level of knowledge retention compared to the students who participated in the traditional educational model. This was validated by a comparison of student grades obtained in the official national undergraduate exam.",

    "Abstract": "Background Missions were established in California in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to convert Native Americans to Christianity and enculturate them into a class of laborers for Californios (Spanish/Mexican settler). The concentration of large numbers of Native Americans at the Missions, along with the introduction of European diseases, led to serious disease problems. Medicinal supplies brought to California by the missionaries were limited in quantity. This situation resulted in an opportunity for the sharing of knowledge of medicinal plants between the Native Americans and the Mission priests. The purpose of this study is to examine the degree to which such sharing of knowledge took place and to understand factors that may have influenced the sharing of medicinal knowledge. The study also examines the sharing of medicinal knowledge between the Native Americans and the Californios following the demise of the California Missions. Methods Two methods were employed in the study: (1) a comparison of lists of medicinal plants used by various groups (e.g., Native American, Mission priests, Californios) prior to, during, and after the Mission period and (2) a close reading of diaries, reports, and books written by first-hand observers and modern authorities to find accounts of and identify factors influencing the exchange of medicinal information. Results A comparison of the lists of medicinal plants use by various groups indicated that only a small percentage of medicinal plants were shared by two or more groups. For example, none of the 265 taxa of species used by the Native Americans in pre-Mission times were imported into Spain for medicinal use and only 16 taxa were reported to have been used at the Missions. A larger sharing of information of medicinal plants took place in the post-Mission period when Native Americans were dispersed from the Missions and worked as laborers on the ranches of the Californios. Conclusions Sharing of information concerning medicinal plants did occur during the Mission period, but the number of documented species was limited. A number of possible factors discouraged this exchange. These include (1) imbalance of power between the priests and the Native Americans, (2) suppression of indigenous knowledge and medical practices by the Mission priests, (3) language barriers, (4) reduction of availability of medicinal herbs around the Mission due to introduced agricultural practices, (5) desire to protect knowledge of medicinal herbs by Native American shaman, (6) administrative structure at the Missions which left little time for direct interaction between the priests and individual Native Americans, (7) loss of knowledge of herbal medicine by the Native Americans over time at the Missions, and (8) limited transportation opportunities for reciprocal the shipment of medicinal plants between California and Spain. Three possible factors were identified that contributed to a greater sharing of information between the Native Americans and the Californios in the post-Mission period. These were (1) more one-to-one interactions between the Californios and the Native Americans, (2) many of the Californios were mestizos whose mothers or grandmothers were Native Americans, and (3) lack of pressure on the part of the Californios to suppress Native American beliefs and medicinal practices.",

    "Abstract": "High fidelity simulation (HFS) is a useful method to teach practical information without the risk of harming a live patient. It is a teaching method used in at least half of all nurse anesthesia programs, but not generally designed to specifically focus on pharmacology content. Similarly, there is no research that specifically explores the use of HFS to supplement didactic pharmacology education in nurse anesthesia. Because of this, we designed a study to investigate the impact that HFS has on the pharmacologic knowledge acquisition and retention of student registered nurse anesthetists (SRNAs). This pilot study recruited fifteen SRNAs to participate in a pharmacology curriculum that included a traditional didactic lecture supplemented with a pharmacology focused HFS experience. Their baseline pharmacologic knowledge was assessed with a pretest that indicated no significant difference in the scores (p=0.34). After the simulation, all participants scored 20% higher on knowledge assessment questions related to pharmacology content that was supplemented with simulation and 1% lower on the content that was taught via the traditional didactic lecture alone (p<0.01). One month after the simulation, participants were assessed for knowledge retention of the same pharmacologic content. All participants scored 20% higher than the pretest on the questions pertaining to the content covered in the simulation and 15% lower than the pretest on the questions that were assessing material only taught via didactic lecture (p<0.01). This pilot study strongly suggests that incorporating simulation into a nurse anesthesia pharmacology curriculum helps clinical trainees learn and retain new pharmacologic material. This educational method should be further explored as a potential means to promote safe practice in the hospital setting by increasing pharmacologic knowledge acquisition and long-term knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "Productivity, safety and its improvement is also an integral part of a good mining operation. In recent times, due to constraints on time and cost, it has become increasingly harder to conduct training and safety inductions at mine sites. For the purpose of overcoming these limitations, the use of virtual reality (VR) is proposed for mining education and training. VR has already been introduced in the education and training of miners overseas, and quantitative studies on the effects of using VR for miner's education and training have been made. However, Japan has only one such application of VR for mining education, namely, “Virtual Mining Practice System” which was produced by Akita University, and there are relatively few cases where VR has been introduced in the Japanese mining industry. Furthermore, there has been no quantitative study to date on the effects of education using VR for mining education. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of a class that utilizes a VR application developed for mining education (Mining VR), as well as evaluate its learning outcomes. In this study, a method called randomized controlled trial (RCT) is used for evaluating Mining VR's effectiveness. Study participants are divided two groups randomly where one class makes use of Mining VR and another class using other non-VR material. After the classes are completed, a test is conducted and the average results of each group are compared by T-test. The results of this experiment showed that there were no statistically significant differences in skill of “understanding” and “knowledge retention” comparing two groups. On the other hand, results suggested that Mining VR has improved students'“ motivation” for class when using Mining VR.",

    "Abstract": "In online collaborative learning, discussions have been widely utilized as an educational activity, and much research has been conducted on the process and behaviors involved in synchronous or asynchronous discussions. However, research on behavioral patterns in collaborative learning environments with different formats of learning materials has not been addressed in detailed yet. In this study, we designed three versions of media to present the same learning contents: interactive version, video version, and text version. The differences among the above three versions are the form of information organization and the interaction mode between students and the given version. There were 131 eighth graders from three classes participated in this study. They were asked to complete a group worksheet through online discussion while engaging with the given learning materials. In order to explore students' online collaborative behavioral patterns while engaging with different multimedia, this study proposed a verb-dominated coding scheme for synchronous online collaborative learning and conducted a lag sequential analysis. The findings indicate that Class A (interactive version) formed an active learning atmosphere, while Class B (video version) spent more time on showing disagreement due to overloaded working memory caused by improper information presentation. In contrast, Class C (text version) had high efficiency in information exchanges because of the convenience of information acquisition. Besides, Class A gained the highest scores in group worksheet and invested moderate cognitive load. Class B had unsatisfactory learning performance on group worksheet along with the highest cognitive load. Class C invested the lowest cognitive load and had better knowledge retention than Class A, as shown in the results of the post-test a week later.

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2020 6th International Conference on Information Management (ICIM) Conference Start Date: 2020, March 27 Conference End Date: 2020, March 29 Conference Location: London, United Kingdom With a Senian understanding of intellectual capital as being a function of agent capability and contextual resource constraints, the requirement for knowledge in the digital economy to be co-created by a network of agents is obvious. From network agents co-creating knowledge for the digital economy as a foundational point of departure, we problematize the management of this co-created knowledge. As network power shifts, so does the foundational capabilities and contexts. As demonstrated by the increased use of multiple stakeholder groups to co-create innovative solutions. These stakeholder groups are commonly classified as Triple helix, Quadruple helix, n Tuple helix. The problems caused by shifts in network power and agent capabilities become apparent in co-creative systems design processes such as Living Labs and popular Design Science frameworks. As the disruptive power of digital change creates shifts in the foundational design network’s agency, knowledge is lost. We postulate that it is typically highly technical design knowledge - created at a high cost during co-creation - that is lost first. We present examples of technical design knowledge flowing out of the network from a local Smart Community design case. Towards the prevention of co-created design knowledge loss as a result of changes in the foundational network, we suggest the use of physical ideation artefacts for the storage, management, and continued dissemination of the knowledge within the network. We present a case study where local, co-created, technical, Smart Community design knowledge was stored explicitly as ideation artefacts called “tech cards” and retained over time within the network after highly disruptive shifts in the capability set of the foundational agent network responsible for the original knowledge creation. The co-creation of physical, knowledge-rich ideation artefacts as part of system design processes such as Living Labs shows promise as a Knowledge Management tool (KMT) amidst fast paced digital change in the knowledge economy.",

    "Abstract": "Mobile devices have penetrated all spheres of human activities, including education. Previous research has shown that smartphones are becoming widely used in learning as they can improve knowledge retention and increase student engagement. The purpose of this study was to discuss students' perception of the use of a mobile application aimed at learning new English vocabulary and phrases and describe its strengths and weaknesses as perceived by the students. In total, 28 university students answered a pen and paper questionnaire survey after experiencing the app during one semester. Overall, the students' agreement to the positive aspects displayed in the questionnaire prevailed over their disagreement or neutral opinions. The mobile app helped students prepare for the final achievement test, learning was accessible from anywhere and at any time, students appreciated the corrective feedback and would opt for the implementation of the mobile app in other courses taught at the faculty. On the other hand, as the findings indicate, the students reported that the app was not very supportive regarding communication performance; they did not find the teachers' notifications encouraging and they did not use the pronunciation support much, which was caused by various factors, such as offering students words and phrases without context or not testing all the items in the final credit test. The findings of this study contribute to the existing knowledge of students' perceptions of the use of mobile apps for learning purposes.",

    "Abstract": "Attrition of anatomy knowledge has been an area of concern in health professions curricula. To ensure safe and effective clinical practice, the study of chiropractic requires a good knowledge of musculoskeletal anatomy. In this study, musculoskeletal limb knowledge retention was investigated among students in the 5-year chiropractic program at Macquarie University, Australia. A test of 20 multiple-choice questions, categorized into low-order (LO) and high-order (HO) cognitive ability according to Bloom's Taxonomy, was developed. Students enrolled in the program were invited to participate with 257 of the 387 choosing to participate, (response rate ranging 56%-72% per year level). No attrition of knowledge across the years was observed, instead, a significant increase in knowledge, measured by total LO and HO scores (P < 0.0005), throughout the program. There were significant increases in both low and high cognitive scores which were not uniform, with high-order scores increasing significantly in the last two year levels. The increase of knowledge, may be explained, at least partially, by the vertical and horizontal integrated curriculum. Retrieval of knowledge, especially in clinically applied formats, may have led to an enhanced ability to apply anatomy knowledge and account for the increased scores in the high-order knowledge seen in the later clinical years. Evaluating anatomy knowledge retention at different cognitive levels seems to provide a better assessment and is worth considering in future anatomy educational research.",

    "Abstract": "Human anatomy is a foundational course in nursing education, however, there is growing concern that students do not retain enough anatomical knowledge to successfully apply it in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to determine retention level of anatomy knowledge among second-year nursing students from their first-year anatomy class, and to determine if there is a difference in level of retention based on organ system. For each system, second-year students were asked to answer 9 to 11 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and the scores from these quizzes were compared to matched test items from their first-year anatomy examinations. There was a significant decrease in the overall mean score from 83.05 ± 8.34 (±SD) in first year to 54.36 ±12.9 in second year (P = 0.0001). Retention levels were system specific. System-specific knowledge retention was highest for the gastrointestinal system (89.7%), respiratory system (88.5%), and genitourinary system (83.6%). This was followed by the integumentary system (80.1%), special senses (79.4%), nervous system (74.9%), and musculoskeletal system (69.3%). Retention was lowest for the lymphatic system (64.3%), cranial nerves (58.8%), vascular system (53.9%), and head and neck (42.6%). The present study shows that nursing students' anatomy knowledge retention was comparatively higher than rates reported by others in medical and allied-health students. The researchers are now investigating knowledge retention in third- and fourth-year nursing students. Further investigation into why retention is higher for specific systems and intervention strategies to improve knowledge acquisition and retention in nursing students is recommended.",

    "Abstract": "The article sets out to develop the concept of attention as a key aspect to building the possible therapeutics that Bernard Stiegler's recent works have pointed to (The Automatic Society, 2016, The \"Neganthropocene\", 2018 and \"Qu'appelle-t-on\" Panser, 2018). The therapeutic aspect of pharmacology takes place through processes that are neganthropic; therefore, which attempt to counteract the entropic nature of digital technologies where there is flattening out to the measurable and the calculable of Big Data. The most obvious examples of this flattening out can be seen in relation to the use of natural language processing technologies for text interpretation and the use of text analytics alongside student analytics. However, the process of exosomatisation of knowledge takes place in forms of hypomnesic tertiary retentions or digital technologies. The loss of knowledge is inherent to these processes of exteriorisation, this loss of knowledge takes place through a process proletarianisation which Marx had pointed to in the \"Grundisse\" (1939). The therapeutic gesture is, therefore, an intrinsically educational one, where the loss of knowledge of the pharmacological nature of digital technologies is counteracted by other forms of knowledge construction that can be enabled by digital technologies. Hence, there is a profound educational gesture necessary to enable the re-harnessing of technology to enable the therapeutics. This paper will argue that the positive re-harnessing, the therapeutics, can take place through the development of new forms of neganthropic gestures which can be afforded by the development of specific forms of digital technologies. These also enable a contributive research process whereby the rationalisation of the production of knowledge within the university can be challenged by collaborative, interpretative processes of knowledge production.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid growth in diversity of information and communication technologies (ICT) enables a range of teaching methods, learning support strategies, and education settings to be developed. Questions about appropriate, effective, and efficient use of educational technology in teaching mathematics have been gaining more attention. This study focuses on the design and testing of an interactive learning textbook (eBook), created with GeoGebra applets and up-to-date web technologies. The eBook is designed to meet the pedagogical and didactic needs of learners, allowing a high degree of interactivity and feedback during the learning process. In order to determine the effect of the created materials on students' achievements, tests of knowledge as well as tests of retention of knowledge were used. Moreover, questionnaires and interviews for students were developed to assess the impact of interactive textbooks on the perceptions of learners concerning mathematics, interactive materials, and the learning process. Students who have used the interactive eBook show statistically significant increased knowledge and knowledge retention compared to students who have attended the standard classes. Students also emphasized that tasks with interactive applets and new kind of learning materials inspired them to learn more, both in school and at home.",

The study improves on the methods used in prior studies by, simplifying the estimation of pre-exam anxiety, and controlling for general student aptitude (GPA) in the specification of model. ANOVA was used to analyse the data. The results of the study provide compelling support for the application of cheat-sheet exams even though the perceptual views of students regarding this exam type were quite low on several variables and parameters.",

    "Abstract": "Coach and parent concussion education programs are essential for the prevention, diagnosis, management, and return to play of youth athletes. This systematic review examined the content and efficacy (changes in knowledge, impact on concussion incidence) of concussion education programs for coaches and parents of youth and high school athletes. Six databases were searched: SPORTDiscus, Academic Search Premiere, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Studies evaluated the use and/or efficacy of concussion education programs among coaches or parents of youth athletes. A total of 13 articles (out of 1553 articles) met selection criteria. Although different concussion education programs exist, only three have been evaluated in the literature: ACTive Athletic Concussion Training™, USA Football’s Heads Up Football, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s HEADS UP. These programs are well liked among coaches and parents and the suggested practices are easily implemented by coaches. These programs increased concussion knowledge among coaches and parents and promoted behavioral changes among coaches to reduce the concussion risk in high school sports. Few studies have assessed the efficacy of concussion education programs on youth athlete health outcomes. No studies included a longitudinal follow up to determine the degree of knowledge retention following the intervention. While online educational programs are sufficient to improve coach knowledge, in-person training may be a more effective educational tool for reducing the incidence of youth sport concussion. Future studies addressing the efficacy of concussion education programs should include a longitudinal follow up to assess knowledge retention and fidelity.",

    "Abstract": "This study compared three multimedia input modes in the modality and redundancy principles (Mayer, 2009) in terms of university ESL (English as a Second Language) students' learning and examined the applicability of the modality and redundancy principles for ESL students. Mayer's modality and redundancy principles (2009) inform the design of effective multimedia lessons. However, the two principles originally stemmed from experimental studies examining students' learning in their native language and did not include ESL students in the discussion. Based on the modality and redundancy principles, added on-screen text and graphics lead to an overload in learner's visual channel, which undermines learning (Clark & Mayer, 2011). For ESL students' multimedia learning, the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (Mayer, 2009) suggests that on-screen text in the input modes of graphics + text and graphics + audio + text might overload the visual channel to impede learning. However, according to the cognitive load theory (Sweller, 2014), text might also reduce the processing demands for identifying and decoding auditory input to facilitate learning. Due to the limited number of empirical studies, it was inconclusive if verbatim text aids or hinders ESL students' learning, and it was unclear if the modality and redundancy principles apply for ESL students. An initial Study addressed common validity issues, such as lack of control of instruments and materials, in related studies, and it quantitatively tested the applicability of the modality and redundancy principles for ESL students' learning. Both knowledge retention and vocabulary test results indicated that input modes did not have an impact on ESL students' learning, and consequently the modality and redundancy principles were insignificant. An additional study, Study 2, addressed the implementation issues and limitations of Study 1 to provide more rigorous findings. Based on the findings of both Study 1 and Study 2, the modality and redundancy principles did not apply for ESL students' content knowledge and vocabulary learning when certain multimedia learning principles were followed. Both Study 1 and Study 2 extended Mayer's modality and redundancy principles by examining their applications to ESL students, as well as provided empirical evidence for designing effective multimedia instruction for ESL students.

These transitions are ultimately and importantly linked to the safety of post-acute stroke survivors A basic strategy in improving challenges related to transitional care is providing better stroke education to patients and caregivers (Sanders et al., 2014; Reeves et al., 2017).Purpose: The purpose of this project is to evaluate stroke knowledge retention among Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), stroke survivors or caregivers when they return home (14ndash30 days after discharge). Specifically, this project analyzed selected demographics (age, gender, type of stroke, discharge location) and assessed 1) stroke knowledge (stroke type and risk factors) and 2) the impact of the stroke education book (did they remember receiving the book and if so did they refer to it and was it helpful) that was provided to the patient and caregivers by the Comprehensive Stroke Center.Design and Methods: A quality improvement project which performed a secondary analysis of data that has been previously collected by a Comprehensive Stroke Center Transition of Care program ± 30 days post hospital discharge. Data that has been collected included patient demographics, stroke knowledge and usefulness of a newly developed stroke education book.Results: Reponses of patients and caregivers (N = 105) were included. The sample included mostly ischemic stroke and TIA patients. Less than half of the participants said they received stroke education or the newly developed stroke education book even though, according to the stroke coordinator, there is nearly 100% compliance in providing stroke education book documented in patients' charts. Further, more than half of the participants who said they received a stroke education book did not refer to the book for any reason. Some of the participants who read the book reported not understanding it.Conclusion: There is lack of knowledge regarding stroke diagnosis and risk factors despite having educational material provided to patients/caregivers. A stroke education book is likely necessary but is not sufficient. There is a need for developing active, individualized in-hospital education as well as a need for early discharge follow up to reinforce education in order to ensure safe transitions when patients return home after experiencing stroke.

    "Abstract": "This quantitative, nonexperimental, predictive study was an examination of how knowledge maturity predicts data system impact. Data volumes are increasing exponentially, and organizations need to understand how data impacts information systems—specifically data systems. Studies have been completed that examined the predictive relationship between knowledge maturity and the overall system impact with transactional systems, but not data systems. The research questions asked to what extent do knowledge creation, knowledge transfer, knowledge retention, and knowledge application predict system quality? To what extent do knowledge creation, knowledge transfer, knowledge retention, and knowledge application predict information quality? To what extent do knowledge creation, knowledge transfer, knowledge retention, and knowledge application predict individual impact? To what extent do knowledge creation, knowledge transfer, knowledge retention, and knowledge application predict organizational impact? The research methodology was a nonexperimental quantitative study using Partial Least Squares, which provided the ability to analyze multiple independent variables and dependent variables. Similar studies used Partial Least Squares and proved to be effective. The target population of 115,000 consisted of data managers who work for U.S. companies earning $1B or more in annual revenue. The sample size was 113 using G*Power software. Cronbach's alpha and composite validity returned results that proved the collection was reliable and valid. Limitations included data managers being the only participants in U.S.-based organizations with annual revenue over $1B. The quantitative, nonexperimental, predictive study did not analyze the demographics of the respondents other than the industry of the participants. There were transcription errors, so the survey was not exactly as expected; however, the survey errors did not affect the overall validity of the results, which validated the theory. Previous studies proved that knowledge maturity predicted transaction system quality; this quantitative, nonexperimental, predictive study proved that knowledge maturity predicts data system quality. Knowledge maturity predicted all variables. This quantitative, nonexperimental, predictive study may provide organizations with a better understanding of how data collection and the accumulation of data affects competitive advantage and validated that converting tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge affords organizations a competitive advantage. This quantitative, nonexperimental, predictive study concluded that (a) knowledge maturity predicts data system quality, and (2) organizations benefit from improved knowledge management. Increasing knowledge with quality information is vital to organizations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Poor knowledge retention is one reason for medical student attrition in learning and has been a huge concern in medical education. Three-dimensional virtual reality (3D-VR)-based teaching and learning in medical education has been promoted to improve student learning outcomes. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of 3D-VR in knowledge retention in human anatomy courses as compared to traditional teaching methods among medical students. Methods A convergent mixed methods design was utilized to evaluate learning outcomes in terms of short- and long-term knowledge retention scores among students using 3D-VR and those using traditional models and to describe students’ experiences and views of the use of 3D-VR as a teaching and learning tool. Results Male students who used the 3D-VR tool had significantly higher short- and long-term knowledge scores than males who used the traditional methods. Meanwhile, females who used traditional methods showed significantly higher short-term knowledge scores than females who used 3D-VR. Conclusion Medical students described 3D-VR as a learning tool with a great deal to offer for learning human anatomy as compared to traditional methods. Therefore, we recommend adding the use of 3D-VR in the anatomy curriculum. However, several 3D-VR limitations were also identified, which may hinder its utilization for teaching and learning. These concerns must be addressed before 3D-VR tools are considered for implementation in medical education human anatomy courses.",

    "Abstract": "Organizations aim to keep their competitive advantage over their rivals in the marketplace. However, due to the growth of the number of older workers and their inevitable retirement, organizations are in danger of losing their competitive advantage due to knowledge loss. Therefore, companies and human resource practitioners need to find ways to motivate the older workforce to share their tacit knowledge before retirement. One strategy to accomplish this goal is through designing motivating work that can lead to tacit knowledge sharing. This study investigated the relationship between the work characteristics of autonomy, task interdependence and task significance with knowledge-sharing behavior. Additionally, the moderating impact of age on these relationships was assessed. The results of this study illustrate that there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between autonomy and task significance with knowledge-sharing behavior. However, age did not moderate the relationship between these three variables and knowledge-sharing behavior. In other words, autonomy, task interdependence, and task significance did not become more motivating as age increases. These results suggest that work design is an essential element in promoting and creating a knowledge-sharing culture within organizations to sustain and increase competitive advantage.

    "Abstract": "The goal of this study was to assess if a neurological disorder ultrasound workshop for the first-year medical students significantly enhanced the students' ability to retain and apply concepts related to neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. INTRODUCTION The goal of this study was to assess if a neurological disorder ultrasound workshop for the first-year medical students significantly enhanced the students' ability to retain and apply concepts related to neuroanatomy and neurophysiology.We performed a prospective study to evaluate student performance before and after an optional ultrasound workshop. Data were collected through a within-population pretest-posttest design. Purposive sampling was used to recruit first-year medical students for this study. The six stations were transcranial doppler ultrasound, ocular ultrasound, ultrasound-guided external ventricular drain placement, high-intensity focused ultrasound for brain lesions, carotid artery scan with ultrasound, and ultrasound-guided central line placement. We used a pre-post workshop survey to identify opinions and perceptions about ultrasound and a pre-post workshop test to assess knowledge about neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and related ultrasound topics. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a prospective study to evaluate student performance before and after an optional ultrasound workshop.

We used a pre-post workshop survey to identify opinions and perceptions about ultrasound and a pre-post workshop test to assess knowledge about neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and related ultrasound topics.Twenty-two 22 first-year medical students consented to participate in this study. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a statistically significant difference in pre- and posttest scores, suggesting that participants demonstrated higher levels of medical knowledge related to neurological physiology, anatomy, and ultrasound after participating in the workshop. The analysis of the pre-post survey showed participants attributed greater value to ultrasound as a useful tool for their future medical practice after participation in the event (Z = -2.45, P = 0.014).

Future studies, with a larger sample size, are needed to further explore the efficacy of this workshop in enhancing knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "Corporations are experiencing significant changes because of the impending Baby Boomers retirements. There are four generations in the workforce today, Traditionalist, Baby Boomers, and Generations X and Y. To effectively address the knowledge management challenges organizations are creating mechanisms to identify, capture, and transfer knowledge to individuals who will be tasked with replacing Baby Boomers, the largest segment of the population. This phenomenological study addressed organizational readiness and loss of knowledge when Baby Boomers retire from the United States based aerospace company. Twenty semi structured face-to-face and telephone interviews were conducted at the United States-based aerospace company. The major findings from this research study identified the need to implement a knowledge transfer program, filling the intermediate gap of security personnel, motivating remaining employees, providing incentives for sharing knowledge, and addressing the obstacles toward knowledge sharing. More important, leaders face the challenge of having skilled and qualified personnel in place before Baby Boomers retire from the organization. In addition, the lack of a robust knowledge transfer program was a finding that requires attention from all leaders, to ensure the company's competitive advantage is not threatened. However, it will be imperative for security leaders to ensure knowledge transfer occurs in the organization once Baby Boomers begin to retire. Knowledge sharing with less experienced personnel is critical to providing security leaders with insight into identifying, capturing, and transferring industrial security knowledge before Baby Boomers retire, thus sustaining the organization's competitive advantage. Future research in the area of information technology is important to building a robust infrastructure to support knowledge management in the security and fire protection organization.

    "Abstract": "In recent years, urban contexts and urban-rural linkages have become central for scholars and activists engaged in agrarian questions, agroecological transitions and food system transformation. Grassroots experimentations in urban agroecology and farmers’ engagement with urban policies have marked the rise of a new agenda aiming to bridge urban and agrarian movements. Departing from the work of Eric Holt-Gimenez and Annie Shattuck, this paper argues that the way urban-rural links have been conceptualized is occasionally progressive, and that an agroecology-informed food system transformation needs radical approaches. Acknowledging that processes of urbanization are dynamic, driven by specific lifestyles, consumption patterns, and value orientations – producing ongoing suburbanization, land enclosures, farmers displacement and food-knowledge loss – the paper argues that thinking transitions through new rural-urban links is unfit to tackle the evolving nature of these geographies, and reproduces the distinction between consumers and producers, living on either side of what Mindi Schneider and Philip McMichael have described as an epistemic and ecological rift. Building on insights from four case-studies across global north and south, the paper reframes agroecological transitions as a paradigmatic change in biopolitical spatial relations, economic values and planning agency – what we call an ‘agroecological urbanism’. The paper articulates a transformation agenda addressing urban nutrients, peri-urban landuse, community food pedagogies and farmers’ infrastructure.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge is a key resource for firms, capable of providing a firm-level competitive advantage. Interfirm networks are a valuable source of knowledge for firms, as both breadth and depth of knowledge can be developed via interfirm relationships. However, for firms that have acquired and developed valuable knowledge assets, they may view their interfirm network as providing an opportunity for knowledge loss via knowledge spillovers. Knowledge spillovers allow the recipient to gain knowledge without compensation to the knowledge-originating firm. Spillovers lead to a loss of present and future value to the knowledge-originating firm. Indeed, firms with valuable knowledge asset may implement network safeguards to limit potential knowledge spillovers via their network size, intensity, structure, and position within the network. While extant research has examined the effect of networks on knowledge outcomes, limited attention has been paid to how firms may adapt their networks to safeguard their knowledge once they have created significant value in their knowledge assets. Furthermore, as networks are a key knowledge resource, it is unknown if these network safeguards will harm the future value of the firm's knowledge asset due to the restriction of available knowledge. This dissertation seeks to explore these issues by examining how firms with knowledge assets of high value may safeguard their knowledge via their network size, intensity, structure, and position, and ultimately how these efforts may impact the value of their future knowledge assets.

    "Abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to investigate the relationships between identified faculty learning styles and the retention of content knowledge as measured by online learning activity choice. A total of 17,589 full time faculty were sent an invitation to participate with 165 choosing to be a part of the study. Using a quasi-experimental quantitative research methodology, faculty completed the Cohen, Oxford, and Chi (2006) Learning Styles Survey in an online module. After completing the survey, faculty chose an instructional object that was customized to one of three learning styles: visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. Faculty completed course content in the instructional object and then completed a comprehension quiz. χ2 tests of independence confirmed demographic variables are independent of learning style. An ANOVA test supported the assumption that there is not a stronger learning style for online learning, but that all groups showed the same level of propensity for knowledge retention. A Pearson r correlation analysis supported the idea that completion time is not indicative of a better score on assessments. Finally, independent sample t-tests indicated that there was not a significant difference in matched learning style or unmatched learning style groups for either completion time or comprehension quiz score. The final results of the current study indicated that an online model of faculty development appears to be effective in delivering content to faculty regardless of learning style.

    "Abstract": "Medicinal plants and plant remedies have been in use in Ethiopia for centuries. Studies on ethnobotany, ethnomedicine, and ethnoveterinary estimate that nearly 80% of Ethiopians use some type of medicinal plants and plant remedies. Medicinal plants are regarded as the most important and sometimes the only source of therapeutics in the country. Some 800 plant species are used as sources of medicine to treat about 300 physical and mental disorders. However, because these plant species are not adequately studied, there is a big limitation in their documentation, profiling, and management. Moreover, there is a continuous loss of knowledge about medicinal plants because the communities and people are adopting new lifestyles. Hence, this article reports the finding of a study aimed at providing the gross phytochemical characteristics and antimicrobial activities of ethanol and aqueous extracts of fruit, leaf, and stem of Solanum incanum L. against two Gram-negative ( Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi ) and two Gram-positive ( Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus ) bacteria for developing gross antimicrobial profile of the plant. Phytochemical screening of fruit, leaf, and stem extracts of S. incanum has shown that it is the source of alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, glycosides, terpenoids, and steroids. According to agar disc-diffusion tests, 100 mg/mL extracts of the plant produced bacterial growth inhibition zones of 0.00 to 16.06 mm. Ethanol and aqueous leaf extracts produced inhibition zones ranging from 11.34 to 16.06 mm against all bacterial species. The greatest inhibition zone of 16.06 mm was recorded in E. coli subjected to ethanol leaf extract. The same extract resulted in a growth inhibition zone of 16.04 mm in S. aureus . The greatest growth inhibition zones in B. subtilis (13.34 mm) and S. typhi (11.56 mm) were observed with ethanol leaf and fruit extracts, respectively. Aqueous leaf extracts produced growth inhibition zones ranging from 10.45 mm (for S. typhi ) to 14.02 mm (for E. coli ). Ethanol leaf extracts resulted in the lowest Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) of 1.56 mg/mL in E. coli and S. aureus . Therefore, fruits, leaves, and stems of S. incanum can be regarded as good sources of some bioactive compounds. The findings are important for taking measures for conservation and sustainable use of the plant as well as for further elucidation of its phytochemistry and antimicrobial efficacy of its constituents.Medicinal plants and plant remedies have been in use in Ethiopia for centuries.

    "Abstract": "This mixed-methods study examined the effect of instructor-generated multimedia on student engagement in six sections of one online graduate course at Wilmington University. This study observed the use of VoiceThread and Collaborate Ultra in three sections of each Block term during the Fall 2018 semester as follows: one using Collaborate Ultra only, one using VoiceThread only, and one using both tools. The pre-developed online course template assignments were modified to use the tool specified. The five instructors were trained on how to use the tools but had creative freedom over the length of the term. The students were administered a confidential survey in their section and the instructor was interviewed at the end of the term. The protocol for each was developed by the researcher to determine student engagement in connection to the Community of Inquiry model. This model states that a complete educational experience is developed through social, teaching, and cognitive presence (Garrison, Anderson & Archer, 2000), The use of the tools proved to have a positive impact on student engagement, social presence, teaching presence, and cognitive presence. The importance of this study impacts all institutions of higher education that have an online course modality. This study was done to highlight the importance of incorporating instructor-generated multimedia into course content in order to increase student-to-instructor, student-to-student, and student-to-content interaction and engagement. Online learning is growing , therefore, understanding what engages these students is necessary in order to improve knowledge retention and development. The results of this study will be important to faculty members as well as academic and administrative leaders. The recommendations identified from this study will help institutions create successful and engaging online programs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "Copyright © JLO (1984) Limited, 2019 2019 JLO (1984) Limited Objective To ascertain whether simulation-based teaching is superior to lecture-based teaching for an induction programme using a home-made induction model. Methods A simulation-based induction programme was designed and separate lecture-based teaching covering the same content was organised for junior doctors. The junior doctors were asked to complete pre- and post-induction surveys regarding confidence and anxiety levels. The skills taught included microsuction, flexible nasendoscopy, and anterior and posterior nasal packing. Structured interviews were conducted after the programme to gain qualitative data for analysis. The trainees’ knowledge retention was compared using a standardised written assessment one month after the session. Results Simulation-based teaching using the induction model was associated with a statistically significant increase in confidence levels and reduction in anxiety levels, and was associated with greater knowledge retention. Conclusion A regular simulation induction programme should be introduced using the induction model, as it leads to better knowledge retention and increased confidence levels.",

    "Abstract": "The original purpose of creating the NMSU library oral histories collection was to learn how senior library employees document and pass on their professional expertise. The project was set up in an effort to find ways of retaining institutional knowledge that would otherwise have vanished. After analysis of the audio recordings, it became apparent that oral histories are the perfect venue for institutional knowledge retention. The collected material on documentation practices went beyond expectations providing deep insight into the NMSU library culture. Given its broad scope, such recorded material may be used for a variety of purposes, including creating a unified documentation policy, developing a library-wide succession plan, establishing an institutional socialization program, and sharing institutional knowledge with new employees.

    "Abstract": "Medicinal plants and plant remedies have been in use in Ethiopia for centuries. Studies on ethnobotany, ethnomedicine, and ethnoveterinary estimate that nearly 80% of Ethiopians use some type of medicinal plants and plant remedies. Medicinal plants are regarded as the most important and sometimes the only source of therapeutics in the country. Some 800 plant species are used as sources of medicine to treat about 300 physical and mental disorders. However, because these plant species are not adequately studied, there is a big limitation in their documentation, profiling, and management. Moreover, there is a continuous loss of knowledge about medicinal plants because the communities and people are adopting new lifestyles. Hence, this article reports the finding of a study aimed at providing the gross phytochemical characteristics and antimicrobial activities of ethanol and aqueous extracts of fruit, leaf, and stem of Solanum incanum L. against two Gram-negative ( Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi ) and two Gram-positive ( Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus ) bacteria for developing gross antimicrobial profile of the plant. Phytochemical screening of fruit, leaf, and stem extracts of S. incanum has shown that it is the source of alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, glycosides, terpenoids, and steroids. According to agar disc-diffusion tests, 100 mg/mL extracts of the plant produced bacterial growth inhibition zones of 0.00 to 16.06 mm. Ethanol and aqueous leaf extracts produced inhibition zones ranging from 11.34 to 16.06 mm against all bacterial species. The greatest inhibition zone of 16.06 mm was recorded in E. coli subjected to ethanol leaf extract. The same extract resulted in a growth inhibition zone of 16.04 mm in S. aureus . The greatest growth inhibition zones in B. subtilis (13.34 mm) and S. typhi (11.56 mm) were observed with ethanol leaf and fruit extracts, respectively. Aqueous leaf extracts produced growth inhibition zones ranging from 10.45 mm (for S. typhi ) to 14.02 mm (for E. coli ). Ethanol leaf extracts resulted in the lowest Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) of 1.56 mg/mL in E. coli and S. aureus . Therefore, fruits, leaves, and stems of S. incanum can be regarded as good sources of some bioactive compounds. The findings are important for taking measures for conservation and sustainable use of the plant as well as for further elucidation of its phytochemistry and antimicrobial efficacy of its constituents.",

    "Abstract": "Background Neonatal healthcare professionals require frequent simulation-based education (SBE) to improve their cognitive, psychomotor and communication skills during neonatal resuscitation. However, current SBE approaches are resource-intensive and not routinely offered in all healthcare facilities. Serious games (board and computer based) may be effective and more accessible alternatives. Objective To review the current literature about serious games, and how these games might improve knowledge retention and skills in neonatal healthcare professionals. Method Literature searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Web of Science and EMBASE databases were performed to identify studies examining serious games in neonatology. All games, such as board games, tabletop games, video games, screen-based simulators, tabletop simulators and virtual reality games were included. Results Twelve serious games were included in this review (four board games, five video games and three virtual reality games). Overall, knowledge improvement was reported for the RETAIN (REsuscitationTrAINing for healthcare professionals) board game (10% increase in knowledge retention) and The Neonatology Game (4.15 points higher test score compared with control). Serious games are increasingly incorporated into Nursing and Medical School Curriculums to reinforce theoretical and practical learning. Conclusions Serious games have the potential to improve healthcare professionals’ knowledge, skills and adherence to the resuscitation algorithm and could enhance access to SBE in resource-intensive and resource-limited areas. Future research should examine important clinical outcomes in newborn infants.",

OBJECTIVE Rapid advancements in medicine and changing standards in medical education require new, efficient educational strategies. We investigated whether an online intervention could increase residents' knowledge and improve knowledge retention in mechanical ventilation when compared with a clinical rotation and whether the timing of intervention had an impact on overall knowledge gains.A prospective, interventional crossover study conducted from October 2015 to December 2017. DESIGN A prospective, interventional crossover study conducted from October 2015 to December 2017.Multicenter study conducted in 33 PICUs across eight countries. SETTING Multicenter study conducted in 33 PICUs across eight countries.Pediatric categorical residents rotating through the PICU for the first time. We allocated 483 residents into two arms based on rotation date to use an online intervention either before or after the clinical rotation. SUBJECTS Pediatric categorical residents rotating through the PICU for the first time. We allocated 483 residents into two arms based on rotation date to use an online intervention either before or after the clinical rotation.Residents completed an online virtual mechanical ventilation simulator either before or after a 1-month clinical rotation with a 2-month period between interventions. INTERVENTIONS Residents completed an online virtual mechanical ventilation simulator either before or after a 1-month clinical rotation with a 2-month period between interventions.Performance on case-based, multiple-choice question tests before and after each intervention was used to quantify knowledge gains and knowledge retention. Initial knowledge gains in residents who completed the online intervention (average knowledge gain, 6.9%; SD, 18.2) were noninferior compared with those who completed 1 month of a clinical rotation (average knowledge gain, 6.1%; SD, 18.9; difference, 0.8%; 95% CI, -5.05 to 6.47; p = 0.81). Knowledge retention was greater following completion of the online intervention when compared with the clinical rotation when controlling for time (difference, 7.6%; 95% CI, 0.7-14.5; p = 0.03). When the online intervention was sequenced before (average knowledge gain, 14.6%; SD, 15.4) rather than after (average knowledge gain, 7.0%; SD, 19.1) the clinical rotation, residents had superior overall knowledge acquisition (difference, 7.6%; 95% CI, 2.01-12.97;p = 0.008). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Performance on case-based, multiple-choice question tests before and after each intervention was used to quantify knowledge gains and knowledge retention. Initial knowledge gains in residents who completed the online intervention (average knowledge gain, 6.9%; SD, 18.2) were noninferior compared with those who completed 1 month of a clinical rotation (average knowledge gain, 6.1%; SD, 18.9; difference, 0.8%; 95% CI, -5.05 to 6.47; p = 0.81). Knowledge retention was greater following completion of the online intervention when compared with the clinical rotation when controlling for time (difference, 7.6%; 95% CI, 0.7-14.5; p = 0.03).

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate residents' retention of menopause-based knowledge immediately after, and 3 months after completion of, self-administered modules that varied by menopause-related topic and delivery format. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate residents' retention of menopause-based knowledge immediately after, and 3 months after completion of, self-administered modules that varied by menopause-related topic and delivery format.Prospective crossover study of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Family Medicine residents at one institution over the 2017 to 2018 academic year. Residents were randomized to a series of three PowerPoints (Microsoft, Redwood, WA), each <30 slides, administered during regularly scheduled didactics. Each series contained three subjects (Menopause Basics [MB], Hormone Therapy [HT], and Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause [GSM]) delivered through three different presentation styles (typical presentation [typical], pictures and a narration [pictures], and interactive to reveal information [interactive]). Knowledge and comfort were assessed through baseline, immediate postexposure, and 3-month follow-up surveys containing 24 knowledge questions (multiple choice) and 10 comfort and satisfaction questions (5-point Likert scale and multiple choice). Statistical tests were applied with P<0.05 considered significant.

Statistical tests were applied with P<0.05 considered significant.Thirty-three residents completed the 3-month follow-up. Immediately postexposure, knowledge and comfort increased from baseline for all topics (P < 0.05). When formats were grouped together to investigate retention by topic, the HT topic demonstrated a sustained increase in knowledge on 3-month follow-up (P = 0.047). The typical format of the GSM topic had significantly better retention than the picture format (P = 0.027). All formats were associated with a significant increase in comfort (all P < 0.01). RESULTS Thirty-three residents completed the 3-month follow-up. Immediately postexposure, knowledge and comfort increased from baseline for all topics (P < 0.05). When formats were grouped together to investigate retention by topic, the HT topic demonstrated a sustained increase in knowledge on 3-month follow-up (P = 0.047). The typical format of the GSM topic had significantly better retention than the picture format (P = 0.027). All formats were associated with a significant increase in comfort (all P < 0.01).Participation in this specialized menopause curriculum led to short-term increases in objectively assessed menopause-related knowledge. Tailoring self-administered learning modules to learning styles did not, however, effectively enhance overall knowledge retention on 3-month follow-up, though comfort in managing menopause remained increased. : Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A474.

BACKGROUND Neonatal healthcare professionals require frequent simulation-based education (SBE) to improve their cognitive, psychomotor and communication skills during neonatal resuscitation. However, current SBE approaches are resource-intensive and not routinely offered in all healthcare facilities. Serious games (board and computer based) may be effective and more accessible alternatives.To review the current literature about serious games, and how these games might improve knowledge retention and skills in neonatal healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVE To review the current literature about serious games, and how these games might improve knowledge retention and skills in neonatal healthcare professionals.Literature searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Web of Science and EMBASE databases were performed to identify studies examining serious games in neonatology. All games, such as board games, tabletop games, video games, screen-based simulators, tabletop simulators and virtual reality games were included. METHOD Literature searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Web of Science and EMBASE databases were performed to identify studies examining serious games in neonatology. All games, such as board games, tabletop games, video games, screen-based simulators, tabletop simulators and virtual reality games were included.Twelve serious games were included in this review (four board games, five video games and three virtual reality games). Overall, knowledge improvement was reported for the RETAIN (REsuscitationTrAINing for healthcare professionals) board game (10% increase in knowledge retention) and The Neonatology Game (4.15 points higher test score compared with control). Serious games are increasingly incorporated into Nursing and Medical School Curriculums to reinforce theoretical and practical learning.

Serious games are increasingly incorporated into Nursing and Medical School Curriculums to reinforce theoretical and practical learning.Serious games have the potential to improve healthcare professionals' knowledge, skills and adherence to the resuscitation algorithm and could enhance access to SBE in resource-intensive and resource-limited areas. Future research should examine important clinical outcomes in newborn infants.

    "Abstract": "Background The interscalene brachial plexus nerve block (ISNB) is a potentially useful method of regional analgesia for humerus fracture and shoulder dislocation reduction in the Emergency Department (ED). We examined the effectiveness of an ISNB workshop given to emergency medicine (EM) residents. We also explored complication rates and effectiveness of ISNBs performed in the ED. Methods One-hour evidence-based ISNB workshops were conducted with EM residents. Participants were given pre-, post-, and 3-month post-workshop knowledge and technical assessments. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. A pre- and post-workshop chart review examined ISNB utilization, complications, post-ISNB opiate administration, and post-ISNB procedural sedation. Results 41 residents enrolled in the workshop. Pre-workshop pass rate: knowledge assessment 22%. Immediate post-workshop pass rates: knowledge assessment 100%, image acquisition 93%, needle placement 100%. Three months post-workshop pass rates: knowledge assessment 73%, image acquisition 76%, needle placement 100%. Areas of poorest knowledge retention were anatomical landmarks, block distribution, and early signs of LAST. In the chart review, 2 ISNBs were performed in the pre-workshop period, and 12 in the post-workshop period. No serious complications were recorded. 78.5% of attempted ISNBs were successful, without need for procedural sedation. Of the 11 successfully performed ISNBs, 91% received no opiates after the procedure. Conclusions Our study suggests that EM residents can learn the ISNB, perform it safely in the emergency department, and that the ISNB may be an alternative to procedural sedation and opiate use for shoulder dislocation. Residents are adept at ISNB technical skills but demonstrate some deficits in knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Computer-based learning (CBL) is considered by many to be an effective means of education. However, features of computer-based modules purported to contribute to learning have not been studied with medical student education. BACKGROUND Computer-based learning (CBL) is considered by many to be an effective means of education. However, features of computer-based modules purported to contribute to learning have not been studied with medical student education.This study was designed to evaluate the effect of auditory supplements in a computer-based instructional module on learning and knowledge retention. OBJECTIVE This study was designed to evaluate the effect of auditory supplements in a computer-based instructional module on learning and knowledge retention.A prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of two types of web-based instructional presentations used to teach key aspects of systems-based practice to fourth-year medical students. DESIGN A prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of two types of web-based instructional presentations used to teach key aspects of systems-based practice to fourth-year medical students.The intervention and control group each received a computer-based module comprised of the same mix of visual and written material, but the intervention group also received an auditory narration of the materials. INTERVENTION The intervention and control group each received a computer-based module comprised of the same mix of visual and written material, but the intervention group also received an auditory narration of the materials.The primary outcome measures were the difference in the students' scores between the two modules using an online 8-item knowledge test completed immediately after the first exposure to the module and again 1 to 7 months later. Students were also asked whether they considered themselves auditory learners. Learning efficiency (the amount of learning per unit time) was calculated for each student and the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare scores between the two groups. MAIN MEASURES The primary outcome measures were the difference in the students' scores between the two modules using an online 8-item knowledge test completed immediately after the first exposure to the module and again 1 to 7 months later. Students were also asked whether they considered themselves auditory learners. Learning efficiency (the amount of learning per unit time) was calculated for each student and the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare scores between the two groups.One hundred thirty fourth-year medical students were randomized by a computer program to one of the two modules. All students completed the first knowledge test and 86 (66%) students completed the second test. Test scores did not differ significantly between the two groups in either the first or the second test. Learning efficiency was lower in the intervention group. Self-identification as auditory learners had no effect on performance. RESULTS One hundred thirty fourth-year medical students were randomized by a computer program to one of the two modules.

Test scores did not differ significantly between the two groups in either the first or the second test. Learning efficiency was lower in the intervention group. Self-identification as auditory learners had no effect on performance.The addition of narration to a computer-based instructional module did not improve learning or knowledge retention even in students who self-identified as auditory learners and resulted in overall lower learning efficiency. CONCLUSIONS The addition of narration to a computer-based instructional module did not improve learning or knowledge retention even in students who self-identified as auditory learners and resulted in overall lower learning efficiency.",

    "Abstract": "Investiga-se como se caracterizam os conhecimentos sobre atividades experimentais no Ensino de Química/Ciências de licenciandos em Química, explicitados durante a participação em uma componente curricular. Analisam-se as produções textuais constituintes de portfólios da componente curricular integrante de um curso de licenciatura em Química de uma instituição pública de educação superior brasileira. O material foi examinado segundo os procedimentos da análise textual discursiva. Entre os resultados, destacam-se: a) conhecimentos relativos à valorização da participação discente durante as atividades experimentais; b) dos conhecimentos discentes concernentes à associação entre atividades experimentais e motivação; c) a explicitação de conhecimentos vinculados à necessidade de considerar, nas atividades experimentais, o respeito à integridade física dos estudantes e ao meio ambiente. Na sequência, analisamse os conhecimentos dos licenciandos com base no referencial progressista de educação de Paulo Freire em diálogo com as categorias estrutura vertical e estrutura horizontal, de Eduardo Nicol. Desta análise depreenderam-se transformações e permanências de conhecimentos dos licenciandos, indicando a apropriação do que foi estudado, como: a possibilidade das atividades experimentais originarem questionamentos, a necessidade de favorecer a explicitação dos conhecimentos iniciais dos alunos e o respeito à integridade física dos estudantes não os submetendo a experimentos perigosos. Por outro lado, foi possível caracterizar a permanência, de forma mais pujante, de um conhecimento inicial sobre as atividades experimentais que as entende com motivadoras. Interpreta-se ainda que as transformações e as permanências de conhecimentos identificadas valorizaram, em alguma medida, a abordagem adotada no estudo sobre atividades experimentais no Ensino de Química/Ciências, na formação inicial de professores de Química. Alternate abstract: How knowledge on lab activities in chemistry teaching is characterized and made explicit in the components of a curriculum is here under examination. The textual productions making up the subject portfolio of a chemistry undergraduate course in a Brazilian higher education institution is analyzed. Discursive textual analysis was used on the corpus. Among the results the following stand out: a) knowledge concerning the valor of student participation in lab activities; b) retention and transformation of the students' perception concerning the association of lab activities and motivation; c) making explicit the need to respect the physical integrity of students and environment in lab activities. Following that, the knowledge of the students is analyzed based on Paulo Freire's progressive education references, as well as on Eduardo Nicol's vertical and horizontal structures' categories. From this analysis, changes and permanencies of knowledge of the undergraduates were inferred, indicating the appropriation of what was studied, such as: the possibility of experimental activities giving rise to questions, the need to favor the explanation of the students' initial knowledge and respect for the physical integrity of the students. subjecting them to dangerous experiments. On the other hand, it was possible to characterize the permanence, more vigorously, of an initial knowledge about experimental activities that understands them as motivating. It is also interpreted that the identified knowledge transformations and permanencies valued, to some extent, the approach adopted in the study of lab activities in chemistry teaching in the initial training of chemistry teachers.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Political unrest in the Middle East heightens the possibility of catastrophe due to violent conflict and/or terrorist attacks. However, the disaster risk reduction strategy in the Saudi health care system appears to be a reactive approach focused more on flood hazards than other threats. Given the current unstable political situation in its neighboring countries and Saudi Arabia’s key role in providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to those affected by internal conflicts and wars, it is essential to develop a framework for training standards related to complex humanitarian disasters to provide the requisite skills and knowledge in a gradual manner, according to local context and international standards. This framework could also support the World Health Organization’s (WHO; Geneva, Switzerland) initiative for establishing a national disaster assistance team in Saudi Arabia. Problem: The main aim of this study is to provide Saudi health care providers with a competencies-based course in Basic Principles of Complex Humanitarian Emergency. Methods: The interactive, competencies-based course in Basic Principles of Complex Humanitarian Emergency was designed by five experts in disaster medicine and humanitarian relief in three stages, accordance to international standards and the local context. The course was piloted over five days at the Officers Club of the Ministry of Interior (MOI; Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). The 33 participants were from different health disciplines of the government sectors in-country. The participants completed the pre- and post-tests and attended three pilot workshops for disaster community awareness. Results: The overall knowledge scores were significantly higher in the post-test (62.9%) than the pre-test (44.2%). There were no significant differences in the pre- and post-knowledge scores for health care providers from the different government health disciplines. A 10-month, post-event survey demonstrated that participants were satisfied with their knowledge retention. Importantly, three of them (16.6%) had the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice in relation to humanitarian aid response. Conclusion: Delivering a competencies-based course in Basic Principles of Complex Humanitarian Emergency for health care providers can help improve their knowledge and skills for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, which is crucial for disaster preparedness augmentation in Saudi Arabia.",

    "Abstract": "Background There has been a worldwide exponential rise in simulation use in health professions education. Most of the evidence about simulation-based education (SBE) comes from Western educational systems. Little is known about simulation use in the education and training of pharmacy students and pharmacists in the Middle Eastern countries. Objective To explore pharmacists' experiences, perceptions and attitudes toward simulation use for learning clinical skills in Kuwait. Setting Different governmental hospitals across the State of Kuwait. Method This was an exploratory descriptive study of pharmacists' perceptions about SBE. A mixed-method research design was employed whereby 110 hospital pharmacists participated in focus groups and completed self-administered surveys. The focus group interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using framework analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to describe characteristics of study participants and survey findings. Main outcome measure Pharmacists' experiences, perceptions and attitudes toward SBE. Results A total of 110 pharmacists participated in the focus groups, of whom 88 completed the survey (80% response rate). The focus groups revealed that pharmacists had different experiences in relation to simulation use which included learning, assessment, and less frequently reported in their training as practitioners. They identified many benefits of simulation such as enhancing knowledge retention and allowing learners practice and rehearse clinical skills in safe environments. Participants' perceived barriers to simulation use in pharmacy students' training included the need for qualified faculty and simulated patients, time constrains to incorporate simulation in faculty teaching and reluctance of learners/educators to use simulation. Most participants expressed positive attitudes toward simulation and welcomed its integration in pharmacy students' learning. In response to survey, 26.1% of pharmacists reported having no prior experience in the use of simulation. The top reported barriers to using simulation for learning were time constrains (22.7%) and the need for qualified faculty (6.8%). Conclusion Pharmacists in Kuwait have diverse experiences regarding simulation use for learning. They expressed positive attitudes toward simulation use for learning clinical skills. Efforts are needed to standardize and expand simulation use in the education and training of pharmacy students, trainees and practitioners to equip them with the clinical skills essential for pharmacy practice.Background There has been a worldwide exponential rise in simulation use in health professions education.

BACKGROUND Addressing themes raised by the Royal College of Anaesthetists National Audit Project 4, we introduced new training programmes to improve the knowledge and skills necessary for the management of airway crises. A further large-scale multimodal training programme was introduced to implement guidelines published in 2015 by the Difficult Airway Society (DAS).In 2014, questionnaires were used to assess the knowledge necessary to manage the unanticipated difficult airway before and after high-fidelity simulation sessions. In 2016, surveys assessed knowledge of new DAS guidelines before and 5 months after the implementation of a large-scale targeted teaching programme to educate staff. METHODS In 2014, questionnaires were used to assess the knowledge necessary to manage the unanticipated difficult airway before and after high-fidelity simulation sessions. In 2016, surveys assessed knowledge of new DAS guidelines before and 5 months after the implementation of a large-scale targeted teaching programme to educate staff.In 2014, 20 anaesthetic teams (75 delegates) attended high-fidelity simulations and demonstrated a significant immediate improvement in knowledge. In 2016, 185 participants attended a targeted teaching programme. Although after the teaching programme an increased number of anaesthetists reported having accessed training, there was a persistent knowledge gap, with some details retained by as few as 15% of participants. RESULTS In 2014, 20 anaesthetic teams (75 delegates) attended high-fidelity simulations and demonstrated a significant immediate improvement in knowledge. In 2016, 185 participants attended a targeted teaching programme. Although after the teaching programme an increased number of anaesthetists reported having accessed training, there was a persistent knowledge gap, with some details retained by as few as 15% of participants.Whereas the knowledge of these important guidelines was improved in the immediate aftermath of high-fidelity simulation training, the knowledge retention was disappointing, raising questions as to why knowledge of highly important techniques used in crises was so poor. We ask whether training should be compulsory and how knowledge retention might be improved across all health care disciplines that rely on guidelines for the effective management of rarely occurring but safety-critical events.

Video discharge education improved patient self-efficacy surrounding discharge medication challenges among general medicine inpatients. Patients and nurses reported satisfaction with the video discharge education.The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of video discharge education to improve self-efficacy in dealing with medication barriers around hospital discharge. We conducted a single-arm intervention feasibility trial to evaluate the use of video education in participants who were being discharged home from the hospital. The scores of pre- and post-intervention self-efficacy involving medication barriers were measured. We also assessed knowledge retention, patient and nursing feedback, follow-up barrier assessments, and hospital revisits. A total of 40 patients participated in this study. Self-efficacy scores ranged from 5 to 25. Median pre- and post-intervention scores were 21.5 and 23.5, respectively. We observed a median increase of 2.0 points from before to after the intervention (p = 0.046). In total, 95 percent of participants reported knowledge retention and 90 percent found the intervention to be helpful.

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of a new ISUOG (International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology) Outreach Teaching and Training Program delivered in Muscat, Oman. BACKGROUND The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of a new ISUOG (International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology) Outreach Teaching and Training Program delivered in Muscat, Oman.Quantitative assessments to evaluate knowledge and practical skills were administered before and after an ultrasound course for sonologists attending the ISUOG Outreach Course, which took place in November, 2017, in Oman. Trainees were selected from each region of the country following a national vetting process conducted by the Oman Ministry of Health. Twenty-eight of the participants were included in the analysis. Pre- and post-training practical and theoretical scores were evaluated and compared. METHODS Quantitative assessments to evaluate knowledge and practical skills were administered before and after an ultrasound course for sonologists attending the ISUOG Outreach Course, which took place in November, 2017, in Oman. Trainees were selected from each region of the country following a national vetting process conducted by the Oman Ministry of Health. Twenty-eight of the participants were included in the analysis. Pre- and post-training practical and theoretical scores were evaluated and compared.Participants achieved statistically significant improvements, on average by 47% (p < 0.001), in both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Specifically, the mean score in the theoretical knowledge test significantly increased from 55.6% (± 14.0%) to 81.6% (± 8.2%), while in the practical test, the mean score increased from 44.6% (± 19.5%) to 65.7% (± 23.0%) (p < 0.001). Performance was improved post-course among 27/28 participants (96.4%) in the theoretical test (range: 14 to 200%) and among 24/28 (85.7%) trainees in the practical skills test (range: 5 to 217%). RESULTS Participants achieved statistically significant improvements, on average by 47% (p < 0.001), in both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

    "Abstract": "Introduction There is currently no protocol for the initiation of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Atlantic Canada. Advanced care paramedics (ACPs) perform advanced cardiac life support in the prehospital setting often completing the entire resuscitation on-scene. Implementation of ECPR will present a novel intervention that is only available at the receiving hospital. Our objective is to determine if an educational program can improve identification of ECPR candidates by paramedics. Establishing paramedic competence will ensure rapid transfer of eligible patients for a potentially life-saving intervention. Methods An educational program was delivered to paramedics including a short seminar and pocket card coupled with simulated OHCA cases. A before-and-after study design using a case-based survey was employed. Paramedics were scored on their ability to correctly identify patients suffering OHCA who met the inclusion criteria for our ECPR protocol. A Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was employed to compare paramedics' scores before and after the education delivery. A six-month follow-up is planned to assess retention. Qualitative data was also collected from paramedics during simulation to help identify practical issues, potential barriers, and to refine inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to the implementation of our protocol in the prehospital setting. Results The median score pre-education was 10 (IQR: 9-10.5) compared to 14 (IQR: 13-15) after education delivery. The median difference between groups was 5. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs test demonstrated a significant improvement in the paramedics' ability to correctly identify ECPR candidates after completing our educational program z = -2.67, p = 0.0039. Conclusion Paramedic training through a didactic session coupled with a pocket card and simulation appeared to be a feasible method of knowledge translation. Six-month follow-up data will help ensure knowledge retention is achieved.Introduction There is currently no protocol for the initiation of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Atlantic Canada.

    "Abstract": "Aim This study evaluated the effects of three-hour instructor-led training courses in the Extended Focused Assessment Sonography for Trauma (EFAST) and Rapid Ultrasound in Shock and Hypotension (RUSH) protocols on knowledge gain and retention by final-year medical students. Methods This prospective study evaluated 79 final year medical students participating in an emergency medicine (EM) clerkship during the 2017-2018 academic year. None of the included students had prior formal ultrasound training or hands-on experience. All students participated in three-hour training courses on the EFAST and RUSH protocols, with training on each protocol involving one hour of didactic training and two hours of practical training. Knowledge improvement was measured by testing before and after each course, and knowledge retention was evaluated on a final clerkship multiple choice question (MCQ) examination. Results Median scores were significantly higher after rather than before both the EFAST (15; range, 12-19 vs. 7; range, 2-18; p < 0.0001) and RUSH (16; range, 6-20 vs. 6; range, 1-13; p < 0.0001) courses. EFAST knowledge was significantly higher than RUSH knowledge before (p = 0.04) but not after (p = 0.82) taking the respective course. The RUSH score was significantly lower than the EFAST score on the final clerkship MCQ examination (p < 0.0001). Conclusions Three hours of instructor-led ultrasound training given during an EM clerkship significantly increased knowledge of both the EFAST and RUSH protocols. Knowledge retention after two weeks was higher for the EFAST than the RUSH protocol. A longer period of RUSH training may improve the retention of knowledge.Aim This study evaluated the effects of three-hour instructor-led training courses in the Extended Focused Assessment Sonography for Trauma (EFAST) and Rapid Ultrasound in Shock and Hypotension (RUSH) protocols on knowledge gain and retention by final-year medical students.

    "Abstract": "As far back as 1995, the Cape Town Declaration on training Africa's future doctor recognized the need for medical schools to adopt active-learning strategies in order to nurture holistic development of the doctor. However, medical education in Africa remains largely stuck with traditional pedagogies that emphasize the 'hard skills' such as knowledge and clinical acumen while doing little to develop 'soft skills' such as effective communication, teamwork, critical thinking or life-long learning skills. By reviewing literature on Africa's epidemiologic and demographic transitions, we establish the need for increasing the output of well-trained doctors in order to match the continent's complex current and future healthcare needs. Challenges that bedevil African medical education such as outdated curricula, limited educational infrastructure and chronic resource constraints are presented and discussed. Furthermore, increased student enrollments, a trend observed at many schools, coupled with chronic faculty shortages have inadvertently presented specific barriers against the success of small-group active-learning strategies such as Problem-Based and Case-Based Learning. We argue that Team-Based Learning (TBL) offers a robust alternative for delivering holistic medical education in the current setting. TBL is instructor-driven and embodies key attributes that foster development of both 'hard' and 'soft' skills. We elaborate on advantages that TBL is likely to bring to the African medical education landscape, including increased learner enthusiasm and creativity, accountability, peer mentorship, deep learning and better knowledge retention. As with all new pedagogical methods, challenges anticipated during initial implementation of TBL are discussed followed by the limited pilot experiences with TBL in Africa.

    "Abstract": "Students in undergraduate premedical anatomy courses may experience suboptimal and superficial learning experiences due to large class sizes, passive lecture styles, and difficult‐to‐master concepts. This study introduces an innovative, hands‐on activity for human musculoskeletal system education with the aim of improving students’ level of engagement and knowledge retention. In this study, a collaborative learning intervention using the REFLECT (augmented reality for learning clinical anatomy) system is presented. The system uses the augmented reality magic mirror paradigm to superimpose anatomical visualizations over the user’s body in a large display, creating the impression that she sees the relevant anatomic illustrations inside her own body. The efficacy of this proposed system was evaluated in a large‐scale controlled study, using a team‐based muscle painting activity among undergraduate premedical students (n = 288) at the Johns Hopkins University. The baseline knowledge and post‐intervention knowledge of the students were measured before and after the painting activity according to their assigned groups in the study. The results from knowledge tests and additional collected data demonstrate that the proposed interactive system enhanced learning of the musculoskeletal system with improved knowledge retention ( F (10,133) = 3.14, P < 0.001), increased time on task ( F (1,275) = 5.70, P < 0.01), and a high level of engagement ( F (9,273) = 8.28, P < 0.0001). The proposed REFLECT system will be of benefit as a complementary anatomy learning tool for students. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "Background Aintree Hospital is an adult tertiary centre providing care to 330,000 patients. There is a paediatric centre of excellence located 4 miles away however, despite its close proximity, acutely unwell children still present to the Emergency Department. We noted that the clinical teams managing these children may not have had recent paediatric training or practical experience, and there was a need to increase knowledge, confidence and team working in managing these challenging cases. Summary of work We distributed a survey to identify 1) training gaps 2) previous issues faced when managing paediatrics in the emergency department and 3) difficult cases clinicians attending wanted to simulate, in order to customise the course and improve knowledge retention¹. We sought advice from the radiology department and paediatric transfer service regarding which facilities are feasible in our location. Finally, we collaborated with the children’s hospital to devise and install a new paediatric trolley in the emergency department, which will be tested during the course. Summary of results The survey revealed: - Equipment and staff training were identified as obstacles hindering optimal management. - 57% of respondents were up to date with APLS. - 28% had managed a paediatric case in the emergency department within the last 3 years, 43% had not been involved in any cases. - 29% of anaesthetists had anaesthetised a child within the last year, 57% within 2 years and 86% within 3 years. One respondent hadn’t anaesthetised a child in over 10 years. - Common themes requested for scenarios included: sepsis, status epilepticus, trauma and cases using very young children/neonates to provide challenging training. Discussion and conclusions With guidance from the survey, we have designed paediatric scenarios that could potentially present to an adult hospital and involve the multidisciplinary emergency team. In order to improve patient safety, scenarios include the use of the paediatric trolley to promote familiarity and identify latent errors for evaluation². It has been important to involve the stakeholders in the design of this course as they have markedly influenced the direction of flow of the simulated cases. We are piloting this course in June 2019 and will collect feedback from delegates attending as well as faculty, which includes our radiology and paediatric transfer service colleagues who are attending to contribute to debrief discussions. We will repeat this course 3 times yearly and modify it based on feedback and new cases that present to our hospital.

    "Abstract": "This study investigated the factors predicting knowledge sharing among architects in architectural firms in Ibadan metropolis, southwestern Nigeria. The study provided insight into the validity of social exchange theory, social capital theory and technological factors for studying and explaining knowledge sharing among professional architects in architectural firms. Survey research design was adopted for the study. A field survey of 104 architects was carried out using a questionnaire for data collection. Convenience and snowball sampling techniques were used to select the respondents for the study. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and multiple regression. Findings revealed that significant predictors of knowledge sharing were enjoyment in helping others, social interaction, social identification, shared language/vision and loss of knowledge power. The level of information and communication technology (ICT) usage was also found to significantly predict knowledge sharing among architects. However, the results indicated that organisational rewards and trust do not significantly predict knowledge sharing among architects. The results also showed that loss of knowledge power negatively affected knowledge sharing, suggesting a tendency to hoard knowledge. Based on these research findings, recommendations were therefore made.",

    "Abstract": "Students in undergraduate premedical anatomy courses may experience suboptimal and superficial learning experiences due to large class sizes, passive lecture styles, and difficult-to-master concepts. This study introduces an innovative, hands-on activity for human musculoskeletal system education with the aim of improving students' level of engagement and knowledge retention. In this study, a collaborative learning intervention using the REFLECT (augmented reality for learning clinical anatomy) system is presented. The system uses the augmented reality magic mirror paradigm to superimpose anatomical visualizations over the user's body in a large display, creating the impression that she sees the relevant anatomic illustrations inside her own body. The efficacy of this proposed system was evaluated in a large-scale controlled study, using a team-based muscle painting activity among undergraduate premedical students (n = 288) at the Johns Hopkins University. The baseline knowledge and post-intervention knowledge of the students were measured before and after the painting activity according to their assigned groups in the study. The results from knowledge tests and additional collected data demonstrate that the proposed interactive system enhanced learning of the musculoskeletal system with improved knowledge retention (F (10,133)  = 3.14, P < 0.001), increased time on task (F (1,275)  = 5.70, P < 0.01), and a high level of engagement (F (9,273)  = 8.28, P < 0.0001).

    "Abstract": "To increase access to voluntary family planning (FP) services, Nigerian policymakers are debating how to task share injectable contraceptive services to drug shop owners known as Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors (PPMVs). Task sharing FP services to drug shops is a promising practice, but information is needed on how to ensure high quality FP services. This analysis assesses the effects of job aids on PPMVs' knowledge of injectable contraceptives 9 months after receiving a standardized training. BACKGROUND To increase access to voluntary family planning (FP) services, Nigerian policymakers are debating how to task share injectable contraceptive services to drug shop owners known as Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors (PPMVs). Task sharing FP services to drug shops is a promising practice, but information is needed on how to ensure high quality FP services. This analysis assesses the effects of job aids on PPMVs' knowledge of injectable contraceptives 9 months after receiving a standardized training.One hundred ninety-four PPMVs were trained on FP counseling and administration of injectable contraceptives in Bauchi, Cross River, Ebonyi and Kaduna states. PPMVs were interviewed before, after, and 9 months after the training. Three variables were used to assess injectable contraceptive knowledge: 1) intramuscular depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM) knowledge: a combination of three questions related to device type, injection location, and reinjection frequency; 2) subcutaneous DMPA (DMPA-SC) knowledge: a combination of the same three questions but for DMPA-SC; and 3) knowledge of at least 4 of the 7 common injectable side effects. Three separate adjusted logistic regression models were conducted to determine the factors that influence PPMV knowledge of injectable contraceptives 9 months after the training. METHODS One hundred ninety-four PPMVs were trained on FP counseling and administration of injectable contraceptives in Bauchi, Cross River, Ebonyi and Kaduna states. PPMVs were interviewed before, after, and 9 months after the training.

Three separate adjusted logistic regression models were conducted to determine the factors that influence PPMV knowledge of injectable contraceptives 9 months after the training.Over half of PPMVs (56%) reported using at least two job aids at 9 months. PPMVs' knowledge of DMPA-IM, DMPA-SC and side effects were low before the training but increased immediately after. Nine months later, knowledge remained higher than pre-test levels but generally reduced compared to posttest levels. PPMVs who reported using at least two FP job aids were 2.6 (95% CI: 1.4-5.1) times more likely to have DMPA-IM knowledge 9 months after the training compared to those who used one or no job aids, while adjusting for PPMV characteristics. Similar results were observed for knowledge of DMPA-SC (AOR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.2-4.6) and side effects (AOR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.3-4.8).

Incorporating proven job aids into routine trainings is a low-cost strategy that can reinforce knowledge and help PPMVs to retain information.

    "Abstract": "Background Novel strategies in medical education including the flipped classroom, test-enhanced learning, and gaming have proven to be effective for preclinical learners but little is known about their efficacy in post-graduate education. We implemented an educational tool in our Infectious Diseases (ID) Fellowship Training program called TACO (To Assess Cognitive Operations) Tuesday that utilizes aspects of the flipped classroom, test-enhanced learning, and gaming to improve ID fellow engagement, satisfaction, knowledge retention, and board examination preparation in association with a weekly ID core didactic curriculum. Methods One to three multiple choice clinical vignettes were emailed to ID fellows the day prior to their weekly didactic lecture. The first fellow to answer all questions correctly was the winner for the week. The correct answer choices along with detailed rationales were distributed to all fellows at the end of the week. After one year of using this educational tool, we surveyed fellows to evaluate its impact on their engagement with the weekly didactic sessions, self-perception of content retention, and sense of preparation for the ID board examination. Results We had a response rate of 82% with 9 of 11 fellows polled participating. Of those, two-thirds attempted to answer the multiple-choice questions prior to lecture and most (77%) reviewed the correct answer choices and rationales weekly. All participants felt the educational tool helped improve their engagement with the lectures and half felt it increased overall satisfaction with their educational experience. The majority felt the tool increased content retention and their level of preparation for the ID board examination. Implementation of this tool was associated with a higher mean IDSA in-training examination score compared with scores from the previous year (518 vs 469). Conclusion ID fellows found that an educational tool utilizing a flipped classroom, test-enhanced learning, and gaming in association with a weekly core didactic curriculum increased their engagement, satisfaction, knowledge retention, and board examination preparation. Future studies will investigate the impact of this tool on knowledge retention and ID board examination scores within our institution as well as across institutions.

    "Abstract": "The utilization of media to improve instructing and learning supplements conventional ways to deal with learning. Viable guidance fabricates between understudies’ information and the learning destinations in mathematics. Through the using of media, it engages students, aids them in knowledge retention, as well as motivates them. This study assessed the extent of instructional media utilization and the academic performance of the Grade 3 pupils in mathematics in a public elementary school, Cebu City, Philippines. The quantitative research method is being used in the study were data gathered through a variety of measurements treated, including the approval letter, parent’s consent, and the respondent’s survey checklist. The study revealed that teachers do not fully utilize the library and the audiovisual room of the school. It was concluded that the academic performance of the pupils are not based on how the teacher utilized the instructional media. The researchers recommend that the proposed enhancement plan be used and monitored.",

    "Abstract": "Anatomical training for regional anaesthesia is critically important, due to the necessity of understanding the course of neurovasculature as well as the layers of tissue needing to be appreciated to enable reliable, effective anaesthesia. There are many training options that do exist, including cadaveric sessions, novel IT solutions in the form of websites and apps for, and, depending on the hospital in which one is based, simulation suites. Unfortunately, once employed as an anaesthetist, very little time is available for furthering anatomical understanding. the following discussion will describe the limitations of current cadaveric training and outline potential ways for ensuring that necessary anatomical understanding can be effectively achieved. It is important to understand that anatomical instruction in medicine arguably can consist of two groupings: undergraduate and post-graduate. Undergraduate anatomical training is meant to cover the entirety of the human body, and as such, the important subtleties of anatomical structures that directly affect clinical practice are not able to be appreciated. the majority of available anatomical training currently caters to undergraduate learners as they form a greater number of people. Post-graduate anatomical training needs to be focussed, more detailed, and directly applicable to clinical practice. the breadth of covering all major structures at a more superficial level as occurs during undergraduate anatomical training, is instead replaced with targeting a deeper level of knowledge that is necessary to fully understand and enhance specialist clinical practice. The current ‘gold standard’ for anatomical training is based on cadaveric inspection. Cadaveric training is expensive, time intensive, and can be limited in its applicability for regional anaesthesia. In addition to the facility costs, and the ability to provide for the precious resources that are cadaveric specimens, cadaveric anatomical training necessitates expert facilitators, a team of technical specialists, and a relatively large amount of uninterrupted time. as such, cadaveric training is limited to irregular occurrences, which is counter-productive for knowledge retention in a discipline such as anatomy that requires a high degree of memorisation. In a typical post-graduate cadaveric laboratory experience for anaesthesia, specialists arrive, review the fundamental anatomy, and, depending on the laboratory, are able to do medical imaging-guided approaches. the benefits to this approach are the access to anatomical and clinical experts and dedicated time to focusing on anatomical fundamentals as needed to further clinical practice. the negatives are a lack of prior focus (which will be described below), variable specimen quality that ultimately does not mimic an in vivo condition, and teaching that can quickly be forgotten as it is given in a large dose of knowledge that limits the ability for deep, long term learning to occur. In sum, cadaveric anatomy is expensive, difficult to arrange time to attend, and gives the learners often more knowledge than can be remembered at one time. With such challenges facing cadaveric anatomy training, what alternative teaching methods could be used instead? Technological solutions focused on web-based and app based electronic learning (E-Learning) have the ability to offer and likely exceed the learning able to be offered in a cadaveric environment for post-graduate learners. Such E-Learning solutions have the greatest benefit in their accessibility. Having expert anatomical knowledge accessible in a timely fashion allows the immediate application of that knowledge. This creates a context of deep learning because knowledge that is used shortly after learning has a greater propensity to be retained. the accessibility of E-Learning also allows repeated viewing of the material at a pace in which the learner isn’t overwhelmed with information, which allows greater understanding of difficult subjects such as anatomy. An interesting aspect of E-Learning is that the learner is in control of what they want and need to learn. This furthers memory retention due to the post-graduate learner being able to simply ‘fill in the gaps’ of their knowledge, or completely revise an area they had forgotten. By having the learner searching for the level of anatomical knowledge that they want also helps to create a scenario where the learner has reflected on what they do know and more importantly what they don’t know, prior to engaging with the E-Learning. There are many cases where learners who go to cadaveric courses do not prepare before entering the lab because the expert trainers act as a safety net to ensure that important material is covered. When the onus is placed on the learner, further contextual links of new anatomical information can be easily created with previously understood anatomy, because the learner is forced to make the contextual links themselves, rather than being given them. This makes for a more active learning process which has repeatedly been shown to improve deeper learning than passive learning, such as listening to an expert trainer. Like all things, E-Learning for post-graduates is not perfect, mainly due to the fact that it is very time consuming to make educational materials, as well as the fact that the level of anatomical information needed by post-graduate anaesthetists generally needs to be created by experts in the area who often do not possess the time to create the material. There are a number of online E-Learning tools that simplify the creation of E-Learning materials, but a greater concerted effort is needed, likely by medical societies who have access to a large number of experts, and therefore can lessen the time constraint on any one individual to make contextually useful anatomy materials for an anaesthetic specialist. In sum, it is possible that cadaveric training can and likely will be replaced by other training methods. Technology enhances accessibility to anatomy and allows deeper learning that is immediately able to be used. However, until there are concerted efforts to make more complete E-Learning anatomical solutions for anaesthetic specialists, it is likely that cadaveric training will remain an important method for post-graduate anaesthetic training.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigated the effects of temporal distribution of practice on the learning and retention of Mandarin tonal word production. Eighty native English‐speaking adults with no prior knowledge of a tonal language participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions varying in intersession interval (ISI) and retention interval (RI): Condition A with a 1‐day ISI and a 1‐week RI, Condition B with a 1‐day ISI and a 4‐week RI, Condition C with a 1‐week ISI and a 1‐week RI, and Condition D with a 1‐week ISI and a 4‐week RI. Participants underwent 3 training sessions followed by a final retention test. Results showed that the effects of ISI and RI differed depending on the type of knowledge to be retained. For the retention of declarative knowledge, RI had a robust effect: the longer the RI, the worse the retention. Compared to shorter spaced practice (1‐day ISI), longer spaced practice (1‐week ISI) seemed to improve long‐term retention (4‐week RI) of declarative knowledge; however, this ISI effect was much weaker. For procedural knowledge retention, ISI played an important role, but not RI, and it was the shorter spaced practice schedule that had an advantage over the longer spaced practice schedule.

    "Abstract": "The following short paper presents the methodology used to create a game-based course (GBC) with Variant: Limits TM . The course used an educational game to make game-based learning the core of instruction in a calculus course to increase student engagement, motivation, knowledge gain and knowledge retention. Variant: Limits, an educational video, focuses on the conceptual understanding of complex calculus concepts. The GBC was a four-week, online course taught at Texas A&M University. While the game was the center of the course design, a game-based learning model was applied to integrate gameplay experience with real-world subject learning. Students were able to maximize the application of the game while learning calculus. At the conclusion of the GBC, the overall results show that students were engaged in the game and course, and gained a deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts presented within Variant: Limits.",

    "Abstract": "Context: Spinal cord injury or disease (SCI/D) leads to unchanged low-density lipoprotein and cholesterol, very low high-density lipoprotein a form of dyslipidemia and physical inactivity which combine to increase risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiometabolic disease. Herein, we describe the selection of structure, process and outcome indicators for adults in the first 18 months post-SCI/D rehabilitation admission. Methods: A Pan-Canadian Cardiometabolic Health Working Group was formed to develop a construct definition. Cardiometabolic risk factors were summarized in a Driver diagram. Release of the Paralyzed Veterans of America \"Identification and Management of Cardiometabolic Risk after Spinal Cord Injury\" and the International Scientific Exercise Guidelines: \"Evidence-based scientific exercise guidelines for adults with spinal cord injury\", informed the group's focus on prevention strategies to advance this Domain of rehabilitation admission. Results: The structure indicator identifies during rehabilitation the presence of appropriate time and resources for physical exercise prescription. Process indicators are lipid profile assessment at rehabilitation admission and documented exercise prescriptions prior to discharge. The outcome indicators track patient's knowledge retention regarding exercise prescription at discharge, current exercise adherence and lipid status 18 months after rehabilitation discharge. Conclusion: Routine national implementation of these indicators at the specified time points will enhance efforts to detect dyslipidemia and assure routine participation in endurance exercise. These indicators align with international initiatives to improve cardiometabolic health through interventions targeting modifiable risk factors specifically endurance exercising and optimal lipid profiles, crucial to augmenting cardiometabolic health after SCI/D.Context: Spinal cord injury or disease (SCI/D) leads to unchanged low-density lipoprotein and cholesterol, very low high-density lipoprotein a form of dyslipidemia and physical inactivity which combine to increase risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiometabolic disease. Herein, we describe the selection of structure, process and outcome indicators for adults in the first 18 months post-SCI/D rehabilitation admission. Methods: A Pan-Canadian Cardiometabolic Health Working Group was formed to develop a construct definition. Cardiometabolic risk factors were summarized in a Driver diagram. Release of the Paralyzed Veterans of America \"Identification and Management of Cardiometabolic Risk after Spinal Cord Injury\" and the International Scientific Exercise Guidelines: \"Evidence-based scientific exercise guidelines for adults with spinal cord injury\", informed the group's focus on prevention strategies to advance this Domain of rehabilitation admission. Results: The structure indicator identifies during rehabilitation the presence of appropriate time and resources for physical exercise prescription. Process indicators are lipid profile assessment at rehabilitation admission and documented exercise prescriptions prior to discharge. The outcome indicators track patient's knowledge retention regarding exercise prescription at discharge, current exercise adherence and lipid status 18 months after rehabilitation discharge. Conclusion: Routine national implementation of these indicators at the specified time points will enhance efforts to detect dyslipidemia and assure routine participation in endurance exercise. These indicators align with international initiatives to improve cardiometabolic health through interventions targeting modifiable risk factors specifically endurance exercising and optimal lipid profiles, crucial to augmenting cardiometabolic health after SCI/D.",

BACKGROUND A diagnosis of cancer, specifically a brain neoplasm, can be daunting and confusing to patients and their family members. It is important to find ways to provide education about diagnosis, symptoms, medications, treatment, and side effects in a usable and retrievable format.The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the following three teaching strategies on patients' knowledge and understanding of their diagnosis. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the following three teaching strategies on patients' knowledge and understanding of their diagnosis.This was a prospective pre-/post-test pilot study including patients who had been diagnosed with brain neoplasms. METHODS This was a prospective pre-/post-test pilot study including patients who had been diagnosed with brain neoplasms.Among 30 patients enrolled during a seven-month period, those who received strategy 3 had higher mean post-test knowledge scores compared to those who received strategy 1 or 2, but the difference was not statistically significant. The results suggest that TEAL-reinforced education is helpful for keeping appointments and may be associated with better knowledge retention regarding disease process and medications. In addition, fewer calls were made to the healthcare team in the strategy 3 group compared to the strategy 1 and 2 groups.

    "Abstract": "Engagement with homework assignments is important to be able to actively process content during in-class activities in flipped classroom education. Active engagement with the content is assumed to promote deeper understanding and to improve retention of knowledge. This comparative case study aims to explore student workload during homework activities and examines in-class activities next to student motivation and their retention of knowledge in both traditional education and flipped classrooms. This quasi-experimental study was conducted in a Hematology and Oncology course, which is scheduled in the second year of medical education, in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Students’ self-reported study time in traditional classrooms (2014) and flipped classrooms (2015) were measured during one course with a daily online questionnaire and in-class activities were explored using an observation scheme and audio recordings. Cognitive evaluation theory was used to investigate student motivation by measuring perceived autonomy and competence (self-efficacy) of students at the end of the course. Knowledge retention and self-efficacy were (again) measured after 10 months. The in-class observations suggested more interactivity in flipped classrooms. All participating students reported similar workload during the course, whereas exam preparation after flipped classrooms was significantly less time consuming. Students in flipped classrooms reported higher scores for self-efficacy, whereas perceived autonomy was comparable to students learning in traditional classrooms. Ten months after the course, retention of knowledge and self-efficacy scores showed no difference. This study indicated that flipped classroom education required less time investment when preparing for the end-of-course exam and students perceived higher self-efficacy, which is relevant in the light of student stress and burn-out. However, comparison of long-term measurements (retention of knowledge and self-efficacy) showed similar outcomes for students in traditional classrooms and flipped classrooms. It would be interesting to learn whether students trained in flipped classroom education turn out to be better problem solvers in their future careers. For example, if the students in this study are better able to handle patient cases during their clinical rotations.

    "Abstract": "Effective communication between gynecologic oncology providers and patients is vital to patient-centered care. Skilled communication improves the patient's knowledge retention, builds trust in providers, enhances shared decision-making, and alleviates anxiety of both patients and caregivers. Effective communication is also associated with reduced provider burnout due to improved comfort from possessing the skills to handle emotionally charged situations. Therefore, training in serious illness communication skills is critically important to gynecologic oncology practice and benefits patients, providers, and the healthcare system. Like surgical skills, communication skills can be learned and improved upon, particularly by making use of communication skills courses and other resources. While the purpose of each conversation will vary based on the medical setting, most communication roadmaps incorporate four basic components: 1) Assess patient knowledge and understanding, 2) inform patient in accordance with her communication preferences, 3) recognize and respond to emotion 4) elicit patient values, and create a plan that aligns with those values. Improved patient outcomes associated with addressing patient emotions underscore a critical need to recognize and address emotional cues during difficult conversations.

    "Abstract": "This study investigated the effects of temporal distribution of practice on the learning and retention of Mandarin tonal word production. Eighty native English‐speaking adults with no prior knowledge of a tonal language participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions varying in intersession interval (ISI) and retention interval (RI): Condition A with a 1‐day ISI and a 1‐week RI, Condition B with a 1‐day ISI and a 4‐week RI, Condition C with a 1‐week ISI and a 1‐week RI, and Condition D with a 1‐week ISI and a 4‐week RI. Participants underwent 3 training sessions followed by a final retention test. Results showed that the effects of ISI and RI differed depending on the type of knowledge to be retained. For the retention of declarative knowledge, RI had a robust effect: the longer the RI, the worse the retention. Compared to shorter spaced practice (1‐day ISI), longer spaced practice (1‐week ISI) seemed to improve long‐term retention (4‐week RI) of declarative knowledge; however, this ISI effect was much weaker. For procedural knowledge retention, ISI played an important role, but not RI, and it was the shorter spaced practice schedule that had an advantage over the longer spaced practice schedule.",

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES Radiology education is suited to delivery via e-learning which may be used to fill gaps in knowledge and help prepare medical students for internship. There is limited evidence of effectiveness of adaptive tutorials, a form of e-learning in a senior medical student cohort.A randomized mixed methods crossover trial was performed to assess effectiveness of adaptive tutorials on engagement and understanding of appropriate use and interpretation of basic imaging studies. Eighty-one volunteer medical students from years 5 and 6 of a 6-year program were randomly allocated to one of two groups. In the first phase of the trial on head CT, one group received access to adaptive tutorials and the other to peer-reviewed web-based resources. A cross over was performed and the second phase of the trial addressing chest CT commenced. Examination style assessments were completed at the end of each phase. At the trial's conclusion, an online questionnaire was provided to evaluate student perceptions of engagement and efficacy of each educational resource.

Students reported higher engagement and overall perceived value of the adaptive tutorials than controls. RESULTS Adaptive tutorial groups in both phases achieved higher mean scores than controls which were statistically significant in the first phase only. Students reported higher engagement and overall perceived value of the adaptive tutorials than controls.Adaptive tutorials are overwhelmingly supported by senior medical students. Questionnaire responses suggest the engaging nature of the tutorials efficiently aids participation and knowledge retention which is in principle supported by test results.

    "Abstract": "A longstanding challenge facing MD-PhD students and other dual-degree medical trainees is the loss of clinical knowledge that occurs during the non medical phases of training. Academic medical institutions nationwide have developed continued clinical training and exposure to maintain clinical competence; however, quantitative assessment of their usefulness remains largely unexplored. The current study therefore sought to both implement and optimize an online game platform to support MD-PhD students throughout their research training. Sixty three current MD-PhD students completing the PhD research phase of training were enrolled in an institutionally-developed online game platform for 2 preliminary and 4 competition rounds of 3-4 weeks each. During preliminary game rounds, we found that participation, though initially high, declined precipitously throughout the duration of each round, with 37 students participating to some extent. Daily reminders were implemented in subsequent rounds, which markedly improved player participation. Average participation in competition rounds exceeded 35% (23/63) active participants each round, with trending improvement in scores throughout the duration of PhD training. Both player participation and progress through the research phase of the MD-PhD program correlated positively with game performance and therefore knowledge retention and/or acquisition. Coupled with positive survey-based feedback from participants, our data therefore suggest that gamification is an effective tool for MD-PhD programs to combat loss of clinical knowledge during research training.A longstanding challenge facing MD-PhD students and other dual-degree medical trainees is the loss of clinical knowledge that occurs during the non medical phases of training.

    "Abstract": "Background: Even though there are diverse varieties of teaching methods to motivate and educate students, not many are used in dental institutions, where most rely only on traditional lectures. Hence, the objective of this study was to compare traditional lectures with newer teaching methods, specifically the flipped classroom and spaced learning method. Materials and Methods: In this prospective cohort study Students were randomized to one of the teaching methods, and their short-term (immediately after teaching) and long-term (i.e., 6 months later) knowledge retention was assessed through multiple choice questions, followed by students feedback which was obtained using Trierer Inventar zur Lehrevaluation questionnaire. P≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: For short-term learning gains, spaced learning group (165.85) showed highest mean scores, followed by the traditional lecture group (163.70) and flipped classroom group (153.25).P value acquired through the Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA was statistically significant (0.003). For long-term knowledge retention, traditional lecture group has highest mean scores (147.50), followed by spaced learning group (146.90) and flipped classroom group (145.05) with no significant difference (P = 0.657). Conclusion: Spaced learning methodology was better than the traditional lecture method and the flipped classroom concerning knowledge gains when measured immediately after the application of learning method. For long-term knowledge retention, both the flipped classroom and spaced learning teaching methods were comparable to the traditional lecture method.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To examine the effects of using different teaching sequences on knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, self‐directed learning and teamwork in a nursing administration project. Background: Compared to other professional courses, nursing administration is relatively difficult, and it is important for nursing administration students to spend long hours working in hospitals. As such, better teaching strategies utilizing proper sequencing may yield better learning outcomes for students. Methods: A longitudinal quasi‐experimental design was used. A total of 129 students were assigned to two groups with which different teaching sequences were used. The investigated learning outcomes were knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, self‐directed learning and teamwork. Generalized estimating equations were used to measure the learning outcomes. Results: There was no significant difference between the two teaching sequences in terms of learning effects. One teaching strategy, problem‐based learning (PBL), yielded effective student learning outcomes. Conclusion: PBL increased the students' self‐directed learning and teamwork. This strategy can be applied to side‐by‐side co‐teaching and post‐graduate year training programmes. Implications for Nursing Management: The results from this study may help hospitals retain nurses and find potential nursing leaders. Instructors and nurse managers should discuss learning goals with students in advance to enhance the students' learning outcomes.

    "Abstract": "Serious games have become increasingly available to educators. Empirical studies and meta-analyses have examined their impact on learning achievement. However, natural sciences could have a special relation to serious games by their systematic use of quantitative and predictive models that can generate microworlds and simulations. Since no known meta-analysis on serious games observed a significant impact in the specific context of science learning, the present meta-analysis synthesised results from 79 empirical studies that compared the impact on science learning achievement of instruction using serious games versus instruction using more conventional methods. Consistent with theory and past meta-analyses not specifically related to science learning, post-instruction learning achievement was weakly to moderately higher for declarative knowledge, knowledge retention and procedural knowledge for students taught with serious games. Furthermore, findings of the present work suggest that five moderator variables produced significant effects on the relationship between playing serious games and learning outcomes, and three showed consistent variations in mean effect size that could lead to significance, with more studies and larger samples. These findings are discussed in connection with previous meta-analyses’ findings, potential pedagogical implications and possible future research.",

    "Abstract": "Entrepreneurship education is on rise across the globe with countries promoting its importance in connection to local, national and economic development. The UK entrepreneurship education policy highlights and draws out categories of learning 'About', For,' and 'Through' entrepreneurship (QAA, 2018). Over the years many teaching strategies have been adopted and adapted for purposes of context around these categories, however, further enhancements are necessary to reflect the changing needs of the learners. Learning 'About' entrepreneurship places a focus on theoretical underpinnings and therefore, can be demanding in terms of content and challenging in terms of knowledge retention and student engagement. This paper focuses on the 'About' element, in the view of combining two pedagogies 'Flipped Classroom' and 'Jigsaw Strategy' and to coin and advocate 'flipping the jigsaw' pedagogy. The philosophy behind the technique is to maximise on time, space, and importantly content, whilst keeping students engaged. The study is based on first year BA Enterprise and Entrepreneurship students at Coventry University. The findings have yielded some interesting outcomes such as heightened subject understanding and retention of knowledge and student engagement. With student survey showing the module to be 'intellectually stimulating and engaging' an increase from 70% to 86% in one academic year.",

    "Abstract": "Employee departure, promotion, transfer, or retirement puts organizations at risk of losing critical knowledge. This loss can be mitigated through activities that identify critical knowledge and construct a plan for its transfer from incumbent employees to their successors. Consequently, organizations need to develop and implement a comprehensive knowledge continuity management (KCM) strategy.Although KCM frameworks exist, they are highly domain and context specific, being developed for a certain work environment. This makes them difficult to generalize to other environments. Moreover, they have divergent terminology, stages, and activities, making it challenging to establish practical guidelines and organizational strategies using more than one approach. The purpose of this study is to methodologically construct a comprehensive KCM framework built with stages and associated activities of well-established frameworks. This paper presents a summarized review of twelve theoretical frameworks from three related areas of research: human capital management, succession planning, and knowledge management (KCM, knowledge loss, knowledge retention). Commonalities in stages and activities are discussed, based on content, narrative, and thematic analyses. The findings point to five thematic similarities: 1) conducting a knowledge audit; 2) establishing the KCM objectives and scope, and assigning responsibilities; 3) planning the KCM implementation and conducting a pilot; 4) performing the knowledge transfer; and 5) integrating the KCM into the organizational culture and establishing support programs. These themes constitute the basis of sequencing stages and assigning corresponding activities in a proposed KCM framework.",

    "Abstract": "The hospitality industry is a business area characterized by high rates of turnover related to the seasonality and precariousness of the activity. Therefore, practitioners and researchers in hospitality have focused on the development of practices preventing employees leaving a job. Recent literature had discussed the importance of implementing knowledge management practices in order to retain talent in hospitality and, also, to share employees' knowledge inside an organisation characterized by significant intangible assets. The main objective of the study is to explore how knowledge management is implemented in the hospitality industry. More specifically, we aim to characterize the talent retention practices, to comprehend how knowledge management is used to decrease the staff turnover in hospitality, and to understand the main challenges to knowledge management in this kind of business. In order to answer to our objectives a qualitative study was conducted. 10 hotel managers, of both genders, with a mean age of 46 years (SD=7.98) participated in the study. All the participants completed a demographic questionnaire and a semi-structured interview was conducted in order to answer the research question \"how knowledge management is used to decrease staff turnover in the hospitality industry?\" The interviews were transcribed verbatim and data analysed according to thematic analysis procedures. The preliminary results showed that hotel managers value the knowledge retention inside the organisation. The implementation of practices of knowledge management is one of the main objectives in these organisations. Staff turnover is comprehended has one of the main problems in this business area and increases the loss of important knowledge acquired by employees. Thus, it can be concluded that knowledge management is a very important issue in the hospitality business; namely to increase employees' knowledge retention. Additionally, it is crucial to implement more strategies in order to increase talent retention and decrease staff turnover rates. In this paper, we discuss the main practical and theoretical implications, and offer some suggestions for further studies.",

    "Abstract": "Major cities and agglomerations are the innovation leaders throughout the globe. High population density and migration influx, clusters of related industries, intensive inter-regional and international networking favour the development of outstanding territorial capital. By attracting talents, entrepreneurs, and capital, coupled with advanced public infrastructure and infinite labour market urban agglomerations intensify regional divergence between and within regions. Cohesion policies are designed to overcome the effects of this unequal competition by supporting industries and the social sector of the peripheral territories. The gap that largely remains irretrievable is the loss of knowledge holders - from an individual to an excellence cluster. Knowledge is the major resource of local, regional, and national competitiveness. Regional innovation systems require a constant influx of new knowledge, while the regional innovation security argues for the most critical knowledge to be generated on spot. This paper aims to present the geography of knowledge in Russia by evaluating the bibliometric data for 997 cities (and 1 rural settlement) and 83 regions across the country for a period of 2013-2017. Tacit knowledge and impalpable innovations - the competencies, know-how, expertise, are hard to trace using common statistics. The methodology based on modern scientometrics and big data analysis offers an approach to capture some of the knowledge capital available in a certain locality and analyse innovation dynamics of urban settlements. Research results suggest there is a strong path-dependency in the Russian knowledge domain that heavily relies on the Soviet legacy and geospatial factors. Often neglected or perceived as a source of input to the knowledge-generating nucleus, peripheral areas are well integrated in value co-creation within the hub-and-spoke cooperation pattern.

    "Abstract": "Language attrition has become a vibrant theme as it has implications for theoretical linguistics, including, for example, the organization of linguistic information in the brain and language processing. Insights from this area also have an impact on the study of second language (L2) development and can feed the area of language teaching. Once language attrition may be valuable for the study of language retention and maintenance, it can contribute to language teaching with long lasting results, more effective planning and syllabus design. In this perspective, as studies exploring L2 attrition are still limited, this article1 provides a synthesis of research on the area. By drawing from the Dynamic Model of Multilingualism and from the hreshold Hypothesis, it also explores the implications L2 attrition research has for language teaching with a view to establishing more informed language practices and policies.",

    "Abstract": "Medical programs are under pressure to maintain currency with scientific and technical advances, as well as prepare graduates for clinical work and a wide range of postgraduate careers. The value of the basic sciences in primary medical education was assessed by exploring the perceived clinical relevance and test performance trends among medical students, interns, residents, and experienced clinicians. A pilot study conducted in 2014 involved administration of a voluntary 60-item multiple-choice question test to 225 medical students and 4 interns. These participants and 26 teaching clinicians rated the items for clinical relevance. In 2016, a similarly constructed test (main study) was made a mandatory formative assessment, attempted by 563 students in years 2, 4, and 6 and by 120 commencing general practice residents. Test scores, performance trends, clinical relevance ratings, and correlations were assessed using relevant parametric and nonparametric tests. Rank order and pass-fail decisions were also reviewed. The mean test scores were 57% (SD 7.1) and 52% (SD 6.1) for the pilot and main studies, respectively. Highest scores were observed in pathology and social sciences. Overall performance increased with increasing year of study. Test scores were positively correlated with perceived relevance. There were moderate correlations (r = 0.50–0.63; P < 0.001) between participants' scores in the basic science and summative exams. Assessments may be key to fostering relevance and integration of the basic sciences. Benchmarking knowledge retention and result comparisons across topics are useful in program evaluation.",

    "Abstract": "Entrepreneurship education is on rise across the globe with countries promoting its importance in connection to local, national and economic development. The UK entrepreneurship education policy highlights and draws out categories of learning 'About', For,' and 'Through' entrepreneurship (QAA, 2018). Over the years many teaching strategies have been adopted and adapted for purposes of context around these categories, however, further enhancements are necessary to reflect the changing needs of the learners. Learning 'About' entrepreneurship places a focus on theoretical underpinnings and therefore, can be demanding in terms of content and challenging in terms of knowledge retention and student engagement. This paper focuses on the 'About' element, in the view of combining two pedagogies 'Flipped Classroom' and 'Jigsaw Strategy' and to coin and advocate 'flipping the jigsaw' pedagogy. The philosophy behind the technique is to maximise on time, space, and importantly content, whilst keeping students engaged. The study is based on first year BA Enterprise and Entrepreneurship students at Coventry University. The findings have yielded some interesting outcomes such as heightened subject understanding and retention of knowledge and student engagement. With student survey showing the module to be 'intellectually stimulating and engaging' an increase from 70% to 86% in one academic year.",

BACKGROUND Even though there are diverse varieties of teaching methods to motivate and educate students, not many are used in dental institutions, where most rely only on traditional lectures. Hence, the objective of this study was to compare traditional lectures with newer teaching methods, specifically the flipped classroom and spaced learning method.In this prospective cohort study Students were randomized to one of the teaching methods, and their short-term (immediately after teaching) and long-term (i.e., 6 months later) knowledge retention was assessed through multiple choice questions, followed by students feedback which was obtained using Trierer Inventar zur Lehrevaluation questionnaire. P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this prospective cohort study Students were randomized to one of the teaching methods, and their short-term (immediately after teaching) and long-term (i.e., 6 months later) knowledge retention was assessed through multiple choice questions, followed by students feedback which was obtained using Trierer Inventar zur Lehrevaluation questionnaire. P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.For short-term learning gains, spaced learning group (165.85) showed highest mean scores, followed by the traditional lecture group (163.70) and flipped classroom group (153.25). P value acquired through the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was statistically significant (0.003). For long-term knowledge retention, traditional lecture group has highest mean scores (147.50), followed by spaced learning group (146.90) and flipped classroom group (145.05) with no significant difference ( P = 0.657).

    "Abstract": "Aim Both simulation and the flipped‐classroom improve learning outcomes in medical education, with evidence emerging that they are effective in combination (‘flipped‐simulation’). Previous studies evaluating simulation in paediatrics have assessed efficacy for senior students. This study aimed to assess whether using flipped‐simulation in early‐phase medical student education would show similar benefits. Methods A flipped‐simulation session was introduced into the earliest phase of the University of New South Wales Sydney's undergraduate medical program. A pre‐test‐post‐test study design was used to assess short‐term knowledge gains with an eight‐item quiz administered before and after students attended the session. A retrospective cohort design was used to assess long‐term knowledge retention, with student scores from a 10‐item quiz administered at the second‐phase paediatric course orientation, compared between a group that completed the flipped‐simulation course and a group that attended an alternative play‐based session. Additional survey data regarding student satisfaction were gathered. Results Students demonstrated short‐term knowledge gains: mean test scores improved from the pre‐test to post‐test (3.4 ± 1.5 vs. 6.0 ± 1.3, P  < 0.001). Students attending the flipped‐simulation course retained knowledge more effectively in the longer term: mean test scores of students who completed the flipped‐simulation session were significantly higher than those who attended the alternative play‐based session (4.4 ± 1.9 vs. 3.4 ± 1.8, P  < 0.001). Survey data demonstrated high student confidence in practical skills.

    "Abstract": "Aim To examine the effects of using different teaching sequences on knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, self‐directed learning and teamwork in a nursing administration project. Background Compared to other professional courses, nursing administration is relatively difficult, and it is important for nursing administration students to spend long hours working in hospitals. As such, better teaching strategies utilizing proper sequencing may yield better learning outcomes for students. Methods A longitudinal quasi‐experimental design was used. A total of 129 students were assigned to two groups with which different teaching sequences were used. The investigated learning outcomes were knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, self‐directed learning and teamwork. Generalized estimating equations were used to measure the learning outcomes. Results There was no significant difference between the two teaching sequences in terms of learning effects. One teaching strategy, problem‐based learning (PBL), yielded effective student learning outcomes. Conclusion PBL increased the students' self‐directed learning and teamwork. This strategy can be applied to side‐by‐side co‐teaching and post‐graduate year training programmes. Implications for Nursing Management The results from this study may help hospitals retain nurses and find potential nursing leaders. Instructors and nurse managers should discuss learning goals with students in advance to enhance the students' learning outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG Indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLC) often use natural resources as both a reason and mechanism for environmental management, yet a number of environmental, social, and economic drivers disrupt this relationship. Here, we argue that these drivers can also trigger a set of feedback mechanisms that further diminish the efficacy of local management. We call this process biocultural hysteresis. These feedbacks, which include knowledge loss and a breakdown of social hierarchies, prevent IPLC from adapting their management to change. Biocultural hysteresis worsens as IPLC spend an increasing amount of time outside their social–ecological context. Therefore, we argue for adaptive policies and processes that favour protecting and enabling IPLC engagement with their environment.",

The value of the basic sciences in primary medical education was assessed by exploring the perceived clinical relevance and test performance trends among medical students, interns, residents, and experienced clinicians. A pilot study conducted in 2014 involved administration of a voluntary 60-item multiple-choice question test to 225 medical students and 4 interns. These participants and 26 teaching clinicians rated the items for clinical relevance. In 2016, a similarly constructed test (main study) was made a mandatory formative assessment, attempted by 563 students in years 2 , 4 , and 6 and by 120 commencing general practice residents. Test scores, performance trends, clinical relevance ratings, and correlations were assessed using relevant parametric and nonparametric tests. Rank order and pass-fail decisions were also reviewed. The mean test scores were 57% (SD 7.1) and 52% (SD 6.1) for the pilot and main studies, respectively. Highest scores were observed in pathology and social sciences. Overall performance increased with increasing year of study. Test scores were positively correlated with perceived relevance. There were moderate correlations ( r  = 0.50-0.63; P < 0.001) between participants' scores in the basic science and summative exams.

    "Abstract": "Purpose Although still under-researched and characterized by a fragmented understanding, unlearning and forgetting have recently received increased scholarly attention. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to survey and evaluate key works in the field of organizational unlearning and forgetting. Through analyzing and synthesizing common themes, this paper aims to highlight research gaps and avenues for future research. Design/methodology/approach This paper follows a systematic approach of identifying, analyzing and synthesizing pertinent literature in the field of organizational unlearning and forgetting. In total, 63 works were thoroughly reviewed. Findings This paper highlights different levels and scopes, as well as antecedents and consequences of organizational unlearning and forgetting. Even though unlearning and forgetting has gained increased attention, researchers still need to provide robust conceptual and empirical evidence to advance the field. Originality/value By structuring the analysis and synthesis around various constructs, theories, typologies and related themes, this paper outlines several research gaps and proposes avenues for further research.

    "Abstract": "To examine the effects of using different teaching sequences on knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, self-directed learning and teamwork in a nursing administration project. AIM To examine the effects of using different teaching sequences on knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, self-directed learning and teamwork in a nursing administration project.Compared to other professional courses, nursing administration is relatively difficult, and it is important for nursing administration students to spend long hours working in hospitals. As such, better teaching strategies utilizing proper sequencing may yield better learning outcomes for students. BACKGROUND Compared to other professional courses, nursing administration is relatively difficult, and it is important for nursing administration students to spend long hours working in hospitals. As such, better teaching strategies utilizing proper sequencing may yield better learning outcomes for students.A longitudinal quasi-experimental design was used. A total of 129 students were assigned to two groups with which different teaching sequences were used. The investigated learning outcomes were knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, self-directed learning and teamwork. Generalized estimating equations were used to measure the learning outcomes. METHODS A longitudinal quasi-experimental design was used. A total of 129 students were assigned to two groups with which different teaching sequences were used. The investigated learning outcomes were knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, self-directed learning and teamwork. Generalized estimating equations were used to measure the learning outcomes.There was no significant difference between the two teaching sequences in terms of learning effects. One teaching strategy, problem-based learning (PBL), yielded effective student learning outcomes. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the two teaching sequences in terms of learning effects. One teaching strategy, problem-based learning (PBL), yielded effective student learning outcomes.PBL increased the students' self-directed learning and teamwork. This strategy can be applied to side-by-side co-teaching and post-graduate year training programmes. CONCLUSION PBL increased the students' self-directed learning and teamwork. This strategy can be applied to side-by-side co-teaching and post-graduate year training programmes.The results from this study may help hospitals retain nurses and find potential nursing leaders. Instructors and nurse managers should discuss learning goals with students in advance to enhance the students' learning outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT The results from this study may help hospitals retain nurses and find potential nursing leaders. Instructors and nurse managers should discuss learning goals with students in advance to enhance the students' learning outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLC) often use natural resources as both a reason and mechanism for environmental management, yet a number of environmental, social, and economic drivers disrupt this relationship. Here, we argue that these drivers can also trigger a set of feedback mechanisms that further diminish the efficacy of local management. We call this process biocultural hysteresis. These feedbacks, which include knowledge loss and a breakdown of social hierarchies, prevent IPLC from adapting their management to change. Biocultural hysteresis worsens as IPLC spend an increasing amount of time outside their social-ecological context. Therefore, we argue for adaptive policies and processes that favour protecting and enabling IPLC engagement with their environment.Indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLC) often use natural resources as both a reason and mechanism for environmental management, yet a number of environmental, social, and economic drivers disrupt this relationship.

    "Abstract": "Achieving learner engagement in the teaching and learning process is paramount towards ensuring knowledge retention in QBASIC programming. This study focuses on effects of b-learning and face-to-face (F2F) on college students’ engagement and retention in QBASIC programming. The study adopted quasi-experimental design with non-equivalent group research design. QBASIC Programming Achievement Test (QBPAT) and College Students’ Engagement Questionnaire (CSEQ) were instruments used for data collection. Results showed that the treatment groups’ retention mean score was significantly higher than the control group. Findings further showed that b-learning facilitated college students’ engagement and improved knowledge retention in QBASIC programming compared to their counterparts in the F2F group. It was recommended that faculty members should adopt innovative teaching pedagogies such as b-learning to promote students’ engagement and retention in the learning process.",

AIM Both simulation and the flipped-classroom improve learning outcomes in medical education, with evidence emerging that they are effective in combination ('flipped-simulation'). Previous studies evaluating simulation in paediatrics have assessed efficacy for senior students. This study aimed to assess whether using flipped-simulation in early-phase medical student education would show similar benefits.A flipped-simulation session was introduced into the earliest phase of the University of New South Wales Sydney's undergraduate medical program. A pre-test-post-test study design was used to assess short-term knowledge gains with an eight-item quiz administered before and after students attended the session. A retrospective cohort design was used to assess long-term knowledge retention, with student scores from a 10-item quiz administered at the second-phase paediatric course orientation, compared between a group that completed the flipped-simulation course and a group that attended an alternative play-based session. Additional survey data regarding student satisfaction were gathered.

Additional survey data regarding student satisfaction were gathered.Students demonstrated short-term knowledge gains: mean test scores improved from the pre-test to post-test (3.4 ± 1.5 vs. 6.0 ± 1.3, P < 0.001). Students attending the flipped-simulation course retained knowledge more effectively in the longer term: mean test scores of students who completed the flipped-simulation session were significantly higher than those who attended the alternative play-based session (4.4 ± 1.9 vs. 3.4 ± 1.8, P < 0.001). Survey data demonstrated high student confidence in practical skills.

    "Abstract": "Many studies have shown that repetition of study material with temporal gaps between the repetitions (i.e., spaced in time) is more effective for long-term retention than are repetitions in immediate succession (i.e., massed; Greene, 1989). Although this spacing effect has proven to be robust in the laboratory (Cepeda, Pashler, Vul, Wixted, & Rohrer, 2006), its status in the real world is relatively understudied. Other research has demonstrated the benefit of memory retrieval on subsequent retrieval of the same information (Bjork, 1975, 1988; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006), referred to as the testing effect . However, it is not clear how spacing and retrieval can be optimally combined in order to enhance knowledge retention in a real-world setting. To investigate this question, we analyzed longitudinal data from 10,514 individuals, collected in the context of naturally occurring workplace training. To determine the impact of spaced retrieval on knowledge retention, these data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model with the following fixed factors: (1) spacing interval between repetitions of content training (retrieval practice), (2) retention interval, and (3) question format. Random factors included the specific content on which employees were trained, which was clustered by employee and, in turn, by company, resulting in a three-level hierarchy. The results showed a significant interaction between spacing interval and retention interval: the optimal amount of spacing between repeated retrieval events increased as the retention interval increased. These findings are in line with the results of laboratory studies, demonstrating the relevance and transferability of laboratory-based research to real-world contexts.

Most deaths are avertable with access to quality care. Saving Children's Lives (SCL) includes an abbreviated high-intensity training (SCL-aHIT) for providers who treat serious childhood illnesses. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of SCL-aHIT on knowledge acquisition and retention of providers.76 participating centres who provide primary and secondary care in Kweneng District, Botswana. SETTING 76 participating centres who provide primary and secondary care in Kweneng District, Botswana.Doctors and nurses expected by the District Health Management Team to provide initial care to seriously ill children, completed SCL-aHIT between January 2014 and December 2016, submitted demographic data, course characteristics and at least one knowledge assessment. PARTICIPANTS Doctors and nurses expected by the District Health Management Team to provide initial care to seriously ill children, completed SCL-aHIT between January 2014 and December 2016, submitted demographic data, course characteristics and at least one knowledge assessment.Retrospective, cohort study. Planned and actual primary outcome was adjusted acquisition (change in total knowledge score immediately after training) and retention (change in score at 1, 3 and 6 months), secondary outcomes were pneumonia and dehydration subscores. Descriptive statistics and linear mixed models with random intercept and slope were conducted. Relevant institutional review boards approved this study. METHODS Retrospective, cohort study. Planned and actual primary outcome was adjusted acquisition (change in total knowledge score immediately after training) and retention (change in score at 1, 3 and 6 months), secondary outcomes were pneumonia and dehydration subscores. Descriptive statistics and linear mixed models with random intercept and slope were conducted. Relevant institutional review boards approved this study.211 providers had data for analysis. Cohort was 91% nurses, 61% clinic/health postbased and 45% pretrained in Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). A strong effect of SCL-aHIT was seen with knowledge acquisition (+24.56±1.94, p<0.0001), and loss of retention was observed (-1.60±0.67/month, p=0.018). IMCI training demonstrated no significant effect on acquisition (+3.58±2.84, p=0.211 or retention (+0.20±0.91/month, p=0.824) of knowledge. On average, nurses scored lower than physicians (-19.39±3.30, p<0.0001). Lost to follow-up had a significant impact on knowledge retention (-3.03±0.88/month, p=0.0007).

This article will provide a brief introduction to the concepts of short-term and long-term memory, and explain how micro-learning can be used to increase retention in learners.

This process also speeds up the learning process overall because students avoid the phenomenon of mental fatigue. The article cites studies suggesting mental fatigue can cause serious cognitive decline in individual performance. By breaking complex courses into manageable smaller lessons, micro-learning preserves the neurotransmitter cascade for steady neurochemical performance. By using mobile devices, students can pause and continue their micro-lessons with ease.

    "Abstract": "Objective. To optimize student pharmacists' long-term retention of brand and generic drug names through spacing and modification of quiz format. Methods. In three experiments, student pharmacists learned brand and generic names for the Top 200 medications taught in a self-paced course. The students completed two spaced quizzes on the course content, a final examination, and a measure of long-term retention administered several weeks after the course was completed. Experiment 1 examined the spacing of quiz 2 relative to quiz 1 and the final examination. Experiment 2 examined whether providing hints such as giving the first 3 letters of the paired associate impacted learning. Experiment 3 examined whether providing more elaborate context improved student retention. Results. When quiz 2 was administered closer to quiz 1 but further from the final examination (expanding practice), students' long-term knowledge retention was greatest. When the first three letters of the paired associate were provided, students' long-term retention decreased. When more elaborative context was provided within the quizzes, students' long-term retention was unaffected despite higher final examination performance. Conclusion. Making retrieval of concepts easier reduces pharmacy students' long-term knowledge retention, albeit only a small effect was seen in this study.

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The aim of this study was to determine if school personnel can understand and apply the Sort, Assess, Life-saving interventions, Treat/Transport (SALT) triage methods after a brief training. The investigators predicted that subjects can learn to triage with accuracy similar to that of medically trained personnel, and that subjects can pass an objective-structured clinical exam (OSCE) evaluating hemorrhage control. Methods: School personnel were eligible to participate in this prospective observational study. Investigators recorded subject demographic information and prior medical experience. Participants received a 30-minute lecture on SALT triage and a brief lecture and demonstration of hemorrhage control and tourniquet application. A test with brief descriptions of mass-casualty victims was administered immediately after training. Participants independently categorized the victims as dead, expectant, immediate, delayed, or minimal. They also completed an OSCE to evaluate hemorrhage control and tourniquet application using a mannequin arm. Results: Subjects from two schools completed the study. Fifty-nine were from a private school that enrolls early childhood through grade eight, and 45 from a public school that enrolls grades seven and eight (n = 104). The average subject age was 45 years and 68% were female. Approximately 81% were teachers and 87% had prior cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training. Overall triage accuracy was 79.2% (SD = 10.7%). Ninety-six (92.3%) of the subjects passed the hemorrhage control OSCE. Conclusions: After two brief lectures and a short demonstration, school personnel were able to triage descriptions of mass-casualty victims with an overall accuracy similar to medically trained personnel, and most were able to apply a tourniquet correctly. Opportunities for future study include integrating high-fidelity simulation and mock disasters, evaluating for knowledge retention, and exploring the study population’s baseline knowledge of medical care, among others.",

    "Abstract": "Expanding frontiers of knowledge have prompted medical schools to reconsider how best to promote learning in the face of information overload. Concept mapping (CM) promotes knowledge retention and integration. Students have perceived CM positively in prior studies, but the feasibility and utility of integrating CM into a medical student oncology curriculum as a learning and assessment tool have not been described. At the University of California, San Francisco, 152 medical students in a second-year hematology/oncology course produced concept maps about a single cancer type over 4 weeks. We collected student evaluations about CM. Two of three graders independently scored each map using a standard rubric. We compared CM scores with USMLE Step 1 scores and clerkship grades using regression. All students produced a concept map. Student perception was mixed, and students provided feedback to improve CM utility as a learning tool. Grading was feasible, and inter-rater reliability was high. CM scores did not predict USMLE Step 1 scores or clerkship grades. CM was feasible as a learning tool, and we present strategies based on student feedback and literature review to improve utility. CM was feasible and reliable as an assessment tool; additional validity evidence may improve utility. Future studies should explore whether CM integrated into medical student oncology curricula early, serially, and collaboratively, with iterative practice and feedback, may predict meaningful learning and performance outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a diagnostic workshop on undergraduate teaching‐learning process for the diagnosis and management of tooth restorations. Methods The first stage of the study was a randomised controlled study with two parallel groups: lecture (L) and lecture coupled with a diagnostic workshop (LW). A pool of cases of tooth restorations including secondary caries and marginal defects was used for training. Theoretical knowledge, perception about the activity and practical abilities were evaluated. The second stage of the study assessed students’ theoretical knowledge retention six months following intervention. All students included in the first stage of the study were exposed to LW. Hence, a new control group of students not exposed to LW was selected. One‐way analysis of variance, Fisher's exact test, Kruskal‐Wallis test and multilevel regression analysis were used as part of statistical analysis. Results The LW group had greater scores for the assignment of lesion severity and activity, presence of marginal defect and treatment indication than the L group ( P  < 0.05). Multilevel regression analysis showed a positive impact of the workshop diagnosis in the correct assessment of lesion activity ( P  = 0.03). There was no statistical difference between the LW and L groups in students’ perception of the activity. The LW group showed greater knowledge retention after six months than the L group ( P  = 0.027). Conclusion Lecture coupled with diagnostic workshop improved students’ practical skills of diagnosis restorations and knowledge retention in the six months following intervention.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a diagnostic workshop on undergraduate teaching-learning process for the diagnosis and management of tooth restorations. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a diagnostic workshop on undergraduate teaching-learning process for the diagnosis and management of tooth restorations.The first stage of the study was a randomised controlled study with two parallel groups: lecture (L) and lecture coupled with a diagnostic workshop (LW). A pool of cases of tooth restorations including secondary caries and marginal defects was used for training. Theoretical knowledge, perception about the activity and practical abilities were evaluated. The second stage of the study assessed students' theoretical knowledge retention six months following intervention. All students included in the first stage of the study were exposed to LW. Hence, a new control group of students not exposed to LW was selected. One-way analysis of variance, Fisher's exact test, Kruskal-Wallis test and multilevel regression analysis were used as part of statistical analysis.

    "Abstract": "Many studies have shown that repetition of study material with temporal gaps between the repetitions (i.e., spaced in time) is more effective for long-term retention than are repetitions in immediate succession (i.e., massed; Greene, 1989). Although this spacing effect has proven to be robust in the laboratory (Cepeda, Pashler, Vul, Wixted, & Rohrer, 2006), its status in the real world is relatively understudied. Other research has demonstrated the benefit of memory retrieval on subsequent retrieval of the same information (Bjork, 1975, 1988; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006), referred to as the testing effect. However, it is not clear how spacing and retrieval can be optimally combined in order to enhance knowledge retention in a real-world setting. To investigate this question, we analyzed longitudinal data from 10,514 individuals, collected in the context of naturally occurring workplace training. To determine the impact of spaced retrieval on knowledge retention, these data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model with the following fixed factors: (1) spacing interval between repetitions of content training (retrieval practice), (2) retention interval, and (3) question format. Random factors included the specific content on which employees were trained, which was clustered by employee and, in turn, by company, resulting in a three-level hierarchy. The results showed a significant interaction between spacing interval and retention interval: the optimal amount of spacing between repeated retrieval events increased as the retention interval increased. These findings are in line with the results of laboratory studies, demonstrating the relevance and transferability of laboratory-based research to real-world contexts.Many studies have shown that repetition of study material with temporal gaps between the repetitions (i.e., spaced in time) is more effective for long-term retention than are repetitions in immediate succession (i.e., massed; Greene, 1989).

    "Abstract": "This Work in Progress paper describes the active learning techniques adapted in a first-year interdisciplinary engineering course at a research university in the southeast region. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a combined learner-centered pedagogical model: the flipped classroom model and the Jigsaw strategy (flipped Jigsaw), called “Flip-J”. Implementation of an active learning strategy such as this Flip-J technique allows for both acquisition of knowledge and applied learning pursuit that is focused on application, evaluation, analysis and synthesis of pertinent information. Freshmen-engineering students participate in a team-based design project curriculum in sections of up to 90 students with additional coursework for professional development. Students primarily learn about the engineering design process, including a variety of technical and professional skills on topics like computer aided design (CAD), 3D printing to memo writing and oral presentation. Adapting the Flip-J technique encompasses both cooperative and collaborative learning strategies that are executable in four stages. The first stage is allocation of instructional materials, where a lesson module is divided into subsections identified by letters, and each student is assigned a letter and a reading assignment (to be completed outside of the classroom) that corresponds to the letter in the subsections. The second stage is formation of collaborative “expert” groups, where students with the same letter assignments sit together to discuss individual main points and to formulate more points pertaining to the reading assignments in stage 1. In the third stage cooperative Jigsaw groups are formed by randomly assigning a number to students while in their expert groups. The students are then directed to sit in a newly formed group consisting of peers with different reading assignments. The fourth stage focuses on reflection on instructional materials, where the instructor poses higher-order thinking questions to students to assess comprehension and clarify any misconceptions. The expert groups discuss lessons learned from the reading assignments, clarify any misconceptions, reinforce important concepts and lastly prepare a presentation to the Jigsaw group. The objective of the Jigsaw groups is to learn instructional materials from each expert member in the number group by actively listening, intentionally taking notes and asking questions for clarity. An assessment of the Flip-J learning strategy may have shown an effective method for knowledge retention, promotion of student engagement and development of professional skills in freshman engineering course. The ability to synthesize thoughts and form collaborative solutions deemed practical with the implementation of this learner-centered model. Based on the midterm course evaluations, students reported that the Flip-J activities provided an opportunity to learn engineering concepts, foster team building, conduct interactive lectures, encourage creative thinking and helped strengthen their communication skills. Feedback from students also highlighted minor areas for improvement, such as time spent on letter groups versus number groups, and the opportunity to switch number groups in subsequent classes to allow more peer interactions. Corrective actions would be applied in forthcoming classes to reflect students’ feedback.",

    "Abstract": "Epilepsy affects approximately 50 million people globally, with approximately 80% living in low/middle-income countries (LMIC), where access to specialist care is limited. In LMIC, primary health workers provide the majority of epilepsy care, despite limited training in this field. Recognising this knowledge gap among these providers is an essential component for closing the epilepsy treatment gap in these regions. OBJECTIVE Epilepsy affects approximately 50 million people globally, with approximately 80% living in low/middle-income countries (LMIC), where access to specialist care is limited. In LMIC, primary health workers provide the majority of epilepsy care, despite limited training in this field. Recognising this knowledge gap among these providers is an essential component for closing the epilepsy treatment gap in these regions.In Zambia, the vast majority of healthcare is provided by clinical officers (COs), primary health providers with 3 years post-secondary general medical education, who predominantly work in first-level health centres around the country. SETTING In Zambia, the vast majority of healthcare is provided by clinical officers (COs), primary health providers with 3 years post-secondary general medical education, who predominantly work in first-level health centres around the country.With cooperation from the Ministry of Health, a total of 10 COs from 4 surrounding first-level health centres around the capital city of Lusaka participated, with 9 completing the entire course. PARTICIPANTS With cooperation from the Ministry of Health, a total of 10 COs from 4 surrounding first-level health centres around the capital city of Lusaka participated, with 9 completing the entire course.COs were trained in a 3-week structured course on paediatric seizures and epilepsy, based on adapted evidence-based guidelines. INTERVENTION COs were trained in a 3-week structured course on paediatric seizures and epilepsy, based on adapted evidence-based guidelines.Preassessment and postassessment were conducted to assess the intervention. Following the course, there was improved overall knowledge about epilepsy (69% vs 81%, p<0.05), specifically knowledge regarding medication management and recognition of focal seizures (p<0.05), improved seizure history taking and appropriate medication titration (p<0.05). However, knowledge regarding provoked seizures, use of diagnostic studies and general aetiologies of epilepsy remained limited. RESULTS Preassessment and postassessment were conducted to assess the intervention. Following the course, there was improved overall knowledge about epilepsy (69% vs 81%, p<0.05), specifically knowledge regarding medication management and recognition of focal seizures (p<0.05), improved seizure history taking and appropriate medication titration (p<0.05). However, knowledge regarding provoked seizures, use of diagnostic studies and general aetiologies of epilepsy remained limited.This pilot project demonstrated that a focused paediatric epilepsy training programme for COs can improve knowledge and confidence in management, and as such is a promising step for improving the large epilepsy treatment gap in children in Zambia. With feasibility demonstrated, future projects are needed to expand to more rural regions for more diverse and larger sample of primary health provider participants and encompass more case-based training and repetition of key concepts as well as methods to improve and assess long-term knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "Active learning has been shown to improve knowledge retention, facilitate feedback, and motivate learners. Despite this evidence, lecture, a passive mode of instruction, is the most widely utilized instructional method for residency educational conferences. Team-based learning fosters active learning but is infrequently used during residency training. BACKGROUND Active learning has been shown to improve knowledge retention, facilitate feedback, and motivate learners. Despite this evidence, lecture, a passive mode of instruction, is the most widely utilized instructional method for residency educational conferences. Team-based learning fosters active learning but is infrequently used during residency training.Three team-based learning sessions (one introductory and two content-based) were held during noon conferences in a pediatrics residency program. A pre-post static-group design was used to evaluate learner satisfaction and knowledge gains. Additional data was collected about facilitator preparation, session attendance, and readiness assurance test scores. Descriptive statistics and qualitative content analyses were conducted. METHODS Three team-based learning sessions (one introductory and two content-based) were held during noon conferences in a pediatrics residency program. A pre-post static-group design was used to evaluate learner satisfaction and knowledge gains. Additional data was collected about facilitator preparation, session attendance, and readiness assurance test scores. Descriptive statistics and qualitative content analyses were conducted.Forty-seven residents and students participated (81%, 47 of 58). Prior to the introductory session, the majority of participants (55%) were not familiar with team-based learning. After the three sessions, 65% of residents and students reported high levels of satisfaction with team-based learning. When compared to traditional, lecture-based noon conferences, 76% of participants reported more engagement and 48% perceived more learning in team-based learning sessions. Challenges included low completion rates of the assigned reading prior to the session and abridged discussions due to time limitations during sessions. Each session required 10 hours of preparation for curriculum development. RESULTS Forty-seven residents and students participated (81%, 47 of 58).

    "Abstract": "The interscalene brachial plexus nerve block (ISNB) is a potentially useful method of regional analgesia for humerus fracture and shoulder dislocation reduction in the Emergency Department (ED). We examined the effectiveness of an ISNB workshop given to emergency medicine (EM) residents. We also explored complication rates and effectiveness of ISNBs performed in the ED. BACKGROUND The interscalene brachial plexus nerve block (ISNB) is a potentially useful method of regional analgesia for humerus fracture and shoulder dislocation reduction in the Emergency Department (ED). We examined the effectiveness of an ISNB workshop given to emergency medicine (EM) residents. We also explored complication rates and effectiveness of ISNBs performed in the ED.One-hour evidence-based ISNB workshops were conducted with EM residents. Participants were given pre-, post-, and 3-month post-workshop knowledge and technical assessments. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. A pre- and post-workshop chart review examined ISNB utilization, complications, post-ISNB opiate administration, and post-ISNB procedural sedation. METHODS One-hour evidence-based ISNB workshops were conducted with EM residents. Participants were given pre-, post-, and 3-month post-workshop knowledge and technical assessments. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. A pre- and post-workshop chart review examined ISNB utilization, complications, post-ISNB opiate administration, and post-ISNB procedural sedation.41 residents enrolled in the workshop. Pre-workshop pass rate: knowledge assessment 22%. Immediate post-workshop pass rates: knowledge assessment 100%, image acquisition 93%, needle placement 100%. Three months post-workshop pass rates: knowledge assessment 73%, image acquisition 76%, needle placement 100%. Areas of poorest knowledge retention were anatomical landmarks, block distribution, and early signs of LAST. In the chart review, 2 ISNBs were performed in the pre-workshop period, and 12 in the post-workshop period. No serious complications were recorded. 78.5% of attempted ISNBs were successful, without need for procedural sedation. Of the 11 successfully performed ISNBs, 91% received no opiates after the procedure. RESULTS 41 residents enrolled in the workshop. Pre-workshop pass rate: knowledge assessment 22%. Immediate post-workshop pass rates: knowledge assessment 100%, image acquisition 93%, needle placement 100%.

No serious complications were recorded. 78.5% of attempted ISNBs were successful, without need for procedural sedation. Of the 11 successfully performed ISNBs, 91% received no opiates after the procedure.Our study suggests that EM residents can learn the ISNB, perform it safely in the emergency department, and that the ISNB may be an alternative to procedural sedation and opiate use for shoulder dislocation. Residents are adept at ISNB technical skills but demonstrate some deficits in knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "While increasing awareness about ocean-related topics is a matter of urgent necessity, ocean and coastal-literate schoolchildren are uncommon in Brazil, even in coastal cities. In the present study, we report the activities of an environmental education project spanning a three-year period in São Vicente, a city surrounded by marine habitats in the southeastern state of São Paulo. This project was part of a university initiative aiming to promote shared knowledge between marine biology student-monitors and the encircling community. With the aid of informal and practical educational activities, we introduced topics of marine zoology, marine ecology, waste management and recycling to fifth-year primary school children. During the project, 200 students took part in our activities. Using pre and post-instructional questionnaires, we evaluated the students’ general knowledge of provided ocean and coastal literacy topics. Our results showed a significant difference between initial and final perception across all questions, with a higher questionnaire score after activities. The highest increase in perception concerned lessons on the marine fauna found around the school (94.6% from the initial 7.9%), pointing to the intrinsic value of teaching biological sciences from a zoological perspective. Increased knowledge retention was also observed in pollution (52.6% from 26.7%), recycling (77.2% from 61.9%), and regional waste treatment lessons (51.8% from 24.2%). Overall, this initiative proved to be a fruitful addition to the school curriculum, especially considering the relevance of rapid urbanization, environmental degradation and water pollution in São Vicente and the role these children might exert as critical-thinking citizens in the future. On the other end, student-monitors were also provided with the opportunity for an informal teaching environment complementary to their usual academic-centric degree, with a fresh perspective on accessible scientific communication.",

    "Abstract": "Background The interscalene brachial plexus nerve block (ISNB) is a potentially useful method of regional analgesia for humerus fracture and shoulder dislocation reduction in the Emergency Department (ED). We examined the effectiveness of an ISNB workshop given to emergency medicine (EM) residents. We also explored complication rates and effectiveness of ISNBs performed in the ED. Methods One-hour evidence-based ISNB workshops were conducted with EM residents. Participants were given pre-, post-, and 3-month post-workshop knowledge and technical assessments. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. A pre- and post-workshop chart review examined ISNB utilization, complications, post-ISNB opiate administration, and post-ISNB procedural sedation. Results 41 residents enrolled in the workshop. Pre-workshop pass rate: knowledge assessment 22%. Immediate post-workshop pass rates: knowledge assessment 100%, image acquisition 93%, needle placement 100%. Three months post-workshop pass rates: knowledge assessment 73%, image acquisition 76%, needle placement 100%. Areas of poorest knowledge retention were anatomical landmarks, block distribution, and early signs of LAST. In the chart review, 2 ISNBs were performed in the pre-workshop period, and 12 in the post-workshop period. No serious complications were recorded. 78.5% of attempted ISNBs were successful, without need for procedural sedation. Of the 11 successfully performed ISNBs, 91% received no opiates after the procedure. Conclusions Our study suggests that EM residents can learn the ISNB, perform it safely in the emergency department, and that the ISNB may be an alternative to procedural sedation and opiate use for shoulder dislocation. Residents are adept at ISNB technical skills but demonstrate some deficits in knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Objective. To optimize student pharmacists' long-term retention of brand and generic drug names through spacing and modification of quiz format. Methods. In three experiments, student pharmacists learned brand and generic names for the Top 200 medications taught in a self-paced course. The students completed two spaced quizzes on the course content, a final examination, and a measure of long-term retention administered several weeks after the course was completed. Experiment 1 examined the spacing of quiz 2 relative to quiz 1 and the final examination. Experiment 2 examined whether providing hints such as giving the first 3 letters of the paired associate impacted learning. Experiment 3 examined whether providing more elaborate context improved student retention. Results. When quiz 2 was administered closer to quiz 1 but further from the final examination (expanding practice), students' long-term knowledge retention was greatest. When the first three letters of the paired associate were provided, students' long-term retention decreased. When more elaborative context was provided within the quizzes, students' long-term retention was unaffected despite higher final examination performance. Conclusion. Making retrieval of concepts easier reduces pharmacy students' long-term knowledge retention, albeit only a small effect was seen in this study. In addition, providing more elaborative context in terms of drug class and indication during retrieval did not improve students' learning.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Many countries are seeing a dramatic increase in the average age of their clinicians. The literature often highlights the challenges of high replacement costs and the need for strategies to retain older personnel. Less discussed are the potential pitfalls of knowledge acquisition and transfer that accompany this aging issue. Purpose: We propose a conceptual framework for understanding how clinicians' age interact with ability, motivation, and opportunity to predict clinical knowledge transfer and acquisition in health care organizations. Approach: This study integrates life-span development perspectives with the ability–motivation–opportunity framework to develop a number of testable propositions on the interaction between age and clinicians' ability, motivation, and opportunity to acquire and transfer clinical knowledge. Results: We posit that the interaction between ability (the knowledge and skills to acquire knowledge), motivation (the willingness to acquire and transfer knowledge), and opportunity (resources required for acquiring and transferring knowledge) is a determinant of successful knowledge management. We also suggest that clinicians' age-and more specifically, the cognitive and motivational changes that accompany aging-moderates these relationships. Conclusion: This study contributes to existing research by offering a set of testable propositions for future research. These propositions will hopefully encourage empirical research into this important topic and lead to guidelines for reducing the risks of organizational knowledge loss due to aging. Practice Implications: We suggest several ways that health care organizations can tailor managerial practices in order to help capitalize on the knowledge-based resources held by their younger and older clinicians. Such initiatives may affect employees' ability (e.g., by providing specific training programs), motivation (e.g., by expanding subjective perceptions of future time at work), and opportunities (e.g., by providing mentoring, reverse mentoring, and coaching programs) to acquire and transfer knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction The setting demands imposed by performing in new, interdisciplinary cultures is common for modern healthcare workers. Both health science students and evidence-based workers are required to operate in professional cultures that differ from their own. As health organisations have placed increasing value on mindfulness for improving performance outcomes, so too have educational administrators embraced common, mindful competencies for improving training for improved patient outcomes. The training of future clinicians for diversified care. teams and patient populations has become known as interprofessional education (IPE). Although the goals for IPE suggest that individual differences in trait mindfulness may serve an important determinant for training effectiveness, it has gone unstudied in extant simulation training research. Methods To fill this gap, in this paper, we examine trait mindfulness’ predictive power for training outcomes across two IPE cohort samples using two, prospective observational designs. Results Study 1’s Findings supported trait mindfulness’ prediction of perceived teamwork behaviours in training simulations between medical and nursing students (n=136). In study 2’s expanded sample to five health professions (n=232), findings extended trait mindfulness’ prediction of team efficacy and skill transfer, assessed 1 month after training. Conclusion A final, follow-up assessment 16 months later extended mindfulness’ predictive validity to knowledge retention and teamwork attitudes. We discuss the theoretical and practical implication of our findings for advancing mindfulness research and IPE effectiveness assessment.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge retention (k-retention) is vital for various enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementations in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), though it is a highly demanding and challenging task. The aim of this paper is to investigate different types of approaches to k-retention and factors influencing k-retention in SMEs. Our study adopts a grounded theory approach with cases based on 12 ERP implementations in UK SMEs. We analyze our data using thematic analysis. The findings reveal specific elements that support the k-retention of ERP package knowledge and business process knowledge. These elements are: k-retention tools, documentation, human capital and the understanding of k-retention challenges. In addition to insights from these aspects, our study reveals two additional factors (project management and organizational culture) that influence ERP package k-retention and business process k-retention. Based on these findings, we develop an ERP k-retention (EKR) framework that can be utilized by SMEs which are considering implementing ERP systems, to facilitate knowledge retention during implementation.",

Managing simulations independently and allowing simulated morbidity and mortality have been shown to improve follow-up performance in simulation. We hypothesised that allowing simulated mortality improves performance in follow-up simulations more than independent practice. BACKGROUND Simulation is an important component of postgraduate medical education, but optimal parameters for simulation are not known. Managing simulations independently and allowing simulated morbidity and mortality have been shown to improve follow-up performance in simulation. We hypothesised that allowing simulated mortality improves performance in follow-up simulations more than independent practice.Using a randomised, controlled, observer-blinded design, 48 first-year residents in anaesthesia were exposed to a hyperkalaemia scenario. Subjects were divided into two groups (n=24) that allowed for independent practice or support from an attending physician. Each of these groups was then subdivided into two groups (n=12) that allowed for simulated mortality or did not. All groups received a standardised debriefing. Six months later, the subjects returned to manage a different hyperkalaemia scenario independently with potential simulated mortality. The primary outcome was total treatment score; secondary outcomes included subjects' time to request diagnostic information, time to treatment, and simulator mortality rate.

Two-way analysis of variance and least-squares means were calculated for each combination of variables. The overall practice effect was contrasted to the potential for mortality and was insignificant; however, their interaction effect (P=0.003) was significant and produced the best results.

    "Abstract": "Many countries are seeing a dramatic increase in the average age of their clinicians. The literature often highlights the challenges of high replacement costs and the need for strategies to retain older personnel. Less discussed are the potential pitfalls of knowledge acquisition and transfer that accompany this aging issue. BACKGROUND Many countries are seeing a dramatic increase in the average age of their clinicians. The literature often highlights the challenges of high replacement costs and the need for strategies to retain older personnel. Less discussed are the potential pitfalls of knowledge acquisition and transfer that accompany this aging issue.We propose a conceptual framework for understanding how clinicians' age interact with ability, motivation, and opportunity to predict clinical knowledge transfer and acquisition in health care organizations. PURPOSE We propose a conceptual framework for understanding how clinicians' age interact with ability, motivation, and opportunity to predict clinical knowledge transfer and acquisition in health care organizations.This study integrates life-span development perspectives with the ability-motivation-opportunity framework to develop a number of testable propositions on the interaction between age and clinicians' ability, motivation, and opportunity to acquire and transfer clinical knowledge. APPROACH This study integrates life-span development perspectives with the ability-motivation-opportunity framework to develop a number of testable propositions on the interaction between age and clinicians' ability, motivation, and opportunity to acquire and transfer clinical knowledge.We posit that the interaction between ability (the knowledge and skills to acquire knowledge), motivation (the willingness to acquire and transfer knowledge), and opportunity (resources required for acquiring and transferring knowledge) is a determinant of successful knowledge management. We also suggest that clinicians' age-and more specifically, the cognitive and motivational changes that accompany aging-moderates these relationships. RESULTS We posit that the interaction between ability (the knowledge and skills to acquire knowledge), motivation (the willingness to acquire and transfer knowledge), and opportunity (resources required for acquiring and transferring knowledge) is a determinant of successful knowledge management. We also suggest that clinicians' age-and more specifically, the cognitive and motivational changes that accompany aging-moderates these relationships.This study contributes to existing research by offering a set of testable propositions for future research. These propositions will hopefully encourage empirical research into this important topic and lead to guidelines for reducing the risks of organizational knowledge loss due to aging. CONCLUSION This study contributes to existing research by offering a set of testable propositions for future research. These propositions will hopefully encourage empirical research into this important topic and lead to guidelines for reducing the risks of organizational knowledge loss due to aging.We suggest several ways that health care organizations can tailor managerial practices in order to help capitalize on the knowledge-based resources held by their younger and older clinicians. Such initiatives may affect employees' ability (e.g., by providing specific training programs), motivation (e.g., by expanding subjective perceptions of future time at work), and opportunities (e.g., by providing mentoring, reverse mentoring, and coaching programs) to acquire and transfer knowledge. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS We suggest several ways that health care organizations can tailor managerial practices in order to help capitalize on the knowledge-based resources held by their younger and older clinicians.

    "Abstract": "Reports an error in \"Clinical Virtual Simulation in Nursing Education: Randomized Controlled Trial\" by J. M. Padilha, P. P. Machado, A. Ribeiro, J. Ramos and P. Costa ( Journal of Medical Internet Research , 2019[Mar][18], Vol 21[3][e11529]). In the original article, a paragraph from the Results section under the subheading \"Self-Efficacy Perception\" was erroneously duplicated in the Discussion section under the subheading \"Clinical Virtual Simulation in Nursing Education.\" The duplicated paragraph has now been removed from the Discussion. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-41802-001). Background: In the field of health care, knowledge and clinical reasoning are key with regard to quality and confidence in decision making. The development of knowledge and clinical reasoning is influenced not only by students’ intrinsic factors but also by extrinsic factors such as satisfaction with taught content, pedagogic resources and pedagogic methods, and the nature of the objectives and challenges proposed. Nowadays, professors play the role of learning facilitators rather than simple “lecturers” and face students as active learners who are capable of attributing individual meanings to their personal goals, challenges, and experiences to build their own knowledge over time. Innovations in health simulation technologies have led to clinical virtual simulation. Clinical virtual simulation is the recreation of reality depicted on a computer screen and involves real people operating simulated systems. It is a type of simulation that places people in a central role through their exercising of motor control skills, decision skills, and communication skills using virtual patients in a variety of clinical settings. Clinical virtual simulation can provide a pedagogical strategy and can act as a facilitator of knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, improved satisfaction with learning, and finally, improved self-efficacy. However, little is known about its effectiveness with regard to satisfaction, self-efficacy, knowledge retention, and clinical reasoning. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of clinical virtual simulation with regard to knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, self-efficacy, and satisfaction with the learning experience among nursing students. Methods: A randomized controlled trial with a pretest and 2 posttests was carried out with Portuguese nursing students (N = 42). The participants, split into 2 groups, had a lesson with the same objectives and timing. The experimental group (n = 21) used a case-based learning approach, with clinical virtual simulator as a resource, whereas the control group (n = 21) used the same case-based learning approach, with recourse to a low-fidelity simulator and a realistic environment. The classes were conducted by the usual course lecturers. We assessed knowledge and clinical reasoning before the intervention, after the intervention, and 2 months later, with a true or false and multiple-choice knowledge test. The students’ levels of learning satisfaction and self-efficacy were assessed with a Likert scale after the intervention. Results: The experimental group made more significant improvements in knowledge after the intervention ( P = .001; d = 1.13) and 2 months later ( P = .02; d = 0.75), and it also showed higher levels of learning satisfaction ( P < .001; d = 1.33). We did not find statistical differences in self-efficacy perceptions ( P = .9; d = 0.054). Conclusions: The introduction of clinical virtual simulation in nursing education has the potential to improve knowledge retention and clinical reasoning in an initial stage and over time, and it increases the satisfaction with the learning experience among nursing students.

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to compare the effect of virtual and traditional education on theoretical knowledge and reporting skills of dental students in radiographic interpretation of bony lesions of the jaw. BACKGROUND This study aimed to compare the effect of virtual and traditional education on theoretical knowledge and reporting skills of dental students in radiographic interpretation of bony lesions of the jaw.This experimental study evaluated 39 dental students who had not received any instruction regarding radiographic interpretation of bony lesions of the jaw. They were randomly divided into two groups of virtual (n = 20) and traditional education (n = 19) and matched in terms of their grade point average (GPA). The virtual group received a virtual learning package while the traditional group received traditional classroom instruction for 6 one-hour sessions. Similar contents were taught to both groups by the same mentor. All students participated in a theoretical test with multiple-choice questions and an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Similar exams were also held 2 months later to assess knowledge retention. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-test and repeated measures ANOVA. METHODS This experimental study evaluated 39 dental students who had not received any instruction regarding radiographic interpretation of bony lesions of the jaw. They were randomly divided into two groups of virtual (n = 20) and traditional education (n = 19) and matched in terms of their grade point average (GPA). The virtual group received a virtual learning package while the traditional group received traditional classroom instruction for 6 one-hour sessions. Similar contents were taught to both groups by the same mentor. All students participated in a theoretical test with multiple-choice questions and an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Similar exams were also held 2 months later to assess knowledge retention. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-test and repeated measures ANOVA.The mean scores of theoretical test (P   0.05) in the virtual education group (16.60 ± 0.91 and 15.13 ± 0.78) were higher than those in the traditional education group (14.89 ± 0.99 and 14.71 ± 0.92). In both methods of instruction, the mean scores of theoretical test and OSCE at 2 months were lower than the scores acquired immediately after instruction but this difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Type of education had a significant effect on the theoretical test score (P   0.05) in the virtual education group (16.60 ± 0.91 and 15.13 ± 0.78) were higher than those in the traditional education group (14.89 ± 0.99 and 14.71 ± 0.92). In both methods of instruction, the mean scores of theoretical test and OSCE at 2 months were lower than the scores acquired immediately after instruction but this difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Type of education had a significant effect on the theoretical test score (P < 0.001) but had no significant effect on the clinical score (P = 0.072).Virtual learning was superior to traditional lecture-based method for enhancement of knowledge acquisition in radiographic interpretation of bony lesions of the jaw. However, to improve our students' reporting skills, we need to revise our virtual educational program so that the students have more opportunities to engage in reporting skills.

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG In the mid-twentieth century, the Seris (Comcaac), a small mobile hunter-gatherer and fishing people of northwestern Mexico, became almost entirely sedentary. They had for centuries survived in the isolated desert and coast along the eastern central Gulf of California, an area of rich biodiversity. The move to permanent settlements facilitated access to non-traditional foods that began to markedly impact their traditional diet of desert and marine resources, including mollusks. Although fish and sea turtles continued to be an important part of that diet, consumption of mollusks declined significantly, accompanied by a gradual loss of knowledge of their names and related ecological information, a loss evident among younger Seris today. This paper explores the role of mollusks in the Seri culture and associated changes that have taken place over the past century. Published accounts, oral tradition, historical records, and current investigation describe how the Seris adopted a sedentary lifestyle, and the impact that the change has had on their traditional diet, ecological knowledge, subsistence practices, and health.",

    "Abstract": "It is often a challenge to gain insight into undergraduate study habits. Students can list the resources at their disposal and can explain the benefits of well-understood techniques (e.g. study groups, individual meetings/tutoring, time management); however, the same students will often ignore the warning signs of academic trouble and resort to poor habits (e.g., web searches for assignment answers). Additionally, students often believe that the knowledge from class doesn’t need to be retained beyond one assignment, quiz, or exam, regardless of if they fail the assignment or evaluation. While it is primarily the students’ obligation to seek help when needed, the instructor must also provide avenues for success for the students, by providing structures for student improvement, not just answers and keys. The work presented here describes an effort to (a) seek insights into the student mindset regarding improving their own knowledge and (b) guide students towards reliable resources (videos, slides, websites) to help them with their future studies. As a secondary effect, student grades are improved and students expressed gratitude for the ability to safeguard their grade from a potentially simple mistake. In a junior-level programming course at Wentworth Institute of Technology, students learning C++ and related concepts had to take a total of nine 10-15 minute quizzes over the course of a 14 week lecture schedule. These quizzes were graded and returned, typically within 2-5 days. If a student earned a grade below 80, they could meet with the instructor within a week and provide new answers for the quiz questions, which, if correct, resulted in a higher grade (maximum of 79). Students were then asked to share how they came to the new/correct answers, whether from websites, videos, peers, or other resources. These resources were not factored into the grade but were used to help guide that student and the entire class to useful resources. If a student were using potentially incorrect or weaker sources, the instructor corrected it. If the sources were strong, they could be shared with other students to help the entire class build a database of useful resources. A similar, but separate retake policy was also implemented in a junior-level Signals & Systems course, where students were able to retake examinations, in order to improve their grade and better understand the material. This process is discussed and compared to the retake policy in the programming course. This work is still in its preliminary phase, with this paper describing the pilot run of the retake process. Despite the early time-frame, this work will share several key insights useful to instructors in programming and in unrelated fields. First, a statistical study in how students took advantage of the opportunity to improve their grades and what sort of impact it had on that student’s grades, in both the short and the long-term of the course (for example, did their future quiz grades improve before utilizing the retake policy). At the same time, quiz grades were meant only an assessment tool, and student knowledge retention is explored, as revealed through a final quiz and survey questions. Next, this work discusses what resources the students were using for both individual concepts and across the entire course. This will help instructors understand to where current students turn when they need help or additional information, as well as provide potentially useful tools to instructors of similar courses. Further insights gained through the analysis is also shared, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to help prepare students for better decision making regarding studying and resources.",

    "Abstract": "An individual’s learning method is often subject to personal inquisitiveness, initiative and inspiration from instructors or other mentors and persistent hard work. Since it is not easy to cater to either inquisitiveness nor student initiative in conventional classrooms, the role of the instructor becomes critical in moulding a student’s learning method [1]. Meanwhile, instructors face the challenge of juggling many hats at the same time. They are required to deliver content, make sure students progress and also need to assess periodically. In such busy environments, arguably, many instructors miss delivering/focusing on aspects of inspiration and leading students into creating connected stories, thoughts and reflections about their learning [2]. If learning is such a personalized process, why do we as instructors attempt to teach all in the same way? This is a question that engineering education as well as many other areas have been facing for many years [3,4]. The general intent of being all inclusive and equal is well served. Nevertheless, since learning approaches differ, each student brings his/her own experience to the discussion and builds on his/her own stories from the sub-stories they create [5,6]. The authors would like to argue that actual learning occurs in this stage, the disparity in the intended communication and student’s acquisition. This is often considered as a flaw on the student’s end in receiving what the instructors conveyed. However, it is actually a value to their learning and growth. The real learning occurs when students are able to engage ‘who they are’ with ‘what they learn’ [7,8]. To better assess the student’s actual learning, in this work, an assessment of the disparity between intention and retention is performed via review of reflections in an inquiry-based course. The student’s were initially provided with a traditional lecture and lecture notes and asked to reflect about what they knew. Then, the students were asked to explain how they could use the idea to achieve something of their interest or for a specific task. Once the student’s write about their own interests, it was apparent, that their stories and experiences had far greater value than the instructor’s initial intent. Finally, with the student’s at the center and awareness of the differences in an instructor’s instruction and student’s retention would make learning an enjoyable experience for both students and instructors.",

    "Abstract": "This complete evidence-based practice paper presents a study on a new “class patent” system designed to increase first year engineering students’ interest, understanding, and knowledge retention in the area of intellectual property. We describe here the conception, implementation, and analysis of this semester-long experiential learning activity, which was designed to make patent and trade secret concepts more grounded, engaging, and fun for students. We also include lessons learned during the implementation of the class patent system, in order to assist instructors who want to implement a similar system in their courses. The class patent system was implemented in a required, 4 credit-hour, first year engineering course at a medium-sized, private university. Course learning outcomes included topics in design and intellectual property, among a range of other foundational areas. Coursework included a major team-based, design-and-build project. This project had a slightly competitive aspect in that bonus points were awarded to the team that built the best project. Three years ago, one of the authors conceived and implemented a “class patent” system whereby teams could write and submit an application to patent a project idea. By patenting an idea, a team could hope to gain competitive advantage in achieving the best project. As a pedagogical study, we sought to determine the effects of the class patent system on the class and learning outcomes. Specific research questions were: 1) What knowledge of patents and intellectual property protections have been retained from the class? 2) What role did the class patent system have on student learning outcomes related to the purpose and mechanics of patents? and 3) What role did the class patent system have on student experience in the class and, especially, the design project? A post-class student survey instrument was developed, and requests to complete the online survey were sent via email to all students who had taken the course while the class patent system was in place. This group covers the last two academic years, and the response rate to the survey was high at 53%. The lead finding of this work is that there is a positive correlation between a student’s level of participation in the class patent system and the student’s knowledge retention in patents. In addition, students reported very favorable opinions of the class patent system, with 92% of the students reporting that the class patent system led to “some” or “a lot” of learning about intellectual property.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge retention is a human issue requiring efficient effective teaching strategies to overcome. In today’s deliverable driven economy members of the software development workforce are expected to bring in applied knowledge that allows them to perform at high levels from their first day on the job. Software Engineering students often do not have enough hands-on experiences to help them retain knowledge on key software concepts to allow them to add value and make timely impact on their first job. Engineering programs need to go beyond simply offering industry-based capstone courses and internships. Engineering educators regard experiential learning as the best way to train the next generation of software engineers. It is the authors’ belief that introducing active learning opportunities in their major courses can help students, bridge the experience gap between study and practice. Active learning makes use of applied classroom activities that engage students in the process. Active learning can be delivered in different formats like using a flipped classroom or peer instruction. Instructors in active classrooms make use of a variety of tools like case studies, trigger videos, role play, and small group exercises. Active learning assists in knowledge retention by immersing students in hands-on activities whose purpose is to reveal the mapping between theory and practice. In this paper the authors’ discuss the effectiveness of Active Learning, describe the Active Learning Tools developed to teach Software Engineering knowledge areas in their Universities and present learning assessments with student testimonials.",

    "Abstract": "Nationally, there has been a large increase in the number of active shooter events within healthcare facilities such as hospitals. Due to this upturn, government organizations have recently released documents to guide healthcare facilities on implementing active shooter policies and updating emergency operation plans. Currently, recommendations from government entities, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security, suggest the ‘Run, Hide, Fight’ approach during an active shooter incident. The current study uses data collected from hospital employees via a survey to determine and assesses variables that influence whether hospital employees retain knowledge related to the ‘Run Hide Fight’ policy, as well as employee perception of whether the training was adequate. Results reveal that level of education, clinical versus non-clinical work role, and work schedule are significant variables in determining successful program implementation.

    "Abstract": "Relying on explicit knowledge sharing and old-style training courses are simply no longer effective knowledge management tools. Therefore, understanding the role of tacit knowledge retention as part of knowledge management is becoming increasingly more important to fulfil the organisation strategic goals. To attain the aim, a theoretical study on the oil and gas industry has been provided. Positive attitude of individual reflected in the willingness to share and transfer knowledge does improve tacit knowledge retention and fulfil the strategic goals such as gaining competitive advantage and improve the performance, productivity and employee's effectiveness.",

    "Abstract": "Objective. To assess and elucidate the impact of student pharmacists' knowledge of future access to recorded lectures on their ability to remember information presented during lecture. Methods. Pharmacy students viewed 50 minutes of videotaped lecture in a simulated class period. For the early lecture material, participants were instructed as to whether or not they would have future access to the recorded lectures for restudy prior to their test one week later. For the late lecture material, participants were instructed they would not have future access to lecture material. Participants were tested immediately following the lectures and again one week later. The primary outcome was the participants' performance on the examination administered immediately following presentation of the late lecture material. If participants had preserved cognitive resources (eg, memory, attention) because of knowledge they would have future access to recorded lectures, performance was expected to be higher on the late lecture material. Results. Overall performance on the examinations did not differ between participants who knew they would have access to the lecture material for later restudy and those who did not. There was, however, loss of knowledge over time. Participants with knowledge of future access to recorded lectures wrote more notes, which correlated with better performance on the examination. Conclusion. These findings suggest knowledge of future access to recorded lectures did not enhance the ability of participants to remember other information and therefore, may not free-up cognitive resources that could be used for other tasks within the classroom.Objective.

    "Abstract": "While traditional models of training such as behavioral modeling (BMT) have been found to enhance training transfer, research suggests that more active learning strategies such as error management (EMT) and team‐based learning (TBL) may be more effective. This paper analyzes BMT, EMT and TBL strategies to train employees on new enterprise resources planning (ERP) software and discusses which training leads to successful procedural and declarative knowledge transfer, knowledge retention and application, and tangible business outcomes. TBL was predicted to be the most effective training type, as it models several components needed to use ERP software in the actual job setting. Overall and procedural knowledge as well as knowledge application scores improved most for TBL participants, while declarative knowledge improved the most in the EMT condition. During training, all conditions showed significant improvement in knowledge application; however, the TBL condition showed the highest knowledge application gains. This paper discusses the elements of TBL that support its use as an effective strategy to increase knowledge transfer in an organizational context.",

BACKGROUND The partograph is a tool used to record labour observations and support decision-making. Although used globally, it has not reached its full potential. We aimed to determine whether an educational board game can improve labour-monitoring skills and influence practice.A quasi-experimental study, underpinned by Kirkpatrick's evaluation model, was used. Midwives and student midwives from Malawi, Kenya and Tanzania were given an identical hypothetical case-scenario of a woman in labour pre-and post-implementation of a game, to assess recording and interpretation abilities. This was supplemented by qualitative inquiry 3 months post-game-playing using semi-structured interviews (n = 24) and expert case-record reviews (n = 24). Quantitative data were analysed using the paired t-test and qualitative data were subjected to framework analysis.

    "Abstract": "Nationally, there has been a large increase in the number of active shooter events within healthcare facilities such as hospitals. Due to this upturn, government organizations have recently released documents to guide healthcare facilities on implementing active shooter policies and updating emergency operation plans. Currently, recommendations from government entities, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security, suggest the ‘Run, Hide, Fight’ approach during an active shooter incident. The current study uses data collected from hospital employees via a survey to determine and assesses variables that influence whether hospital employees retain knowledge related to the ‘Run Hide Fight’ policy, as well as employee perception of whether the training was adequate. Results reveal that level of education, clinical versus non-clinical work role, and work schedule are significant variables in determining successful program implementation.",

    "Abstract": "While traditional models of training such as behavioral modeling (BMT) have been found to enhance training transfer, research suggests that more active learning strategies such as error management (EMT) and team‐based learning (TBL) may be more effective. This paper analyzes BMT, EMT and TBL strategies to train employees on new enterprise resources planning (ERP) software and discusses which training leads to successful procedural and declarative knowledge transfer, knowledge retention and application, and tangible business outcomes. TBL was predicted to be the most effective training type, as it models several components needed to use ERP software in the actual job setting. Overall and procedural knowledge as well as knowledge application scores improved most for TBL participants, while declarative knowledge improved the most in the EMT condition. During training, all conditions showed significant improvement in knowledge application; however, the TBL condition showed the highest knowledge application gains. This paper discusses the elements of TBL that support its use as an effective strategy to increase knowledge transfer in an organizational context.

    "Abstract": "Context Open Source Software (OSS) development is a knowledge focused activity which relies heavily on contributors who can be volunteers or paid workers and are geographically distributed. While working on OSS projects contributors acquire project related individualistic knowledge and gain experience and skills, which often remains unshared with others and is usually lost once contributors leave a project. All software development organisations face the problem of knowledge loss as employees leave, but this situation is exasperated in OSS projects where most contributors are volunteers with largely unpredictable engagement durations. Contributor turnover is inevitable due to the transient nature of OSS project workforces causing knowledge loss, which threatens the overall sustainability of OSS projects and impacts negatively on software quality and contributor productivity. Objective: The objective of this work is to deeply and systematically investigate the phenomenon of knowledge loss due to contributor turnover in OSS projects as presented in the state-of-the-art literature and to synthesise the information presented on the topic. Furthermore, based on the learning arising from our investigation it is our intention to identify mechanisms to reduce the overall effects of knowledge loss in OSS projects. Methodology: We use the snowballing methodology to identify the relevant literature on knowledge loss due to contributor turnover in OSS projects. This robust methodology for a literature review includes research question, search strategy, inclusion, exclusion, quality criteria, and data synthesis. The search strategy, and inclusion, exclusions and quality criteria are applied as a part of snowballing procedure. Snowballing is considered an efficient and reliable way to conduct a systematic literature review, providing a robust alternative to mechanically searching individual databases for given topics. Result: Knowledge sharing in OSS projects is abundant but there is no evidence of a formal strategy or practice to manage knowledge. Due to the dynamic and diverse nature of OSS projects, knowledge management is considered a challenging task and there is a need for a proactive mechanism to share knowledge in the OSS community for knowledge to be reused in the future by the OSS project contributors. From the collection of papers found using snowballing, we consolidated various themes on knowledge loss due to contributor turnover in OSS projects and identified 11 impacts due to knowledge loss in OSS projects, and 10 mitigations to manage with knowledge loss in OSS projects. Conclusion: In this paper, we propose future research directions to investigate integration of proactive knowledge retention practices with the existing OSS practices to reduce the current knowledge loss problem. We suggest that there is insufficient attention paid to KM in general in OSS, in particular there would appear to an absence of proactive measures to reduce the potential impact of knowledge loss. We also propose the need for a KM evaluation metric in OSS projects, similar to the ones that evaluate health of online communities, which should help to inform potential consumers of the OSS of the KM status on a project, something that is not existent today.",

    "Abstract": "Focused cardiac ultrasonography (FCU) is an increasingly integral component of routine medical training and practice. While various instructional methods have been described, few attempts have been made to incorporate a physical 3-dimensional (3D) instructional aid. BACKGROUND Focused cardiac ultrasonography (FCU) is an increasingly integral component of routine medical training and practice. While various instructional methods have been described, few attempts have been made to incorporate a physical 3-dimensional (3D) instructional aid.The aim of this study was to determine if a 3D printed heart model workshop for FCU instruction leads to equivalent structure recognition and scanning ability compared to traditional didactic FCU instruction. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine if a 3D printed heart model workshop for FCU instruction leads to equivalent structure recognition and scanning ability compared to traditional didactic FCU instruction.Twenty first-year medical students with no point-of-care ultrasonography experience were randomly assigned to a traditional lecture (n = 10) or a 3D printed heart model workshop (n = 10). Written examinations at 0 and 3 months as well as image acquisition at 3 months were compared. INTERVENTION Twenty first-year medical students with no point-of-care ultrasonography experience were randomly assigned to a traditional lecture (n = 10) or a 3D printed heart model workshop (n = 10). Written examinations at 0 and 3 months as well as image acquisition at 3 months were compared.The median scores from the initial written structure identification in the traditional and 3D heart groups were 74% and 90%, respectively (P = 0.7). The second written exam at 3 months yielded median scores of 56% and 58% in the traditional and 3D heart groups, respectively (P = 0.8). The average scores on the image acquisition practical at 3 months were 3.3 of 5 and 2.7 of 5 (P = 0.1) in the traditional and 3D heart groups, respectively. RESULTS The median scores from the initial written structure identification in the traditional and 3D heart groups were 74% and 90%, respectively (P = 0.7). The second written exam at 3 months yielded median scores of 56% and 58% in the traditional and 3D heart groups, respectively (P = 0.8). The average scores on the image acquisition practical at 3 months were 3.3 of 5 and 2.7 of 5 (P = 0.1) in the traditional and 3D heart groups, respectively.Utilizing 3D heart models in an FCU workshop format results in similar skill acquisition and knowledge retention as traditional didactics. The 3D heart models are relatively inexpensive, portable, and reusable, enabling learners to practice repeatedly and at flexible intervals. The reduction in ongoing expenses and the ability to teach large groups may decrease training costs as well as the need for local faculty expertise.

    "Abstract": "The development of procedural skills is necessary for medical students. Computer-based video instruction (CBVI) increases knowledge and procedural skills. BACKGROUND The development of procedural skills is necessary for medical students. Computer-based video instruction (CBVI) increases knowledge and procedural skills.This pilot study's aim was to investigate the usefulness of CBVI in dermatologic procedure training for medical students and secondarily assess students' overall perception of the field of dermatology. OBJECTIVE This pilot study's aim was to investigate the usefulness of CBVI in dermatologic procedure training for medical students and secondarily assess students' overall perception of the field of dermatology.Twenty-nine first- and second-year medical students were randomly assigned to the CVBI group or control group, in addition to in-person instructor demonstration of shave and punch biopsies using fresh cadaver tissue. Blinded evaluators graded student performances using a five-point Likert scale immediately after demonstration, and 1 week later to assess knowledge retention. METHODS Twenty-nine first- and second-year medical students were randomly assigned to the CVBI group or control group, in addition to in-person instructor demonstration of shave and punch biopsies using fresh cadaver tissue. Blinded evaluators graded student performances using a five-point Likert scale immediately after demonstration, and 1 week later to assess knowledge retention.In overall performance, the CBVI group demonstrated higher scores both in shave (3.54 vs 2.59, p = .01) and punch biopsies (3.63 vs 2.88, p = .01) at immediate recall and knowledge retention (3.68 vs 2.67, p = .01; 4.00 vs 2.99, p < .001, respectively). Approximately 33.3% of the students stated that the experience increased their interest in the field of dermatology. RESULTS In overall performance, the CBVI group demonstrated higher scores both in shave (3.54 vs 2.59, p = .01) and punch biopsies (3.63 vs 2.88, p = .01) at immediate recall and knowledge retention (3.68 vs 2.67, p = .01; 4.00 vs 2.99, p < .001, respectively). Approximately 33.3% of the students stated that the experience increased their interest in the field of dermatology.Incorporation of CBVI into the dermatology curriculum augments medical students' procedural skills. The CBVI group performed significantly better in all 7 grading categories for shave biopsy and in 5 of 7 categories for punch biopsy. Integration of procedural laboratory tests raises students' interest in dermatology. CONCLUSION Incorporation of CBVI into the dermatology curriculum augments medical students' procedural skills. The CBVI group performed significantly better in all 7 grading categories for shave biopsy and in 5 of 7 categories for punch biopsy. Integration of procedural laboratory tests raises students' interest in dermatology.",

    "Abstract": "Study motivation and knowledge retention benefit from regular student self-assessments. Inclusion of certainty-based learning (CBL) in computer-assisted formative tests may further enhance this by enabling students to identify whether they are uninformed or misinformed regarding the topics tested, which may trigger future study actions including instructor consultation. BACKGROUND Study motivation and knowledge retention benefit from regular student self-assessments. Inclusion of certainty-based learning (CBL) in computer-assisted formative tests may further enhance this by enabling students to identify whether they are uninformed or misinformed regarding the topics tested, which may trigger future study actions including instructor consultation.Using a cross-over study design involving two out of thirteen computer-assisted formative assessments (CAFAs) of a first-year cell biology course, we compared student-instructor interactions, student learning experiences and final exam scores between two (bio)medical science student cohorts who worked with different CBL-containing CAFAs. METHODS Using a cross-over study design involving two out of thirteen computer-assisted formative assessments (CAFAs) of a first-year cell biology course, we compared student-instructor interactions, student learning experiences and final exam scores between two (bio)medical science student cohorts who worked with different CBL-containing CAFAs.A total of 389 students participated in the study. After completion 159 (41%) filled in a questionnaire on their experience with CBL during supervised CAFAs. In the control group the median duration of student-instructor interactions was 90 s (range 60-140 s), and this increased with 20 s to 110 s (range 60-150 s) in the group working with a CBL-based CAFA. The number of interactions was similar in both groups (0.22 per student per hour, regardless of CBL inclusion). Forty percent of the students expected that CBL would positively influence their study behavior, and 23% also anticipated a positive effect on examination scores. Student examination scores, however, were not affected by CBL. Almost half of the students (43%) were in favor of CBL inclusion in future computer-assisted learning modules, whereas 33% did not see merit in including CBL in CAFAs.

Almost half of the students (43%) were in favor of CBL inclusion in future computer-assisted learning modules, whereas 33% did not see merit in including CBL in CAFAs.Incorporation of CBL in a single formative assessment led to a slight increase in student-instructor interaction times, but had effect neither on the number of student-instructor interactions nor on exam scores. CBL inclusion positively influenced student's appreciation of the coursework, presumably by helping students to evaluate their mastery level and identify misconceptions. A more extensive enrollment of CBL beyond an individual formative assessment, throughout a course or a curriculum, may possibly reveal positive effects on study efficacy.

    "Abstract": "Objective. To assess and elucidate the impact of student pharmacists' knowledge of future access to recorded lectures on their ability to remember information presented during lecture. Methods. Pharmacy students viewed 50 minutes of videotaped lecture in a simulated class period. For the early lecture material, participants were instructed as to whether or not they would have future access to the recorded lectures for restudy prior to their test one week later. For the late lecture material, participants were instructed they would not have future access to lecture material. Participants were tested immediately following the lectures and again one week later. The primary outcome was the participants' performance on the examination administered immediately following presentation of the late lecture material. If participants had preserved cognitive resources (eg, memory, attention) because of knowledge they would have future access to recorded lectures, performance was expected to be higher on the late lecture material. Results. Overall performance on the examinations did not differ between participants who knew they would have access to the lecture material for later restudy and those who did not. There was, however, loss of knowledge over time. Participants with knowledge of future access to recorded lectures wrote more notes, which correlated with better performance on the examination. Conclusion. These findings suggest knowledge of future access to recorded lectures did not enhance the ability of participants to remember other information and therefore, may not free-up cognitive resources that could be used for other tasks within the classroom.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Medical education literature suggests that ethics education should be learner-centered and problem-based rather than theory-based. Team-based learning is an appropriate method for this suggestion. However, its effectiveness was not investigated enough in medical ethics education. Research question: Is team-based learning effective in medical ethics education in terms of knowledge retention, in-class learner engagement, and learner reactions? Research design: This was a prospective controlled follow-up study. We changed lecture with team-based learning method to teach four topics in a 2-week medical ethics clerkship, while the remaining topics were taught by lectures. For comparison, we formed team-based learning and lecture groups, in which the students and instructor are the same, but the topics and teaching methodologies are different. We determined in-class learner engagement by direct observation and student satisfaction by feedback forms. Student success for team-based learning and lecture topics in the end-of-clerkship exam and two retention tests performed 1 year and 2 years later were compared. Ethical considerations: Ethical approval for the study was granted by Akdeniz University Board of Ethics on Noninvasive Clinical Human Studies Ethics committee. Findings: Short-term knowledge retention did not differ; however, team-based learning was found superior to lecture at long-term retention tests. Student satisfaction was high with team-based learning and in-class engagement was better in team-based learning sessions. Discussion: Our results on learner engagement and satisfaction with team-based learning were similar to those of previous reports. However, knowledge retention results in our study were contrary to literature. The reason might be the fact that students prepared for the end-of-clerkship pass/fail exam (short term) regardless of the teaching method. But, at long-term retention tests, they did not prepare for the exam and answered the questions just using the knowledge retained in their memories. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that team-based learning is a better alternative to lecture to teach ethics in medical education.

    "Abstract": "Background: Antimicrobial resistance threatens the e ffective prevention and treatment of many types of infections. Infection occurs more frequently in patients diagnosed with psychiatric illness due to a number of risk factors. Urinary tract infections (UTI) are among the most common infections in this patient population. Currently, there is little information available offering guidance on how to treat infections commonly reported in patients with psychiatric illnesses, nor are there speci c recommendations on how to provide effcient and effective educational interventions to prescribers who typically are not infectious disease specialists yet are responsible for treating infections within a psychiatric hospital. This study aims to determine 1) whether psychiatric inpatients were appropriately treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) prior to educational interventions, and 2) whether there is a relationship between di fferent modes of educational interventions and increased knowledge attainment and retention among healthcare clinicians regarding UTI treatment. This study also sought to determine if 3) health-team teaching used as an enablement method improves antibiotic prescribing and if 4) the number of appropriate UTI treatment regimens increased following educational intervention compared to baseline (prior to educational intervention). Methods: A 10-question pre-test survey focusing on UTIs was administered to clinicians in various healthcare disciplines who were later randomly assigned to receive UTI educational interventions either as a live lecture or independent study with identical content. The same 10-question survey was administered as a post-test, 6 to 7 weeks following the educational intervention. Antibiotic prescribing prior to and following educational interventions was assessed to note prescribing trends. Results: Analysis showed that healthcare providers who received live education scored higher on the post-test survey versus those who received directions for self-directed review of educational material presented at the live educational intervention ( p < 0.001). Following educational interventions, the number of urine samples collected for suspected UTI decreased, resulting in a decrease of unnecessary antibiotic treatment. The number of appropriately prescribed antibiotic treatment regimens increased following educational e orts. Conclusion: These enablement educational intervention strategies resulted in signi ficantly improved antibiotic prescribing, indicating that andragogical teaching methods, reinforced through printed material and verbal communication of prescribing deficits, promotes knowledge retention and improved care for patients hospitalized with psychiatric illness.

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG Fire has long been used as a tool to remove pests and disease, regenerate land, and remove unwanted vegetation buildup. Although traditionally used as a widespread land management tool in the past, its continued use could be under threat due to public perceptions pertaining to risks from burns getting out of control, as well as the impacts of smoke pollution and ecological damage. To determine the attitudes of rural practitioners and residents toward use of fire as a land management tool, this paper reports the results, analysis, and interpretation to a survey question: “Do you feel fire is a good option for managing rural land?”, along with an analysis of key attitudes toward the use of fire as a land management tool. The survey was undertaken with 696 respondents consisting of (rural land managers, rural populace, and rural fire personnel) within New Zealand. The survey identified differing perceptions about the suitability of prescribed fire use by land-based sectors. Five constructs explained the attitudes toward use of fire as a land management tool: benefits of fire use, the tradition of fire as a tool, regulations and liabilities, smoke impacts from fire, and the risks from knowledge loss and changing land use. Results showed that a person’s high agreement with the construct concerning negative smoke impacts resulted in less agreement that fire was a good option for use in rural land management in New Zealand. Main demographics influencing a positive attitude toward the use of fire included gender (male), their current use of fire, and larger land area managed. For prescribed fire to continue to be a useful tool, an improved understanding of current management practices and clear guidelines around best practice in using fire in New Zealand to manage land are required, with particular emphasis on limiting smoke impacts.",

    "Abstract": "Background Taenia solium is a neglected zoonotic parasite endemic throughout many low-income countries worldwide, including Zambia, where it causes human and pig diseases with high health and socioeconomic burdens. Lack of knowledge is a recognized risk factor, and consequently targeted health educational programs can decrease parasite transmission and disease occurrence in endemic areas. Preliminary assessment of the computer-based education program ‘The Vicious Worm’ in rural areas of eastern Zambia indicated that it was effective at increasing knowledge of T. solium in primary school students. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of ‘The Vicious Worm’ on knowledge retention by re-assessing the same primary school students one year after the initial education workshops. Methodology/Principal findings Follow-up questionnaires were administered in the original three primary schools in eastern Zambia in 2017, 12 months after the original workshops. In total, 86 pupils participated in the follow-up sessions, representing 87% of the initial workshop respondents. Knowledge of T. solium at ‘follow-up’ was significantly higher than at the initial ‘pre’ questionnaire administered during the Vicious Worm workshop that took place one year earlier. While some specifics of the parasite’s life cycle were not completely understood, the key messages for disease prevention, such as the importance of hand washing and properly cooking pork, remained well understood by the students, even one year later. Conclusions/Significance Results of this study indicate that ‘The Vicious Worm’ may be an effective tool for both short- and long-term T. solium education of rural primary school students in Zambia. Inclusion of educational workshops using ‘The Vicious Worm’ could be recommended for integrated cysticercosis control/elimination programs in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly if the content is simplified to focus on the key messages for prevention of disease transmission.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper reflections are made on the place that culture occupies in the formation of the university student, given that in recent years; these topics have become topics of vital importance, an aspect that in our view is related to the opinion of modern philosophers, who consider that we are in the \"New Middle Ages\", evidenced by the lack and loss of knowledge and all that this produces in society. In the university, not only science must be done, but also culture, so the design of a pedagogical strategy for the integral formation of the university student, through the culture, constitutes a social necessity and is a problem of great actuality.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to review the latest management developments across the globe and pinpoint practical implications from cutting-edge research and case studies. Design/methodology/approach This briefing is prepared by an independent writer who adds their own impartial comments and places the articles in context. Findings The study produced five thematic summaries – managers could prevent accidental knowledge depreciation through targeted interventions. Managers can prevent accidental knowledge loss with “purposeful interventions,” such as developing employee networks and implementing technological solutions. Managers can preserve organizational memory through control, management and maintenance of its usage and structure. Managers could help the process of intentional forgetting by developing a supportive environment. Managers could have a damaging effect on organizations if they prevented organizational change. The conclusions could be of great practical use for managers. They provide useful guidelines and strategies on how to reduce the disruptive effects of accidental forgetting and also how to plan intentional forgetting, a process known as “managed unlearning”. Practical implications The paper provides strategic insights and practical thinking that have influenced some of the world’s leading organizations. Originality/value The briefing saves busy executives and researchers hours of reading time by selecting only the very best, most pertinent information and presenting it in a condensed and easy-to-digest format.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Medical education literature suggests that ethics education should be learner-centered and problem-based rather than theory-based. Team-based learning is an appropriate method for this suggestion. However, its effectiveness was not investigated enough in medical ethics education. Research question: Is team-based learning effective in medical ethics education in terms of knowledge retention, in-class learner engagement, and learner reactions? Research design: This was a prospective controlled follow-up study. We changed lecture with team-based learning method to teach four topics in a 2-week medical ethics clerkship, while the remaining topics were taught by lectures. For comparison, we formed team-based learning and lecture groups, in which the students and instructor are the same, but the topics and teaching methodologies are different. We determined in-class learner engagement by direct observation and student satisfaction by feedback forms. Student success for team-based learning and lecture topics in the end-of-clerkship exam and two retention tests performed 1 year and 2 years later were compared. Ethical considerations: Ethical approval for the study was granted by Akdeniz University Board of Ethics on Noninvasive Clinical Human Studies Ethics committee. Findings: Short-term knowledge retention did not differ; however, team-based learning was found superior to lecture at long-term retention tests. Student satisfaction was high with team-based learning and in-class engagement was better in team-based learning sessions. Discussion: Our results on learner engagement and satisfaction with team-based learning were similar to those of previous reports. However, knowledge retention results in our study were contrary to literature. The reason might be the fact that students prepared for the end-of-clerkship pass/fail exam (short term) regardless of the teaching method. But, at long-term retention tests, they did not prepare for the exam and answered the questions just using the knowledge retained in their memories. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that team-based learning is a better alternative to lecture to teach ethics in medical education.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Disaster Medicine (DM) is a discipline arising from the marriage of emergency medicine and disaster management. The importance of DM has recently increased, with current wildfire situations throughout the world being examples of mass scale disasters with significant human morbidity and mortality. DM deals with preparedness, mitigation, response, recovery, and prevention of disasters ( 1 ). Aim: To develop an educational strategy and reusable format for delivering undergraduate DM courses online. Man-made, weather-related, humanitarian, and technological disasters occur all around the globe annually, yet the majority of medical schools do not have an undergraduate DM program. This project developed an online course structure accessible to medical schools and students throughout the world. Methods: Learning theories and models of learning were used to construct a course layout that encouraged students to be active learners, developed long-term retention strategies, and facilitated assessment for and of learning. This was accomplished through innovative educational modalities, including novel apps and external online resources. The course focuses heavily on outcome-based education with an emphasis on the development of applicable skills. Each lecture is divided into a series of learning objectives to allow students to master concepts sequentially, followed by questions to make use of the “testing effect” ( 2 ). Results: Focused review of current medical education literature reveals that students learn best when given short, outcome-focused “mini-lectures” followed by low-stakes assessment and feedback. Discussion: Medical schools without trained DM staff now have access to expert online material developed by educationalists with a focus on skills and knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction : There is currently no protocol for the initiation of extra corporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) in out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Atlantic Canada. Advanced care paramedics (ACPs) perform advanced cardiac life support in the prehospital setting often completing the entire resuscitation on-scene. Implementation of ECPR will present a novel intervention that is only available at the receiving hospital, altering how ACPs manage selected patients. Our objective is to determine if an educational program can improve paramedic identification of ECPR candidates. Methods : An educational program was delivered to paramedics including a short seminar and pocket card coupled with simulations of OHCA cases. A before and after study design using a case-based survey was employed. Paramedics were scored on their ability to correctly identify OHCA patients who met the inclusion criteria for our ECPR protocol. Scores before and after the education delivery were compared using a two tailed t-test. A 6-month follow-up is planned to assess knowledge retention. Qualitative data was also collected from paramedics during simulation to help identify potential barriers to implementation of our protocol in the prehospital setting. Results : Nine advanced care paramedics participated in our educational program. Mean score pre-education was 9.7/16 (61.1%) compared to 14/16 (87.5%) after education delivery. The mean difference between groups was 4.22 (CI = 2.65-5.80, p = 0.0003). There was a significant improvement in the paramedics’ ability to correctly identify ECPR candidates after completing our educational program. Conclusion : Paramedic training through a didactic session coupled with a pocket card and simulation appears to be a feasible method of knowledge translation. 6-month retention data will help ensure knowledge retention is achieved. If successful, this pilot will be expanded to train all paramedics in our prehospital system as we seek to implement an ECPR protocol at our centre.",

    "Abstract": "Fire has long been used as a tool to remove pests and disease, regenerate land, and remove unwanted vegetation buildup. Although traditionally used as a widespread land management tool in the past, its continued use could be under threat due to public perceptions pertaining to risks from burns getting out of control, as well as the impacts of smoke pollution and ecological damage. To determine the attitudes of rural practitioners and residents toward use of fire as a land management tool, this paper reports the results, analysis, and interpretation to a survey question: “Do you feel fire is a good option for managing rural land?”, along with an analysis of key attitudes toward the use of fire as a land management tool. The survey was undertaken with 696 respondents consisting of (rural land managers, rural populace, and rural fire personnel) within New Zealand. The survey identified differing perceptions about the suitability of prescribed fire use by land-based sectors. Five constructs explained the attitudes toward use of fire as a land management tool: benefits of fire use, the tradition of fire as a tool, regulations and liabilities, smoke impacts from fire, and the risks from knowledge loss and changing land use. Results showed that a person’s high agreement with the construct concerning negative smoke impacts resulted in less agreement that fire was a good option for use in rural land management in New Zealand. Main demographics influencing a positive attitude toward the use of fire included gender (male), their current use of fire, and larger land area managed. For prescribed fire to continue to be a useful tool, an improved understanding of current management practices and clear guidelines around best practice in using fire in New Zealand to manage land are required, with particular emphasis on limiting smoke impacts.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objective Celiac disease (CD), the most common genetically‐based food intolerance, affects 3% to 16% of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Treatment involves lifelong adherence to a gluten‐free diet (GFD). Individualized dietary education is resource‐intensive. We, therefore, sought to develop and test the usability of an e‐learning module aimed at educating patients and caregivers regarding implementation of the GFD in children with concurrent CD and T1D. Methods An interactive e‐learning module was developed based on extensive review of CD, T1D, and educational literature. A mixed‐methods usability testing approach was used to refine and evaluate the module, using qualitative semi‐structured interviews, observations, and satisfaction and knowledge questionnaires in two iterative cycles. The module was refined based on themes identified from each usability cycle. Results Eighteen patients (8 in cycle 1, 10 in cycle 2) and 15 caregivers (7 in cycle 1, 8 in cycle 2) participated. Patient participants had CD and T1D for a mean (SD) of 6.1 ± 5.1 and 8.3 ± 5.5 years, respectively. Their mean age was 13.5 ± 4.5 years. Thematic analysis of usability interviews showed the module to be appealing and resulted in minor module revisions after each cycle to improve usability. Mean satisfaction scores post‐module completion were high (4.67 ± 0.54), indicating participants were “very satisfied” with the education. Knowledge test scores increased significantly from pre‐ to post‐module completion ( P  = 0.001). Conclusion A multifaceted user‐centered usability approach demonstrated that an innovative, interactive e‐learning module is effective in knowledge retention and can provide comprehensive and accessible information in the implementation of the GFD teaching in children with CD and T1D.",

    "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CD), the most common genetically-based food intolerance, affects 3% to 16% of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Treatment involves lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Individualized dietary education is resource-intensive. We, therefore, sought to develop and test the usability of an e-learning module aimed at educating patients and caregivers regarding implementation of the GFD in children with concurrent CD and T1D. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Celiac disease (CD), the most common genetically-based food intolerance, affects 3% to 16% of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Treatment involves lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Individualized dietary education is resource-intensive. We, therefore, sought to develop and test the usability of an e-learning module aimed at educating patients and caregivers regarding implementation of the GFD in children with concurrent CD and T1D.An interactive e-learning module was developed based on extensive review of CD, T1D, and educational literature. A mixed-methods usability testing approach was used to refine and evaluate the module, using qualitative semi-structured interviews, observations, and satisfaction and knowledge questionnaires in two iterative cycles. The module was refined based on themes identified from each usability cycle. METHODS An interactive e-learning module was developed based on extensive review of CD, T1D, and educational literature. A mixed-methods usability testing approach was used to refine and evaluate the module, using qualitative semi-structured interviews, observations, and satisfaction and knowledge questionnaires in two iterative cycles. The module was refined based on themes identified from each usability cycle.Eighteen patients (8 in cycle 1, 10 in cycle 2) and 15 caregivers (7 in cycle 1, 8 in cycle 2) participated. Patient participants had CD and T1D for a mean (SD) of 6.1 ± 5.1 and 8.3 ± 5.5 years, respectively. Their mean age was 13.5 ± 4.5 years. Thematic analysis of usability interviews showed the module to be appealing and resulted in minor module revisions after each cycle to improve usability. Mean satisfaction scores post-module completion were high (4.67 ± 0.54), indicating participants were \"very satisfied\" with the education. Knowledge test scores increased significantly from pre- to post-module completion (P = 0.001). RESULTS Eighteen patients (8 in cycle 1, 10 in cycle 2) and 15 caregivers (7 in cycle 1, 8 in cycle 2) participated. Patient participants had CD and T1D for a mean (SD) of 6.1 ± 5.1 and 8.3 ± 5.5 years, respectively. Their mean age was 13.5 ± 4.5 years. Thematic analysis of usability interviews showed the module to be appealing and resulted in minor module revisions after each cycle to improve usability. Mean satisfaction scores post-module completion were high (4.67 ± 0.54), indicating participants were \"very satisfied\" with the education. Knowledge test scores increased significantly from pre- to post-module completion (P = 0.001).A multifaceted user-centered usability approach demonstrated that an innovative, interactive e-learning module is effective in knowledge retention and can provide comprehensive and accessible information in the implementation of the GFD teaching in children with CD and T1D. CONCLUSION A multifaceted user-centered usability approach demonstrated that an innovative, interactive e-learning module is effective in knowledge retention and can provide comprehensive and accessible information in the implementation of the GFD teaching in children with CD and T1D.",

    "Abstract": "Medical education literature suggests that ethics education should be learner-centered and problem-based rather than theory-based. Team-based learning is an appropriate method for this suggestion. However, its effectiveness was not investigated enough in medical ethics education. BACKGROUND Medical education literature suggests that ethics education should be learner-centered and problem-based rather than theory-based. Team-based learning is an appropriate method for this suggestion. However, its effectiveness was not investigated enough in medical ethics education.Is team-based learning effective in medical ethics education in terms of knowledge retention, in-class learner engagement, and learner reactions? RESEARCH QUESTION Is team-based learning effective in medical ethics education in terms of knowledge retention, in-class learner engagement, and learner reactions?This was a prospective controlled follow-up study. We changed lecture with team-based learning method to teach four topics in a 2-week medical ethics clerkship, while the remaining topics were taught by lectures. For comparison, we formed team-based learning and lecture groups, in which the students and instructor are the same, but the topics and teaching methodologies are different. We determined in-class learner engagement by direct observation and student satisfaction by feedback forms. Student success for team-based learning and lecture topics in the end-of-clerkship exam and two retention tests performed 1 year and 2 years later were compared.

Student success for team-based learning and lecture topics in the end-of-clerkship exam and two retention tests performed 1 year and 2 years later were compared.Ethical approval for the study was granted by Akdeniz University Board of Ethics on Noninvasive Clinical Human Studies Ethics committee. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Ethical approval for the study was granted by Akdeniz University Board of Ethics on Noninvasive Clinical Human Studies Ethics committee.Short-term knowledge retention did not differ; however, team-based learning was found superior to lecture at long-term retention tests. Student satisfaction was high with team-based learning and in-class engagement was better in team-based learning sessions. FINDINGS Short-term knowledge retention did not differ; however, team-based learning was found superior to lecture at long-term retention tests. Student satisfaction was high with team-based learning and in-class engagement was better in team-based learning sessions.Our results on learner engagement and satisfaction with team-based learning were similar to those of previous reports. However, knowledge retention results in our study were contrary to literature. The reason might be the fact that students prepared for the end-of-clerkship pass/fail exam (short term) regardless of the teaching method. But, at long-term retention tests, they did not prepare for the exam and answered the questions just using the knowledge retained in their memories.

    "Abstract": "Suppose learners use their free time to go online to review course materials, and they do so by taking optional tests that consist of multiple‐choice questions (MCQs). What will happen if, for every practice question, there is always a choice (out of four possible choices) that is marked as “the (current) hot choice?” Will this make any difference in learning effects? To answer this question, an educational experiment was conducted. It was found that “hot designations” helped the experimental group perform significantly better in both the immediate post‐test exam and a delayed post‐test exam and that learners with higher levels of initial knowledge benefited more from this review strategy. From the results of a follow‐up questionnaire and one‐on‐one interviews, it was found that the proposed review strategy promoted a more thorough thinking style in subjects of the experimental group.

    "Abstract": "Background: First-time anterior shoulder dislocations (FTASD) provide an opportunity to examine the value of integrating stated-preference data with decision modeling to differentiate between patients whose preferred management strategy involves operative or nonoperative treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a FTASD decision tool intervention with individual preference measurement compared with a text-based control in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Two hundred respondents between 18 and 35 years of age at risk for experiencing an FTASD were enrolled from the orthopedic clinics and randomized to receive either an interactive decision tool intervention capable of eliciting patient preferences for treatment of an FTASD or a text-based control on shoulder dislocations and treatments. The primary outcome was preference for operative or nonoperative treatment choice. Secondary outcomes included the decisional conflict scale (DCS), stage of decision making, patient activation and engagement, awareness of preference sensitive decisions, knowledge retention, and instrument acceptability. Results: One hundred respondents were randomized to the intervention and 100 to the control. A total of 154 men and 46 women with an average age of 23.6 years completed the survey. Participants in the intervention group made treatment decisions that aligned more closely with evidence-based recommendations than those in the control group ( P = 0.016). Secondary outcomes showed no difference between intervention and control, excluding several DCS subscales. Discussion: An interactive, preference-based decision tool for treatment of FTASD affects patient decision making by guiding respondents toward treatment decisions that align more closely with evidence-based recommendations in the absence of a consultation with an orthopedic provider compared with a standard-of-care control tool. Additional study is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of this tool on treatment outcomes, patient adherence, and satisfaction.

    "Abstract": "Recent findings have provided strong evidence that retrieval-based learning is an effective strategy for enhancing knowledge retention and long-term meaningful learning, but it is not a preferred learning strategy for the majority of students. The present research analyzes the application of learning gamification principles in online, open-book, multiple-choice tests in order to motivate students to engage in repeated retrieval-based learning activities. The results reveal a strong positive correlation between the number of successful retrieval attempts in these tests that cover content from the course textbook, and long-term knowledge retention as demonstrated in a live, final, closed-book, cumulative exam consisting of multiple-choice, labeling, definitions, and open-ended questions covering the content of both textbook readings and lectures. The presented results suggest that online, open-book tests designed using gamification principles, even when covering partial course content and one type of questions, are an effective strategy for using educational technology to motivate students to repeatedly engage in retrieval-based learning activities and improve long-term knowledge retention, regardless of the course delivery mode.",

    "Abstract": "On the subject of knowledge retention, Adrian Lyons OFSTED's National Lead for Economics, Business and Enterprise, explains the importance of underpinning enterprise education with a firm foundation of knowledge rather than just skills. [...]this issues closes with a reminder about how little we all really know about the world around us. Ruth Corderoy, reviewing the book 'Factfulness' by the late Hans Rosling shares his analysis of the poor grasp we have of important quantifiable data such as population growth, levels of immigration, standards of healthcare, despite confidence to the contrary.",

BACKGROUND The purpose of this quality improvement project was to examine the association between regular cumulative quizzes and knowledge retention in nursing doctorate students.Sixteen students in a large midwestern university enrolled in a hybrid nursing research course were assessed with weekly online cumulative quizzes. METHOD Sixteen students in a large midwestern university enrolled in a hybrid nursing research course were assessed with weekly online cumulative quizzes.The mean score of the cumulative weekly quizzes was 94% (SD = 3%). The mean score on the cumulative final was 97% (SD = 3%). Fifteen students who completed an average of 12 of 14 (86%) cumulative weekly quizzes as scheduled passed the course.

    "Abstract": "Introduction To increase the rate of bystander resuscitation, basic life support (BLS) training for schoolchildren is now recommended on a broad level. However, debate continues about the optimal teaching methods. In this study, we investigated the effects of a 90 min BLS training on female pupils’ BLS knowledge and self-confidence and whether learning outcomes were influenced by the instructors’ professional backgrounds or test-enhanced learning. Methods We conducted a cluster randomised, longitudinal trial in a girls’ grammar school in Germany from 2013 to 2014. Pupils aged 10–17 years were randomised to receive BLS training conducted by either emergency physicians or medical students. Using a multiple-choice questionnaire and a Likert-type scale, BLS knowledge and self-confidence were investigated before training (t 0 ), 1 week (t 1 ) and 9 months after training (t 2 ). To investigate whether test-enhanced learning influenced learning outcomes, the questionnaire was administered 6 months after the training in half of the classrooms. The data were analysed using linear mixed-effects models. Results The study included 460 schoolchildren. BLS knowledge (mean number of correct answers) increased from 5.86 at t 0 to 9.24 at t 1 (p<0.001) and self-confidence (mean score on the Likert-type scale) increased from 8.70 at t 0 to 11.29 at t 1 (p<0.001). After 9 months, knowledge retention was good (8.94 at t 2 ; p=0.080 vs t 1 ), but self-confidence significantly declined from t 1 to 9.73 at t 2 (p<0.001). Pupils trained by medical students showed a slight but statistically significant greater increase in the knowledge at both t 1 and t 2 , whereas instructors’ background did not influence gain or retention of self-confidence. Retesting resulted in a marginally, non-significantly better retention of knowledge. Conclusions BLS training led to short-term gains in knowledge and self-confidence. Although knowledge was retained at 9 months after the training session, self-confidence significantly decreased. Interim testing did not appear to impact retention of knowledge or self-confidence. Medical students should be considered as instructors for these courses given their favourable learning outcomes and greater availability.",

    "Abstract": "Objective Virtual reality (VR) objects of fetal ultrasound volumes have been proposed for teaching and learning diagnostic ultrasound. The aim of this study was to determine if VR objects improve learning efficiency and retention of diagnostic ability in fetal ultrasound. Methods Medical students and junior doctors were taught normal and abnormal sonographic fetal brain anatomy using conventional means (video lectures and review articles; control group) or additionally with selected VR objects from a novel fetal brain atlas (Pocket Brain, http://pb.fetal.ch ; study group). Knowledge, speed of recognition and retention of diagnostic ability were tested in multiple‐choice questionnaires 1 and 4 months after teaching, and the results were compared between those taught using conventional means only and those taught using VR objects. Results Participants taught using VR objects answered significantly more questions correctly and solved the tests quicker than those taught using conventional methods only, both 1 and 4 months after teaching. Conclusion The use of VR objects in teaching fetal ultrasound significantly improves learning efficiency and knowledge retention. Copyright © 2018 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "First-time anterior shoulder dislocations (FTASD) provide an opportunity to examine the value of integrating stated-preference data with decision modeling to differentiate between patients whose preferred management strategy involves operative or nonoperative treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a FTASD decision tool intervention with individual preference measurement compared with a text-based control in a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND First-time anterior shoulder dislocations (FTASD) provide an opportunity to examine the value of integrating stated-preference data with decision modeling to differentiate between patients whose preferred management strategy involves operative or nonoperative treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a FTASD decision tool intervention with individual preference measurement compared with a text-based control in a randomized controlled trial.Two hundred respondents between 18 and 35 years of age at risk for experiencing an FTASD were enrolled from the orthopedic clinics and randomized to receive either an interactive decision tool intervention capable of eliciting patient preferences for treatment of an FTASD or a text-based control on shoulder dislocations and treatments. The primary outcome was preference for operative or nonoperative treatment choice. Secondary outcomes included the decisional conflict scale (DCS), stage of decision making, patient activation and engagement, awareness of preference sensitive decisions, knowledge retention, and instrument acceptability. METHODS Two hundred respondents between 18 and 35 years of age at risk for experiencing an FTASD were enrolled from the orthopedic clinics and randomized to receive either an interactive decision tool intervention capable of eliciting patient preferences for treatment of an FTASD or a text-based control on shoulder dislocations and treatments. The primary outcome was preference for operative or nonoperative treatment choice. Secondary outcomes included the decisional conflict scale (DCS), stage of decision making, patient activation and engagement, awareness of preference sensitive decisions, knowledge retention, and instrument acceptability.One hundred respondents were randomized to the intervention and 100 to the control. A total of 154 men and 46 women with an average age of 23.6 years completed the survey. Participants in the intervention group made treatment decisions that aligned more closely with evidence-based recommendations than those in the control group ( P = 0.016). Secondary outcomes showed no difference between intervention and control, excluding several DCS subscales. RESULTS One hundred respondents were randomized to the intervention and 100 to the control. A total of 154 men and 46 women with an average age of 23.6 years completed the survey. Participants in the intervention group made treatment decisions that aligned more closely with evidence-based recommendations than those in the control group ( P = 0.016). Secondary outcomes showed no difference between intervention and control, excluding several DCS subscales.An interactive, preference-based decision tool for treatment of FTASD affects patient decision making by guiding respondents toward treatment decisions that align more closely with evidence-based recommendations in the absence of a consultation with an orthopedic provider compared with a standard-of-care control tool. Additional study is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of this tool on treatment outcomes, patient adherence, and satisfaction.

INTRODUCTION To increase the rate of bystander resuscitation, basic life support (BLS) training for schoolchildren is now recommended on a broad level. However, debate continues about the optimal teaching methods. In this study, we investigated the effects of a 90 min BLS training on female pupils' BLS knowledge and self-confidence and whether learning outcomes were influenced by the instructors' professional backgrounds or test-enhanced learning.We conducted a cluster randomised, longitudinal trial in a girls' grammar school in Germany from 2013 to 2014. Pupils aged 10-17 years were randomised to receive BLS training conducted by either emergency physicians or medical students. Using a multiple-choice questionnaire and a Likert-type scale, BLS knowledge and self-confidence were investigated before training (t 0 ), 1 week (t 1 ) and 9 months after training (t 2 ). To investigate whether test-enhanced learning influenced learning outcomes, the questionnaire was administered 6 months after the training in half of the classrooms. The data were analysed using linear mixed-effects models. METHODS We conducted a cluster randomised, longitudinal trial in a girls' grammar school in Germany from 2013 to 2014.

To investigate whether test-enhanced learning influenced learning outcomes, the questionnaire was administered 6 months after the training in half of the classrooms. The data were analysed using linear mixed-effects models.The study included 460 schoolchildren. BLS knowledge (mean number of correct answers) increased from 5.86 at t 0 to 9.24 at t 1 (p<0.001) and self-confidence (mean score on the Likert-type scale) increased from 8.70 at t 0 to 11.29 at t 1 (p<0.001). After 9 months, knowledge retention was good (8.94 at t 2 ; p=0.080 vs t 1 ), but self-confidence significantly declined from t 1 to 9.73 at t 2 (p<0.001). Pupils trained by medical students showed a slight but statistically significant greater increase in the knowledge at both t 1 and t 2 , whereas instructors' background did not influence gain or retention of self-confidence. Retesting resulted in a marginally, non-significantly better retention of knowledge. RESULTS The study included 460 schoolchildren.

    "Abstract": "This paper aims not only at raising awareness for the preservation of traditional construction techniques and materials when intervening in urban cultural heritage (UCH), but also at demystifying whether or not the integration of traditional seismic strengthening strategies in the renovation process of such assets is economically viable. In Portugal, countless UCH assets have been massively demolished and replaced by modern construction solutions over the last decades. As this phenomenon is contributing both to the mischaracterisation of the existing building stock within the majority of historical centres, and to the gradual loss of knowledge on these construction techniques, it is fundamental to tackle this issue from its very foundations, i.e., by raising the awareness and consciousness of all the involved stakeholders to the need of preserving such techniques and materials as part of the patrimonial value of UCH assets. Hence, in order to investigate the above-mentioned issues, the database created in the framework of the 1998 Azores earthquake by the Regional Secretariat for Housing and Equipment (SRHE) of Faial Island, was herein revisited. By critically handling and analysing this database, it was possible not only to investigate the economic prospects of UCHs assets’ renovation in Portugal, but also to derive new repair cost functions suitable to the Azorean traditional stone masonry building stock, that might be used to support post-disaster emergency plans and the design of risk mitigation strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Considering the urgent need of training to improve standardised management of drug-resistant infectious disease and the lack of evidence on the impact of training, this study evaluates whether training participants' knowledge on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is improved immediately and a year after training. OBJECTIVES Considering the urgent need of training to improve standardised management of drug-resistant infectious disease and the lack of evidence on the impact of training, this study evaluates whether training participants' knowledge on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is improved immediately and a year after training.The study involved 91 MDR-TB healthcare providers (HCPs), including clinical doctors, nurses and CDC staff, who attended a new MDR-TB HCP training programme in Liaoning and Jiangxi provinces, China. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS The study involved 91 MDR-TB healthcare providers (HCPs), including clinical doctors, nurses and CDC staff, who attended a new MDR-TB HCP training programme in Liaoning and Jiangxi provinces, China.A phone-based assessment of participants' long-term retention of knowledge about MDR-TB management was conducted in July 2017, approximately 1 year after training. The proportion of correct responses in the long-term knowledge assessment was compared with a pretraining test and an immediate post-training test using a χ 2 test. Factors influencing participants' performance in the long-term knowledge assessment were analysed using linear regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES A phone-based assessment of participants' long-term retention of knowledge about MDR-TB management was conducted in July 2017, approximately 1 year after training. The proportion of correct responses in the long-term knowledge assessment was compared with a pretraining test and an immediate post-training test using a χ2 test. Factors influencing participants' performance in the long-term knowledge assessment were analysed using linear regression.Across both provinces, knowledge of definitions of drug-resistant TB, standardised MDR-TB case detection protocols and laboratory diagnosis was improved 1 year after the training by 14.5% (p=0.037), 32.4% (p<0.001) and 31% (p<0.001) relative to pretraining. However, compared with immediately after training, the knowledge of the three topics declined by 26.5% (p=0.003), 19.8% (p=0.018) and 52.7% (p<0.001) respectively in Jiangxi, while no significant decline was observed in Liaoning. Additionally, we found that obtaining a higher score in the long-term knowledge assessment was associated with longer years of clinical experience (coefficient=0.51; 95 CI% 0.02 to 0.99; p=0.041) and attending training in Liaoning (coefficient=0.50; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.85; p=0.007). RESULTS Across both provinces, knowledge of definitions of drug-resistant TB, standardised MDR-TB case detection protocols and laboratory diagnosis was improved 1 year after the training by 14.5% (p=0.037), 32.4% (p<0.001) and 31% (p<0.001) relative to pretraining. However, compared with immediately after training, the knowledge of the three topics declined by 26.5% (p=0.003), 19.8% (p=0.018) and 52.7% (p<0.001) respectively in Jiangxi, while no significant decline was observed in Liaoning.

Knowledge decline 1 year after training was observed in one province, Jiangxi, and this may be partly addressed by targeted support to HCPs with fewer years of clinical experience. CONCLUSION Our study, the first to assess knowledge retention of MDR-TB HCPs 1 year after training, showed an overall positive long-term impact of lecture-style group training on participants' knowledge. Knowledge decline 1 year after training was observed in one province, Jiangxi, and this may be partly addressed by targeted support to HCPs with fewer years of clinical experience.",

    "Abstract": "[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 21(6)[e14155] of Journal of Medical Internet Research (see record 2019-44689-001). In the original article, a paragraph from the Results section under the subheading \"Self-Efficacy Perception\" was erroneously duplicated in the Discussion section under the subheading \"Clinical Virtual Simulation in Nursing Education.\" The duplicated paragraph has now been removed from the Discussion.] Background: In the field of health care, knowledge and clinical reasoning are key with regard to quality and confidence in decision making. The development of knowledge and clinical reasoning is influenced not only by students’ intrinsic factors but also by extrinsic factors such as satisfaction with taught content, pedagogic resources and pedagogic methods, and the nature of the objectives and challenges proposed. Nowadays, professors play the role of learning facilitators rather than simple “lecturers” and face students as active learners who are capable of attributing individual meanings to their personal goals, challenges, and experiences to build their own knowledge over time. Innovations in health simulation technologies have led to clinical virtual simulation. Clinical virtual simulation is the recreation of reality depicted on a computer screen and involves real people operating simulated systems. It is a type of simulation that places people in a central role through their exercising of motor control skills, decision skills, and communication skills using virtual patients in a variety of clinical settings. Clinical virtual simulation can provide a pedagogical strategy and can act as a facilitator of knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, improved satisfaction with learning, and finally, improved self-efficacy. However, little is known about its effectiveness with regard to satisfaction, self-efficacy, knowledge retention, and clinical reasoning. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of clinical virtual simulation with regard to knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, self-efficacy, and satisfaction with the learning experience among nursing students. Methods: A randomized controlled trial with a pretest and 2 posttests was carried out with Portuguese nursing students (N = 42). The participants, split into 2 groups, had a lesson with the same objectives and timing. The experimental group (n = 21) used a case-based learning approach, with clinical virtual simulator as a resource, whereas the control group (n = 21) used the same case-based learning approach, with recourse to a low-fidelity simulator and a realistic environment. The classes were conducted by the usual course lecturers. We assessed knowledge and clinical reasoning before the intervention, after the intervention, and 2 months later, with a true or false and multiple-choice knowledge test. The students’ levels of learning satisfaction and self-efficacy were assessed with a Likert scale after the intervention. Results: The experimental group made more significant improvements in knowledge after the intervention ( P = .001; d = 1.13) and 2 months later ( P = .02; d = 0.75), and it also showed higher levels of learning satisfaction ( P < .001; d = 1.33). We did not find statistical differences in self-efficacy perceptions ( P = .9; d = 0.054). Conclusions: The introduction of clinical virtual simulation in nursing education has the potential to improve knowledge retention and clinical reasoning in an initial stage and over time, and it increases the satisfaction with the learning experience among nursing students.

Introduction Teaching emergency medicine residents the principles of obstetric emergencies is a challenging task, as these emergencies are uncommon in general practice and include specific maneuvers for difficult and precipitous deliveries. These requirements are not easy to satisfy in a standard lecture and are labor intensive for small groups. This resource is a board game that leverages near-peer teaching, engages student collaboration, and supports friendly competition.The game was designed to be used by emergency medicine residents and emphasized the evaluation and management of acute issues related to labor and delivery (L&D). To play the game, three to four learners took turns answering questions. Each correct answer was awarded points for forward movement on the game board. The first person to reach the end of the game won. A faculty moderator circulated among the players to clarify questions or answers as needed.

    "Abstract": "Related Article This is a corrected version. See correction statement in: http://www.jmir.org/2019/6/e14155/ Background: In the field of health care, knowledge and clinical reasoning are key with regard to quality and confidence in decision making. The development of knowledge and clinical reasoning is influenced not only by students’ intrinsic factors but also by extrinsic factors such as satisfaction with taught content, pedagogic resources and pedagogic methods, and the nature of the objectives and challenges proposed. Nowadays, professors play the role of learning facilitators rather than simple “lecturers” and face students as active learners who are capable of attributing individual meanings to their personal goals, challenges, and experiences to build their own knowledge over time. Innovations in health simulation technologies have led to clinical virtual simulation. Clinical virtual simulation is the recreation of reality depicted on a computer screen and involves real people operating simulated systems. It is a type of simulation that places people in a central role through their exercising of motor control skills, decision skills, and communication skills using virtual patients in a variety of clinical settings. Clinical virtual simulation can provide a pedagogical strategy and can act as a facilitator of knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, improved satisfaction with learning, and finally, improved self-efficacy. However, little is known about its effectiveness with regard to satisfaction, self-efficacy, knowledge retention, and clinical reasoning. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of clinical virtual simulation with regard to knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, self-efficacy, and satisfaction with the learning experience among nursing students. Methods: A randomized controlled trial with a pretest and 2 posttests was carried out with Portuguese nursing students (N=42). The participants, split into 2 groups, had a lesson with the same objectives and timing. The experimental group (n=21) used a case-based learning approach, with clinical virtual simulator as a resource, whereas the control group (n=21) used the same case-based learning approach, with recourse to a low-fidelity simulator and a realistic environment. The classes were conducted by the usual course lecturers. We assessed knowledge and clinical reasoning before the intervention, after the intervention, and 2 months later, with a true or false and multiple-choice knowledge test. The students’ levels of learning satisfaction and self-efficacy were assessed with a Likert scale after the intervention. Results: The experimental group made more significant improvements in knowledge after the intervention ( P =.001; d =1.13) and 2 months later ( P =.02; d =0.75), and it also showed higher levels of learning satisfaction ( P <.001; d =1.33). We did not find statistical differences in self-efficacy perceptions ( P =.9; d =0.054). Conclusions: The introduction of clinical virtual simulation in nursing education has the potential to improve knowledge retention and clinical reasoning in an initial stage and over time, and it increases the satisfaction with the learning experience among nursing students.",

    "Abstract": "Aim Increasing attacks on healthcare personnel in India have highlighted the need for improved communication between staff and patients. Currently, communication skill workshops target doctors and nurses, overlooking a key player relevant to patient satisfaction—allied health professionals (henceforth, AHPs). This study evaluates the impact of communication skills training for diagnostic laboratory and blood bank personnel on patient satisfaction scores. Method The impact of communication workshop for AHPs was tested through pre-workshop and post-workshop questionnaires to participants that tested how they handle communication with patients. Additionally, participants were also administered the questionnaire 4 months after the workshop to test knowledge retention. In parallel, the change in patient satisfaction towards AHPs was assessed by a pre-workshop and post-workshop patient survey. Results Participants experienced a statistically significant improvement in communication skills, as measured by the pre-workshop and post-workshop questionnaires. This coincided with a significant increase in patient satisfaction scores after the workshop, as indicated by the patient satisfaction survey. The difference in communication skills scores between experienced and inexperienced personnel showed a marked decrease after the workshop, suggesting that such workshops can help inexperienced workers ‘catch up’ with more experienced workers. However, scores of all participants showed a statistically significant decrease after 4 months, suggesting that the use of such workshops can be enhanced through periodic refresher courses. Conclusion Communication workshops for AHPs can play a crucial role in improving patient–hospital relations. These workshops can also help standardise services by bridging communication skill differences between experienced and inexperienced staff.",

    "Abstract": "Research objective To test the relative efficacy of adaptive and fixed simulator training vs. adaptive and fixed computer-based training (CBT) vs. traditional lecture. Methods Ninety-two board certified Family Physicians were given a pretest, followed by training under one of five randomly assigned training conditions: (i) adaptive CBT; (ii) non-adaptive CBT; (iii) adaptive simulator; (iv) non-adaptive simulator; and (v) lecture. Subjects were given a post-test immediately after training and again in 6 weeks. In the adaptive groups, the content presented to subjects was a function of the subjects’ knowledge and performance, under control of a MOODLE LMS. In the lecture component, a physician projected images identical to the images in the CBT component of the study. Results No significant differences ( p = 0.89 for ANOVA) in baseline knowledge between the five groups, based on pretest scores; In each of the five groups, our intervention resulted in immediate changes in knowledge (95% CI), based on analysis of pretest and PostTest1 scores; and, with the exception of subjects with non-adaptive, simulator intervention, all groups had significant decay in knowledge between the first and second post-tests (95% CI). Conclusion Periodic simulator intervention could result in significant knowledge retention over extended periods of time.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study examined whether Motivational Interviewing (MI) follow-up calls improved the extent to which a specific therapeutic technique (Key Word Sign) presented in training was retained and implemented by staff supporting people with an intellectual disability. Method: Thirty-eight residential support workers who attended Key Word Sign (KWS) training were divided into three groups. One group received post training MI follow-up calls, the second received non-MI “check-in control” (CIC) follow-up calls and the third received no follow-up calls. Results: Both follow-up conditions outperformed the no follow-up condition on KWS knowledge retention and use. No significant differences were noted between the MI and CIC condition in this study. Conclusion: The results highlight the value of post-training follow-up in promoting knowledge retention and implementation of skills. Methodological challenges (including treatment fidelity issues across groups) prevented firm conclusions about the impact of MI from being drawn.

Numerous teaching strategies employed in undergraduate pharmacology courses for nursing students have been summarized and compared for their impact on pharmacology knowledge retention, application of pharmacology theory to practice, and student satisfaction. Future directions for research are discussed. Design The review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Data Sources The Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Academic Search Complete, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), and Education Source and Health Reference Centre Academic were searched using key search terms and phrases. Twenty studies, conducted between 2001 and 2017, met the inclusion criteria. Method Quality assessment was made in accordance with two appraisal tools: Kirkpatrick's framework and the Medical Education Research Quality Instrument (MERSQI) for quantitative studies. Results Online, simulation, and integrated methods of teaching pharmacology were most beneficial for pharmacology knowledge acquisition and student satisfaction. Traditional lecture, problem-based learning, and a flipped classroom were least effective strategies for teaching pharmacology to undergraduate students. Conclusions This systematic review will contribute to the body of knowledge used by nurse educators who teach in undergraduate nursing programs, may be particularly useful for undergraduate nursing program directors/administrators who are considering undergoing curricular changes, and may be a conduit for future researchers who wish to design studies aimed at improving teaching and learning within undergraduate nursing education.",

INTRODUCTION Leadership and teaching skills are essential, but not often emphasized, components of medical training. As emergency care develops as a specialty in Uganda, two cadres of providers are being trained: physicians and non-physician clinicians (NPCs). Building formal leadership and educator training into these curricula is essential.A week long continuing education (CE) course on leadership and teaching is described and evaluated for effectiveness using Kirkpatrick's framework for learner-centred outcomes. The emergency care trained NPCs participated in a week-long course consisting of lectures, role-playing, and small group discussions, as well as a personality self-assessment. The evaluation process consisted of: 1) an immediate post-course survey to measure learner satisfaction, 2) a retrospective, pre/post self-assessment with a Likert-type scoring tool to measure knowledge gains, and 3) a three-month follow up survey and structured interviews to measure knowledge retention and behaviour change in practice.

Learner satisfaction was high with an average score of 9.3 (on a 1-10 scale) for course content, amount learned, and use of time. Participants reported gains in knowledge for each of the 24 competencies measured, with an average difference in pre- and post-course Likert scores of 1.11 (on a scale of 1-5). Lastly, all 15 participants shared detailed examples of using course content in practice three months after the course finished. The most frequently mentioned themes were \"giving and receiving feedback,\" \"delegating and assigning tasks,\" and \"communication.\" RESULTS All 15 NPCs participated in the evaluation process.

    "Abstract": "Two-stage collaborative testing is an assessment strategy that involves students initially writing a test individually and then immediately afterward writing the same (or similar) test again in groups. Current evidence shows that twostage testing improves performance on multiple-choice tests as well as short-term retention of material, but little is known about the effect on long-answer questions and retention across a longer time frame. The purpose of this study was to determine (a) if two-stage testing improves performance on both multiple-choice and longanswer questions, (b) if two-stage testing improves short- and longterm knowledge retention, and (c) whether there are differences in knowledge retention based on question type. A two-stage midterm with both question types was administered in two undergraduate science courses, followed by a short-term and long-term retention test. Performance on both question types improved, with comparable improvement on both question types. Two-stage testing also maintained knowledge retention from the original midterm for both question types in the short term, although the learning gains for long-term retention were less apparent.",

    "Abstract": "Focused Cardiac Ultrasound (FoCUS) has proven instrumental in guiding anesthesiologists' clinical decision-making process. Training residents to perform and interpret FoCUS is both feasible and effective. However, the degree of knowledge retention after FoCUS training remains a subject of debate. We sought to provide a description of our 4-week FoCUS curriculum, and to assess the knowledge retention among anesthesia residents at 6 months after FoCUS rotation. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Focused Cardiac Ultrasound (FoCUS) has proven instrumental in guiding anesthesiologists' clinical decision-making process. Training residents to perform and interpret FoCUS is both feasible and effective. However, the degree of knowledge retention after FoCUS training remains a subject of debate. We sought to provide a description of our 4-week FoCUS curriculum, and to assess the knowledge retention among anesthesia residents at 6 months after FoCUS rotation.A prospective analysis involving eleven senior anesthesia residents was carried out. At end of FoCUS Rotation (EOR) participants completed a questionnaire (evaluating the number of scans completed and residents' self-rated knowledge and comfort level with FoCUS), and a multiple-choice FoCUS exam comprised of written- and video-based questions. Six months later, participants completed a follow-up questionnaire and a similar exam. Self-rated knowledge and exam scores were compared at EOR and after 6 months. Spearman correlations were conducted to test the relationship between number of scans completed and exam scores, perceived knowledge and exam scores, and number of scans and perceived knowledge. METHODS A prospective analysis involving eleven senior anesthesia residents was carried out. At end of FoCUS Rotation (EOR) participants completed a questionnaire (evaluating the number of scans completed and residents' self-rated knowledge and comfort level with FoCUS), and a multiple-choice FoCUS exam comprised of written- and video-based questions. Six months later, participants completed a follow-up questionnaire and a similar exam. Self-rated knowledge and exam scores were compared at EOR and after 6 months. Spearman correlations were conducted to test the relationship between number of scans completed and exam scores, perceived knowledge and exam scores, and number of scans and perceived knowledge.Mean exam scores (out of 50) were 44.1 at EOR and 43 at the 6-month follow-up. Residents had significantly higher perceived knowledge (out of 10) at EOR (8.0) than at the 6-month follow-up (5.5), p=0.003. At the EOR, all trainees felt comfortable using FoCUS, and at 6 months 10/11 still felt comfortable. All the trainees had used FoCUS in their clinical practice after EOR, and the most cited reason for not using FoCUS more frequently was the lack of perceived clinical need. A strong and statistically significant (rho=0.804, p=0.005) correlation between number of scans completed during the FoCUS rotation and 6-month follow-up perceived knowledge was observed. RESULTS Mean exam scores (out of 50) were 44.1 at EOR and 43 at the 6-month follow-up.

CONCLUSION Four weeks of intensive FoCUS training results in adequate knowledge acquisition and 6-month knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "A course in introductory psychology (Intro Psych) has potential to cultivate valuable knowledge and skills, especially for first-year students. The present research is a first step at understanding this potential by surveying college seniors who took Intro Psych during their first year. We aimed to discover students’ perspectives on what they learned, a sense of how much they actually retained, and whether students’ course experiences predicted their academic behaviors as seniors. When asked what they learned from the course that helped them in other courses and in life, both majors and nonmajors described how Intro Psych shaped their study skills, knowledge, and perspectives on the social world. In a retest of items from their first midterm, students showed high performance (70% correct) compared to previous studies, with psychology students (majors and minors) showing better performance than nonpsychology students (81% vs. 69%), d = .74. Finally, we found that students’ performance on a multiphase term project in Intro Psych predicted their self-reported project management skills as seniors (r = .32, p < .001). Students’ enjoyment of the course, measured by their evaluations of the instructors, predicted self-reported project management skills (r(148) = .294, p < .001) and also later study skills (r(148) = .266, p < .001). Together, these findings support the importance of Intro Psych and highlight the need to further clarify and expand our knowledge of its long-term impact.

    "Abstract": "Background: This study examined whether Motivational Interviewing (MI) follow-up calls improved the extent to which a specific therapeutic technique (Key Word Sign) presented in training was retained and implemented by staff supporting people with an intellectual disability. Method: Thirty-eight residential support workers who attended Key Word Sign (KWS) training were divided into three groups. One group received post training MI follow-up calls, the second received non-MI \"check-in control\" (CIC) follow-up calls and the third received no follow-up calls. Results: Both follow-up conditions outperformed the no follow-up condition on KWS knowledge retention and use. No significant differences were noted between the MI and CIC condition in this study. Conclusion: The results highlight the value of post-training follow-up in promoting knowledge retention and implementation of skills. Methodological challenges (including treatment fidelity issues across groups) prevented firm conclusions about the impact of MI from being drawn.",

    "Abstract": "Rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is administered for rabies prevention after a human exposure to a potentially rabid animal, such as a bite. Previous studies have reported that rabies PEP is often inappropriately administered. Health professional education was proposed as one potential solution to address inappropriate PEP use. We assessed baseline knowledge, knowledge gain, and knowledge retention among health professionals in Arizona of rabies epidemiology and appropriate PEP administration. Maricopa County Department of Public Health created an online rabies PEP continuing education module and measured knowledge before and after module completion using a 10-question test. The same test was administered three times (pretest, posttest, and retention test at ≥3 months). To assess knowledge gain and retention, we compared median scores using nonparametric methods. A total of 302 respondents completed the pretest (median score, 60%) and posttest (median score, 90%; p < .001); 98 respondents completed all three tests with median scores 60% (pretest), 90% (posttest, p < .01), and 80% (retention test and compared with pretest, p < .01). Sixty-nine (70%) respondents improved their pretest to retention test score by a mean of 2.4 points out of a total 10 points (median: 2 points; range: -5 to 7 points). Only 48% of pretest respondents correctly answered that PEP should not be administered immediately to anyone bitten by a healthy dog. However, 81% and 70% answered correctly on the posttest ( p < .0001) and retention test ( p = .002), respectively. Respondents demonstrated rabies epidemiology and PEP knowledge gain and ≥3-month knowledge retention after completing the online continuing education module.Rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is administered for rabies prevention after a human exposure to a potentially rabid animal, such as a bite.

    "Abstract": "Effective knowledge transfer can improve the work efficiency of project network members. However, as traditional labor-intensive enterprises, construction companies do not pay enough attention to knowledge management, and the characteristics of projects increase knowledge loss to a certain extent. This results in the knowledge-transfer performance of a project network not being ideal and work efficiency reduction. This paper aims to explore knowledge-transfer factors and their relationships in construction project cooperation networks (CPCNs). A framework model and hypotheses were formulated through literature research, theoretical analysis, and practical experience. The authors applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the hypotheses based on a questionnaire survey data set of 210 workers from Chinese construction companies. The results showed that, in the context of Chinese relationships, the temporary nature of projects will not affect knowledge transfer in CPCNs. The urgency of projects will positively affect parts of network members’ knowledge transfer. The relationship between knowledge suppliers and recipients plays a critical role in mediating the influences of project characteristics on knowledge-transfer performance.",

OBJECTIVE This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of portable video media (PVM) compared to standard verbal communication (SVC) as a novel adjunct for surgical education of junior medical officers and medical students, in terms of knowledge acquisition and participant satisfaction.The effective, continued education of final year medical students and junior doctors is the foundation of quality healthcare. The development of new media technologies and rapid internet streaming has resulted in an opportunity for the integration of PVM into medical education. PVM is an educational platform with the advantage of being standardized, efficient, and readily available. BACKGROUND The effective, continued education of final year medical students and junior doctors is the foundation of quality healthcare. The development of new media technologies and rapid internet streaming has resulted in an opportunity for the integration of PVM into medical education. PVM is an educational platform with the advantage of being standardized, efficient, and readily available.This is a multicenter, prospective, and randomized controlled crossover study. Participants completed a preintervention knowledge test and were then randomized in an allocation ratio of 1:1 to receive surgical education regarding cystoscopy and ureteric stenting for acute renal colic via either PVM or SVC. A 32-point knowledge test and a modified Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 were then administered and the participants were then crossed over to the other educational method. The knowledge and satisfaction tests were then readministered. DESIGN This is a multicenter, prospective, and randomized controlled crossover study. Participants completed a preintervention knowledge test and were then randomized in an allocation ratio of 1:1 to receive surgical education regarding cystoscopy and ureteric stenting for acute renal colic via either PVM or SVC. A 32-point knowledge test and a modified Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 were then administered and the participants were then crossed over to the other educational method. The knowledge and satisfaction tests were then readministered.Fifty-four participants were recruited for this study with 27 participants in each group. Both groups had a 18% to 20% increase in knowledge scores following the first intervention p < 0.001 and on crossover there was a further 4% increase in knowledge scores, p < 0.01. There was no significant difference between the groups in knowledge scores before intervention, p = 0.23 after first intervention p = 0.74 or following crossover p = 0.09. After first intervention, participants in the group receiving PVM education first had a significant 8% higher satisfaction score compared to the SVC group, p = 0.023.

Furthermore, PVM was shown to have higher satisfaction scores compared to SVC. Further studies will need to evaluate the use of PVM for education in other surgical and medical domains and assess the long-term knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "Nursing faculty sought to promote students' engagement with course material and their peers by using Kaizen, an online educational game. The purpose of this qualitative study was to learn more about nursing students' perceptions of team competition in an educational game and whether the game promoted their engagement with educational material in one fundamental nursing course. BACKGROUND Nursing faculty sought to promote students' engagement with course material and their peers by using Kaizen, an online educational game. The purpose of this qualitative study was to learn more about nursing students' perceptions of team competition in an educational game and whether the game promoted their engagement with educational material in one fundamental nursing course.Qualitative data collection included focus groups, observations of students, documents showing leaderboards and game participation, and \"status of competition\" e-mails. Data were transcribed and coded to determine emerging themes. METHOD Qualitative data collection included focus groups, observations of students, documents showing leaderboards and game participation, and \"status of competition\" e-mails. Data were transcribed and coded to determine emerging themes.Four themes emerged from data analysis: learning in teams, motivators to play, learning course content, and suggestions for game improvement. RESULTS Four themes emerged from data analysis: learning in teams, motivators to play, learning course content, and suggestions for game improvement.Students were overwhelmingly positive about using a gamified platform for its educational rewards. They perceived that playing the game increased their knowledge retention, and they believed it helped them improve their test-taking skills. [J Nurs Educ. 2019;58(2):79-85.]. CONCLUSION Students were overwhelmingly positive about using a gamified platform for its educational rewards. They perceived that playing the game increased their knowledge retention, and they believed it helped them improve their test-taking skills. [J Nurs Educ. 2019;58(2):79-85.].",

    "Abstract": "The propagation of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications that leverage smartphone technology has increased along with the ubiquity of smartphone adoption. Although AR and VR technologies have been widely utilized in the educational domain, there remains a dearth of empirical research examining the differences in educational impact across AR and VR technologies. The purpose of our exploratory study was to address this gap in the literature by comparing AR and VR technologies with regard to their impact on learning outcomes, such as retention of science information. Specifically, we use a two-condition (AR vs. VR) between-subjects' design to test college students' science-knowledge retention in response to both auditory and visual information presented on a Samsung S4 smartphone app. Our results ( N = 109) suggest that VR is more immersive and engaging through the mechanism of spatial presence. However, AR seems to be a more effective medium for conveying auditory information through the pathway of spatial presence, possibly because of increased cognitive demands associated with immersive experiences. Thus, an important implication for design is that educational content should be integrated into visual modalities when the experience will be consumed in VR, but into auditory modalities when it will be consumed in AR.

    "Abstract": "Research on cognition and emotion during the past 30 years has made reasonable progress in theory, methods and empirical research. New theories of the cognition-emotion relation have been proposed, emotion research has become more interdisciplinary, and improved methods of emotion measurement have been developed. On the empirical side, the main achievement of the past 30 years is seen to consist in the reduction of the set of serious contenders for a theory of emotions. Still, several important issues are not fully resolved, including the computational implementation of appraisal processes, the nature of emotions, and the link between emotions and actions. Also, quantitative theories of the cognition-emotion relation need to be refined and tested, and improved theories of the link between emotions and bodily and facial expressions need to be developed.

    "Abstract": "Research on cognition and emotion during the past 30 years has made reasonable progress in theory, methods and empirical research. New theories of the cognition-emotion relation have been proposed, emotion research has become more interdisciplinary, and improved methods of emotion measurement have been developed. On the empirical side, the main achievement of the past 30 years is seen to consist in the reduction of the set of serious contenders for a theory of emotions. Still, several important issues are not fully resolved, including the computational implementation of appraisal processes, the nature of emotions, and the link between emotions and actions. Also, quantitative theories of the cognition-emotion relation need to be refined and tested, and improved theories of the link between emotions and bodily and facial expressions need to be developed. To counter the dangers of theoretical fragmentation and knowledge loss, more efforts should be devoted to the analysis, reconstruction, comparison and integration of important theories and hypotheses in the field of emotion, as well as to the systematization of arguments in favor and against these theories and hypotheses.Research on cognition and emotion during the past 30 years has made reasonable progress in theory, methods and empirical research.

    "Abstract": "The propagation of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications that leverage smartphone technology has increased along with the ubiquity of smartphone adoption. Although AR and VR technologies have been widely utilized in the educational domain, there remains a dearth of empirical research examining the differences in educational impact across AR and VR technologies. The purpose of our exploratory study was to address this gap in the literature by comparing AR and VR technologies with regard to their impact on learning outcomes, such as retention of science information. Specifically, we use a two-condition (AR vs. VR) between-subjects' design to test college students' science-knowledge retention in response to both auditory and visual information presented on a Samsung S4 smartphone app. Our results (N = 109) suggest that VR is more immersive and engaging through the mechanism of spatial presence. However, AR seems to be a more effective medium for conveying auditory information through the pathway of spatial presence, possibly because of increased cognitive demands associated with immersive experiences. Thus, an important implication for design is that educational content should be integrated into visual modalities when the experience will be consumed in VR, but into auditory modalities when it will be consumed in AR.The propagation of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications that leverage smartphone technology has increased along with the ubiquity of smartphone adoption.

    "Abstract": "Background: Nursing faculty sought to promote students' engagement with course material and their peers by using Kaizen, an online educational game. The purpose of this qualitative study was to learn more about nursing students' perceptions of team competition in an educational game and whether the game promoted their engagement with educational material in one fundamental nursing course. Method: Qualitative data collection included focus groups, observations of students, documents showing leaderboards and game participation, and “status of competition” e-mails. Data were transcribed and coded to determine emerging themes. Results: Four themes emerged from data analysis: learning in teams, motivators to play, learning course content, and suggestions for game improvement. Conclusion: Students were overwhelmingly positive about using a gamified platform for its educational rewards. They perceived that playing the game increased their knowledge retention, and they believed it helped them improve their test-taking skills. [ J Nurs Educ . 2019;58(2):79–85.]",

    "Abstract": "Uganda is a low income country that continues to experience disease outbreaks caused by emerging and re-emerging diseases such as cholera, meningococcal meningitis, typhoid and viral haemorrhagic fevers. The Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was adopted by WHO-AFRO in 1998 as a comprehensive strategy to improve disease surveillance and response in WHO Member States in Africa and was adopted in Uganda in 2000. To address persistent inconsistencies and inadequacies in the core and support functions of IDSR, Uganda initiated an IDSR revitalisation programme in 2012. The objective of this evaluation was to assess IDSR core and support functions after implementation of the revitalised IDSR programme. BACKGROUND Uganda is a low income country that continues to experience disease outbreaks caused by emerging and re-emerging diseases such as cholera, meningococcal meningitis, typhoid and viral haemorrhagic fevers. The Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was adopted by WHO-AFRO in 1998 as a comprehensive strategy to improve disease surveillance and response in WHO Member States in Africa and was adopted in Uganda in 2000. To address persistent inconsistencies and inadequacies in the core and support functions of IDSR, Uganda initiated an IDSR revitalisation programme in 2012. The objective of this evaluation was to assess IDSR core and support functions after implementation of the revitalised IDSR programme.The evaluation was a cross-sectional survey that employed mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. We assessed IDSR performance indicators, knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention and level of confidence in performing IDSR tasks among health workers who underwent IDSR training. Qualitative data was collected to guide the interpretation of quantitative findings and to establish a range of views related to IDSR implementation. METHODS The evaluation was a cross-sectional survey that employed mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. We assessed IDSR performance indicators, knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention and level of confidence in performing IDSR tasks among health workers who underwent IDSR training. Qualitative data was collected to guide the interpretation of quantitative findings and to establish a range of views related to IDSR implementation.Between 2012 and 2016, there was an improvement in completeness of monthly reporting (69 to 100%) and weekly reporting (56 to 78%) and an improvement in timeliness of monthly reporting (59 to 93%) and weekly reporting (40 to 68%) at the national level. The annualised non-polio AFP rate increased from 2.8 in 2012 to 3.7 cases per 100,000 population < 15 years in 2016. The case fatality rate for cholera decreased from 3.2% in 2012 to 2.1% in 2016. All districts received IDSR feedback from the national level. Key IDSR programme challenges included inadequate numbers of trained staff, inadequate funding, irregular supervision and high turnover of trained staff. Recommendations to improve IDSR performance included: improving funding, incorporating IDSR training into pre-service curricula for health workers and strengthening support supervision. RESULTS Between 2012 and 2016, there was an improvement in completeness of monthly reporting (69 to 100%) and weekly reporting (56 to 78%) and an improvement in timeliness of monthly reporting (59 to 93%) and weekly reporting (40 to 68%) at the national level.

Recommendations to improve IDSR performance included: improving funding, incorporating IDSR training into pre-service curricula for health workers and strengthening support supervision.The revitalised IDSR programme in Uganda was associated with improvements in performance. However in 2016, the programme still faced significant challenges and some performance indicators were still below the target. It is important that the documented gains are consolidated and challenges are continuously identified and addressed as they emerge.

    "Abstract": "Organisations are confronted with the challenges of managing, controlling and putting in place retention strategies to mitigate against high turnover intention. This is also the case with public libraries. The purpose of this study was to investigate the determinants of the turnover intention of public librarians at the City of Johannesburg Libraries (COJLIS) in the Gauteng province of South Africa, with a view to developing a retention strategy. Turnover intention can bring devastation to the organisation and can also lead to negative consequences such as decreased morale and productivity, shortage of skilled and qualified librarians, direct and indirect costs to library organisation and loss of knowledge. This quantitative research study utilised the conceptual framework to investigate demographic, personal and organisational factors influencing turnover intentions of librarians. The conceptual framework for the present study incorporated aspects of a theory or theories, concepts from the literature, personal experiences, knowledge of the context and models The aspects of theory or theories and concepts from the literature on employee turnover “content” and “process” models such as Mobley (1977), Jerome (2017), Nair, Mee & Cheik (2016), Perez (2008), Spector (2005), Spector (1997), Price and Mueller (2000) and Price (2001)were modified to suit this study for public librarians at COJLIS. Mobley’s (1977) turnover process model was germane to this study, as it theorises a linear sequence consisting of the following: “dissatisfaction, thoughts of quitting, evaluation of subjective expected utility of job search and costs of quitting, search intentions, evaluation of alternatives, comparison of alternatives and present job, intentions to quit and quitting”. The constituents of the conceptual framework are demographics factors (age, tenure and job designation level), personal factors (job satisfaction and organisational commitment) and organisational factors (payment and fringe benefits, location of workplace, working environment: flexi working hours, perceived alternative employment opportunity, promotion and recognition, personal interaction, supervision and leadership, training and opportunity to utilise skills) as well as turnover intention. This study employed the census method and adopted the cross-sectional survey design method to collect data from 174 librarians working in 89 public libraries and three support sections at COJLIS. Data collection involved the use of a closed-ended questionnaire, as well as analysis documents such as strategic plans and human resource policies. Quantitative data were analysed using the Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) according to the objectives of the study. The researcher conducted a linear regression test to find the instance of correlation between personal and organisational variables, and librarians’ intention to leave their workplace. The findings revealed that demographic determinants (age, tenure and job designation level) are significantly related to turnover intention. Tenure was a highly significant predictor of turnover intention. The major findings to this study were a negative and significant relationship between payment and fringe benefits, working environment: flexi working hours (work-life balance) promotion and recognition towards turnover intention. The study concludes that COLIS may be able to reduce turnover intention through the improvement of factors such as payment and fringe benefit, working environment: flexi working hours (work-life balance) promotion and recognition which would lead to increased job satisfaction and organisational commitment. It is recommended that in order to mitigate turnover intention and increase retention, the talent retention policy, strategy and initiatives should be developed which could incorporate the variables (e.g. payment and fringe benefits, promotion and recognition and training to develop and utilise new skills) of the suggested conceptual talent retention model for COJLIS. A further study to validate a newly developed retention model in COJLIS is recommended.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to explore the knowledge entropy processes within organizations and how they are reflected in the knowledge management and organizational intellectual capital. Entropy is a very powerful concept, which can be found today in almost any branch of science and technology. It was introduced by Rudolf Clausius in 1865 in Thermodynamics, then used in the communication theory by Claude Shannon, and expanded by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen in economics. However, dues to its extensive use in so many different research domains, the concept of entropy became fuzzy and sometimes misleading in applications. Also, its statistical formulations based on the Boltzmann theory made the entropy understanding rather difficult and its interpretations on the edge of coherence. Knowledge entropy is an extension of information entropy and used within the framework of knowledge management. Our conceptual analysis aims to shed light on the appropriate use of knowledge entropy and its potential in knowledge management research and practice. Since knowledge entropy is associated to all transformational processes in knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge loss, we may say that knowledge management can be interpreted as the process of managing knowledge entropy within organizations.",

    "Abstract": "Problemos aktualumas: dantų ėduonies paplitimo rodikliai ir Lietuvoje, ir pasaulyje vis dar siekia didelius skaičius, todėl reikalingas didesnis dėmesys burnos ligų prevencijai. Atliekant taisyklingos burnos higienos mokymus mokyklose svarbu žinoti, kokiu metodu tai atlikti, kad informacija vaikams būtų kuo efektyviau įsisavinama ir turėtų įtakos burnos higienos įpročių teigiamiems pokyčiams. Darbo tikslas: palyginti vaikų žinių apie burnos sveikatą, individualią burnos higieną ir mitybos įpročių įtaką burnos sveikatai įsisavinimą taikant skirtingas mokomąsias priemones. Medžiaga ir metodai: atsitiktinai atrinktose Kauno miesto mokyklose pasirinkti dviejų amžiaus grupių moksleiviai: 9 - 11 metų (I grupė) bei 13 – 15 metų (II grupė). Panaudojant klausimyną, įvertintos mokinių žinios apie burnos higieną, tuomet buvo atliekami burnos higienos mokymai, paskirstant mokinius į du pogrupius: vieni žiūrėjo edukacinį vaizdo įrašą (A grupė), kiti klausėsi tradicinės paskaitos (B grupė). Po mokymų mokiniai dar kartą atsakė į anketos klausimus. Rezultatai: tiek mokymai e-mokymo, tiek tradicinės paskaitos metodu buvo naudingi visiems mokiniams (žinių įvertinimas pakilo nuo 6,90 iki 7,91 balų, p<0,05). Reikšmingai išsiskyrė mokymų efektyvumas pagal amžiaus grupę: I grupės mokiniai geriau pasisavino žinias e-mokymų būdu, II grupės mokiniai – tradicinės paskaitos būdu. Mergaitės žinias įsisavino geriau nei berniukai (balų skirtumas 0,50; p<0,05). Mokymų būdo parinkimas tarp skirtingų lyčių ir mokslų vidurkio nebuvo reikšmingas. Išvados: 1. Vaikų žinios pritaikius skirtingus informavimo metodus buvo geresnės po mokymų nei prieš juos. 2. 9 – 11 metų amžiaus grupėje efektyvesnis mokymų metodas buvo e-mokymo priemone, 13 – 15 metų amžiaus grupėje – tradicinės paskaitos metu (p<0,05). 3. Naudojant abu mokymo metodus mergaitės žinias įsisavino geriau nei berniukai, o mokymų metodo efektyvumo skirtumo lyčių grupėse nenustatyta. 4. Esant aukštesniam akademinio pažangumo vidurkiui, žinių įsisavinimas po mokymų yra geresnis nepriklausomai nuo mokymų metodo (p<0,05), tačiau ryšio tarp skirtingo žinių įsisavinimo metodo ir akademinio pažangumo vidurkio nenustatyta. Alternate abstract: Relevance of the problem: The continuing high prevalence of dental caries on a national level in Lithuania and worldwide signals that more attention should be paid to oral disease prevention, especially at an early age. In order to accelerate the positive dental care changes, and improve overall oral health, it is of vital importance to understand how children retain such knowledge most effectively. The aim of this research project is to compare how well children retain knowledge and information about oral health care and hygiene by using different methods of teaching Material and methods: The two focus groups (children aged 9-11 and 13-15 respectively) were randomly selected from local schools in Kaunas and subsequently divided by teaching method, i.e. e-learning and group lecture. Groups were asked to use questionnaires in order to assess the level of knowledge they had prior to the teaching about oral health care and after the exposure to information. Results: both teaching methods proved to be effective. An overall improvement in understanding was observed, where graded understanding increased form 6.90 to 7.91 on a scale of 1 to 10 (p<0.05). Significant difference of teaching method effectiveness was observed in different age groups: children aged 9 – 11 showed better results after e-learning, while children aged 13 – 15 demonstrated a better understanding after traditional lecture. Female students showed better knowledge retention than male students (score difference 0,50; p<0,05). No correlation was found between gender and students‘ average grade when exposed to different teaching methods. Conclusions: 1. Children knowledge after both teaching programs were better than before. 2. Children aged 9 – 11 responded better to e-learning, whereas children aged 13 – 15 were more responsive to a traditional lecture. 3. Female students showed better knowledge retention than male students with no significant difference in selected teaching method. 4. Greater knowledge retention levels were observed among pupils with higher average grade.",

    "Abstract": "[...]they “think and process information fundamentally differently from their predecessors” (Prensky 2001, 1). While this approach has expanded through the growth of online instruction, literature shows that this form of teaching can result in lower knowledge retention after the course ends (Van Eynde and Spencer 1988) and difficulty in maintaining student attention (Dorestani 2005). According to Zayapragassarzan and Kumar (2012), there are four key strategies to active learning: 1) create individual activities (inside and outside of the classroom); 2) incorporate student paired activities; 3) encourage informal groups; and 3) assign cooperative student projects. In education, it has been defined as “a philosophy and methodology in which educators purposefully engage with students in direct experience and focused reflection in order to increase knowledge, develop skills, clarify values, and develop people’s capacity to contribute to their communities” (Association for Experiential Education, para. 2).",

    "Abstract": "Across the world, sudden cardiorespiratory arrest is one of the main causes of death. Cardiorespiratory resuscitation when performed immediately and correctly may prevent this outcome. Chest compressions in particular are one of the main steps in the survival chain. It is extremely important that these manoeuvres are performed correctly as it increases the victims’ survival success rate. Several studies have shown that the resuscitation technique can be less effective due to the lack of training. The usage of medical simulation tools, such as manikins for autonomous CPR training, in the educational area has been obtaining positive results both in the learning process as well as in knowledge retention. However, there is still lack of training because is an expensive option, which implies the respect of a very tight training schedule. Researchers have been using several approaches to make training CPR more appealing. To this end, they took inspiration from games, since it is a well-known fact that users enjoy them and put them in learning situations. The use of certain game elements in a non-game context, which characterizes gamification, may also promote amore engaged training. The main objective of this thesis was to design and evaluate a gamified approach for CPR training. To this end, a first study aimed to review the literature regarding how serious games for the training of cardiorespiratory resuscitation incorporate the game elements. A second study focused in designing a gamified software for autonomous training of resuscitation using an existing software, named CPR.PT, as a base. And third and final study aimed at evaluating the adopted approach. The literature review revealed that most of the games contribute to knowledge acquisition and learning of CPR, however work still needs to be done, particularly regarding the actual training of important CPR components (depth, recoil). It is also possible to conclude that external hardware components may play an important role in allowing digital games to include the practice of technical skills. The design was developed by identifying and using a gamification framework, named 6D, and resulted in a set of software requisites. Game elements were based in the framework and chosen according to the system needs. Finally, a randomized control trial with health professionals and students was conducted which included training and a pre and post-tests sessions where users answered a questionnaire and were submitted to a practical evaluation on their CPR technical skills. From the results obtained it was possible to conclude that that the system helps to improve the skills of the CPR technique, however it was not possible with this study to distinguish if there is any difference between the two systems. Nevertheless, the opinions expressed in the questionnaires and occasional conversations with the users confirmed that they felt more compelled to train when they had the gamified application with 79% of the professionals and 77% of the students preferring the CPR.PT gamified. This thesis concludes that the use of a gamified software approach can be a feasible solution to promote the interest in training CPR, creating a conducive environment to learning, and better knowledge retention as a consequence of higher training frequency. Alternate abstract: No mundo, a paragem cardiorrespiratória súbita é uma das principais causas demorte. A reanimação cardiorrespiratória quando realizada corretamente e de imediatoé a solução para prevenir estes casos, principalmente as compressões torácicas que éum dos principais passos da cadeia de sobrevivência. É de extrema importância que areanimação seja realizada corretamente pois aumenta a taxa de sobrevivência dasvítimas. Vários estudos demonstram que a técnica de reanimação é menos eficaz devido àfalta de treino. O uso de ferramentas de simulação médica, como os manequins para otreino autónomo de CPR, na área da educação, tem vindo a obter resultados positivostanto no processo de aprendizagem como na retenção de conhecimento. No entanto,ainda existe muita falta de treino, pois é uma opção cara, o que implica um agendamentodos treinos muito rígido. Investigadores têm vindo a estudar diferentes abordagens para tornar o treino deCPR mais atrativo. Desta forma, inspiraram-se nos jogos que, como todos sabem sãoaplicações muito utilizadas e reconhecidas pelos utilizadores, e colocaram-nos emsituações de aprendizagem. O uso de elementos de jogo num contexto não relacionadocom jogos (gamificação) também pode promover um treino mais motivador. O principal objetivo desta tese foi realizar o design e avaliar uma abordagemgamificada para o treino de CPR. Consequentemente, o primeiro estudo teve comoobjetivo rever a literatura de como os jogos sérios para o treino da técnica dereanimação cardiorrespiratória incorporam os elementos do jogo. Um segundo estudofocou-se no design de um software gamificado para o treino autónomo de reanimação,usando um software pré-existente, designado CPR.PT, como base. Em terceiro eúltimo, teve o objetivo de avaliar a abordagem adotada. O design foi desenvolvido através da identificação e utilização de uma estrutura degamificação, de nome 6D, e resultou num conjunto de requisitos de software . Oselementos do jogo foram baseados nessa estrutura e escolhidos de acordo com asnecessidades do sistema. Por fim, foi realizado um estudo de controlo randomizado com profissionais eestudantes de saúde. Este estudo incluiu treinos e sessões de pré e pós-teste, em que osutilizadores responderam a um questionário e foram submetidos a uma avaliaçãoprática das suas habilidades técnicas de CPR. A partir dos resultados obtidos, foi possível concluir que o sistema ajuda a melhoraras habilidades da técnica de CPR, contudo não é possível, com este estudo, distinguirse existe alguma diferença entre os dois sistemas. No entanto, as opiniões expressas nosquestionários e conversas pontuais com os utilizadores, em que 79% dos profissionaise 77% dos estudantes, confirmaram que o CPR.PT gamificado foi o sistema maisinteressante. Esta tese conclui que o uso de uma abordagem de software gamificado pode seruma possível solução para promover um maior interesse no treino de CPR, criando umambiente propício à aprendizagem e uma melhor retenção de conhecimento comoconsequência da realização de treinos mais frequentes.",

Strategic and systematic use of this approach can have beneficial outcome on organizational progressing. Thus, knowledge management appears to be the new main assets when it comes to organizational effectiveness. This work aims to create a valuable insight into knowledge flow insight of the small organization and its effect on their growth. For this purpose, we define Knowledge Management, introduce it inside of a small organization and apply the most effective model of knowledge sharing into that organization. The right model will be chosen after creating and analyzing right survey composed out of 21 questions related to the topic. Finding the right model for knowledge obtained inside of organization presents a great challenge for leaders. In this dissertation, we analyze the best solutions and strategies that could upgrade organizational growth, along with providing new knowledge creating and sharing models but at the same time preventing knowledge loss.",

    "Abstract": "For the past decades, organizations have been investing heavily in BPM projects in the hope of improving their competitive advantage in an increasingly complex environment. However, although it is believed that the higher the level of BPM maturity the greater the success of the organization, experience shows that this relationship is not always possible to prove. The purpose of this study is to help clarify the relationship between the level of BPM maturity and the success of an organization. This was done through the implementation of a case study-based research within a global company that has an operation in Portugal, focusing on the shared services organization. An analysis of the existing BPM maturity models and its level of coverage of BPM core areas was conducted as a way to select the most suitable BPM maturity model to conduct the assessment of the current BPM maturity level of the organization. It was also established a framework to characterize the success of an organization. These two inputs, along with information gathered to understand process improvements that were implemented and its impact in the organization, were the basis for conducting the research. Results show a successful organization, with a high maturity level according to the BPM OMG maturity model, that has been investing in continually improving its processes with a strong focus on digital transformation. The identified benefits from a high level of BPM maturity, namely the improved productivity, cost reduction, error & risk prevention, higher agility, employee upskilling and knowledge retention, were shown to have a positive influence in the majority of the dimensions used to characterize the success of the organization.",

    "Abstract": "Introdução Na PCR extra-hospitalar, o cidadão desempenha um papel de grande importância acionando a cadeia da sobrevivência e iniciando manobras de ressuscitação de forma precoce, aumentando as possibilidades de sobrevivência da vítima. O treino em crianças escolarizadas pode contribuir para aumentar a taxa de reanimação iniciada pelo cidadão. O docente da escola encontra-se numa posição privilegiada para liderar o treino em manobras de ressuscitação. O objetivo deste estudo foi determinar o custo e as consequências da formação em manobras de reanimação do projeto institucional do Hospital Professor Doutor Fernando Fonseca EPE, \"Aprende os 3C's - Salva uma vida\" em crianças escolarizadas entre o 10º e o 12º ano, comparando professores de ensino e profissionais da saúde. Metodologia Foi realizado um estudo de abordagem quantitativa e desenho quási-experimental com avaliação na baseline , imediatamente após a intervenção e três meses depois. Foram comparados os custos do programa e as consequências do treino numa amostra de 362 crianças entre o 10°, 11º e 12º ano numa escola de ensino secundário de Sintra, quando feito por professores (grupo experimental) versus profissionais de saúde (grupo de controlo). O treino consistiu na visualização de um vídeo e a realização de uma prática simulada. Foram avaliadas as dimensões de retenção do conhecimento, demonstração de habilidades práticas e realização de compressões torácicas num manequim. Resultados Existiu melhoria na retenção do conhecimento nos dois grupos de estudo, mantendo esses niveis elevados após dois meses e meio (p-value <0,001). Não se encontraram diferenças significativas entre os grupos ao fim de dois meses e meio (p-value 0,181). No que se refere à demonstração de habilidades práticas, o grupo experimental melhorou aos dois meses e meio face ao treino inicial (p-value 0,002). Essa melhoria foi menor no grupo controlo (p-value 0,596). A diferença das médias para esta dimensão foi favorável para o grupo experimental (p-value 0.013). Na realização de compressões torácicas no manequim de treino, existiu uma ligeira melhoria no desempenho nos grupos, não sendo estatisticamente significativa entre os grupos (p-value 0,074 na primeira ronda e p-value 0,156 na segunda ronda). Foram calculados os custos anuais comparando profissionais de saúde e professores de ensino secundário, observando um horizonte de 5 anos. O programa de formação, quando liderado pelos professores de ensino, teve um custo mais favorável (diferença de custos) em 31.950€ por escola e cerca de 4€ por aluno formado. Discussão e conclusões O programa de formação, quando liderado por professores de ensino secundário, apresenta níveis semelhantes de efetividade da prática simulada na dimensão de retenção do conhecimento, habilidades práticas no treino simulado e frequência das compressões torácicas no manequim, obtidos com um custo mais baixo que a mesma formação liderada pelos profissionais da saúde. Alternate abstract: Introduction In case of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the citizen plays a major role by launching the survival chain and initiating early stage resuscitation maneuvers, increasing the victim's chances of survival. Training school children may contribute to increase the citizen-initiated reanimation rate.School teachers are in a prime position to lead the training in resuscitation maneuvers. The aim of this study was to determine the costs and consequences of the training in resuscitation maneuvers, of the institutional project run by Hospital Professor Doutor Fernando Fonseca EPE,“Aprende os 3C’s – Salva uma vida” in School children between 10th and 12 th grade, comparingthe training provided by teachers versus health professionals. Methodology A quantitative quasi-experimental study was realized with baseline assessment, immediately after intervention, and three months thereafter. The costs of the program and consequences of trainingwere compared on a sample of 362 children between 10th, 1 th and 12 th grade, in a secondary school in Sintra, between performed by school teachers (experimental group) versus health professionals (control group). The training consisted of watching a video and performing a mock exercise. The dimensions of knowledge retention, demonstration of practical skills and performance of chest compressions in a mannequin were evaluated. Results There was an improvement in knowledge retention in both study groups, keeping high levels two and a half months after (p-value <0.001). There was no significant change found between the groups two and a half months later (p-value 0.181). In regard to practical skills, the experimental group improved at two and a half months compared to the initial training (p-value 0.002). This improvement was smaller in the control group (p-value 0.596). The average difference of this dimension was favorable to the experimental group (p-value 0.013). There was a slight improvement in performance in both groups in performing chest compressions on a mannequin, without statistically significant differences between groups (p-value 0.074 in the first round and pvalue 0.156 in the second round). The annual costs were calculated, comparing health professionals and teachers from secondary schools, for a 5-year time horizon. The training program, when led by the teachers, had was 31,950€ cheaper per school and about 4 € cheaperper graduate student. Arguments and conclusions The training program, when led by secondary school teachers, presented similar levels of effectiveness on the simulated practice, knowledge retention, practical skills and frequency of chest compressions on the mannequin, obtained at a lower cost, compared to the same trainingled by health professionals.",

    "Abstract": "Sanayi Devrimi’nden sonraki dönemi ifade eden Antroposen, biyosferin evriminde önemli bir (f)aktör haline gelen insanın etkilerinin yoğunlaştığı ve zehir vasfıyla ortaya çıkan evreyi temsil eder. Yerküre üzerindeki bütün yaşam biçimlerini tehdit eden Antroposen’de insan, küresel ölçekte ve yaşanması güç bir dönemde varoluşunu bir kriz içerisinde bulurken kendi yaşamını da hayatta kalmaya indirgemiş durumdadır. Antroposen bu niteliklerinden ötürü katlanılamaz bir durumu, yaşamı yaşamaya değer kılanın ne olduğunun unutulduğu bir evreyi işaret eder. Antroposen, modern teknolojinin sanayileşme yoluyla gerçekleşen dünya üzerindeki egemenliğinden kaynaklanır ve ekolojik, psişik, sosyal, ekonomik ve özellikle de noetik seviyelerde bir entropi üreterek kendi gelişiminin sorgulamasını engeller. Dolayısıyla Antroposen, sistemli ve büyük ölçekte zehirli karakterini ortaya çıkardığı jeofiziksel evrimin son dönemidir. Jeolojik krizler üzerinden okunabiliecek olan Antroposen’de yalnızca yerküre değil insan da bir krizin içerisinde kendini bulur. Bilginin bütün formları, Antroposen’de adeta sınanır. Bu, yoğun bir entropi artışıyla ortaya çıkan bir proleterleşmedir. Bilgi ile başlayan kayıp, yaşamların yalnızca hayatta kalmak üzerine kurulu olmasıyla arzuya, tekilliğe ve geleceğe-yönelimlere kadar sirayet eder. Bernard Stiegler’e göre noetik varlık olarak insan, geçmişeyönelimlerin içerildiği geleceğe-yönelimleri dışsallaştırarak bireyleşir. Yaşamın bilgisinin yitimi, yaşamın içinde arzunun barınamaması Antroposen’deki geçim temelli olan yaşamların özetidir. Antroposen, arzunun içine düştüğü bu krizden beslenir. Yaşamın arzudan azade yapısında geleceğe-yönelimlerin hiçlik ile dolu olması, bireyleşmenin de yitimi anlamına gelir. Olumsuzlukla ve krizlerle dolu olan Antroposen’den çıkmak, onun ötesine geçmek, sınırlarda düşünmeyi yani hipereleştiriyi gerektirir. Farmakolojik olduğu kadar organolojik bir perspektifle ele alınması elzem olan bu evre, Antroposen’in çağdaş bir okumasıyla mümkündür. Küresel ölçekli bir ihtimam ve tümüyle itinalı bir düşünme, Antroposen özelinde ancak hipereleştiriyle olanaklıdır. Hipereleştiri, farmakonun iyileştirici yani pozitif vasfıyla ortaya çıkartacağı yeni psişik ve kolektif bireyleşme imkânlarını, yeni bir ekonomiyi ve insanın çevresiyle olan ilişkisinin gözden geçirilmesini içerirken birlikte yaşamın da zeminini hazırlar. Çalışma boyunca amaçlanan, entropik karakterli Antroposen’den çıkışın hangi yollarla mümkün olacağını ortaya koyarken Negantroposen’e girişin de yeni bir insan figürü bağlamında olanaklarını göstermektir. Alternate abstract: The Anthropocene, referring to the period after the Industrial Revolution, represents the epoch, in which the effects of human that became a substantial (f)actor through the evolution of the biosphere, and having the characteristic of toxic. Human in the course of the Anthropocene, threatening all forms of life on the sphere, reduced his or her own life to survival, whilst finding his or her existence in a global crisis during an inhospitable period. The Anthropocene, due to these characteristics, points out an unbearable situation as well as an epoch during which it is forgotten what makes life worth living. The Anthropocene originates from the worldwide hegemony of the modern technology actualizing by means of industrialization and it prevents questioning of its own expansion by way of producing an entropy at ecological, psychic, social, economic and especially noetic levels. Therefore the Anthropocene is the last period of the geophysical evolution, during which it uncovers its systematic and widely toxic character. In the Anthropocene which can be discussed through the geological crises, not only the sphere but also human finds himself or herself in a crisis. All forms of knowledge are almost tested in the Anthropocene. This is a proletarianization, emerging along with an intensive increase of entropy. Loss begins with knowledge and spreads over desire, singularity and pretention, since lives are built solely upon survival. According to Bernard Stiegler, human, as a noetic being, is individuated by exteriorizing the pretentions that include retentions. Loss of knowledge of life and desire being unable to subsist in life, summarize the lives based on subsistence in the Anthropocene. The Anthropocene exploits this crisis which desire falls under. Pretentions being full of nihil in the structure of desire liquidation of life amounts also to the loss of individuation. Escaping the Anthropocene, that is full of negations and crises, requires going beyond the Anthropocene itself, thinking within the limits – namely the hypercritique. This epoch which must be discussed with an organological perspective as well as a pharmacological one, is possible through a contemporary approach of the Anthropocene. Care on a global scale and care-fully thought is, specific to the Anthropocene, merely possible by hypercritique. Hypercritique includes new psychic and collective individuation possibilities which pharmakon will bring out due to having the therapeutic –in other words positive– characteristic, a new economy and question of the relationship between human and his or her environment, whilst forming a basis for living together. The study aims to set forth by which means it will be possible to escape the entropic character of the Anthropocene, while pointing out the possibilities of entrance to the Neganthropocene within the context of a new human figure.",

Çalışmada, karma araştırma yöntemlerinden iç içe desen kullanılmıştır. Araştırmanın nicel kısmında öntest-sontest kontrol gruplu yarı deneysel desen kullanılırken nitel kısmında görüşmeler yapılmıştır. Araştırmada, uygun örneklem seçimine gidilerek belirlenen çalışma grubuyla uygulama yapılmıştır. Araştırmanın çalışma grubunu, 2018-2019 eğitim-öğretim yılı İzmir ili Buca ilçesinde orta sosyo-ckonomik düzcyde bir devlet okulunun biri deney (0-33) biri kontrol grubu (n-31) olmak üzere iki 4. sınıfı oluşturmuştur. Uygulama sürecinde dency grubunda, 4. sınıf sosyal bilgiler dersi “İnsanlar, Yerler ve Çevreler” öğrenme alanı konuları, 6 hafta boyunca sınıf dışı eğitim etkinlikleri ve sınıf dışı öğretim yöntemi ilc, kontrol grubunda Sosyal Bilgiler Dersi Öğretim Programı içeriği ve etkinlikleri ile işlenmiştir. Veri toplama aracı olarak İlkokul 4. sınıf “İnsanlar, Yerler ve Çevreler” öğrenme alanı kazanımları kapsamında araştırmacı tarafından oluşturulmuş “Akademik Başarı Testi”, Ulu Kalın ve Topkaya (2017) tarafından geliştirilen “İlkokul 4. Sınıf Sosyal Bilgiler Dersi Tutum Ölçeği” uygulama öncesi öntest ve uygulama sonrası sontest olarak kullanılmıştır. Ayrıca deneysel süreç ile ilgili öğrenci görüşlerini elde etmek için, uygulama sürccinin bitiminde uygulama yapılan öğrencilere “Yarı Yapılandırılmış Görüşme Formu” uygulanmıştır. Deneysel süreç sonrası, uygulama öğretmeni ile görüşme vc deneysel sürcci betimlemek amacıyla araştırmacı günlüğü yoluyla gözlemler gerçekleştirilmiştir. Akademik Başarı Testi, uygulamalar bittikten 4 hafta sonra öğrencilerin bilgilerini hatırda tutma düzeylerini ölçmek için kalıcılık testi olarak uygulanmıştır. Nicel verilerin istatistiksel çözümleri; betimsel istatistikler, bağımsız örneklemler için t-testi ve karışık ölçümler için iki yönlü ANOVA ile yapılmıştır. Nitel verilerin analizinde içerik analizi yapılmıştır. Çalışmanın sonuçlarına göre; sınıf dışı eğitim ctkinlikleri ile sınıf dışında sosyal bilgiler dersini alan dency grubu öğrencilerinin akademik başarı düzeyleri, sosyal bilgiler dersine yönelik tutumları ve bilgilerinin kalıcılık düzeyleri, sınıf ortamında Sosyal Bilgiler Dersi Öğretim Program ve ctkinliklerine göre ders işleyen kontrol grubu öğrencilerinden anlamlı düzeyde yüksek bulunmuştur. Deney grubu öğrencileri ile gerçekleştirilen görüşmelerden, öğrencilerin sınıf dışında görcrek, dokunarak, hissederek kalıcı öğrenmeler edindiği, eğlenerek ve derse aktif katılarak, yaparak-yaşayarak öğrendikleri sonucuna varılmıştır. Öğretmen görüşü vc araştırmacı gözlemleri de bu sonuçları destekler niteliktedir. Sonuç olarak; sosyal bilgiler dersi öğretiminde sınıf dışı eğitim etkinliklerinin uygulanmasının öğrencilerin başarı düzeylerini arttırdığı, derse yönelik tutumlarını ve bilgilerini hatırda tutma düzeylerini olumlu etkilediği belirlenmiştir. Alternate abstract: The aim of this study is to determine the effects of outdoor education activities on social studies lessons in regards to the students‟ academic achievements, their attitudes towards the social studies lesson and their level of recalling the information. In this study, embedded mixed method which is one of the mixed methods is used. In the quantitative part of the study, quasi-experimental design with pretest-posttest control group was used. Interviews were conducted for the qualitative part of method. The research was carried out with the study group using the proper sample selection. The study group of the research consisted of two classes from the 4th grade, one experimental group (n=33) and one control group (n=31) from the government school with the middle socio-economic level in Buca district of Ġzmir province in 2018-2019 academic year. During the process of 6 weeks, with experimental group, the 4th grade social studies course on learning areas “people, places and environments”, outdoor education activities and outdoor teaching methods were carried out, on the other hand, Social Studies Course Curriculum content and activities were carried out with the control group. As a means of collection of the data the “Academic Achievement Test”, created by the researcher within the scope of the learning area “People, Places and Environments” and “The Attitude Scale Social Studies for the 4th grade elementary school” developed by Ulu Kalın and Topkaya (2017) by using the pre-test before practice and posttest after the practice were used. Moreover, in order to obtain the views of the students about the experimental process, “Semi-Structured Interview Form” was applied to the students at the end of the practice process. After the experimental process with the practice teacher interviews and observations through the researcher's diary to describe the experimental process were conducted. The Academic Achievement Test was applied as a retention test to measure the level of students' recalling knowledge 4 weeks after the end of practices. Statistical analyzes of quantitative data were carried out with descriptive statistics, t-test for independent samples and two-way ANOVA for mixed measurements. Content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. In accordance with the results of the study, academic achievement levels, attitudes towards social studies course and persistence level of the knowledge of experimental group of students, taking social studies courses outside the classroom with outdoor education activities, were found to be significantly higher than the control group taking the Social Studies Course and activities in class in accordance with the Social Studies Course Curriculum. It was concluded from the interviews with the experimental group that the students have learned permanently by seeing, touching and feeling outside of the classroom, learning by doing the actual things by having fun and active participation of the lesson. Teachers' opinions and observations of the researcher support these results as well. As a result, it was found out that the application of outdoor education activities in social studies course teaching increased the students' level of success, influenced their attitudes towards the course in a positive way and contributed to the level of recalling their knowledge positively.",

    "Abstract": "Immersive virtual reality (VR) technology has brought many new opportunities for training researchers and students. In the immersive VR environment, trainees can practice tasks which are similar to what they will perform in a physical environment. By repeating the training, trainees will finally get themselves familiar with concepts and operations related to a specific device. Virtual reality technology has several advantages for training researchers or students, such as reducing the cost, increasing the flexibility of the training, as well as protecting the trainees from any potential risk. However, learning from the VR scenario should meet several requirements: first, trainees should indeed learn the expected learning objectives from the virtual training; second, trainees should be able to transfer the knowledge which trainees gained from virtual training to physical scenario; third, trainees should remember these skills well enough compared with the traditional training method. In the traditional training environment, trainees usually follow verbal instructions (lecture) or visual instructions (video tutorial, job manual) as certain training methods. For this research study, we not only tested how much procedural knowledge the trainees could learn from the VR training compared with traditional media training (video plus instruction manual), we also specifically focused on how well the knowledge could retain in a certain amount of time. The finding of this study shows that VR training can help trainees learn procedural knowledge, and also shows that VR training can help enhance procedural knowledge retention in terms of recall error.

    "Abstract": "While blame is not a difficult practice to defend, in part because of its ineradicability in our moral lives, angry blame has been a tougher sell. Critics of angry blame cast it as an unnecessary, punitive, or unproductive practice--one that should be either avoided or abandoned altogether. Against these views, I argue that anger has positive moral value and should remain on the table in our blaming practices. The argument proceeds by identifying a specific mode of angry blame--what I call 'authority-focused resentment'--which is both apt and uniquely valuable in cases in which agents' standing as equals is under threat. Insofar as anger has value in these cases, it should not be dismissed wholesale in favor of other blaming alternatives, as anger's staunchest critics would recommend. For all the virtues of anger, it is not equally accessible to all. In final chapter of the project, I identify a distinct kind of harm that happens to oppressed agents when their anger fails to receive uptake. While feminist accounts of anger's dismissal have tended to focus on its epistemic dimensions, I shift to consider the damage to oppressed subjects' moral agency. I argue that what is going on in the dismissal of marginalized agents' anger is not merely the loss of knowledge or the dismissal of testimony. Instead, we need a different paradigm to conceptualize the dismissal and its harms. If we understand angry blame as an invocation or an assertion of authority, then its dismissal is a refusal to comply and to recognize our authority as subjects--an altogether different problem.

    "Abstract": "員工是組織最重要的資產，一旦員工離職將使組織人力、財力和專業知識流失。護理人員佔醫院中員工比例最高的一群，人力的質與量將決定組織的表現，但其惡劣的工作環境與高離職率卻是時有所聞，處於競爭且動態的工作環境下，如何降低離職率是人資人員需面對的急迫性挑戰。有鑑於此，本研究使用問卷調查法，針對人力問題最急迫的手術室相關單位護理人員施測，探討組織氣候、工作壓力、壓力因應行為與離職傾向之間的影響差異。本研究共發放317份問卷，回收285份，有效樣本為271份，研究結果顯示改善組織氣候、工作壓力及壓力因應行為使用頻率能降低離職傾向，壓力因應行為不受組織氣候及工作壓力的影響，變項之間沒有中介效果。本研究結果可作為醫學中心護理人員擬定改善方案的參據，以利後續組織發展與改革。 Alternate abstract: Employees are the most important assets of an organization. Once an employee leaves, it will lead to labor wastage, higher cost and professional knowledge loss of the organization. Nurses account for the highest proportion of employees in the hospital, and their quantity and quality will determine the organizational performance. However, the poor work environment and high turnover rate are well known. In a competitive and dynamic work environment, how to reduce the turnover rate is an urgent challenge for human resource specialists. In view of that, this study used questionnaire survey method and 317 nurses working in the operating rooms and related units where the most urgent manpower problem happens participated in the study. In order to investigate the relationships among organizational climate, work stress, coping behaviors and turnover intention, an analysis of structural equation modeling was conducted and showed that (1) improving the organizational climate, work stress and coping behaviors could reduce the turnover intention; (2) coping behaviors would not be affected by organizational and work stress; (3) there was no mediating effects between dimensions. The result of this study can be used as a reference for medical center to plan an improvement strategy and provide an overview for the development and change of organization.",

    "Abstract": "Changes in workplace demographics in the oil and gas industry have raised a concern about the risks of a knowledge-loss crisis due to mass retirement. The industry response has often consisted of strategies aimed at mapping knowledge across organizational units, codifying knowledge in databases, and mentoring new staff. However, such common managerial responses show important limitations in terms of grasping tacit and network-based dimensions of knowledge in complex oil production operations. Therefore, there is an industrial need for innovative knowledge management practices. In this conceptual article, we look at the knowledge-loss crisis from the perspective of network resilience in complex systems. A central assumption here is that it is important to look at retiring staff not only in terms of their explicit knowledge, but also in relation to their roles in evolving networks of interactions. Why do some social systems adapt to the departure of some individuals, recover from eventual knowledge-loss crises, and keep performing its functions? From an anticipatory logic, network analysis may show the initial conditions of a system and identify possible loss scenarios. From an adaptive logic, network analysis may inform interventions aimed at facilitating processes of interactions from which new knowledge may emerge and spread. Integrated operations may be a step in this direction.",

    "Abstract": "Initially funded as part of the Jisc Data Spring Initiative, a team of stakeholders (publishers, data repository managers, coders) has developed a simple workflow to streamline data paper submission. Metadata about a dataset in a data repository is combined with ORCID metadata about the author to automate and thus greatly reduce the friction of the submission process. Funders are becoming more interested in good data management practice, and institutions are developing repositories to hold the data outputs of their researchers, reducing the individual burden of data archiving. However, to date only a subset of the data produced is associated with publications and thus reliably archived, shared and re-used. This represents a loss of knowledge, leading to the repetition of research (especially in the case of negative observations) and wastes resources. It is laborious for time-poor researchers to fully describe their data via an associated article to maximise its utility to others, and there is little incentive for them to do so. Filling out diverse submission forms, for the repository and journal(s), makes things even lengthier. The app makes the process of associating and publishing data with a detailed description easier, with corresponding citation potential and credit benefits.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to explore the knowledge entropy processes within organizations and how they are reflected in the knowledge management and organizational intellectual capital. Entropy is a very powerful concept, which can be found today in almost any branch of science and technology. It was introduced by Rudolf Clausius in 1865 in Thermodynamics, then used in the communication theory by Claude Shannon, and expanded by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen in economics. However, dues to its extensive use in so many different research domains, the concept of entropy became fuzzy and sometimes misleading in applications. Also, its statistical formulations based on the Boltzmann theory made the entropy understanding rather difficult and its interpretations on the edge of coherence. Knowledge entropy is an extension of information entropy and used within the framework of knowledge management. Our conceptual analysis aims to shed light on the appropriate use of knowledge entropy and its potential in knowledge management research and practice. Since knowledge entropy is associated to all transformational processes in knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge loss, we may say that knowledge management can be interpreted as the process of managing knowledge entropy within organizations.",

    "Abstract": "While blame is not a difficult practice to defend, in part because of its ineradicability in our moral lives, angry blame has been a tougher sell. Critics of angry blame cast it as an unnecessary, punitive, or unproductive practice—one that should be either avoided or abandoned altogether. Against these views, I argue that anger has positive moral value and should remain on the table in our blaming practices. The argument proceeds by identifying a specific mode of angry blame—what I call “authority-focused resentment”—which is both apt and uniquely valuable in cases in which agents’ standing as equals is under threat. Insofar as anger has value in these cases it should not be dismissed wholesale in favor of other blaming alternatives, as anger’s staunchest critics would recommend. For all the virtues of anger, it is not equally accessible to all. In final chapter of the project, I identify a distinct kind of harm that happens to oppressed agents when their anger fails to receive uptake. While feminist accounts of anger’s dismissal have tended to focus on its epistemic dimensions, I shift to consider the damage to oppressed subjects’ moral agency. I argue that what is going on in the dismissal of marginalized agents’ anger is not merely the loss of knowledge or the dismissal of testimony. Instead, we need a different paradigm to conceptualize the dismissal and its harms. If we understand angry blame as an invocation or an assertion of authority, then its dismissal is a refusal to comply and to recognize our authority as subjects—an altogether different problem.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Spaced learning (SL) and experiential learning (EL) have been identified as being more efficient to long-term knowledge retention than other forms of learning. The purpose of this paper is to confirm these benefits of SL and EL in a work-based learning environment. Design/methodology/approach This case study research monitored changes in learning outcomes of a work-based EL training, the Model Warehouse, when adding SL. The Model Warehouse of the Karlsruher Institute for Technology, Germany intends to educate professionals in lean warehouse logistics. Following a pragmatic standpoint, two groups of students were considered and compared by using multiple-choice question based knowledge tests where one group participated in an additional SL session. The experiences and perceptions of students were assessed by conducting in-depth interviews. Findings Findings revealed that adding SL to the EL training resulted either in students’ knowledge retention or knowledge improvement. Additionally, participants of the SL session did not perceive it as being required to strengthen understanding of lean warehouse management. Practical implications This study recommends considering SL as an effective means to significantly enhance long-term knowledge retention of any work-based or EL training. Originality/value This study confirms the benefits of SL and EL drawn from laboratory-based studies in a real business context. Adopting both learning theories in training programmes which converge with realities of the workplace results in a significant improvement of long-term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of role playing as an applied learning technique for enhanced classroom experiences as compared to traditional lecture methods. Design/methodology/approach This study uses the pre-test/post-test design to conduct experiments with several control and experimental groups. Subjects are graduate students in an MBA program at a private, non-profit university in a traditional classroom setting. Findings Students in the experimental group gained significantly more knowledge (post-test minus pre-test scores) – 45 percent higher – through participation in the role playing exercise as compared to the control group. Research limitations/implications This study represents only a single educational discipline explored using a single role playing learning activity. Impacts on the long-term retention of the knowledge should be studied further. Practical implications Educators should enhance their classroom experience with more applied learning activities such as role playing in order to increase knowledge gain and potentially longer knowledge retention. Originality/value This study uses a customized role playing activity within a business curriculum as one of many applied learning techniques. The value to students was shown by significantly higher gain in knowledge while simultaneously enhancing their enjoyment of the classroom experience to potentially encourage further lifelong learning.",

    "Abstract": "The primary purpose of this study was to determine if WebVR enhances the knowledge retention regarding mechanical components of high-risk moving machinery, specifically elevators. There were 23 participants divided into a treatment group and comparison group. The treatment group used WebVR to take a virtual elevator machine room tour while the comparison group studied printed images of the same elevator machine room. These alternative activities were conducted prior to a field trip to a real elevator machine room. Gains in knowledge pre to post were measured and compared between the treatment and comparison groups. The research findings showed an overall gain in knowledge for the participants in the elevator bootcamp. More in depth analysis showed the treatment group exhibited significant gains for six of the ten knowledge areas while the comparison group exhibited significant gains in three of the ten targeted knowledge areas. The treatment group gained more knowledge on components higher than eye-level while the comparison group scored better on components that were below eye-level or on the floor. Both groups were seen actively engaged in the field trips. The treatment group members exposed to the virtual reality elevator machine room frequently referred to what they saw in the WebVR while the comparison group did not refer to their printed images while on an actual tour of the elevator machine room. Virtual reality training of this type has the potential to improve basic knowledge and safety trainings. Added, it provides trainings to large numbers of people across the globe who would otherwise not receive such training. This type of training has the potential to save the lives of workers in high risk electro-mechanical spaces and similar settings in different industries.",

    "Abstract": "Jesus-characters are most often created as a reflection of their authors, and the author/s of the text traditionally known as “The Gospel According to Matthew” is no different. Matthew creates a Jesus that is focussed on knowledge retention, interpretation, and dissemination. Throughout the text, they set up different scribe-characters as foils for Jesus, so that Jesus’s superior ability to interpret and teach the Hebrew writings can be displayed. Like ben Sira, Matthew creates an “ideal scribe” in their Jesus, and also displays the characteristics of the “ideal scribe” in the composition of the text. This scribe is an able teacher, has complete knowledge of the Hebrew prophecies and the Law, and has been granted, from a divine source, the ability to correctly interpret their knowledge. Matthew’s biography is a creative work, formed by re-working sources and use of original material. The author/s interest in the nature of prophecy and divine knowledge is distinct from other Jesus-biographies, which is displayed by creation of composite prophetic quotations, a requirement for verbatim fulfillment of prophecy, and use of dream-revelations. These are Greco-Roman literary techniques, and Matthew’s biography, alongside other biographies of Jesus, should be imagined to have the same compositional process as other texts of its period and genre.",

    "Abstract": "The utilization of media to improve instructing and learning supplements conventional ways to deal with learning. Viable guidance fabricates between understudies' information and the learning destinations in mathematics. Through the using of media, it engages students, aids them in knowledge retention, as well as motivates them. This study assessed the extent of instructional media utilization and the academic performance of the Grade 3 pupils in mathematics in a public elementary school, Cebu City, Philippines. The quantitative research method is being used in the study were data gathered through a variety of measurements treated, including the approval letter, parent's consent, and the respondent's survey checklist. The study revealed that teachers do not fully utilize the library and the audiovisual room of the school. It was concluded that the academic performance of the pupils are not based on how the teacher utilized the instructional media. The researchers recommend that the proposed enhancement plan be used and monitored.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigated the effects of temporal distribution of practice on the learning and retention of Mandarin tonal word production. Eighty native English-speaking adults with no prior knowledge of a tonal language participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions varying in intersession interval (ISI) and retention interval (RI): Condition A with a 1-day ISI and a 1-week RI, Condition B with a 1-day ISI and a 4-week RI, Condition C with a 1-week ISI and a 1-week RI, and Condition D with a 1-week ISI and a 4-week RI. Participants underwent 3 training sessions followed by a final retention test. Results showed that the effects of ISI and RI differed depending on the type of knowledge to be retained. For the retention of declarative knowledge, RI had a robust effect: the longer the RI, the worse the retention. Compared to shorter spaced practice (1-day ISI), longer spaced practice (1-week ISI) seemed to improve long-term retention (4-week RI) of declarative knowledge; however, this ISI effect was much weaker. For procedural knowledge retention, ISI played an important role, but not RI, and it was the shorter spaced practice schedule that had an advantage over the longer spaced practice schedule.",

This study focuses on effects of b-learning and face-to-face (F2F) on college students' engagement and retention in QBASIC programming. The study adopted quasi-experimental design with non-equivalent group research design. QBASIC Programming Achievement Test (QBPAT) and College Students' Engagement Questionnaire (CSEQ) were instruments used for data collection. Results showed that the treatment groups' retention mean score was significantly higher than the control group. Findings further showed that b-learning facilitated college students' engagement and improved knowledge retention in QBASIC programming compared to their counterparts in the F2F group. It was recommended that faculty members should adopt innovative teaching pedagogies such as b-learning to promote students' engagement and retention in the learning process.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To systematically review current literature to determine whether active learning is more successful than passive learning at producing cognitive skills in health care professions students. Data Sources: An electronic search was conducted in 4 databases: EBSCO-CINAHL, EBSCO-Sport Discus, Educational Resources Information Center, and PubMed. Search terms included: millennial AND health education, active learning AND knowledge retention, flipped classroom AND learning outcomes, problem based learning AND learning outcomes, problem based learning AND student confidence, active learning AND critical thinking, higher order thinking AND active learning. Study Selection: We included studies if they were published in English between 2007 and 2017 and evaluated outcomes of an active learning intervention. Studies of nonhealth care disciplines, practicing health care practitioners, or studies that did not address the primary research questions were excluded. Data Extraction: Study design, health care discipline, intervention used, assessment measures, outcome(s) measures, main results, and conclusions were extracted from each article, as appropriate. Data Synthesis: Articles were categorized based on capacity to answer 1 or both of the research questions. Conclusions were summarized according to the learning technique used and its effectiveness in regard to studied learning outcome. Out of 85 studies on lower-order cognition, 61 (72%) indicated active learning techniques were effective at achieving improved recall, understanding, and/or application of course material. Of 69 studies on higher-order cognition, 58 (84%) supported active learning over passive instruction for improving students' confidence in or performance of analytical, evaluative, and creative skills. Conclusions: Active learning produces gains to both lower- and higher-order cognition at levels equal to, and more often, greater than the use of passive learning methods. Despite this evidence, we believe more high-quality, well-designed prospective studies using validated assessment measures are needed to endorse the value of these methods in producing cognitive skills.",

    "Abstract": "While traditional models of training such as behavioral modeling (BMT) have been found to enhance training transfer, research suggests that more active learning strategies such as error management (EMT) and team-based learning (TBL) may be more effective. This paper analyzes BMT, EMT and TBL strategies to train employees on new enterprise resources planning (ERP) software and discusses which training leads to successful procedural and declarative knowledge transfer, knowledge retention and application, and tangible business outcomes. TBL was predicted to be the most effective training type, as it models several components needed to use ERP software in the actual job setting. Overall and procedural knowledge as well as knowledge application scores improved most for TBL participants, while declarative knowledge improved the most in the EMT condition. During training, all conditions showed significant improvement in knowledge application; however, the TBL condition showed the highest knowledge application gains. This paper discusses the elements of TBL that support its use as an effective strategy to increase knowledge transfer in an organizational context.",

    "Abstract": "Medical programs are under pressure to maintain currency with scientific and technical advances, as well as prepare graduates for clinical work and a wide range of postgraduate careers. The value of the basic sciences in primary medical education was assessed by exploring the perceived clinical relevance and test performance trends among medical students, interns, residents, and experienced clinicians. A pilot study conducted in 2014 involved administration of a voluntary 60-item multiple-choice question test to 225 medical students and 4 interns. These participants and 26 teaching clinicians rated the items for clinical relevance. In 2016, a similarly constructed test (main study) was made a mandatory formative assessment, attempted by 563 students in years 2, 4, and 6 and by 120 commencing general practice residents. Test scores, performance trends, clinical relevance ratings, and correlations were assessed using relevant parametric and nonparametric tests. Rank order and pass-fail decisions were also reviewed. The mean test scores were 57% (SD 7.1) and 52% (SD 6.1) for the pilot and main studies, respectively. Highest scores were observed in pathology and social sciences. Overall performance increased with increasing year of study. Test scores were positively correlated with perceived relevance. There were moderate correlations (r = 0.50-0.63; P < 0.001) between participants' scores in the basic science and summative exams. Assessments may be key to fostering relevance and integration of the basic sciences. Benchmarking knowledge retention and result comparisons across topics are useful in program evaluation.",

    "Abstract": "Recent findings have provided strong evidence that retrieval-based learning is an effective strategy for enhancing knowledge retention and long-term meaningful learning, but it is not a preferred learning strategy for the majority of students. The present research analyzes the application of learning gamification principles in online, open-book, multiple-choice tests in order to motivate students to engage in repeated retrieval-based learning activities. The results reveal a strong positive correlation between the number of successful retrieval attempts in these tests that cover content from the course textbook, and long-term knowledge retention as demonstrated in a live, final, closed-book, cumulative exam consisting of multiplechoice, labeling, definitions, and open-ended questions covering the content of both textbook readings and lectures. The presented results suggest that online, open-book tests designed using gamification principles, even when covering partial course content and one type of questions, are an effective strategy for using educational technology to motivate students to repeatedly engage in retrieval-based learning activities and improve long-term knowledge retention, regardless of the course delivery mode.",

The study adopted quantitative approach through questionnaire to collect data randomly from the sample of two hundred and seventy six (N=276) research scientists. The study revealed that cross-functional project teams and mentoring were the main knowledge management resources and techniques used to derive research and innovations in the institutes. Findings also show that the knowledge management initiatives adopted in the institutes include, identification of existing knowledge, improving documentation of existing knowledge, changing of the organisational culture, improving cooperation and communication, externalisation, i.e. tacit to explicit, improving knowledge retention, and improving innovations management. The study concludes that the knowledge management resources and techniques used are capable of enhancing the various knowledge management initiatives adopted in the institutes.",

Knowledge employees are the most important resources in the era of knowledge economy. Because knowledge employee have more knowledge and have the ability to create new knowledge, they have strong liquidity, which can cause their value to be lost. On summarizing the concept and origin of knowledge employee, value-loss feature and its causes of knowledge employees is discussed. Based on the concept of utility in economics, the utility model of knowledge employees is analyzed, and the equilibrium model of vulnerability of knowledge employees is presented based on utility analysis in this paper",

    "Abstract": "This study reviews knowledge management as a construct for analysing strategy discourse; identifying key strategy artefacts; and how they may be interpreted by key stakeholders engaged in strategy discourse. The context of this study is set initially in three case studies that illuminate the nature of storytelling and narrative as a strategy discourse. In seeking to clarify the nature of storytelling and narrative and the import of social architecture, further enquiry was required. The importance of storytelling and narrative in the development of strategy is recognised. In developing the notion of strategy as a people orientated construct, this study provides a theoretical foundation for the determination of how actors in strategy may take a position on strategy. To understand the nature of strategy discourse, this study reviews the field of semiotics, as a form of social constructivism, and its importance in revealing the way artefacts in strategy discourse may be interpreted as it regulates behaviour towards establishing a position in relation to strategy. Some readers of strategy have flirted with the notion of semiotic theory in the field of strategy discourse, but the flirtation is fleeting and does not attempt to read strategy from a semiotic locus. In this study, the focus is on the way strategy conversation changes as the nature of the story is changed. This locus revealed a knowledge gap in current literature and therefore the relevance of this study. The mixed methodology in this study draws upon existing semiotic theory to explicate strategy as a story of intent; with a focus on the semiotic components; the artefacts; and the vocabulary of strategy discourse that so determine how actors in strategy take a position on strategy. This study uses three case studies as the genesis for this investigation, rooted in the academic fieldof knowledge management to set the context of this study on Semiotics of Strategy. These studies are practice based and define an organisational model of the social interactions affecting knowledge transfer within organisations arising from problems of knowledge location, knowledge retention; and knowledge transfer. The research framework chosen to achieve the research aims of this study, includes using Q Methodology,and the complexity of the Q Sort data demanded a logical and consistent analysis of the data to triangulate a semiotic view of strategy discourse. This ontological approach captures the epistemological characteristics of strategy artefactsinterpreted by the Senior Management Team, as actors, at Solent University. This research project underpins the value of a semiotic view as a diagnostic tool to determine the position that actors take in the context of existing strategy discourse. From an etymological perspective this study posits a typology based upon a semiotic framework to help diagnose how actors take a position based on their interpretation of key strategy artefacts; and to understand the nature of interpretation as a means of intervention by which the strategy narrative may be reshaped. What is of interest is how storytelling and narrative empowers individuals as they seek to disseminate and transfer knowledge from the past in order to shape the future. This study reveals the inflection that individuals may exert on knowledge artefacts; and the motivation of those who trade in knowledge assets, through storytelling and narrative, as players in the game of strategy search for coping strategies in an attempt to adapt to the new reality. Ultimately this study provides new insight into the power of semiotics in the early stage; and constructivism in the later stages of the knowledge management continuum; and describes how participants in strategy adopt a position on strategy.",

    "Abstract": "The Malaysian construction industry has been urged by the government to implement BIM to become a stable, developed, and modernised country by the year 2020. In the Malaysian context, research has shown that BIM implementation is relatively low and is still facing some challenges. Lack of understanding and knowledge remains a significant barrier to BIM adoption. Meanwhile, knowledge sharing (KS) is acknowledged as the essence of technological capability development to start the dissemination process, preventing the loss of knowledge and lessons learned, and also to increase operational efficiencies. The practice of knowledge sharing will enable learning development in implementing BIM. This will potentially help to avoid the same problems that other organisations have faced, hence speeding up a successful BIM implementation process. However, there seems to be little effort in developing a knowledge sharing framework for BIM implementation. Therefore, this study attempted to expand the literature and to support improvements in construction organisations by developing a framework of intra-organisational knowledge sharing practices for an effective implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the Malaysian construction industry. This study explored and identified the critical factors of knowledge sharing as the main components of the framework. Since BIM is relatively new within the Malaysian construction industry, a few steps were taken to identify a suitable organisation that has an understanding of BIM and fulfil the research scope. The first step was through a review of implementation cases in publications. The second was by a direct conversation with a gatekeeper who is incharge of monitoring the development of BIM in Malaysia, and thirdly through preliminary interviews with thirteen (13) organisations identified from all the three steps taken. However, only nine (9) responded, and six (6) matched the scope of this study. This study uses multiple-case studies as a research strategy for the primary data collection through semi-structured interviews with nine (9) respondents across six construction organisations that have implemented BIM in Malaysia. Content analysis techniques were used to analyse data from each case study before it was crossanalysed to determine further results. Then, the findings were discussed and theoretically validated to produce a preliminary framework. Consequently, the final framework was presented after the preliminary framework was validated via peer interviews supported with a questionnaire survey. The framework outlines three elements (people, process, and technology), which consist of eight practices and 32 KS components according to their KS ranking in implementing BIM. Each of the practice describes the KS requirement that the organisation needs to develop to allow the success of knowledge sharing in implementing BIM. It highlights the need for organisations to focus their efforts on eight essential practices; Leadership and management support, Team characteristics and organisation, Individual attitudes and personality, Communication and collaboration, Policy, Operational, IT infrastructure and Appropriate tools. The framework could be used to guide the construction organisations to identify the capability of the organisation in determining the requirement of knowledge sharing practices in implementing BIM. This will improve the workflow and speed up the successful implementation process of BIM in Malaysia.",

    "Abstract": "Serious games have become increasingly available to educators. Empirical studies and meta-analyses have examined their impact on learning achievement. However, natural sciences could have a special relation to serious games by their systematic use of quantitative and predictive models that can generate microworlds and simulations. Since no known meta-analysis on serious games observed a significant impact in the specific context of science learning, the present meta-analysis synthesised results from 79 empirical studies that compared the impact on science learning achievement of instruction using serious games versus instruction using more conventional methods. Consistent with theory and past meta-analyses not specifically related to science learning, post-instruction learning achievement was weakly to moderately higher for declarative knowledge, knowledge retention and procedural knowledge for students taught with serious games. Furthermore, findings of the present work suggest that five moderator variables produced significant effects on the relationship between playing serious games and learning outcomes, and three showed consistent variations in mean effect size that could lead to significance, with more studies and larger samples. These findings are discussed in connection with previous meta-analyses' findings, potential pedagogical implications and possible future research.",

    "Abstract": "Students in undergraduate premedical anatomy courses may experience suboptimal and superficial learning experiences due to large class sizes, passive lecture styles, and difficult-to-master concepts. This study introduces an innovative, hands-on activity for human musculoskeletal system education with the aim of improving students' level of engagement and knowledge retention. In this study, a collaborative learning intervention using the REFLECT (augmented reality for learning clinical anatomy) system is presented. The system uses the augmented reality magic mirror paradigm to superimpose anatomical visualizations over the user's body in a large display, creating the impression that she sees the relevant anatomic illustrations inside her own body. The efficacy of this proposed system was evaluated in a large-scale controlled study, using a team-based muscle painting activity among undergraduate premedical students (n = 288) at the Johns Hopkins University. The baseline knowledge and post-intervention knowledge of the students were measured before and after the painting activity according to their assigned groups in the study. The results from knowledge tests and additional collected data demonstrate that the proposed interactive system enhanced learning of the musculoskeletal system with improved knowledge retention (F[subscript (10,133)] = 3.14, P < 0.001), increased time on task (F[subscript (1,275)] = 5.70, P < 0.01), and a high level of engagement (F[subscript (9,273)] = 8.28, P < 0.0001). The proposed REFLECT system will be of benefit as a complementary anatomy learning tool for students.",

    "Abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) provides exciting opportunities for advancing the design and practice of classroom instruction. AR can facilitate unique opportunities for students to conceptualise, understand and recall learning content. AR offers students contextual learning experiences. These views suggest that AR can assist in reducing distances between learner's knowledge and what they need to understand. In my senior music classroom, I tested these ideas, wanting to see if students, through using AR, could visualise relationships between component parts, describe their function and use that knowledge in practice. The focus centred on students need to construct a sound system for performance in a Year 12 music class (16-17 years old). The project question was; Would AR aid the understanding and conceptualisation of content and develop the quality and retention of their learning? Through observation, interviews and a questionnaire, I used these data to understand levels of knowledge retention, conceptualisation and understanding of content. Findings indicate that while students displayed content conceptualisation skills, they also showed secure knowledge retention in line with previous studies. An encouraging finding suggests that in using AR, students retained what they had learned, remembering the function and use of various components after one learning experience. The potential impact of new and emerging technologies such as AR on student progress and instructional design is exciting, offering alternative ways of delivering and mediating learning content and concepts that connect with teaching and learning.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of using communication technologies in teaching of attainments related to global education in social studies course on students' academic success, knowledge retention and their opinions on teaching practice. The research was carried out on the 6th grade students in a secondary school in the province of Samsun. In the research, exploratory order model, one of the mixed method research designs, was used. There were 44 students in the experimental group and 41 students in the control group. \"Academic achievement test\" was used for data collection. The second phase of the study was designed as a case study and a semi-structured interview form was used to collect data. The interview form prepared for 10 students in the experimental group was applied. One-factor ANOVA was used for the repeated measures of the relationship between pretest, post-test and retention scores of the experimental and control groups to determine the retention of the program in learning. Descriptive analysis method was used in the analysis of qualitative data. At the end of the research, it was found that the technology supported teaching program applied to the experimental group was more effective in increasing students' academic achievement and learning retention compared to the teaching application in the control group which was not supported by communication technologies and where teacher-centered teaching--straight expression method--was used.",

Thus, knowledge dissemination/acquisition becomes difficult because of the four inherent distances in GSD, which, in turn causes AK vaporization. One way to reduce this loss of knowledge is to take advantage of the AK traces that different unstructured and textual electronic means (UTEM) leave (e.g. instant messengers and email), which developers prefer on AGSD environments. These traces are valuable, but their access is difficult because these means have no tools adapted to search AK and because this knowledge is scattered in different UTEM. The AK condensation concept proposes that trough a mechanism of classification and collection of messages contained in UTEM, AK could become available for the stakeholders. This article presents a Slack complement, which implements an AK classification mechanism based on social tagging. We evaluated this mechanism with undergraduate students through a replica of a previous study. We obtained positive results in regards to usefulness and ease of use, but with tagging behavior results that differ (not statistically significant) from those obtained previously. These evidences encourage us to evaluate the AK condensation concept in its whole, in real scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "The evolution of the construction industry and the increasing complexity of its projects, alongside the global economic crisis and concerns about repeating unsuccessful experiments in construction, have resulted in significant pressure on construction organisations, forcing them to establish new programs and departments to identify their priorities and achieve effective results. The importance of using project management (PM) practices is increasing dramatically. Organisations consider it increasingly important to employ PM to achieve project effectiveness and efficiency, helping to consistently employ knowledge, tools, and skills to meet the overall organisational objectives. In addition, the existence of knowledge management (KM) practices are important in helping to resolve PM challenges, increase project success rates, and improve business performance. In other words, the management of project knowledge not only increase the project’s quality, but it also helps to avoid knowledge loss and reinventing the wheel. A large number of researchers and experts have found that investing in Project Management Offices (PMOs) can lead to higher levels of project success whilst also embedding strong and consistent project management practices, processes, and procedures into the organisation. PMO is an organisation unit, department, or office that adopts and maintains the various practices of PM while also controlling organisational projects. Theoretically, the roles of PMO are responsible for providing and encouraging the KM practices. The PMO objective is to centralize knowledge and bring together lessons learned in order to convert this accumulated knowledge into more effective new procedures and processes. The Project Management Maturity Model (PMMM) proposed to address the different levels of PMOs to move from operation and tactical PMOs over time towards more directive and strategic PMOs by proposing a number of criteria and practices in each maturity level. Hence, PMMM should employ the KM processes and components within the PMO. The adoption of PMOs is not without challenge. The biggest challenge currently facing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)’s construction firms is the introduction of robust immigration controls, in 2012, which state only a maximum of 50% of employees, can originate from outside the KSA. Given most project management staff are European and American citizens, this, together with the temporary nature of construction projects, causes a problem. Consequently, the KSA’s construction firmware now facing a skills and knowledge drain as project management staff members leave both the organisation and country. Ultimately this leak of specialist knowledge and experience must now be addressed before it becomes a serious risk to both successful project delivery and organisational survival. One possible solution is to embed Knowledge Management via a PMO into the organisation in an attempt to capture the explicit and tacit knowledge returned by these professionals before they depart. Thus, this research suggests that as people hold knowledge and new knowledge is created at every phase of a project, if this knowledge is captured, it can flow seamlessly through the organisation if centrally stored and disseminated by the PMO. It was therefore resolved to appraise the emergent state of art in terms of PMO adoption and the extent tacit knowledge is amenity captured by KSA construction organisations.",

However, there are not so many researches to evaluate instructional design for digital fabrication education. Therefore, we conducted an experiment in an actual digital fabrication course and evaluated its instructional design. The research question of the experiment is what kind of factors affect to knowledge retention of learners in the case of digital fabrication education. In the experiment, learners took a test to assess knowledge they acquired in lessons each week. They were required to repeatedly try to take the tests until they achieved a perfect score. Three weeks later, to assess learner's knowledge retention, the learners took a delayed-test which was the same contents as the previous tests. Several learners scored lower than a half of full marks even though they achieved the perfect score three weeks before. In order to investigate the reason why they could not retain their knowledge, we analyzed their job-sheet they had written their works and found several reasons of them caused from lack of their practical experience. In consideration of the analytical result, this paper also discusses about a better instructional design for digital fabrication. The contents of the discussion will contribute as a useful idea for an instructor to consider instructional design for digital fabrication education.",

    "Abstract": "This study compared three multimedia input modes in the modality and redundancy principles (Mayer, 2009) in terms of university ESL (English as a Second Language) students’ learning and examined the applicability of the modality and redundancy principles for ESL students. Mayer’s modality and redundancy principles (2009) inform the design of effective multimedia lessons. However, the two principles originally stemmed from experimental studies examining students’ learning in their native language and did not include ESL students in the discussion. Based on the modality and redundancy principles, added on-screen text and graphics lead to an overload in learner’s visual channel, which undermines learning (Clark & Mayer, 2011). For ESL students’ multimedia learning, the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (Mayer, 2009) suggests that on-screen text in the input modes of graphics + text and graphics + audio + text might overload the visual channel to impede learning. However, according to the cognitive load theory (Sweller, 2014), text might also reduce the processing demands for identifying and decoding auditory input to facilitate learning. Due to the limited number of empirical studies, it was inconclusive if verbatim text aids or hinders ESL students’ learning, and it was unclear if the modality and redundancy principles apply for ESL students. An initial Study addressed common validity issues, such as lack of control of instruments and materials, in related studies, and it quantitatively tested the applicability of the modality and redundancy principles for ESL students’ learning. Both knowledge retention and vocabulary test results indicated that input modes did not have an impact on ESL students’ learning, and consequently the modality and redundancy principles were insignificant. An additional study, Study 2, addressed the implementation issues and limitations of Study 1 to provide more rigorous findings. Based on the findings of both Study 1 and Study 2, the modality and redundancy principles did not apply for ESL students’ content knowledge and vocabulary learning when certain multimedia learning principles were followed. Both Study 1 and Study 2 extended Mayer’s modality and redundancy principles by examining their applications to ESL students, as well as provided empirical evidence for designing effective multimedia instruction for ESL students.",

    "Abstract": "Our first study sought to identify if intermittent maternofetal oxygen supplementation (IUGR+O2) during late gestation rescued growth and skeletal muscle glucose metabolism impaired by hyperthermia-induced intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in lambs. Birthweight, bodyweight (BW), and brain:BW was less in IUGR lambs but did not differ between IUGR+O2 and controls. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) tended to be lower in IUGR lambs but was recovered by IUGR+O2. Insulin stimulated glucose oxidation rates in hindlimb tissues of lambs and in primary skeletal muscle at necropsy were decreased by IUGR but rescued in IUGR+O2 lambs. However, hindlimb and ex vivo skeletal muscle glucose uptake did not differ among groups. These data show that fetal hypoxemia drives the development of IUGR and metabolic deficiencies but that intermittent maternofetal oxygen supplementation improves skeletal muscle growth and glucose metabolism. To evaluate inflammatory factors involved in adaptive fetal programming, we developed a maternofetal inflammation-induced IUGR (MI-IUGR) model. For this study, we evaluated the effects of sustained maternal inflammation on fetal inflammation, growth, and skeletal muscle glucose metabolism. Near-term fetuses demonstrated elevated circulating leukocytes and ~22% reduction in size 2 weeks after induction of inflammation ceased. Fetal inflammation impaired muscle glucose metabolism; in vivo and ex vivo insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation was reduced in MI-IUGR fetuses. In vivo glucose uptake did not differ, but ex vivo uptake was reduced under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions. Thus, maternofetal inflammation resulted in an IUGR phenotype characterized by adaptive fetal growth restriction and impaired skeletal muscle glucose metabolism. Lastly, we performed a study to determine the effects of retrieval practices in the form of homework assignments requiring higher-order cognitive skills (HOC) compared to those requiring lower-order cognitive skills (LOC) on students’ long-term retention of knowledge. There were no differences in short-term or long-term knowledge retention between retrieval practice types. However, students completing HOC retrieval practices had decreased performance scores for 9 of 11 topics. Retrieval practices create desirable difficulties that benefit knowledge retention, but only when an equal degree of success is achieved. These data indicate that desirable difficulties were not created, as students were not equally successful on both types of retrieval practices.",

    "Abstract": "In the modern world, it is increasingly moving from the classic way of managing people, natural and material resources to the knowledge management process. Knowledge Management (Knowledge Management or KM for Knowledge) is a system that helps us understand how and why something happened in a particular organization or enterprise. In the business world, this process is also called \"corporate memory\". Knowledge in this context is seen as an organization's ability to function effectively. Knowledge management is a name that indicates a process in which an organization, collectively, intentionally and systematically collects, organizes, exchanges, shares and analyzes its own resources in terms of resources, documents, knowledge and skills of its associates. At the beginning of 1998, technological advances made it possible to eliminate the deficiency observed across business sectors: companies did not systematically manage the knowledge they gained in their work. If an employee leaves the company, there was an irrecoverable loss of knowledge, and the whole process of training, acquisition of knowledge and development of the methodology had to be repeated. Only a decade later, things have changed and many organizations have developed knowledge management systems. This concept attracted the attention to NGO because many of them generate knowledge, on the one hand, and face rapid changes of associates on the other. Knowledge management implies the ability to organize data (mining data), as well as some ways in which the searched data will \"push\" the target users, because the very existence of resources is not enough incentive for adult learning. Dealing with the knowledge component within business activities as explicitly expressed and integrated into all aspects of strategy work, through policy to practice at all levels in the organization.",

However, this behavior is accompanied by several shortcomings, especially the documentation section since its dependence on direct communication. Therefore, the use of knowledge management in Scrum seems to be important. Knowledge management in Scrum was influenced by several challenges such as the various locations of the team members, the changes of software developers, the methods for large-scale projects, and the needs for high-quality software. These problems need to be resolved to avoid the amount of knowledge loss. Therefore researchers want to find out more about how knowledge management system influences the development of scrum-based software and its effect on developers' performance. This study uses a quasi-experimental approach with the application in the real world to startup companies. A quasi-experimental is research method used to compare the effect before and after treatment in a group by comparing the performance conditions before and after the implementation of the knowledge management system. The data collected from experiment are scrum artefact, knowledge artefact, and developers' performance (using IWQP). The first experiment for the group lasted for two sprints using a scrum support system. Knowledge management system based scrum used for the second experiment. The findings obtained were an increase in adaptation performance of 8%, contextual performance of 12%, and improvement of knowledge circulation from the development team. The Knowledge Management System is proven to be able to improve and handle the knowledge circulation in Scrum and give impact to software developers.",

    "Abstract": "This quantitative, nonexperimental, predictive study was an examination of how knowledge maturity predicts data system impact. Data volumes are increasing exponentially, and organizations need to understand how data impacts information systems—specifically data systems. Studies have been completed that examined the predictive relationship between knowledge maturity and the overall system impact with transactional systems, but not data systems. The research questions asked to what extent do knowledge creation, knowledge transfer, knowledge retention, and knowledge application predict system quality? To what extent do knowledge creation, knowledge transfer, knowledge retention, and knowledge application predict information quality? To what extent do knowledge creation, knowledge transfer, knowledge retention, and knowledge application predict individual impact? To what extent do knowledge creation, knowledge transfer, knowledge retention, and knowledge application predict organizational impact? The research methodology was a nonexperimental quantitative study using Partial Least Squares, which provided the ability to analyze multiple independent variables and dependent variables. Similar studies used Partial Least Squares and proved to be effective. The target population of 115,000 consisted of data managers who work for U.S. companies earning $1B or more in annual revenue. The sample size was 113 using G*Power software. Cronbach’s alpha and composite validity returned results that proved the collection was reliable and valid. Limitations included data managers being the only participants in U.S.-based organizations with annual revenue over $1B. The quantitative, nonexperimental, predictive study did not analyze the demographics of the respondents other than the industry of the participants. There were transcription errors, so the survey was not exactly as expected; however, the survey errors did not affect the overall validity of the results, which validated the theory. Previous studies proved that knowledge maturity predicted transaction system quality; this quantitative, nonexperimental, predictive study proved that knowledge maturity predicts data system quality. Knowledge maturity predicted all variables. This quantitative, nonexperimental, predictive study may provide organizations with a better understanding of how data collection and the accumulation of data affects competitive advantage and validated that converting tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge affords organizations a competitive advantage. This quantitative, nonexperimental, predictive study concluded that (a) knowledge maturity predicts data system quality, and (2) organizations benefit from improved knowledge management. Increasing knowledge with quality information is vital to organizations.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction There is currently no protocol for the initiation of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Atlantic Canada. Advanced care paramedics (ACPs) perform advanced cardiac life support in the prehospital setting often completing the entire resuscitation on-scene. Implementation of ECPR will present a novel intervention that is only available at the receiving hospital. Our objective is to determine if an educational program can improve identification of ECPR candidates by paramedics. Establishing paramedic competence will ensure rapid transfer of eligible patients for a potentially life-saving intervention. Methods An educational program was delivered to paramedics including a short seminar and pocket card coupled with simulated OHCA cases. A before-and-after study design using a case-based survey was employed. Paramedics were scored on their ability to correctly identify patients suffering OHCA who met the inclusion criteria for our ECPR protocol. A Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was employed to compare paramedics’ scores before and after the education delivery. A six-month follow-up is planned to assess retention. Qualitative data was also collected from paramedics during simulation to help identify practical issues, potential barriers, and to refine inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to the implementation of our protocol in the prehospital setting. Results The median score pre-education was 10 (IQR: 9-10.5) compared to 14 (IQR: 13-15) after education delivery. The median difference between groups was 5. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs test demonstrated a significant improvement in the paramedics’ ability to correctly identify ECPR candidates after completing our educational program z = -2.67, p = 0.0039. Conclusion Paramedic training through a didactic session coupled with a pocket card and simulation appeared to be a feasible method of knowledge translation. Six-month follow-up data will help ensure knowledge retention is achieved.",

    "Abstract": "Background The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of a new ISUOG (International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology) Outreach Teaching and Training Program delivered in Muscat, Oman. Methods Quantitative assessments to evaluate knowledge and practical skills were administered before and after an ultrasound course for sonologists attending the ISUOG Outreach Course, which took place in November, 2017, in Oman. Trainees were selected from each region of the country following a national vetting process conducted by the Oman Ministry of Health. Twenty-eight of the participants were included in the analysis. Pre- and post-training practical and theoretical scores were evaluated and compared. Results Participants achieved statistically significant improvements, on average by 47% ( p < 0.001), in both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Specifically, the mean score in the theoretical knowledge test significantly increased from 55.6% (± 14.0%) to 81.6% (± 8.2%), while in the practical test, the mean score increased from 44.6% (± 19.5%) to 65.7% (± 23.0%) ( p < 0.001). Performance was improved post-course among 27/28 participants (96.4%) in the theoretical test (range: 14 to 200%) and among 24/28 (85.7%) trainees in the practical skills test (range: 5 to 217%). Conclusion Application of the ISUOG Basic Training Curriculum and Outreach Teaching and Training Course improved the theoretical knowledge and practical skills of local health personnel. Long-term re-evaluation is, however, considered imperative to ascertain and ensure knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Background: There are no studies comparing anesthesia interactive videos and long-term knowledge retention. This study explored whether or not an interactive educational video would have an impact on immediate and long-term knowledge retention and if there would be a greater effect among the Millennial demographic when compared to other generational demographics. Methods: The research study utilized a panel design to collect data on a convenience sample of Doctor of Nurse Anesthesia Practice Entry-Level students. Data collection occurred at three separate intervals; a pretest (T1) administered prior to the educational video presentation, a posttest (T2) administered immediately after the educational video, and a 30-day follow-up posttest (T3). Results: The study showed interactive educational videos to be effective. Participants in the interactive educational video group had a statistically significant (14.4%) improvement in knowledge retention at the 30-day testing point when compared to those participants who viewed a traditional linear video. Conclusion: There is a lack of research related to interactive videos and long-term knowledge retention in the field of anesthesia. The findings suggest that it may be effective to integrate interactive educational videos during the education of nurse anesthesia students in order to enhance long-term knowledge retention.

Proponents of the problem-based learning model argue that by providing authentic, real-world problems in a peer-supported group setting, learners are better able to apply their knowledge after graduation. Studies have shown that problem-based learning affords students advantages such as increased motivation, teamwork skills, improved critical thinking abilities, increased knowledge retention, and better organization and integration of new knowledge. Critics of problem-based learning argue that the model adds additional burdens on instructors and negatively affects the amount of knowledge gained (facts), which in turn leads to lower test scores. This paper seeks to explain the characteristics of the problem-based learning model and examine its merits and limitations. An examination of past and future progression of this model will also be undertaken. Finally, this paper will propose a multi-strategy research design to study this model and assess its effectiveness.",

Although augmented reality technology has brought freshness to students, it is necessary to design suitable teaching support to promote student learning. Therefore, knowing how to design a teaching support system has become an important research problem. The researchers have designed open scaffolding and convergent scaffold based on augmented reality technology as a teaching support. Twenty-one elementary school students were randomly assigned to use either the convergent scaffolding or the open scaffolding for a learning task. Using a mixed research method, this study examined the effects of different scaffoldings on knowledge retention, knowledge transfer, learning satisfaction, and cognitive load. The results revealed that open scaffolding could improve students' knowledge retention, knowledge transfer, and reduce cognitive load.",

PURPOSE Various smartphone-based virtual reality (VR) applications allow the users to view 360° videos of real or simulated places. A 360° VR is captured with a special camera that simultaneously records all 360° of a scene unlike the standard video recording. An experimental study was conducted where 4th-year medical students participated in a workshop.The study was conducted at College of Medicine (COM-J), King Saud bin Abdul-Aziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. 360° VR videos including, pre-briefing and debriefing sessions were held for the experimental group, whereas group two (control group) was provided with the interactive lecture. A total of 169 undergraduate medical students attend the 4th year at the College of Medicine (KSAU-HS) Jeddah. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study was conducted at College of Medicine (COM-J), King Saud bin Abdul-Aziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. 360° VR videos including, pre-briefing and debriefing sessions were held for the experimental group, whereas group two (control group) was provided with the interactive lecture. A total of 169 undergraduate medical students attend the 4th year at the College of Medicine (KSAU-HS) Jeddah.The response rate was 88% for 169 participants, 57 (VR) and 112 (conventional method). The majority of students (93%) thought that VR can be used in medical education. Post-MCQs score (out of 20) was significantly higher in the VR group, when compared to the conventional group (17.4+2.1 vs 15.9+2.9, p-value <0.001). The OSCE score was also better with the VR group (12.9+4.1 vs 9.8+4.2, p-value <0.001). Overall rating of VR satisfaction experience showed a mean of 7.26 of 10.

    "Abstract": "Aim This study evaluated the effects of three-hour instructor-led training courses in the Extended Focused Assessment Sonography for Trauma (EFAST) and Rapid Ultrasound in Shock and Hypotension (RUSH) protocols on knowledge gain and retention by final-year medical students. Methods This prospective study evaluated 79 final year medical students participating in an emergency medicine (EM) clerkship during the 2017-2018 academic year. None of the included students had prior formal ultrasound training or hands-on experience. All students participated in three-hour training courses on the EFAST and RUSH protocols, with training on each protocol involving one hour of didactic training and two hours of practical training. Knowledge improvement was measured by testing before and after each course, and knowledge retention was evaluated on a final clerkship multiple choice question (MCQ) examination. Results Median scores were significantly higher after rather than before both the EFAST (15; range, 12-19 vs. 7; range, 2-18; p < 0.0001) and RUSH (16; range, 6-20 vs. 6; range, 1-13; p < 0.0001) courses. EFAST knowledge was significantly higher than RUSH knowledge before (p = 0.04) but not after (p = 0.82) taking the respective course. The RUSH score was significantly lower than the EFAST score on the final clerkship MCQ examination (p < 0.0001). Conclusions Three hours of instructor-led ultrasound training given during an EM clerkship significantly increased knowledge of both the EFAST and RUSH protocols. Knowledge retention after two weeks was higher for the EFAST than the RUSH protocol. A longer period of RUSH training may improve the retention of knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "This is a report of a scholarly project involving the current mandatory online educational process of registered nursing staff on a medical-surgical unit and the impact of providing protected learning time on said population. The topic was selected because the author was interested in determining if allowing registered nurses time away from the bedside to complete their mandatory online education in a quiet controlled environment would improve their knowledge retention of the subject matter as well as their employee satisfaction with the educational process. The author demonstrated that nurses that completed online education without the provision of protected learning time felt more distracted and less satisfied while completing their online educational modules. They also had lower immediate and delayed post-test scores than the nurses that were provided protected learning time to complete their online educational modules. Nurses that were provided protected learning time during this study stated that they felt more satisfied and less distracted while completing their educational module. The findings from the project support providing protected learning time to staff as a means to increase registered nurse satisfaction and knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to examine the effectiveness of organizational information technology (IT)-based and non-IT-based knowledge transfer mechanisms (KTMs) for the retention of different types of knowledge from mobile experts. It differentiates among four types of knowledge loss (KL), namely, conscious knowledge (i.e. individual explicit knowledge that can be codified); codified knowledge (i.e. explicit knowledge captured at the social level); automatic knowledge (i.e. implicit individual knowledge); and collective knowledge (i.e. implicit knowledge embedded in the organization). Design/methodology/approach: A research framework connecting the organizational knowledge retention (KR) cycle to KL is developed and an exploratory analysis is conducted using data from two case studies in the Canadian federal public service. Findings: are confirmed using a third government agency. Findings Without the right processes in place for organizational knowledge retrieval and reuse, the KR cycle is not complete, leading to KL. The lack of available social KTMs for the conversion of individual to social objectified knowledge leads to KL. KTMs shortcomings increase the risk of automatic and objectified KL. Research limitations/implications: Exploratory results demonstrate that KL does not always equate to lack of KR. Implementing knowledge-specific organizational KTMs is important to encourage the retention of individual knowledge at the social level. Propositions and a framework are developed for future research. Practical implications: Mobile experts hold valuable knowledge at high risk of being lost by organizations. This paper provides managers with a set of guidelines to develop a knowledge-specific strategy focused on KTMs that increase KR and mitigate KL. Originality/value: This paper challenges the assumption that KL only results from poor retention and studies both retention and loss to identify additional types of unintentional loss that occur when individual knowledge is not converted to social knowledge.

    "Abstract": "Athletic training education is evolving which increases the importance of retaining athletic training students in athletic training programs. Research has demonstrated that athletic training students are motivated to persist through an athletic training program, however, the type of motivation has not been studied. This study aims to analyze professional athletic training students' achievement goal orientation and grit scores as they relate to their persistence in athletic training programs. A mixed-methods approach utilizing the grit scale, achievement goal orientation survey, and open-ended questions to understand bachelor- and master-level professional athletic training students' approach to persisting in an academic program. Analysis of the data demonstrated that athletic training students believe persistence, academic and clinical experiences, passion for the profession, knowledge retention, and key mentors and support play roles in their persistence through athletic training programs. Also, there are no differences in grit scores or achievement goal orientation between bachelor- and master-level athletic training students (p>.05). However, there is a difference between the achievement goal orientations (mastery, performance-approach, performance-avoidant, work-avoidant) in all athletic training students (p<.001). Mastery is significantly higher than all other achievement goal orientations. Also, grit and mastery goal orientation have a moderate positive correlation (r=.379, p<.001) and all other achievement goal orientations have a significant negative correlation with grit. Therefore, educators need to understand how students are motivated to provide the support which reflects their needs to maintain drive and passion for athletic training.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Various smartphone-based virtual reality (VR) applications allow the users to view 360° videos of real or simulated places. A 360° VR is captured with a special camera that simultaneously records all 360° of a scene unlike the standard video recording. An experimental study was conducted where 4th-year medical students participated in a workshop. Patients and methods: The study was conducted at College of Medicine (COM-J), King Saud bin Abdul-Aziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. 360° VR videos including, pre-briefing and debriefing sessions were held for the experimental group, whereas group two (control group) was provided with the interactive lecture. A total of 169 undergraduate medical students attend the 4th year at the College of Medicine (KSAU-HS) Jeddah. Results: The response rate was 88% for 169 participants, 57 (VR) and 112 (conventional method). The majority of students (93%) thought that VR can be used in medical education. Post-MCQs score (out of 20) was significantly higher in the VR group, when compared to the conventional group (17.4+2.1 vs 15.9+2.9, p-value <0.001). The OSCE score was also better with the VR group (12.9+4.1 vs 9.8+4.2, p-value <0.001). Overall rating of VR satisfaction experience showed a mean of 7.26 of 10. Conclusion: VR provides a rich, interactive, and engaging educational context that supports experiential learning-by-doing. In fact, it raises interest and motivation for student and effectively supports knowledge retention and skills acquisition.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this multiple case study is to examine the relationships between transaction cost economics (TCE) attributes and possible IT outsourcing outcomes. The TCE attributes are human asset specificity, institutional influences, and core competencies. The possible outcomes of the IT outsourcing (ITO) are vendor lock-in, knowledge loss, and IT alignment. This study selected four community colleges based on the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board assessment peer groupings of small, medium, large, and very large colleges. A comparative analysis of the means and standard deviation of the data from an online questionnaire was conducted to create a narrative that was used to make an analytical generalization to the theory of TCE. The nature of the community college as a community serving higher education organization suggested the inclusion of regional demographic data and financial data for each of the colleges. The TCE attributes of the ITO choice for higher education are ubiquitous as they would be for any homogenous industry study. The specific assets, the institutional influences, and the core competencies were found to be the same for the schools. The responses to the questionnaire show that knowledge is not unique for each school. The schools each provide education as needed by their local region. The region, in turn, provides the tax base and the student population for the college. This relationship has shown to affect the schools in this study. This study provides an observation of how four schools with differing regional resources approach the problems associated with ITO. The schools have an understanding of their outsourcing needs and accept the choice and the limitations the arrangement affords. This research shows how regional advantages and disadvantages can influence the outcomes of the ITO decision and can be used to support future research into the relationship between available resources and the outcome of the ITO decision.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to investigate the relationships between identified faculty learning styles and the retention of content knowledge as measured by online learning activity choice. A total of 17,589 full time faculty were sent an invitation to participate with 165 choosing to be a part of the study. Using a quasi-experimental quantitative research methodology, faculty completed the Cohen, Oxford, and Chi (2006) Learning Styles Survey in an online module. After completing the survey, faculty chose an instructional object that was customized to one of three learning styles: visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. Faculty completed course content in the instructional object and then completed a comprehension quiz. χ 2 tests of independence confirmed demographic variables are independent of learning style. An ANOVA test supported the assumption that there is not a stronger learning style for online learning, but that all groups showed the same level of propensity for knowledge retention. A Pearson r correlation analysis supported the idea that completion time is not indicative of a better score on assessments. Finally, independent sample t -tests indicated that there was not a significant difference in matched learning style or unmatched learning style groups for either completion time or comprehension quiz score. The final results of the current study indicated that an online model of faculty development appears to be effective in delivering content to faculty regardless of learning style.",

    "Abstract": "This study examined enterprise social media (ESM) use by personnel at joint military staff organizations. The research addressed the problem of organizational knowledge loss caused by routine personnel rotations and unexpected turnover, and how emerging enterprise social software may be employed to mitigate the effect. A qualitative phenomenological study gathered data in support of the central research question: What are the enterprise social media strategies joint commands use to mitigate organizational knowledge loss? Semi-structured interviews were conducted via video chat with ten former military participants from a population of individuals with recent experience in joint commands, part of the United States military that have intentionally high turnover and are highly collaborative teams of knowledge workers. Qualified participants were recruited via LinkedIn professional collegial networks and other social media groups. The findings were that joint commands provide enterprise social media tools, but employ varied strategies toward their adoption and use by the staff. Also, turnover-induced organizational knowledge loss remains a challenge, and first-generation network tools such as email and shared drives present individual and organizational knowledge management challenges. Barriers to wider adoption of enterprise social media tools within joint commands are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "This mixed-methods study examined the effect of instructor-generated multimedia on student engagement in six sections of one online graduate course at Wilmington University. This study observed the use of VoiceThread and Collaborate Ultra in three sections of each Block term during the Fall 2018 semester as follows: one using Collaborate Ultra only, one using VoiceThread only, and one using both tools. The pre-developed online course template assignments were modified to use the tool specified. The five instructors were trained on how to use the tools but had creative freedom over the length of the term. The students were administered a confidential survey in their section and the instructor was interviewed at the end of the term. The protocol for each was developed by the researcher to determine student engagement in connection to the Community of Inquiry model. This model states that a complete educational experience is developed through social, teaching, and cognitive presence (Garrison, Anderson & Archer, 2000), The use of the tools proved to have a positive impact on student engagement, social presence, teaching presence, and cognitive presence. The importance of this study impacts all institutions of higher education that have an online course modality. This study was done to highlight the importance of incorporating instructor-generated multimedia into course content in order to increase student-to-instructor, student-to-student, and student-to-content interaction and engagement. Online learning is growing , therefore, understanding what engages these students is necessary in order to improve knowledge retention and development.

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to explore the knowledge entropy processes within organizations and how they are reflected in the knowledge management and organizational intellectual capital. Entropy is a very powerful concept, which can be found today in almost any branch of science and technology. It was introduced by Rudolf Clausius in 1865 in Thermodynamics, then used in the communication theory by Claude Shannon, and expanded by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen in economics. However, dues to its extensive use in so many different research domains, the concept of entropy became fuzzy and sometimes misleading in applications. Also, its statistical formulations based on the Boltzmann theory made the entropy understanding rather difficult and its interpretations on the edge of coherence. Knowledge entropy is an extension of information entropy and used within the framework of knowledge management. Our conceptual analysis aims to shed light on the appropriate use of knowledge entropy and its potential in knowledge management research and practice. Since knowledge entropy is associated to all transformational processes in knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge loss, we may say that knowledge management can be interpreted as the process of managing knowledge entropy within organizations.",

However, it is often the case that knowledge retention is carried out in an ad-hoc way. Aims: In this study, we report our experience from proposing the Knowledge Critically Evaluation Method (KCEM) to evaluate knowledge items (KIT). Our main goal with KCEMs is to support companies to systematically retain knowledge in ASD contexts. Method: We conducted an improvement case study to develop and evaluate KCEM. This research follows the guidelines for technology transfer between industry and academia. The case and unit of analysis is Ericsson, a Swedish company that develops telecommunication solutions. Results: In this paper, we provide initial results of both lab and static validation, enriched by the lessons learned. Conclusions: The preliminary results show that KCEM is easy to understand and use, provides a different perspective on the KIT by visualizing in the criticality chart, and reduces the level of abstraction associated to a knowledge subject area.",

In order to investigate the characteristics of knowledge transmission and heterogeneity of social networks, an ILSFI (ignoramus-learner-spreader-forgetter-ignoramus) model is presented on scale-free networks. The spreading dynamics of knowledge are analyzed in detail by using the theory of mean-field. The basic reproductive number R 0 is calculated by the next generation matrix method and two equilibria are derived. The theoretical analysis indicates that the basic reproductive number mainly depends on the knowledge transmission process and the topology of the underlying networks. Furthermore, the global stability of the knowledge loss equilibrium and the permanence of the knowledge transmission are also studied in detail. Finally, we analyze the interest degree and the benefit degree through numerical simulations.",

    "Abstract": "Organizational success is dependent on innovation, which is dependent upon the creation of new knowledge, and thus was an important area for new research. Architectural designers and environmental psychologists identified a causal relationship between a physical environment and the behavior of its occupants. The general problem was the absence of evidence-based guidance to plan employee workspace in organizational strategic decisions to support knowledge creation, organizational learning, and innovation. The specific problem for this research effort was to reduce the theoretical uncertainty concerning a wide range of physical space attributes and spatial arrangements, which enable or hinder knowledge functions. The concept of architectural determinism indicated architectural design affected human behavior as an independent variable of cause and effect. This study integrated the focused results of previous researchers on the separate features of the physical environment. This study gathered technical information about workspaces in various building structures for architects, organizational managers, and knowledge-workers to consider in construction projects for the selection of physical space attributes to enhance results as ideation and knowledge sharing. The theoretical lens included the organizational knowledge creation (OKC) theory and the socio-technical systems (STS) theory. This study explored the physical space attributes where 11 knowledge workers created new knowledge and shared their new knowledge with others. The participants contributed to both radical and incremental innovations, 64% and 36% respectively. This research followed the biographical narrative interpretive method open narrative interview style. Coding protocols separated the data for the actual physical space attributes experienced by knowledge creators and knowledge workers. The findings included, access, indoor environment quality (air quality, lighting, noise, thermal comfort), room characteristics (colors, condition, shape, type, and ceilings), biophilics, furnishings, pictures, technology, and windows (daylight and views). This study found how stimulation outside of ideation spaces, windows in ideation spaces, and standing and walking in collaboration spaces contributed to knowledge creation and sharing. Further, this study found why: windows, standing and walking, isolation and quiet rooms, pictures, daylight spectrum lighting, standing desks, and thermal comfort contributed to knowledge creation; and why soundproof collaboration spaces and thermal comfort contributed to knowledge sharing. Specific contributions of this research study expanded the understanding of how knowledge creators use window views to expand their mind space for new thoughts, and recommended future research on substitutions for the stimulation of window views. Furthermore, the role of isolation and quiet spaces to prevent the loss of knowledge creators' train of thought requires future research when the knowledge creator is out walking to experience sensory stimulation while thinking. Future researchers should also explore use of the proposed triangulation instrument for a virtual focus group as a modified nominal group technique to expand use of triangulation to increase transparency and the usefulness of any qualitative research findings.

    "Abstract": "Baby Boomer leaders are retiring from healthcare organizations without sharing tacit knowledge. The purpose of this qualitative, collective case study was to explore the strategies leaders in the healthcare industry in Florida, Georgia, and Ohio used to retain tacit knowledge from Baby Boomer managers, leaders, and supervisors before retirement. The specific problem is that healthcare leaders may lack strategies to retain tacit knowledge from Baby Boomers before retirement from healthcare organizations in Florida, Georgia, and Ohio. The results of the study helped to identify tacit knowledge retention strategies. The study may inspire change using knowledge collection strategies that integrated conversations from managers, leaders, and supervisors to assist in retaining tacit knowledge from retiring Baby Boomers. This study involved 15 retired participants that met the criteria. The main research question was what strategies do leaders use to retain tacit knowledge from Baby Boomers in the healthcare industry before retirement? Three theories guided this research approach including general systems theory, transformational leadership theory, and knowledge management theory. Data collection occurred through semi-structured face-to-face and audio-taped interviews and field notes. Four themes emerged: (a) generational differences; (b) developing awareness among leaders; (c) mentoring by example; and (d) the lack of a formal system. NVivo 12 software supported data analysis, assisted in sorting and organizing the data, identifying associations, similarities, and patterns revealed through the literature review portion of the study. The results of this study contributed to the existing body of knowledge regarding Baby Boomers and strategies to retain tacit knowledge before retirement.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose. The purpose of this quantitative study was to determine the degree of importance of Liebowitz’s (2009) knowledge management strategies model to support the attraction and retention of talent, as perceived by human resource (HR) leaders and strategic business partners in the warehousing/logistics industries located in the Inland Empire region of Southern California, as measured by the Liebowitz and Chen (2001) Knowledge Sharing Effectiveness Inventory Questionnaire. Another purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a significant difference in the degree of importance of the knowledge management strategies model to support the attraction and retention of talent, as perceived by (a) HR leaders and (b) strategic business partners in warehousing/logistics industries located in the Inland Empire region of Southern California, as measured by the Liebowitz and Chen Knowledge Sharing Effectiveness Inventory Questionnaire. Theoretical Framework. The theoretical foundation for this study was based on knowledge management and determined by Liebowitz’s (2009) knowledge retention framework, as measured by the Liebowitz and Chen (2001) Knowledge Sharing Effectiveness Inventory Questionnaire. Methodology. The design of this study supported descriptive and ex post facto methods for survey research, along with an independent-samples t test. HR leaders and strategic business partners in the Inland Empire were invited to participate in this study. The design of the research was selected to determine whether knowledge management practices supported the attraction and retention of talent. The Knowledge Sharing Effectiveness Inventory Questionnaire instrument was used to survey the HR leaders and warehouse/logistics leaders. Findings. Though the differences are not statistically significant, mean score differences exist between the degree of importance of the knowledge management strategies. Conclusions and Recommendations. This study looked into knowledge management strategies that could help the organization gain competitive advantage. Some recommended areas of focus would fall under the knowledge retention arena: Foster a learning environment through shared engaged practices, create a professional knowledge center, and create a teaming environment to transfer knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of using communication technologies in teaching of attainments related to global education in social studies course on students’ academic success, knowledge retention and their opinions on teaching practice. The research was carried out on the 6th grade students in a secondary school in the province of Samsun. In the research, exploratory order model, one of the mixed method research designs, was used. There were 44 students in the experimental group and 41 students in the control group. “Academic achievement test\" was used for data collection. The second phase of the study was designed as a case study and a semi-structured interview form was used to collect data. The interview form prepared for 10 students in the experimental group was applied. One-factor ANOVA was used for the repeated measures of the relationship between pre-test, post-test and retention scores of the experimental and control groups to determine the retention of the program in learning. Descriptive analysis method was used in the analysis of qualitative data. At the end of the research, it was found that the technology supported teaching program applied to the experimental group was more effective in increasing students' academic achievement and learning retention compared to the teaching application in the control group which was not supported by communication technologies and where teacher-centered teaching -straight expression method- was used.",

    "Abstract": "This descriptive case study captured the narratives of seven refugee resettlement workers in Texas to examine the impacts of refugee policy changes upon them and their organizations. The research questions were: (a) How do refugee resettlement workers describe the effects of recent refugee policies on their practice and their lives? (b) What changes do the study’s participants report in their refugee resettlement organizations? and, (c) What can be concluded about the state of refugee resettlement in Texas and in the nation? Data collected through interviews, artifacts, and a researcher’s journal were examined using paradigmatic analysis. Study findings showed a significant negative impact of current policies on refugee resettlement. The Trump administration has appreciably reduced refugee admissions and funding while promulgating anti-immigrant rhetoric. The reductions in refugee admissions and funding have resulted in downsizing, uncertainty, knowledge loss, and structural stress within resettlement organizations, with smaller agencies closing. Resettlement workers, often, former refugees themselves, expressed concern and distress regarding their futures and the futures of their clients. The tight coupling of refugee resettlement policies with resettlement organizations and workers via government agreements make them unusually sensitive to policy changes. Contributions to adult education and policy-making with recommendations for resettlement organizations are provided.",

    "Abstract": "According to the USDA, food insecurity or the inadequate access to a sufficient amount of nutritious food, affects over 12.3 percent of the U.S. population including more than 680,000 South Carolinians (USDA, 2017a). These individuals find some relief from food banks and food pantries that provide meals, groceries and services to individuals experiencing hunger, poverty, food insecurity and inadequate nutritional intake. Because food banks and pantries operate on limited budgets, they rely heavily on volunteers to perform numerous activities such as handling, sorting and distributing food. For this reason, food safety education of volunteers is critical in minimizing foodborne illness among food bank and pantry clients. Nutrition education is less prevalent among volunteers at food banks and pantries, but it is emerging as a successful intervention for improving client health and food insecurity. A study was conducted to determine the nutrition and food safety literacy among supervisors and volunteers working in food banks and pantries in South Carolina. A survey of food pantry supervisors was administered to characterize South Carolina food pantries and to identify gaps in nutrition and food safety knowledge. Survey information was then used to create a series of food safety and nutrition education modules for food pantry volunteers. Pre and post-test scores of volunteers completing the modules were used to improve modules and determine knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Micro-learning is an educational teaching method used to train users on multiple platforms. This article will provide a brief introduction to the concepts of short-term and long-term memory, and explain how micro-learning can be used to increase retention in learners. Micro-lessons can aid in negating the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve and can use reintroduction to keep retention at significantly higher levels. This process also speeds up the learning process overall because students avoid the phenomenon of mental fatigue. The article cites studies suggesting mental fatigue can cause serious cognitive decline in individual performance. By breaking complex courses into manageable smaller lessons, micro-learning preserves the neurotransmitter cascade for steady neurochemical performance. By using mobile devices, students can pause and continue their micro-lessons with ease. The mobile application also gives them the opportunity to continually check on their performance, and adjust their learning accordingly.

    "Abstract": "Objective Epilepsy affects approximately 50 million people globally, with approximately 80% living in low/middle-income countries (LMIC), where access to specialist care is limited. In LMIC, primary health workers provide the majority of epilepsy care, despite limited training in this field. Recognising this knowledge gap among these providers is an essential component for closing the epilepsy treatment gap in these regions. Setting In Zambia, the vast majority of healthcare is provided by clinical officers (COs), primary health providers with 3 years post-secondary general medical education, who predominantly work in first-level health centres around the country. Participants With cooperation from the Ministry of Health, a total of 10 COs from 4 surrounding first-level health centres around the capital city of Lusaka participated, with 9 completing the entire course. Intervention COs were trained in a 3-week structured course on paediatric seizures and epilepsy, based on adapted evidence-based guidelines. Results Preassessment and postassessment were conducted to assess the intervention. Following the course, there was improved overall knowledge about epilepsy (69% vs 81%, p<0.05), specifically knowledge regarding medication management and recognition of focal seizures (p<0.05), improved seizure history taking and appropriate medication titration (p<0.05). However, knowledge regarding provoked seizures, use of diagnostic studies and general aetiologies of epilepsy remained limited. Conclusions This pilot project demonstrated that a focused paediatric epilepsy training programme for COs can improve knowledge and confidence in management, and as such is a promising step for improving the large epilepsy treatment gap in children in Zambia. With feasibility demonstrated, future projects are needed to expand to more rural regions for more diverse and larger sample of primary health provider participants and encompass more case-based training and repetition of key concepts as well as methods to improve and assess long-term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives Millions of children die every year from serious childhood illnesses. Most deaths are avertable with access to quality care. Saving Children’s Lives (SCL) includes an abbreviated high-intensity training (SCL-aHIT) for providers who treat serious childhood illnesses. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of SCL-aHIT on knowledge acquisition and retention of providers. Setting 76 participating centres who provide primary and secondary care in Kweneng District, Botswana. Participants Doctors and nurses expected by the District Health Management Team to provide initial care to seriously ill children, completed SCL-aHIT between January 2014 and December 2016, submitted demographic data, course characteristics and at least one knowledge assessment. Methods Retrospective, cohort study. Planned and actual primary outcome was adjusted acquisition (change in total knowledge score immediately after training) and retention (change in score at 1, 3 and 6 months), secondary outcomes were pneumonia and dehydration subscores. Descriptive statistics and linear mixed models with random intercept and slope were conducted. Relevant institutional review boards approved this study. Results 211 providers had data for analysis. Cohort was 91% nurses, 61% clinic/health postbased and 45% pretrained in Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). A strong effect of SCL-aHIT was seen with knowledge acquisition (+24.56±1.94, p<0.0001), and loss of retention was observed (−1.60±0.67/month, p=0.018). IMCI training demonstrated no significant effect on acquisition (+3.58±2.84, p=0.211 or retention (+0.20±0.91/month, p=0.824) of knowledge. On average, nurses scored lower than physicians (−19.39±3.30, p<0.0001). Lost to follow-up had a significant impact on knowledge retention (−3.03±0.88/month, p=0.0007). Conclusions aHIT for care of the seriously ill child significantly increased provider knowledge and loss of knowledge occurred over time. IMCI training did not significantly impact overall knowledge acquisition nor retention, while professional status impacted overall score and lost to follow-up impacted retention.",

The present study focuses on knowledge retention in Medical Microbiology and assesses the effectiveness of some strategies implemented for short- and long-term retention. A pre- and post-test was used to assess student’s learning. This study involved students of Porto University (test group). Test group participants were all attending the third year of the Medicine Degree Program. The results of post-test 1 were considered very positive and support the importance of these applied active activities and/or methodologies in Medical Microbiology for short-term retention. However, the results obtained in post-test 2 showed that knowledge retention after 9 months, despite substantial, decreases.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to test the use of generating self-explanations in nursing education as it relates to student academic achievement in theoretical nursing courses. With the study being built upon a framework of cognitive constructivism, a mixed methods approach was used to examine the academic achievement of associate degree nursing students in a community college in northeast Texas. Unit exam grades and final exam grades were examined in two integrated theoretical nursing courses over the course of one semester. Demographic variables were considered, along with the semester of nursing school in which the student was enrolled. The quantitative portion of the study examined the amount of self-explanations generated as it related to academic achievement on unit exams and the final exam through a repeated measures approach. It also examined whether the semester of nursing school in which the participant was enrolled impacted the exam scores when generating self-explanations. While quantitative results yielded no significance, this non-significance and mean exam scores demonstrated that generating self-explanations can indicate knowledge retention and produce similar results to standard multiple-choice practice questions not-requiring self-explanations. Qualitative inquiry produced descriptive data, which highlighted four major themes and points of discussion including (a) activity design, (b) individual learners, (c) method of self-reflection, and (d) theory and practice. These qualitative data points augmented the quantitative results and provided valuable insight into the use of generating self-explanations in nursing classrooms and for areas of further research. With consideration given to quantitative and qualitative analysis, generating self-explanations should be considered as a tool to utilize in nursing classrooms.

    "Abstract": "Background: Knowledge refers to the skills and facts that individuals acquire while performing some tasks. Knowledge leakage is the loss of knowledge, resulting in loss of the organisation’s position in the marketplace. Internal and external knowledge leakage in software development organisations lowers the organisations’ competitive advantage. Knowledge sharing is a process of innovation and value creation that leads to competitive advantage. Innovation is a result of an effective knowledge sharing process. Knowledge can be shared internally and externally; however, not all knowledge can be shared externally because of some confidentiality issues. Some organisations do not promote knowledge sharing to avoid knowledge leakage. Objectives: The main objective of this study was to investigate how knowledge sharing leads to knowledge leakages in software development organisations. Method: A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from IT professionals to explore knowledge sharing and knowledge leakages. A response rate of 53.6% was received. Results: The results indicated that people always move from one organisation to another, resulting in an increased knowledge leakage. People will always share whatever they have learnt in the new organisation. Five key critical findings that cause staff turnover are management and citizenship, industrial psychology, industrial relations, employee morale and organisational culture. Conclusions: Because knowledge resides in the brains of individuals, it is recommended that organisations should motivate their staff not to leave. Organisations need to implement global skills resource management, mentoring programmes and documentation of lessons learnt to retain knowledge. Good management strategies should be applied to create a good working environment and organisational culture to retain employees.",

    "Abstract": "Many studies have shown that repetition of study material with temporal gaps between the repetitions (i.e., spaced in time) is more effective for long-term retention than are repetitions in immediate succession (i.e., massed; Greene, 1989). Although this spacing effect has proven to be robust in the laboratory (Cepeda, Pashler, Vul, Wixted, & Rohrer, 2006), its status in the real world is relatively understudied. Other research has demonstrated the benefit of memory retrieval on subsequent retrieval of the same information (Bjork, 1975, 1988; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006), referred to as the testing effect . However, it is not clear how spacing and retrieval can be optimally combined in order to enhance knowledge retention in a real-world setting. To investigate this question, we analyzed longitudinal data from 10,514 individuals, collected in the context of naturally occurring workplace training. To determine the impact of spaced retrieval on knowledge retention, these data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model with the following fixed factors: (1) spacing interval between repetitions of content training (retrieval practice), (2) retention interval, and (3) question format. Random factors included the specific content on which employees were trained, which was clustered by employee and, in turn, by company, resulting in a three-level hierarchy. The results showed a significant interaction between spacing interval and retention interval: the optimal amount of spacing between repeated retrieval events increased as the retention interval increased. These findings are in line with the results of laboratory studies, demonstrating the relevance and transferability of laboratory-based research to real-world contexts.",

Different learning methods are discussed in detail, with respect to identified enhanced learning outcomes such as higher engagement level, knowledge retention, and applied practical competency. Integration of AVR technology has a proven potential to elevate engagement and memory retention capacity according to the distinguished literature discussed in this paper. The primary objective of this research is establishing an evaluation framework that effectively measure the learning experience. Two experimental groups of novice trainee students were exposed to a traditional, class room based training program and virtual reality (VR) based training program. Both programs deliver a maintenance training activity of a chosen mechanism (sub-system), which will be used as preliminary results. An evaluation procedure was developed to assess each trainee to gather important data such as time consumption, accuracy, aptitude, performance level and intuition. A mathematical model was formulated to assess and index the individuals from the collected data, to establish their individual cognitive and psychomotor skill index (CPSI). This numerical rating allows assessment of workers over various tasks, and it can be used as an indicator of the competencies of trainees. Through integrated VR training, individuals were shown to have higher engagement during the training process, as their understanding of the scenario improved. This allowed them to work faster, more efficiently and more accurately with a shorter overall training time.",

As any delays and downtimes in the production towards time-to-market means a substantial financial loss, manufacturers take an interest in getting the production system to full utilisation as quickly as possible. The concept of plug-and-produce manufacturing systems facilitates an easy integration process through embedded intelligence in the devices. However, a human still needs to validate the functionality of the system and more importantly must ensure that the required quality and performance is delivered. This is done during the ramp-up phase, where the system is assembled and tested first-time. System adaptations and a lack of standard procedures make the ramp-up process still largely dependent on the operator’s experience level. A major problem that currently occurs during ramp-up, is a loss of knowledge and information due to a lack of means to capture the human’s experience. Acquiring this information can be used to simplify future ramp-up cases as additional insights about change actions and their effect on the system could be revealed. Hence, this paper proposes a decision-support framework for plug-and-produce assembly systems that will help to reduce the ramp-up effort and ultimately shorten ramp-up time. As an illustrative example, a glueing station developed as part of the European project openMOS is considered.",

    "Abstract": "Problem-based learning is a learner-centered teaching method, which uses real-world scenarios to promote student learning of concepts and principles. The aim of our study is to analyze the consequence of increased problem difficulty on team-based learning and the analytical skills of medical students. In our prospective descriptive study, two problem-based learning scenarios prepared on the topic of hypercortisolism were given to 197 students in two successive sessions. At the end of two sessions, the perceptions of students about team-based learning were documented using a five-point Likert scale on a standardized questionnaire for both scenarios (simple and complex) simultaneously. A written test consisting of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and short essay questions (SEQs) was given at the end of a complex scenario to test the problem-solving skills and retention of knowledge. No statistically significant difference (p> 0.05) was noted in team-based learning between the simple and complex problem-based learning scenario. MCQs and SEQs of C-2 (interpretation) level were attempted well than C-1 (recall) level and C3 (problem-solving) level. In conclusion, the understanding of the problem by the medical students was improved; however, there was no significant improvement in the problem-solving skills and knowledge retention of the students.",

Doctor of Education (Ed.D.), December 2018, 93pp., 6 tables, 83 references, 5 appendices. With increasing criticism concerning police interactions with the public and the use-of-force decisions, the importance of preservice law enforcement instruction is an ongoing concern for both police practitioners and the public. Law enforcement education can benefit from the integration of new instructional strategies that can increase comprehension and long-term knowledge retention transferable into the field. Digital storytelling has been proffered as an effective cross-cultural communication tool and has been noted as having the ability to infiltrate the diverse communication needs of the law enforcement profession. This study sought to determine if digital storytelling could influence academic performance in the cadet police training, and if its use could increase a police cadet's interest and motivation in the topic being taught at the regional law enforcement academy. In this mixed methods research study, two cohorts in a regional police academy were exposed to digital storytelling, and the results and effects were analyzed. This study discussed how the findings affected this diverse work environment and proposed opportunities for further research in law enforcement education and practice.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Although still under-researched and characterized by a fragmented understanding, unlearning and forgetting have recently received increased scholarly attention. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to survey and evaluate key works in the field of organizational unlearning and forgetting. Through analyzing and synthesizing common themes, this paper aims to highlight research gaps and avenues for future research. Design/methodology/approach: This paper follows a systematic approach of identifying, analyzing and synthesizing pertinent literature in the field of organizational unlearning and forgetting. In total, 63 works were thoroughly reviewed. Findings: This paper highlights different levels and scopes, as well as antecedents and consequences of organizational unlearning and forgetting. Even though unlearning and forgetting has gained increased attention, researchers still need to provide robust conceptual and empirical evidence to advance the field. Originality/value: By structuring the analysis and synthesis around various constructs, theories, typologies and related themes, this paper outlines several research gaps and proposes avenues for further research. Additionally, this systematic literature review resulted in the development of a framework based on the intentionality and depth of knowledge loss, which allows future researchers to position their research and differentiate themselves from other literature in the field.

    "Abstract": "In the modern world, it is increasingly moving from the classic way of managing people, natural and material resources to the knowledge management process. Knowledge Management (Knowledge Management or KM for Knowledge) is a system that helps us understand how and why something happened in a particular organization or enterprise. In the business world, this process is also called \"corporate memory\". Knowledge in this context is seen as an organization 's ability to function effectively. Knowledge management is a name that indicates a process in which an organization, collectively, intentionally and systematically collects, organizes, exchanges, shares and analyzes its own resources in terms of resources, documents, knowledge and skills of its associates. At the beginning of 1998, technological advances made it possible to eliminate the deficiency observed across business sectors: companies did not systematically manage the knowledge they gained in their work. If an employee leaves the company, there was an irrecoverable loss of knowledge, and the whole process of training, acquisition of knowledge and development of the methodology had to be repeated. Only a decade later, things have changed and many organizations have developed knowledge management systems. This concept attracted the attention to NGO because many of them generate knowledge, on the one hand, andface rapid changes of associates on the other. Knowledge management implies the ability to organize data (mining data), as well as some ways in which the searched data will \"push\" the target users, because the very existence of resources is not enough incentive for adult learning. Dealing with the knowledge component within business activities as explicitly expressed and integrated into all aspects of strategy work, through policy to practice at all levels in the organization.

    "Abstract": "Background Study motivation and knowledge retention benefit from regular student self-assessments. Inclusion of certainty-based learning (CBL) in computer-assisted formative tests may further enhance this by enabling students to identify whether they are uninformed or misinformed regarding the topics tested, which may trigger future study actions including instructor consultation. Methods Using a cross-over study design involving two out of thirteen computer-assisted formative assessments (CAFAs) of a first-year cell biology course, we compared student-instructor interactions, student learning experiences and final exam scores between two (bio)medical science student cohorts who worked with different CBL-containing CAFAs. Results A total of 389 students participated in the study. After completion 159 (41%) filled in a questionnaire on their experience with CBL during supervised CAFAs. In the control group the median duration of student-instructor interactions was 90 s (range 60–140 s), and this increased with 20 s to 110 s (range 60–150 s) in the group working with a CBL-based CAFA. The number of interactions was similar in both groups (0.22 per student per hour, regardless of CBL inclusion). Forty percent of the students expected that CBL would positively influence their study behavior, and 23% also anticipated a positive effect on examination scores. Student examination scores, however, were not affected by CBL. Almost half of the students (43%) were in favor of CBL inclusion in future computer-assisted learning modules, whereas 33% did not see merit in including CBL in CAFAs. Conclusions Incorporation of CBL in a single formative assessment led to a slight increase in student-instructor interaction times, but had effect neither on the number of student-instructor interactions nor on exam scores. CBL inclusion positively influenced student’s appreciation of the coursework, presumably by helping students to evaluate their mastery level and identify misconceptions. A more extensive enrollment of CBL beyond an individual formative assessment, throughout a course or a curriculum, may possibly reveal positive effects on study efficacy.",

    "Abstract": "With the emergence of the evolutionary approach, tacit knowledge gained greater significance as a new internal resource of competitiveness of companies. This paper, through the research undertaken on industrial SME in Algeria, attempts to highlight the continuous loss of knowledge capital. Thus, it exposes the three elements on which tacit knowledge has been developed: professional experience, learning through practice and routines. It also suggests the need for adopting a new model of growth likely to exploit remaining tacit knowledge accumulated over the last years to adapt with the oil revenue issues in which the Algerian industrial SME is encrusted.",

    "Abstract": "[Purpose] The present study analyzed the degree of retention of knowledge from physical therapy lectures for the development of practical courses. [Participants and Methods] The participants were 80 second-year students in a department of physical therapy who had registered for both lectures and practical courses. A pop quiz regarding basic knowledge tested in mid- and end-term examinations was administered on the first day of the practical training to check the degree of retention of knowledge demonstrated in the examinations. [Results] The grades of both the mid-term and end-term pop quizzes showed lower values than those of the tests taken in the lecture subject. [Conclusion] The results of the present study suggest that the partial loss of knowledge from lecture subjects should be considered in the development of practical courses, because all such knowledge wasn’t retained, even though the participants in this study had received credit for the lecture subject.",

Automation complacency - a state characterized by over-trust in intelligent systems - has the potential to result in catastrophic performance failure. An under-investigated factor in automation complacency research is the effect that DSS might have on human learning of domain concepts. In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of two studies of users interacting with decision aids to understand how knowledge retention is affected by the competence and presentation of a DSS. Our results indicate that while humans have the opportunity to learn and internalize domain concepts while being supported by a DSS, features that make the DSS appear more competent, persuasive, or customizable may lead a user to form incorrect beliefs about a domain.",

    "Abstract": "Two-stage collaborative testing is an assessment strategy that involves students initially writing a test individually and then immediately afterward writing the same (or similar) test again in groups. Current evidence shows that two-stage testing improves performance on multiple-choice tests as well as short-term retention of material, but little is known about the effect on long-answer questions and retention across a longer time frame. The purpose of this study was to determine (a) if two-stage testing improves performance on both multiple-choice and long-answer questions, (b) if two-stage testing improves short- and long-term knowledge retention, and (c) whether there are differences in knowledge retention based on question type. A two-stage midterm with both question types was administered in two undergraduate science courses, followed by a short-term and long-term retention test. Performance on both question types improved, with comparable improvement on both question types. Two-stage testing also maintained knowledge retention from the original midterm for both question types in the short term, although the learning gains for long-term retention were less apparent.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study examined whether Motivational Interviewing (MI) follow-up calls improved the extent to which a specific therapeutic technique (Key Word Sign) presented in training was retained and implemented by staff supporting people with an intellectual disability.Method: Thirty-eight residential support workers who attended Key Word Sign (KWS) training were divided into three groups. One group received post training MI follow-up calls, the second received non-MI \"check-in control\" (CIC) follow-up calls and the third received no follow-up calls.Results: Both follow-up conditions outperformed the no follow-up condition on KWS knowledge retention and use. No significant differences were noted between the MI and CIC condition in this study.Conclusion: The results highlight the value of post-training follow-up in promoting knowledge retention and implementation of skills. Methodological challenges (including treatment fidelity issues across groups) prevented firm conclusions about the impact of MI from being drawn.",

    "Abstract": "With the rapid development of new digital technologies, cities are increasingly critical sites of techno-social experimentation and transformation. Through ‘smart city’ initiatives, city governments around the world are partnering with transnational technology firms to deeply integrate digital technologies—including extensive Internet of Things (IoT) sensing networks and increasingly complex infrastructures for data analytics—into everyday urban spaces. At the same time, emerging forms of digitally-mediated “platform capitalism,” represented by companies such as Airbnb and Uber, are dramatically disrupting existing economic, political and socio-spatial relations across urban contexts. In opposition to these trends, citizens’ initiatives in Barcelona, Spain are organizing around calls for “technological sovereignty,” radically rethinking existing models of urban development by claiming community control over emerging digital technologies. My ethnographic dissertation asks: Are emerging digital technologies inherently tools of technocratic governance, surveillance, and capital accumulation? Or how might they become loci for imagining and building alternative digital urban futures? I operationalize this question through three sub-questions focused on the production of alternative economies, urban space, and digital subjectivities, respectively, within the movement for technological sovereignty in Barcelona. These three sub-questions are the basis of the three articles attached as appendices. The first paper (Appendix A) explores the concept of technological sovereignty employed by activists in Barcelona, describing its basis in experiments with alternative arrangements of work and property, an ethics of care, and an engagement with municipal institutions. Reviewing existing literature on the politics of digital development in geography, I argue for the need to think beyond critiques of techno-capitalist development—and beyond binaries of techno-optimism and techno-pessimism. Analyses of ongoing processes of technological change in general, and smart cities in particular, too often present emerging digital technologies as silver-bullet solutions to a multitude of existing societal problems—making the world more connected, efficient, and sustainable, holding the promise to improve quality of life for millions of people. In contrast, more critical approaches highlight the ways such processes facilitate increased state and corporate surveillance, new forms of power and control, and new forms of exploitation and exclusion. Beyond such binaries, this paper argues for the need to imagine a multiplicity of possible social futures emergent in the entangled processes of urban and technological change. It explores the practices and discourses of the TS movement as a way to demonstrate how such alternatives might be brought about through grassroots organizing and collective experimentation. The second article (Appendix B) engages geographic literature on the automatic production of space—the way evolving assemblages of hardware, code, and data produce space with little to no direct human intervention—viewing it through the lens of philosopher Bernard Stiegler’s notion of proletarianization as the loss of knowledge. In contrast to this view of digital infrastructure, I describe the practices of Guifinet—neighborhood-based associations that build and maintain their own broadband internet infrastructure—focusing on the multiple forms of knowledge production and circulation on which the project is based. I present Guifinet as an example of amateur practices of de -proletarianization—as participants re-claim critical forms of knowledge about the processes (re)producing urban space. In doing so, I demonstrate the possibilities for digital infrastructures to create new spaces for democratic power based on alternative logics of techno-social organization. The third article (Appendix C) explores the question of digital subjectivity in the movement for technological sovereignty in Barcelona. I approach digital subjectivity as the way people understand their relationship to digital technology and processes of technological change, structured by discursively produced hierarchies of technological expertise that are intimately entangled in the reproduction of gender, race, class, age, and other axes of difference. The paper employs the work of Stiegler (1998) and Barad (2007) to explore the co-constitution of humanity and technics, and recognize the way material practices involving an array of human and nonhuman actors iteratively reproduce hierarchies of difference. Against the hegemonic subject positions of techno-capitalism, I explore the practices of technological sovereignty activists that challenge the discursive privileging and separation of “technical” knowledge from its social entanglements and produce a diversity of subjects enacting a being-toward alternative techno-social futures.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The knowledge loss or longevity of taught lessons is a major concern in medical students and all medical practitioners. This study evaluated the physiology knowledge loss in medical students in Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences in Iran. Methods: A total of 265 volunteers from medical students who had previously passed the “general exam of medical basic sciences” at the end of fifth semester took a retention test (RT) to evaluate their knowledge loss of physiology. The candidates were divided into ten groups depending on the semester (S) they were passing at the time of study: 41 students in preclinical levels (S6 and S7), 123 students in externship levels (S8, S9, S10, S11 and S12), and 101 students in internship levels (S13, S14 and S15). The RT consisted of 20 multiple choice questions from all topics of medical physiology, including central nervous system, endocrine, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, blood, and cellular. Results: Findings showed that there was a decreasing trend of knowledge loss from S6 to S15. The lowest level of knowledge loss was observed in S15 students. These results also demonstrated that knowledge loss in male medical students was more than that in female students. Conclusion: These findings indicated that the physiology knowledge loss trend is inversely correlated with the time passing. We conclude that the reason is that physiology is a basic science which is most applicable during medical students’ clinical years.",

The study adopted quantitative approach through questionnaire to collect data randomly from the sample of two hundred and seventy six (N=276) research scientists. The study revealed that cross-functional project teams and mentoring were the main knowledge management resources and techniques used to derive research and innovations in the institutes. Findings also show that the knowledge management initiatives adopted in the institutes include, identification of existing knowledge, improving documentation of existing knowledge, changing of the organisational culture, improving cooperation and communication, externalisation, i.e. tacit to explicit, improving knowledge retention, and improving innovations management. The study concludes that the knowledge management resources and techniques used are capable of enhancing the various knowledge management initiatives adopted in the institutes.",

    "Abstract": "Succession planning is fast becoming a crucial component of workforce planning for local government organizations. Local governments and small corporations face increasing competition from large private sector organizations and each other for a limited amount of qualified workers. The loss of experienced personnel threatens the organizations existing knowledge pool. The strategy of succession management in the context of workforce planning to retain organizational knowledge assets is the conceptual basis by which succession plans become policy. Succession planning has become a viable solution to some of the problems small governments face as they attempt to meet citizen’s expectations for the uninterrupted continuation of essential services. This research effort was to study the operation of a local government entity concerning succession planning in the organization. The theory of organizational knowledge transfer, which is a dynamic part of how organizations retain and expand their knowledge base in a linear hierarchy from one generation of employees to the next, undergirded this research. The seminal study by Grant (1996) highlighted the need for knowledge retention and management. The methodology was a Qualitative Case Study that involved survey responses by employees in a typical county government in Florida. The first goal of the research was to acquire a greater understanding of succession planning strategies and implementation within a local government organization. The second was to study how to create a viable succession plan that can be successfully implemented in all departments within the local government. The findings revealed an organization that has shown no serious effort in developing succession-planning strategies for addressing knowledge asset loss or personnel shortages. Despite the facts that the theories of knowledge management and warnings of labor shortages have existed for several decades, there was little evidence of any policy initiatives to deal with either problem as evidenced by no administrative leadership and lack of subject knowledge on the part of the stakeholders. Recommendations for practice included administration leadership, employing the human resource department in developing a viable program, creating an oversite hierarchy, and stakeholder education in knowledge management and succession-planning theory and operation. i",

    "Abstract": "There is a lack of consensus among educators regarding the ideal structure of radiology training in veterinary medicine. Research in the medical field suggests that early integration has positive short- and long-term impacts on student interest in radiology. This study evaluated the effect of a new radiology course in the first year of the veterinary curriculum. Authors hypothesized that students taught radiology in years 1 and 2 would have greater interest in and appreciation for the specialty of radiology and would perform better on tests of basic knowledge of medical imaging principles, entry-level image interpretation, and anatomy identification than students who were not taught until year 2. An online questionnaire was administered to different classes of students after completion of their radiology courses. Students with early and increased radiology training were significantly more likely to respond that radiology was more interesting than other veterinary specialties. Unexpectedly, students with early and increased training performed significantly better than students with less and later training on only one out of nine content knowledge questions, though they did perform significantly better on additional knowledge questions compared to students with only early exposure. This suggests early and increased training in radiology may increase student interest in and appreciation for the specialty, but may not lead to increased short-term knowledge retention compared to a traditional curriculum format.There is a lack of consensus among educators regarding the ideal structure of radiology training in veterinary medicine.

    "Abstract": "The knowledge loss or longevity of taught lessons is a major concern in medical students and all medical practitioners. This study evaluated the physiology knowledge loss in medical students in Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences in Iran. PURPOSE The knowledge loss or longevity of taught lessons is a major concern in medical students and all medical practitioners. This study evaluated the physiology knowledge loss in medical students in Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences in Iran.A total of 265 volunteers from medical students who had previously passed the \"general exam of medical basic sciences\" at the end of fifth semester took a retention test (RT) to evaluate their knowledge loss of physiology. The candidates were divided into ten groups depending on the semester (S) they were passing at the time of study: 41 students in preclinical levels (S6 and S7), 123 students in externship levels (S8, S9, S10, S11 and S12), and 101 students in internship levels (S13, S14 and S15). The RT consisted of 20 multiple choice questions from all topics of medical physiology, including central nervous system, endocrine, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, blood, and cellular. METHODS A total of 265 volunteers from medical students who had previously passed the \"general exam of medical basic sciences\" at the end of fifth semester took a retention test (RT) to evaluate their knowledge loss of physiology.

The RT consisted of 20 multiple choice questions from all topics of medical physiology, including central nervous system, endocrine, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, blood, and cellular.Findings showed that there was a decreasing trend of knowledge loss from S6 to S15. The lowest level of knowledge loss was observed in S15 students. These results also demonstrated that knowledge loss in male medical students was more than that in female students. RESULTS Findings showed that there was a decreasing trend of knowledge loss from S6 to S15. The lowest level of knowledge loss was observed in S15 students. These results also demonstrated that knowledge loss in male medical students was more than that in female students.These findings indicated that the physiology knowledge loss trend is inversely correlated with the time passing. We conclude that the reason is that physiology is a basic science which is most applicable during medical students' clinical years.

    "Abstract": "Organizational success is dependent on innovation, which is dependent upon the creation of new knowledge, and thus was an important area for new research. Architectural designers and environmental psychologists identified a causal relationship between a physical environment and the behavior of its occupants. The general problem was the absence of evidence-based guidance to plan employee workspace in organizational strategic decisions to support knowledge creation, organizational learning, and innovation. The specific problem for this research effort was to reduce the theoretical uncertainty concerning a wide range of physical space attributes and spatial arrangements, which enable or hinder knowledge functions. The concept of architectural determinism indicated architectural design affected human behavior as an independent variable of cause and effect. This study integrated the focused results of previous researchers on the separate features of the physical environment. This study gathered technical information about workspaces in various building structures for architects, organizational managers, and knowledge-workers to consider in construction projects for the selection of physical space attributes to enhance results as ideation and knowledge sharing. The theoretical lens included the organizational knowledge creation (OKC) theory and the socio-technical systems (STS) theory. This study explored the physical space attributes where 11 knowledge workers created new knowledge and shared their new knowledge with others. The participants contributed to both radical and incremental innovations, 64% and 36% respectively. This research followed the biographical narrative interpretive method open narrative interview style. Coding protocols separated the data for the actual physical space attributes experienced by knowledge creators and knowledge workers. The findings included, access, indoor environment quality (air quality, lighting, noise, thermal comfort), room characteristics (colors, condition, shape, type, and ceilings), biophilics, furnishings, pictures, technology, and windows (daylight and views). This study found how stimulation outside of ideation spaces, windows in ideation spaces, and standing and walking in collaboration spaces contributed to knowledge creation and sharing. Further, this study found why: windows, standing and walking, isolation and quiet rooms, pictures, daylight spectrum lighting, standing desks, and thermal comfort contributed to knowledge creation; and why soundproof collaboration spaces and thermal comfort contributed to knowledge sharing. Specific contributions of this research study expanded the understanding of how knowledge creators use window views to expand their mind space for new thoughts, and recommended future research on substitutions for the stimulation of window views. Furthermore, the role of isolation and quiet spaces to prevent the loss of knowledge creators’ train of thought requires future research when the knowledge creator is out walking to experience sensory stimulation while thinking. Future researchers should also explore use of the proposed triangulation instrument for a virtual focus group as a modified nominal group technique to expand use of triangulation to increase transparency and the usefulness of any qualitative research findings.",

    "Abstract": "One of the licensing requirements for cupping providers in Saudi Arabia is to attend a compulsory training course that lasts 5 days for non-physicians and 4 days for physicians, irrespective of any previous experience in cupping therapy. The course is conducted by the National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM/MOH). As a part of course auditing, the current study aimed to evaluate knowledge retention among licensed cupping providers 1-3 years after passing the official cupping course. BACKGROUND One of the licensing requirements for cupping providers in Saudi Arabia is to attend a compulsory training course that lasts 5 days for non-physicians and 4 days for physicians, irrespective of any previous experience in cupping therapy. The course is conducted by the National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM/MOH). As a part of course auditing, the current study aimed to evaluate knowledge retention among licensed cupping providers 1-3 years after passing the official cupping course.Licensed cupping providers were invited to attend a continuing medical education activity. Sixty-two attended the continuing medical education activity. Before the event, participants were asked to answer 35 multiple-choice questions taken from the same data bank as the pretest and posttest of the course. The test scores were linked and compared with the pre- and posttest of the training course. METHODS Licensed cupping providers were invited to attend a continuing medical education activity. Sixty-two attended the continuing medical education activity. Before the event, participants were asked to answer 35 multiple-choice questions taken from the same data bank as the pretest and posttest of the course. The test scores were linked and compared with the pre- and posttest of the training course.A paired t test showed significant differences between the pre- and posttest knowledge scores (mean difference: 224.6 ± 86, p = 0.0001) and between the posttest and follow-up knowledge scores (mean difference: -115.26 ± 103.9, p = 0.0001). The follow-up score was still significantly higher than the pretest score, with a mean difference of 112 (95% CI: 83.66-140.34, p = 0.0001). There was no significant effect of category (physician vs. non-physician) on knowledge retention after controlling for the postcourse score. Gender, the total duration of experience, and total years of experience in cupping did not affect knowledge score retention between the physicians and the non-physicians. RESULTS A paired t test showed significant differences between the pre- and posttest knowledge scores (mean difference: 224.6 ± 86, p = 0.0001) and between the posttest and follow-up knowledge scores (mean difference: -115.26 ± 103.9, p = 0.0001).

Gender, the total duration of experience, and total years of experience in cupping did not affect knowledge score retention between the physicians and the non-physicians.The official cupping training course of the NCCAM/MOH achieved reasonable knowledge retention. To achieve long-term knowledge retention, refresher training/courses and continuous professional development will be required.

    "Abstract": "This study examined enterprise social media (ESM) use by personnel at joint military staff organizations. The research addressed the problem of organizational knowledge loss caused by routine personnel rotations and unexpected turnover, and how emerging enterprise social software may be employed to mitigate the effect. A qualitative phenomenological study gathered data in support of the central research question: What are the enterprise social media strategies joint commands use to mitigate organizational knowledge loss? Semi-structured interviews were conducted via video chat with ten former military participants from a population of individuals with recent experience in joint commands, part of the United States military that have intentionally high turnover and are highly collaborative teams of knowledge workers. Qualified participants were recruited via LinkedIn professional collegial networks and other social media groups. The findings were that joint commands provide enterprise social media tools, but employ varied strategies toward their adoption and use by the staff. Also, turnover-induced organizational knowledge loss remains a challenge, and first-generation network tools such as email and shared drives present individual and organizational knowledge management challenges. Barriers to wider adoption of enterprise social media tools within joint commands are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system which leads to demyelination and neurodegeneration. The T and B cells, the body's immune cells, start attacking the brain and spinal cord, leading to a variety of symptoms. Alemtuzumab is a recently approved disease-modifying therapy that has been shown to have a very high impact on MS. However, it has many potentially life-threatening side effects which patients are often not aware of. For treatments as effective and risky as Alemtuzumab, patients who are considering it must be well-informed on the process and the potential side effects. Patient education is vital to equip patients with knowledge on their disease and treatment, and has shown to be successful in improving the management of chronic diseases and increasing medication adherence. Unfortunately, the language used is often too complex and at a higher reading level than average patients can comprehend, and available resources such as pamphlets and websites are often disorganized. This research proposes a radically different approach to patient education, using less formal channels such as a mobile application to improve health literacy, using LEMTRADA ® (Alemtuzumab) as an example. MS patients were involved in a co-design process to produce a series of user-friendly, intuitive and interactive graphical interfaces which propose plain language, illustrations, animations, audio and Augmented Reality components that aim to enhance patients' knowledge retention and recall. Finally, nine MS patients along with a senior MS nurse tested the mobile application and answered a usability questionnaire that aimed to compare the delivery of information with typical websites and pamphlets. Results suggested this approach to be highly user-friendly and engaging, improving patients' understanding of medical information considerably. This research illustrates more engaging channels to communicate with MS patients in order to enhance health literacy.Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system which leads to demyelination and neurodegeneration.

    "Abstract": "Objectives Considering the urgent need of training to improve standardised management of drug-resistant infectious disease and the lack of evidence on the impact of training, this study evaluates whether training participants’ knowledge on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is improved immediately and a year after training. Setting and participants The study involved 91 MDR-TB healthcare providers (HCPs), including clinical doctors, nurses and CDC staff, who attended a new MDR-TB HCP training programme in Liaoning and Jiangxi provinces, China. Main outcome measures A phone-based assessment of participants’ long-term retention of knowledge about MDR-TB management was conducted in July 2017, approximately 1 year after training. The proportion of correct responses in the long-term knowledge assessment was compared with a pretraining test and an immediate post-training test using a χ 2 test. Factors influencing participants’ performance in the long-term knowledge assessment were analysed using linear regression. Results Across both provinces, knowledge of definitions of drug-resistant TB, standardised MDR-TB case detection protocols and laboratory diagnosis was improved 1 year after the training by 14.5% (p=0.037), 32.4% (p<0.001) and 31% (p<0.001) relative to pretraining. However, compared with immediately after training, the knowledge of the three topics declined by 26.5% (p=0.003), 19.8% (p=0.018) and 52.7% (p<0.001) respectively in Jiangxi, while no significant decline was observed in Liaoning. Additionally, we found that obtaining a higher score in the long-term knowledge assessment was associated with longer years of clinical experience (coefficient=0.51; 95 CI% 0.02 to 0.99; p=0.041) and attending training in Liaoning (coefficient=0.50; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.85; p=0.007). Conclusion Our study, the first to assess knowledge retention of MDR-TB HCPs 1 year after training, showed an overall positive long-term impact of lecture-style group training on participants’ knowledge. Knowledge decline 1 year after training was observed in one province, Jiangxi, and this may be partly addressed by targeted support to HCPs with fewer years of clinical experience.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Based on the theory of conservation of resources (Hobfoll, 1989), the purpose of this paper is to propose job satisfaction as a mediator between the use of generativity and affective occupational commitment. The authors tested the mediating role of affective occupational commitment on the relationship between job satisfaction and retirement preparation. Design/methodology/approach A sequential mediation model was tested by the method of indirect effects based on a bootstrap analysis (Preacher and Hayes, 2004) based on 3,000 replications with a 95% confidence interval. The statistical treatments were carried out with the AMOS software V.22. Data were collected for a sample of 340 older workers (bridge and retirees) in Québec, Canada. Findings Results indicate that generativity was related positively to affective occupational commitment via job satisfaction. Moreover, job satisfaction was also related positively to retirement preparation through affective occupational commitment. Practical implications The results can be helpful to guide organizational efforts at retaining older workers, and also recruiting and selecting those who want to return to work after retiring. They provide an insight on the effect of one of the main human resources practices or strategies, that is, programs aiming to attract and retain older workers to stay in the workplace and to encourage retirees to return to work in the form of bridge employment for example. Originality/value The study adds to the existing literature by examining a sequential mediation model to understand the relationship between organizational resources, job attitudes and retirement planning. It thus answers the call for more research and a theoretical framework on these critical variables for the retirement decision-making process. The findings can also contribute to the field of knowledge retention and fulfill some gaps in the literature on this topic. Indeed, examining the use of generativity in the study can help researchers and practitioners to better understand the reasons that encourage older workers to continue working and retirees to return to work.",

    "Abstract": "Objective. To review the types of pre-class learning modalities used in flipped classrooms (FC) and team-based learning (TBL) and determine best practices. Findings. Forty-eight articles were included. Reading materials or video lectures were used most often as the primary modality to deliver the pre-class learning. Students favored assignments that have clear objectives, provide guidance, are guided, and are brief. Summary. This study describes how pharmacy schools and colleges are implementing FC into their curricula and the types of pre-class learning that are being developed and assigned with the implementation. More research should be done in comparing the impact of different types of pre-class material on learning outcomes, such as knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "Background: The current resuscitation guidelines recommend frequent simulation based medical education (SBME). However, the current SBME approach is expensive, time-intensive, and requires a specialized lab and trained instructors. Hence, it is not offered routinely at all hospitals. We designed the board game \"RETAIN\" to train healthcare providers (HCPs) in neonatal resuscitation in a cost-friendly and accessible way. Objectives: To examine if a board game-based training simulator improves knowledge retention in HCPs. Methods: \"RETAIN\" consists of a board using an image of a baby, visual objects, adjustable timer, monitors, and action cards. Neonatal HCPs at the Royal Alexandra Hospital were invited to participate. Participants completed a written pre-test (resuscitation of a 24-week infant), then played the board game (starting with a tutorial followed by free playing of three evidence-based neonatal resuscitation scenarios). Afterwards, a post-test with the same resuscitation scenario and an opinion survey was completed. The answers from the pre- and post-test were compared to assess HCPs' knowledge retention. Results: Thirty HCPs (four doctors, 12 nurses, and 14 respiratory therapist) participated in the study. Overall, we observed a 10% increase in knowledge retention between the pre- and post-test (49-59%, respectively). Temperature management showed the most knowledge gain between the pre- and post-test (14-46%, respectively). Placement of a hat (10-43%), plastic wrap (27-67%), and temperature probe (7-30%) improved between the pre- and post-test. Conclusion: Knowledge retention increased by 12% between pre- and post-test (49-61%, respectively). The improvement in performance and knowledge supports the use of board game simulations for clinical training.Background: The current resuscitation guidelines recommend frequent simulation based medical education (SBME).

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to examine the effectiveness of organizational information technology (IT)-based and non-IT-based knowledge transfer mechanisms (KTMs) for the retention of different types of knowledge from mobile experts. It differentiates among four types of knowledge loss (KL), namely, conscious knowledge (i.e. individual explicit knowledge that can be codified); codified knowledge (i.e. explicit knowledge captured at the social level); automatic knowledge (i.e. implicit individual knowledge); and collective knowledge (i.e. implicit knowledge embedded in the organization). Design/methodology/approach A research framework connecting the organizational knowledge retention (KR) cycle to KL is developed and an exploratory analysis is conducted using data from two case studies in the Canadian federal public service. Findings are confirmed using a third government agency. Findings Without the right processes in place for organizational knowledge retrieval and reuse, the KR cycle is not complete, leading to KL. The lack of available social KTMs for the conversion of individual to social objectified knowledge leads to KL. KTMs shortcomings increase the risk of automatic and objectified KL. Research limitations/implications Exploratory results demonstrate that KL does not always equate to lack of KR. Implementing knowledge-specific organizational KTMs is important to encourage the retention of individual knowledge at the social level. Propositions and a framework are developed for future research. Practical implications Mobile experts hold valuable knowledge at high risk of being lost by organizations. This paper provides managers with a set of guidelines to develop a knowledge-specific strategy focused on KTMs that increase KR and mitigate KL. Originality/value This paper challenges the assumption that KL only results from poor retention and studies both retention and loss to identify additional types of unintentional loss that occur when individual knowledge is not converted to social knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "Background Uganda is a low income country that continues to experience disease outbreaks caused by emerging and re-emerging diseases such as cholera, meningococcal meningitis, typhoid and viral haemorrhagic fevers. The Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was adopted by WHO-AFRO in 1998 as a comprehensive strategy to improve disease surveillance and response in WHO Member States in Africa and was adopted in Uganda in 2000. To address persistent inconsistencies and inadequacies in the core and support functions of IDSR, Uganda initiated an IDSR revitalisation programme in 2012. The objective of this evaluation was to assess IDSR core and support functions after implementation of the revitalised IDSR programme. Methods The evaluation was a cross-sectional survey that employed mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. We assessed IDSR performance indicators, knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention and level of confidence in performing IDSR tasks among health workers who underwent IDSR training. Qualitative data was collected to guide the interpretation of quantitative findings and to establish a range of views related to IDSR implementation. Results Between 2012 and 2016, there was an improvement in completeness of monthly reporting (69 to 100%) and weekly reporting (56 to 78%) and an improvement in timeliness of monthly reporting (59 to 93%) and weekly reporting (40 to 68%) at the national level. The annualised non-polio AFP rate increased from 2.8 in 2012 to 3.7 cases per 100,000 population < 15 years in 2016. The case fatality rate for cholera decreased from 3.2% in 2012 to 2.1% in 2016. All districts received IDSR feedback from the national level. Key IDSR programme challenges included inadequate numbers of trained staff, inadequate funding, irregular supervision and high turnover of trained staff. Recommendations to improve IDSR performance included: improving funding, incorporating IDSR training into pre-service curricula for health workers and strengthening support supervision. Conclusion The revitalised IDSR programme in Uganda was associated with improvements in performance. However in 2016, the programme still faced significant challenges and some performance indicators were still below the target.

    "Abstract": "Outsourcing provides organizations the opportunity for cost-saving and increased opportunities to build a competitive advantage, while better utilizing limited resources and focusing efforts on their strategic goals. There was a risk associated with deciding to outsource human resources (HR) functions in the federal government, which can influence management's ability to make informed decisions and affect an organization's effectiveness. Social groups inside an organization can influence knowledge, innovation, and productivity. Research has shown nothing emerges from a social group except individual behavior, and individual behavior can influence the organization's growth in a marketplace. The purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore the perceived risk to the federal government associated with deciding to outsource HR functions. This research was conducted using a qualitative method with a multiple case study design. Data collection and analysis focused on those federal agencies in the Washington, DC geographical area having at least 2,000 employees and outsourcing at least 40% of their HR functions (e.g., compensation and benefits, employee relations, and compliance) and support services (e.g., payroll, recruitment, and benefit administration). Once these organizations were identified, a review of historical documents related to outsourced functions covering a period of at least five-years will be performed using at a selected federal agency. Additionally, an observational research approach using naturalistic observation as teams of HR practitioners within the targeted agency was done as the practitioners performed duties within their everyday environment (e.g., approximately 3-5 teams with approximately 25 personnel as target sample size). Finally, one-on-one semi-structured interviews with purposefully selected HR staff and management (e.g., approximately 10-12 participants from the target agencies) was conducted. These interviews drew a deeper understanding of the shared experiences of the participants and the perceived influence outsourcing HR functions has on knowledge retention needed to be retained in the federal government. Knowledge gained from this study could add value to the body of knowledge for future HR professionals and management to make informed outsourcing decisions in the federal government. The findings of this research added value to the body of knowledge for future HR professionals to influence outsourcing decisions in the federal government. Additionally, this study may inspire future researchers' study of the desired competencies of HR practitioners in the federal government.

    "Abstract": "Objective Otolaryngology residents face time‐management challenges between clinical duties and self‐directed learning. Mobile devices provide a new medium for education that could aid with educational efficiency. The objective of this study was to investigate whether spaced repetition mobile app use of an otolaryngology question bank was associated with improving factual knowledge as measured by in‐service exam performance. Methods For approximately 6 months prior to the 2016 in‐service examination, 12 otolaryngology residents at a single institution were provided access to a spaced‐repetition app with a preloaded licensed otolaryngology review question bank. The number of questions answered, as well as the time spent on the app, were electronically tracked. The associations of app usage on in‐service results were analyzed using an autoregressive model adjusted for prior historical Otolaryngology Trainee Examination performance and postgraduate year. Results Eleven residents used the mobile app and were included in the analysis for an average of 304 minutes (range: 3 to 1,020) and reviewed on average 679 questions (range: 6 to 1,934). Controlling for residency year and prior performance, app usage was associated with an improvement by 2.92 percentage points (pp) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14, 5.70) on overall in‐service score. Allergy and pediatric subsection scores improved by 11.3 pp (95% CI: 3.8, 18.8) and 15.2 pp. (95% CI: 8.9, 21.5), respectively. Increased app use was associated with a score improvement by 0.008 pp per minute of use (95% CI: 0.004, 0.012).

    "Abstract": "Overlaying a building with images from the past can be an engaging way to explore a historic site. However, little is known about what type of content functions well when using augmented reality (AR) in outdoor contexts. This research investigates how different types of AR content—such as text or image—can affect the flow experience as well as other user affective and behavioural responses. We ran an experimental study with 85 participants at a university campus, where three groups used different apps—AR app with overlaid textual information, AR app with overlaid both textual information and images and an app with audio guide—to explore the area's historic and cultural background. The results show that overlaying images in addition to the text was clearly the most successful way of attracting attention and providing stronger flow in comparison to the apps that overlaid only text or delivered audio. However, we also discovered that users occasionally interpreted the overlaid imagery to be cues for something else other than what they were designed to represent. Finally, we discuss how AR content can enlarge otherwise invisible details, depict historic elements and unveil interiors of buildings.

    "Abstract": "In a context where distance, user fees, and health staff shortages constitute significant barriers to accessing facility-based family planning services, the use of community-based distributors (CBDs) as counseling and contraceptive providers has been tested in several resource-constrained environments to increase family planning uptake. In the capital city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kinshasa, a massive CBD program (AcQual) has been implemented since 2014, with lackluster results measured in terms of the low volume of contraceptives provided. A process evaluation conducted in 2017 assessed the fidelity of implementation of the program compared with the original AcQual design and analyzed gaps in provider training and motivation, contraceptive supplies, and reporting and monitoring processes. Its objective was to identify both theory and implementation failures in order to propose midcourse corrections for the program. The mixed-method data collection focused on the CBDs as a pivotal component of the AcQual program with 700 active CBDs interviewed. In addition, 10 in-depth interviews were conducted with clinical personnel, local health program managers, and project partners to identify gaps in the AcQual implementation environment. Issues with CBDs' performance, knowledge retention, and commitment to program activities, as well as gaps in contraceptive supply chains and insufficient monitoring and supervision processes, were the main implementation failures identified. Inappropriate method mix offered by the CBDs (condoms, pills, and CycleBeads only) and chronic overburdening of health care staff at the local level compounded these issues and explained the low volume of contraceptives provided through AcQual. Midcourse corrections included a more structured schedule of activities, stronger integration of CBDs with clinical providers and health zone managers, expansion of the mix of contraceptives offered to include subcutaneous injectables and emergency contraceptive pills, and clarifying reporting and monitoring responsibilities among all partners. Findings from this process evaluation contribute to the limited knowledge base regarding \"unwelcome results\" by examining all the intervention components and their relationships to highlight areas of potential failures, both in design and implementation, for similar CBD programs.In a context where distance, user fees, and health staff shortages constitute significant barriers to accessing facility-based family planning services, the use of community-based distributors (CBDs) as counseling and contraceptive providers has been tested in several resource-constrained environments to increase family planning uptake.

    "Abstract": "Family physicians are in frequent contact with patients, and their contribution to oral health promotion programs could be utilized more effectively. We implemented an oral health care (OHC) educational seminar for physicians and evaluated its impact on their knowledge retention in OHC. BACKGROUND Family physicians are in frequent contact with patients, and their contribution to oral health promotion programs could be utilized more effectively. We implemented an oral health care (OHC) educational seminar for physicians and evaluated its impact on their knowledge retention in OHC.We conducted an educational trial for primary care physicians (n = 106) working in Public Health Centers in Tehran city. We launched a self-administered questionnaire about pediatric dentistry, general dental, and dentistry-related medical knowledge and backgrounds. Physicians in intervention group A (n = 38) received an educational intervention (Booklet, Continuous Medical Education (CME), and Pamphlet), and those in group B (n = 32) received only an OHC pamphlet. Group C (n = 36) served as the control. A post-intervention survey followed four months later to measure the difference in the physicians' knowledge; the Chi-square test, ANOVA and linear regression analysis served for statistical analysis.

A post-intervention survey followed four months later to measure the difference in the physicians' knowledge; the Chi-square test, ANOVA and linear regression analysis served for statistical analysis.The intervention significantly increased the physicians' oral health knowledge scores in all three domains and their total knowledge score (p <  0.001). Those physicians who had lower knowledge scores at the baseline showed a higher increase in their post-intervention knowledge. The models showed no associations between the background variables and the knowledge change.

Those physicians who had lower knowledge scores at the baseline showed a higher increase in their post-intervention knowledge. The models showed no associations between the background variables and the knowledge change.The primary care physicians' OHC knowledge improved considerably after an educational seminar with a reminder. These findings suggest that OHC topics should be included in physicians' CME programs or in their curriculum to promote oral health, especially among non-privileged populations.

    "Abstract": "Decreasing the use of redundant anaerobic therapy is a key target for antimicrobial stewardship. Education techniques that optimize knowledge retention could be an important component of reducing these regimens. BACKGROUND Decreasing the use of redundant anaerobic therapy is a key target for antimicrobial stewardship. Education techniques that optimize knowledge retention could be an important component of reducing these regimens.We implemented a quality improvement project that incorporated spaced education to reduce the use of redundant anaerobic therapy. The initial interventions (November through December 2015) included education in a hospital-wide newsletter and review of redundant anaerobic regimens by the antimicrobial stewardship program. A spaced education module was then developed with the gastroenterology (GI) service, which had a relatively high rate of redundant anaerobic therapy use. Ten questions with teaching points were delivered to GI physicians at spaced intervals over 2 to 4 weeks (February through March 2016). Knowledge scores were compared at initial and final question presentation using generalized estimating equations. Interrupted time-series analysis was used to compare the rates of redundant-metronidazole-days per 1000 patient-days among patients in the patients admitted to the GI service and those in the non-GI group before and after the intervention.

Interrupted time-series analysis was used to compare the rates of redundant-metronidazole-days per 1000 patient-days among patients in the patients admitted to the GI service and those in the non-GI group before and after the intervention.Of 66 GI physicians, 56 (85%) participated in the spaced education activity. After the intervention, their knowledge scores on all the questions improved, and their mean knowledge score increased from 57% to 86% (P < .001). Nearly all (91%) of the participants were very or generally satisfied with the activity. In the GI group, the rate of redundant-metronidazole-days decreased from 26.2 to 13.0 per 1000 patient-days (relative risk [RR], 0.45 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.27-0.73]; P = .001). This rate in the non-GI group also decreased from 5.47 to 2.18 per 1000 patient-days (RR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.36-0.60]; P < .001) after our interventions.

    "Abstract": "Learning and teaching algebra concepts are frequent problems for both students and teachers alike. Students struggle to learn algebra, and teachers struggle to identify the best way to teach algebra. It is recurrent that teachers use instructional methods that promote memorization, and, consequently, the learning process may prove unsatisfactory. This paper introduces Virtual Algebra Tiles, an open educational resource whose purpose is to enable students to use algebra tiles from a computer to enhance their knowledge of algebra concepts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, we designed a case study. The participants were 40 students of engineering degrees who were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. Results indicate that the system has a large effect size (ES = 0.83, p < 0.001) on learning effectiveness and a promising long-term knowledge retention (ES = 0.79, p < 0.001). Students concluded that this version of algebra tiles is more motivating than other versions, because it is presented in a format that stands natural to them. Students feel more comfortable in virtual environments, and therefore, the learning process becomes a more pleasant task.",

    "Abstract": "GER German ger Philosophy needs History of Science needs History of Philosophy. The purpose of this essay is to identify why history of science and philosophy of science have lost their former alliance. Reasons include, among others, structural elements in funding, e.g. a run‐down version of interdisciplinarity that encourages philosophy and history to work with the sciences rather than with each other. Moreover, the disciplinary assemblage in terms of cultural studies (German: Kulturwissenschaften) has eroded the continental concept of ‘Geisteswissenschaft’ to which history and philosophy traditionally belong. In consequence, both disciplines face a loss of knowledge in historical terminologies and related inquiries. Above all, these matter for shaping and understanding concepts and ideas; not last for the conceptualization of history and philosophy of science themselves.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG Storytelling is a two-way interaction, written or oral, between someone telling a story and one or more listeners. It is a well-known and powerful means of communicating messages and engaging audiences. In this commentary paper, we present a framework for the integration of storytelling in systematic reviews and systematic maps at the stages where stakeholders are actively involved. Using storytelling to explain complex research has, in the past, not been considered a rigorous method of communicating science. But an increasing number of studies are showing how narratives can be useful for developing trust with an audience and increasing knowledge retention as well as the ability and willingness by audiences to learn and take action. Being easily digested by the human brain, stories help bridging between our logos and pathos; when an audience becomes emotionally receptive of facts, chances increase that they will respond and act on the knowledge. Here, we argue that storytelling holds potential as a tool in systematic reviews and systematic maps, serving mainly two purposes. First, collecting contextual narratives from stakeholders at the stages of question formulation and protocol writing can help to inform and generate relevant research questions and review designs. Here, we refer to contextual narratives as stories gathered from stakeholders to gain an understanding of their perspective. Second, creating a final story that faithfully presents the review results, while also relating to the contextual narratives, can contribute to effective communication of the results to stakeholders as well as to a broader audience. This approach can increase their engagement with the science and the implementation of evidence-based decisions. The paper concludes that storytelling holds untapped potential for communicating evidence from systematic reviews and maps for increased stakeholder engagement. It is time for researchers and research networks such as the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence to support and emphasize the importance of exploring new tools for effective science communication, such as storytelling.",

    "Abstract": "The case-based reasoning methodology fundamentally relies on historical cases to solve new problems. Supplementing insufficient data by the reproduction of appropriate values can mitigate the potential negative effects on the solutions resulting from sudden changes. However, CBR researchers have rarely examined this issue. To address this challenge, this research proposes a learning method for knowledge retention based on CBR by applying a data-mining approach to manage missing dataset values. A case study on a 164-apartment project was conducted to compare the estimation accuracy of the suggested learning method to that of past research with the same experiment conditions. The learning method with the CBR model achieved higher accuracy of the overall cost estimation and higher stability compared with the previous model. This research shows how cases can be generated and retained as learned cases to overcome the difficulties of continuous updates in a wide range of construction projects, as well as why the case bases need to be continuously updated. The research outcomes could support work related to cost estimation for decision makers ranging from beginners to experts in both academia and industry.",

    "Abstract": "Richard Mayer's cognitive theory of multimedia learning and multimedia learning principles provide theoretical and empirical foundations for multimedia instruction. However, the theory and the principles were developed based on empirical studies of native English-speaking students and may not apply to English-as-a-second-language (ESL) students. Specifically, the modality and redundancy principles that involve text and audio could become compromised in the ESL context, since ESL students have difficulty fully comprehending L2 (second language) English text and audio. This study sought to identify ESL students' optimum input mode (among graphics + audio, graphics + text, and graphics + audio + text, addressed in the modality and redundancy principles) and to test whether the modality and redundancy principles also apply to their multimedia learning. Empirical studies comparing the input modes for ESL students' learning were reviewed and common limitations were identified. When it came to knowledge retention, no statistically significant differences were found in ESL students' learning outcomes from the three input modes. The findings also indicated that Mayer's modality and redundancy principles had not applied to the learning of ESL students.

Our objective was to determine if repeated testing improved retention of pharmacy calculations and drug knowledge.Second, third, and fourth year pharmacy students were invited to participate in this voluntary study. Participants were divided into GPA categories and randomly assigned to a control or study group. Seven quizzes were given to the study group over one academic year. No quizzes were given to the control group. Both groups had access to the question bank from which the quizzes were constructed. A final exam and survey were given to both groups at the end of the study. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING Second, third, and fourth year pharmacy students were invited to participate in this voluntary study. Participants were divided into GPA categories and randomly assigned to a control or study group. Seven quizzes were given to the study group over one academic year. No quizzes were given to the control group. Both groups had access to the question bank from which the quizzes were constructed. A final exam and survey were given to both groups at the end of the study.We did not find an effect of repeated testing on knowledge retention for the study group compared to the control group in the study. However, when fourth year students were excluded from the analysis, we observed a benefit of repeated testing for lower-performing students. Over 90% of survey respondents agreed that repeated testing promoted long term knowledge and that students should test themselves repeatedly. However, approximately 60% of students admitted to not testing themselves repeatedly. Nearly 85% of survey respondents agreed that the school should implement a repeated testing program.

    "Abstract": "Philosophy needs History of Science needs History of Philosophy . The purpose of this essay is to identify why history of science and philosophy of science have lost their former alliance. Reasons include, among others, structural elements in funding, e.g. a run‐down version of interdisciplinarity that encourages philosophy and history to work with the sciences rather than with each other. Moreover, the disciplinary assemblage in terms of cultural studies (German: Kulturwissenschaften) has eroded the continental concept of ‘Geisteswissenschaft’ to which history and philosophy traditionally belong. In consequence, both disciplines face a loss of knowledge in historical terminologies and related inquiries. Above all, these matter for shaping and understanding concepts and ideas; not last for the conceptualization of history and philosophy of science themselves.",

    "Abstract": "Learning and teaching algebra concepts are frequent problems for both students and teachers alike. Students struggle to learn algebra, and teachers struggle to identify the best way to teach algebra. It is recurrent that teachers use instructional methods that promote memorization, and, consequently, the learning process may prove unsatisfactory. This paper introduces Virtual Algebra Tiles, an open educational resource whose purpose is to enable students to use algebra tiles from a computer to enhance their knowledge of algebra concepts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, we designed a case study. The participants were 40 students of engineering degrees who were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. Results indicate that the system has a large effect size (ES = 0.83, p  < 0.001) on learning effectiveness and a promising long‐term knowledge retention (ES = 0.79, p  < 0.001). Students concluded that this version of algebra tiles is more motivating than other versions, because it is presented in a format that stands natural to them. Students feel more comfortable in virtual environments, and therefore, the learning process becomes a more pleasant task. Alternate abstract: Lay Description What is already known about this topic: Inadequate teaching methodologies can lead to student failure. It is necessary to decrease the emphasis on memorization and to favour active learning techniques. The use of mathematical manipulatives increases students' learning gains. Algebra tiles are an educational resource that helps students understand algebra concepts by using geometric figures. What this paper adds: Virtual Algebra Tiles is a multimedia version of the educational resource algebra tiles. Virtual Algebra Tiles has a large effect size on students' learning achievements. Virtual Algebra Tiles improves students' long‐term knowledge retention. Implications for practices and/or policy: Teachers should participate in the development of digital pedagogical material to enrich their lectures. It is necessary to develop more open educational resources, which can be accessed by students and teachers. Digital educational resources must take into account the special needs of particular users.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to explore the factors associated with the recall of basic medical physiology knowledge among medical interns and to determine the level of retained basic science knowledge. Two hundred and four interns, 114 women and 90 men, working in two major tertiary medical care centers, King Fahad Medical City (KFMC; 29 students) and King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH; 117 students), in Riyadh city, participated in the study. An anonymous knowledge test with 10 validated multiple-choice questions was developed specifically for this purpose. One hundred and forty-six interns (117 working at KKUH and 29 at KFMC) had graduated from medical schools adopting a conventional instructional system, whereas 58 (3 from KKUH and 55 from KFMC had graduated from schools adopting an integrated system (hybrid problem-based learning). Fifty-two students (26%) gained a score =60%, whereas 152 students (74%) obtained <60% of the score. Higher scores were associated with younger age (P < 0.01), traditional curriculum (P < 0.001), interns from KKUH (P < 0.001), and candidates for postgraduate studies (P < 0.02). There was no significant association between recall of physiology knowledge and all other variables studied, including sex. Multivariate analyses show that age and traditional curriculum are the only significant predictors of knowledge retention. Almost three-fourths of the interns scored <60%, and higher scores were significantly associated with younger interns, traditional curriculum, working in KKUH, and interns preparing for graduate studies. However, the difference between the two curricula disappears when the influence of hospital training is considered.",

    "Abstract": "High-fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) is expensive in money and faculty resources. There has been a recent push to increase the use of HFPS for undergraduates to teach basic science. However, it is still unclear if HFPS is superior to other cost-effective modalities for learning, and there have been limited studies comparing HFPS directly with other methods. The purpose of this study was to compare learning between three groups: 1) students who participated in a HFPS after reading material (RS); 2) students who reread material (RR) individually; and 3) students who had no intervention or reading (CON). Quizzes (10 true/false questions) were given presimulation, immediately after the simulation (post-sim 1), and 1 wk later to all groups (post-sim 2). Ninety-seven undergraduate students consented to include their data in the study. All groups scored the same on the presimulation quiz (median of 6). The RR and RS scored significantly higher than the CON group on post-sim 1 (medians 8 vs. 6). All groups performed similarly on post-sim 2. A questionnaire also showed that students had increased perceived confidence about pathophysiology. These data suggest that a single-time use of HFPS for knowledge learning for undergraduate students is not more effective than other methods. Future studies need to determine whether increasing the number of HFPS and developing social learning networks could make HFPS more effective for undergraduates. Additionally, future studies should focus on soft skill development, such as confidence, critical thinking, and teamwork/communication skills, as opposed to knowledge acquisition.High-fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) is expensive in money and faculty resources.

Two hundred and four interns, 114 women and 90 men, working in two major tertiary medical care centers, King Fahad Medical City (KFMC; 29 students) and King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH; 117 students), in Riyadh city, participated in the study. An anonymous knowledge test with 10 validated multiple-choice questions was developed specifically for this purpose. One hundred and forty-six interns (117 working at KKUH and 29 at KFMC) had graduated from medical schools adopting a conventional instructional system, whereas 58 (3 from KKUH and 55 from KFMC had graduated from schools adopting an integrated system (hybrid problem-based learning). Fifty-two students (26%) gained a score ≥60%, whereas 152 students (74%) obtained <60% of the score. Higher scores were associated with younger age (P < 0.01), traditional curriculum (P < 0.001), interns from KKUH (P < 0.001), and candidates for postgraduate studies (P < 0.02). There was no significant association between recall of physiology knowledge and all other variables studied, including sex. Multivariate analyses show that age and traditional curriculum are the only significant predictors of knowledge retention. Almost three-fourths of the interns scored <60%, and higher scores were significantly associated with younger interns, traditional curriculum, working in KKUH, and interns preparing for graduate studies.

    "Abstract": "Informal health care providers particularly \"village doctors\" are the first point of care for under-five childhood illnesses in rural Bangladesh. We engaged village doctors as part of the Multi-Country Evaluation (MCE) of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) and assessed their management of sick under-five children before and after a modified IMCI training, supplemented with ongoing monitoring and supportive supervision. BACKGROUND Informal health care providers particularly \"village doctors\" are the first point of care for under-five childhood illnesses in rural Bangladesh. We engaged village doctors as part of the Multi-Country Evaluation (MCE) of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) and assessed their management of sick under-five children before and after a modified IMCI training, supplemented with ongoing monitoring and supportive supervision.In 2003-2004, 144 village doctors across 131 IMCI intervention villages in Matlab Bangladesh participated in a two-day IMCI training; 135 of which completed pre- and post-training evaluation tests. In 2007, 38 IMCI-trained village doctors completed an end-of-project knowledge retention test. Village doctor prescription practices for sick under-five children were examined through household surveys, and routine monitoring visits. In-depth interviews were done with mothers seeking care from village doctors. METHODS In 2003-2004, 144 village doctors across 131 IMCI intervention villages in Matlab Bangladesh participated in a two-day IMCI training; 135 of which completed pre- and post-training evaluation tests. In 2007, 38 IMCI-trained village doctors completed an end-of-project knowledge retention test. Village doctor prescription practices for sick under-five children were examined through household surveys, and routine monitoring visits. In-depth interviews were done with mothers seeking care from village doctors.Village doctors' knowledge on the assessment and management of childhood illnesses improved significantly after training; knowledge of danger signs of pneumonia and severe pneumonia increased from 39% to 78% ( P  < 0.0001) and from 17% to 47% ( P  < 0.0001) respectively. Knowledge on the correct management of severe pneumonia increased from 62% to 84% ( P  < 0.0001), and diarrhoea management improved from 65% to 82% ( P  = 0.0005). Village doctors retained this knowledge over three years except for home management of pneumonia. No significant differences were observed in prescribing practices for diarrhoea and pneumonia management between trained and untrained village doctors. Village doctors were accessible to communities; 76% had cell phones; almost all attended home calls, and did not charge consultation fees. Nearly all (91%) received incentives from pharmaceutical representatives.

Training alone did not improve inappropriate antibiotic prescription practices. Intensive monitoring and efforts to target key actors including pharmaceutical companies, which influence village doctors dispensing practices, and implementation of mechanisms to track and regulate these providers are necessary for future engagement in management of under-five childhood illnesses.

Nevertheless, games are not considered mainstream material in medical teaching. Two research questions that arise are the following: What pedagogical strategies do developers use when creating games for medical education? And what is the quality of the evidence on the effectiveness of games?A systematic review was made by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers following the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines. We included peer-reviewed journal articles which described or assessed the use of serious games or gamified apps in medical education. We used the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) to assess the quality of evidence in the use of games. We also evaluated the pedagogical perspectives of such articles. METHODS A systematic review was made by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers following the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines. We included peer-reviewed journal articles which described or assessed the use of serious games or gamified apps in medical education. We used the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) to assess the quality of evidence in the use of games. We also evaluated the pedagogical perspectives of such articles.Even though game developers claim that games are useful pedagogical tools, the evidence on their effectiveness is moderate, as assessed by the MERSQI score. Behaviourism and cognitivism continue to be the predominant pedagogical strategies, and games are complementary devices that do not replace traditional medical teaching tools. Medical educators prefer simulations and quizzes focused on knowledge retention and skill development through repetition and do not demand the use of sophisticated games in their classrooms. Moreover, public access to medical games is limited.

This makes sense since the practical use of games depends on the quality of the evidence about their effectiveness. Moreover, recognition of said pedagogical strategy would allow game developers to design more robust games which would greatly contribute to the learning process.

BACKGROUND Informed consent is a complex process to help patients engage in care processes and reach the best treatment decisions. There are many limitations to the conventional consent process that is based on oral discussion of information related to treatment procedures by the health care provider. A conclusive body of research supports the effectiveness of multimedia patient decision aids (PtDAs) in the consent process in terms of patient satisfaction, increased knowledge about the procedure, reduced anxiety level, and higher engagement in the decision making. Little information is available about the effectiveness of multimedia PtDAs in the consent process of invasive therapeutic procedures such as the peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC).The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a multimedia PtDA in supplementing the consent process of the PICC for patients in 10 acute and intensive care units in terms of knowledge recall, knowledge retention, satisfaction with the consent process, and satisfaction with the PICC multimedia PtDA. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a multimedia PtDA in supplementing the consent process of the PICC for patients in 10 acute and intensive care units in terms of knowledge recall, knowledge retention, satisfaction with the consent process, and satisfaction with the PICC multimedia PtDA.This pre-post quasi-experimental study included 130 patients for whom a PICC was ordered. Patients in the control group (n=65) received the conventional consent process for the PICC, while those in the intervention group (n=65) received the multimedia PtDA to support the consent process of a PICC. All patients were surveyed for knowledge recall and retention about the procedure and satisfaction with the consent process. Patients in the intervention group were also surveyed for their satisfaction with the multimedia PtDA. METHODS This pre-post quasi-experimental study included 130 patients for whom a PICC was ordered. Patients in the control group (n=65) received the conventional consent process for the PICC, while those in the intervention group (n=65) received the multimedia PtDA to support the consent process of a PICC. All patients were surveyed for knowledge recall and retention about the procedure and satisfaction with the consent process. Patients in the intervention group were also surveyed for their satisfaction with the multimedia PtDA.Compared with the control group, patients in the intervention group scored around 2 points higher on knowledge recall (t 125 =4.9, P 4.5 out of 5 on all items. Items with the highest mean scores were related to the effect of the multimedia PtDA on knowledge retention (mean 4.9 [SD 0.2]), patient readiness to learn (mean 4.8 [SD 0.5]), complete understanding of the procedure-related complications (mean 4.8 [SD 0.4]), and patient role in maintaining the safety of the PICC (mean 4.8 [SD 0.5]). Patients in the two groups were highly satisfied with the consent process. However, 15% (10/65) patients in the control group reported that the following information was omitted from the discussion: patient and provider roles in the safety of the PICC, other treatment options, and common side effects. Furthermore, 2 patients commented that they were not ready to engage in the discussion.

    "Abstract": "The authors perform a classroom experiment to test the effectiveness of discipline-specific case studies on knowledge acquisition and retention in advanced business statistics courses. The results indicate that although students are more engaged in the case studies, overall there is no impact on acquisition or retention of statistics knowledge by having students engage in discipline-specific case studies relative to traditional case studies. However, for high-performing students, discipline-specific case studies have a positive and significant impact on statistical knowledge retention. Moreover, our research reaffirms past research, which has found greater retention for students with higher grade point average, and there exists a significant negative correlation between retention and time.",

BACKGROUND Hands-only bystander CPR increases survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Video-based CPR instruction in schools has been proposed as a means to mass-educate laypersons in Hands-only CPR™ (HOCPR), in developed as well as developing countries.The purpose of this study is to determine whether a brief video- and mannequin-based instructional program, developed by the American Heart Association (AHA), is an effective strategy for teaching Costa Rican middle- and high-school age children to learn the steps of HOCPR. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is to determine whether a brief video- and mannequin-based instructional program, developed by the American Heart Association (AHA), is an effective strategy for teaching Costa Rican middle- and high-school age children to learn the steps of HOCPR.This study took place in four educational centers that spanned the entire socioeconomic spectrum within the Grand Metropolitan Area of Costa Rica. Three hundred and eight students from the sixth to eleventh grades participated. The intervention included exposure to the AHA \"CPR Anytime\" video and practice with CPR mannequins. Before and after the intervention, students took a four-question, multiple-choice quiz that measured their knowledge of the correct steps and proper techniques of HOCPR; a separate question assessed their level of comfort \"doing CPR on someone with a cardiac arrest.\" Pre- and post-intervention \"percent correct\" scores were compared and tested for statistical significance using paired t-tests or the McNemar test as appropriate. Improvement in knowledge and comfort levels were also compared across the different educational centers and compared with similar programs implemented in the United States. METHODS This study took place in four educational centers that spanned the entire socioeconomic spectrum within the Grand Metropolitan Area of Costa Rica. Three hundred and eight students from the sixth to eleventh grades participated. The intervention included exposure to the AHA \"CPR Anytime\" video and practice with CPR mannequins.

Improvement in knowledge and comfort levels were also compared across the different educational centers and compared with similar programs implemented in the United States.The students' overall scores (mean percent correct) on the multiple choice questions more than doubled after training (40.9% ± 1.4% before training vs. 92.5% ± 0.9% after training, p < 0.00001). Improvements were observed in each school, regardless of geographic location or socioeconomic status. Knowledge of the appropriate steps of HOCPR doubled after training (42.2% before training vs. 92.5% after training, p < 0.000001). Post-intervention, a majority (73%) of children reported comfort with performing CPR on an individual who had suffered a cardiac arrest. RESULTS The students' overall scores (mean percent correct) on the multiple choice questions more than doubled after training (40.9% ± 1.4% before training vs. 92.5% ± 0.9% after training, p < 0.00001).

    "Abstract": "Background Medical trainees play a critical role in the prescribing of antimicrobials. Prescriber education is one of the CDC core elements of antimicrobial stewardship programs. Optimal strategies for educating residents about antimicrobials have not been identified; however, the common practice of teaching all classes of available antibiotics over a short period of time (usually a single 1–2 hour lecture or “bolus”) is generally not well received and likely ineffective. Methods We developed a novel antibiotic of the month (AOTM) education program (“continuous infusion”) for pediatric residents. It included a monthly 10-minute presentation by an infectious diseases physician or fellow about a single commonly prescribed antibiotic, a handout summarizing important aspects of the antibiotic and a display posted in the resident workroom. An anonymous survey was sent to all pediatric residents before and 6 months after implementation of the AOTM program. The survey consisted of questions on demographics, satisfaction with the program, and antibiotic knowledge. Responses were tabulated and analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Responses were summarized and reported as a proportion of total responses. Results Both pre- and post-implementation surveys were completed by 21 pediatric residents (51% response rate). Prior to the AOTM program, 55% of respondents felt very or somewhat uncomfortable about their current level of knowledge about antimicrobials and antimicrobial prescribing. Six months after initiation of the program, 86% and 76% agreed or strongly agreed that their knowledge of antimicrobials and antimicrobial resistance, respectively, had improved. After introduction of the program, 81% felt more comfortable or much more comfortable with antimicrobial prescribing. Fifty-seven percent had referenced the handout at some point after the teaching session and 100% agreed that the program was worthwhile continuing in the next academic year. Conclusion A continuous infusion of antimicrobial education in the form of an AOTM education program was well received among pediatric residents and increased their knowledge and comfort level with antimicrobial prescribing. Further studies to measure knowledge retention with this strategy are required. Disclosures All authors: No reported disclosures.",

    "Abstract": "The authors perform a classroom experiment to test the effectiveness of discipline-specific case studies on knowledge acquisition and retention in advanced business statistics courses. The results indicate that although students are more engaged in the case studies, overall there is no impact on acquisition or retention of statistics knowledge by having students engage in discipline-specific case studies relative to traditional case studies. However, for high-performing students, discipline-specific case studies have a positive and significant impact on statistical knowledge retention. Moreover, our research reaffirms past research, which has found greater retention for students with higher grade point average, and there exists a significant negative correlation between retention and time.

    "Abstract": "A flipped classroom is a growing pedagogy in higher education. Many research studies on the flipped classroom have focused on student outcomes, with the results being positive or inconclusive. A few studies have analyzed confounding variables, such as student's previous achievement, or the impact of a flipped classroom on long‐term retention and knowledge transfer. In the present study, students in a Doctor of Physical Therapy program in a traditional style lecture of gross anatomy ( n = 105) were compared to similar students in a flipped classroom ( n = 112). Overall, students in the flipped anatomy classroom had an increase in semester average grades ( P = 0.01) and performance on higher‐level analytical questions ( P < 0.001). Long‐term retention and knowledge transfer was analyzed in a subsequent semester's sequenced kinesiology course, with students from the flipped anatomy classroom performing at a higher level in kinesiology ( P < 0.05). Student's pre‐matriculation grade point average was also considered. Previously lower performing students, when in a flipped anatomy class, outperformed their traditional anatomy class counterparts in anatomy semester grades (P < 0.05), accuracy on higher‐level analytical anatomy multiple‐choice questions ( P < 0.05) and performance in subsequent course of kinesiology ( P < 0.05). This study suggests that the flipped classroom may benefit lower performing student's knowledge acquisition and transfer to a greater degree than higher performing students. Future studies should explore the underlying reasons for improvement in lower performing students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "With a Senian understanding of intellectual capital as being a function of agent capability and contextual resource constraints, the requirement for knowledge in the digital economy to be co-created by a network of agents is obvious. From network agents co-creating knowledge for the digital economy as a foundational point of departure, we problematize the management of this co-created knowledge. As network power shifts, so does the foundational capabilities and contexts. The problems caused by shifts in network power and agent capabilities become apparent in co-creative systems design processes such as Living Labs and popular Design Science frameworks. As the disruptive power of digital change creates shifts in the foundational design network's agency, knowledge is lost. We postulate that it is typically highly technical design knowledge - created at a high cost during co-creation - that is lost first. We present examples of technical design knowledge flowing out of the network from a local Smart Community design case. Towards the prevention of co-created design knowledge loss as a result of changes in the foundational network, we suggest the use of physical ideation artefacts for the storage, management, and continued dissemination of the knowledge within the network. We present a case study where local, co-created, technical, Smart Community design knowledge was stored explicitly as ideation artefacts called \"tech cards\" and retained over time within the network after highly disruptive shifts in the capability set of the foundational agent network responsible for the original knowledge creation. The co-creation of physical, knowledge-rich ideation artefacts as part of system design processes such as Living Labs shows promise as a Knowledge Management tool amidst fast paced digital change in the knowledge economy.",

To this end, they have introduced two theoretical innovations: a contrast between two ways of introducing error-possibilities and a distinction between discriminating and favoring evidence. I argue that their solution faces the “sufficiency problem”: it is unclear whether the evidence that is normally available to adult humans is sufficient to retain knowledge of the entailing proposition and come to know the entailed proposition. I submit that, on either infallibilist or fallibilist views of evidence, Carter and Pritchard have set the bar for deductive knowledge too low. At the end, I offer an alternative solution. I suggest that the knowledge-retention condition of the closure principle is not satisfied in zebra-like scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "The present study aims to explore the impact of three reward strategies on adult e-learners’ learning performance in a gamified teaching process. One hundred and eighty participants who were recruited for the experiment were evenly assigned to three groups, with Group A adopting the forfeit-or-prize reward strategy, Group B employing the prize-only reward strategy, and Group C applying the no-prize-no-forfeit strategy. A pretest, an immediate posttest, a delayed posttest and two questionnaires were adopted as instruments for the study. The results showed that the forfeit-or-prize pattern and the prize-only pattern could exert a significantly better impact on the e-learners’ learning than the no-prize-no-forfeit pattern. Additionally, the forfeit-or-prize pattern elicited better knowledge retention than the prize-only pattern. The two questionnaires revealed that the forfeit-or-prize pattern and the prize-only pattern could stimulate students' motivation in learning, although a high-level anxiety was perceived by the subjects assigned to the forfeit-or-prize pattern. Possible explanations and implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "In BC, the population of adults over 65 years of age is growing rapidly. The risk of injurious falls increases with age, resulting in a major threat to the quality of life of older adults. Fall-related injuries are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among seniors (>65 years) in BC, and there are over 13 000 hospitalizations per year, resulting in $485 million in direct healthcare costs. The majority of these falls occur among community living seniors. Public education on the magnitude of the problem, and the fact that falls and injuries are preventable with evidence informed strategies, is important for the implementation and sustained use of these prevention strategies. The FindingBalanceBC website has been providing falls prevention information to citizens across BC for the last 3 years. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the level of knowledge retention of visitors to the Finding Balance BC website, which promotes the Senior Falls Prevention Campaign, for the purposes of quality assurance and program improvement. During the month of November, visitors to the FindingBalanceBC website were invited to participate in the survey and those who expressed their consent were enrolled in the study. A questionnaire assessing knowledge of evidence-informed falls prevention strategies among seniors (exercise, vision check, medication review and home safety) based on the website content was prepared and pre-tested. Participants completed the questionnaire at the 4th week and 10th week following their first visit to the website. Respondent composite scores for each of the fall prevention strategies will be calculated and the respective scores for the 4th week and 10th week will be compared using paired t -tests. Results and policy implications will be presented at the conference.",

    "Abstract": "Background Falls are the leading cause of injury-related hospitalizations and deaths for older adults (>65 years) in BC, Canada, with an average 13 397 hospitalizations and over 500 fatalities each year. However, these injuries are preventable. Almost 62% of older adults who use the internet do so to search medical or health-related information, and 32% use social networking websites such as Facebook. Objectives To determine whether Facebook advertisements are an effective communication tool for disseminating falls prevention messages and directing users to the FindingBalanceBC campaign website. Methods Thirty advertisements promoting four evidence-informed falls prevention messages ran on Facebook from October 30 to November 30, 2017 (campaign period) through the FindingBalanceBC Facebook page. Messaging targeted community-dwelling older adults and their caregivers living in BC. Engagement with advertisements were measured through tracking clicks, comments, shares, and reactions. Findings During the campaign period, 4470 people engaged with the advertisements, with 5583 link clicks, 321 reactions, 36 comments, and 181 shares. Advertisements were on screen a total of 3 35 114 times (impressions) and 1 40 049 people saw the advertisements at least once (reach). The FindingBalanceBC Facebook page received 188 new likes as a result of the advertising campaigns. The number of visits to the FindingBalanceBC website during this campaign period were comparable to previous years, where out-of-home and print advertising methods were used and Facebook advertisements were not. Conclusion Facebook advertisements are an effective and low-cost method of engaging older adults and their caregivers in falls prevention communications. Further research is needed on best practices for composition of advertising content, for heightened engagement and assessing knowledge retention. Policy implications Facebook advertising should be considered as an effective means to disseminate health promotion messages among older adults.",

Participants were randomized to receive an online preworkshop stand-alone MCQ test (no feedback) and a postworkshop MCQ test (with feedback) after a 14-day delay. Controls received no pre-/posttesting. The primary outcome measure was performance on a clinical vignette-based retention and application test delivered to all participants four weeks post conference. Secondary outcomes included self-reported changes in learning behavior, satisfaction, and efficiency of TEL.

    "Abstract": "Aims Considering the growing role of urodynamic studies (UDS) in urology, we aimed to determine the most effective teaching method with objective evaluation for urodynamic skills, to improve training and patient care. Methods Urology residents ( n  = 20) post‐graduate years 3‐5 were randomized to receive either a UDS video training module or a standard UDS teaching document one week prior to an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). The OSCE was a validated visual recognition exam with interpretation of 12 UDS tracing scenarios. Participants rated their proficiency to interpret UDS tracings before doing the OSCE. Total interpretation score was determined by the accuracy of their response to each question ranging from 0 to 2. Results The mean total interpretation score was 13.3 of 24 (55%). The video group achieved significantly higher interpretation scores (15.1 ± 2.08 vs 11.4 ± 2.41, P  = 0.0017), and cumulative certainty scores ( P  = 0.0341). Overall interpretation scores significantly correlated with self‐reported proficiency scores prior to the exam ( r  = 0.502, P  < 0.05), and total certainty scores ( r  = 0.531, P  < 0.05). Conclusions Reviewing a UDS video training module resulted in significantly better scores on objective assessment of urology residents’ UDS interpretation skills when compared with a standard teaching document. These findings must be interpreted with caution in light of sample size and short knowledge retention required for the assessment within a week. Therefore, using a UDS video training module could be more effective review tool for urology residents. These findings highlight the need to incorporate multimedia teaching into urology training curriculum.",

    "Abstract": "Considering the growing role of urodynamic studies (UDS) in urology, we aimed to determine the most effective teaching method with objective evaluation for urodynamic skills, to improve training and patient care. AIMS Considering the growing role of urodynamic studies (UDS) in urology, we aimed to determine the most effective teaching method with objective evaluation for urodynamic skills, to improve training and patient care.Urology residents (n = 20) post-graduate years 3-5 were randomized to receive either a UDS video training module or a standard UDS teaching document one week prior to an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). The OSCE was a validated visual recognition exam with interpretation of 12 UDS tracing scenarios. Participants rated their proficiency to interpret UDS tracings before doing the OSCE. Total interpretation score was determined by the accuracy of their response to each question ranging from 0 to 2. METHODS Urology residents (n = 20) post-graduate years 3-5 were randomized to receive either a UDS video training module or a standard UDS teaching document one week prior to an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). The OSCE was a validated visual recognition exam with interpretation of 12 UDS tracing scenarios. Participants rated their proficiency to interpret UDS tracings before doing the OSCE. Total interpretation score was determined by the accuracy of their response to each question ranging from 0 to 2.The mean total interpretation score was 13.3 of 24 (55%). The video group achieved significantly higher interpretation scores (15.1 ± 2.08 vs 11.4 ± 2.41, P = 0.0017), and cumulative certainty scores (P = 0.0341). Overall interpretation scores significantly correlated with self-reported proficiency scores prior to the exam (r = 0.502, P < 0.05), and total certainty scores (r = 0.531, P < 0.05). RESULTS The mean total interpretation score was 13.3 of 24 (55%). The video group achieved significantly higher interpretation scores (15.1 ± 2.08 vs 11.4 ± 2.41, P = 0.0017), and cumulative certainty scores (P = 0.0341). Overall interpretation scores significantly correlated with self-reported proficiency scores prior to the exam (r = 0.502, P < 0.05), and total certainty scores (r = 0.531, P < 0.05).Reviewing a UDS video training module resulted in significantly better scores on objective assessment of urology residents' UDS interpretation skills when compared with a standard teaching document. These findings must be interpreted with caution in light of sample size and short knowledge retention required for the assessment within a week. Therefore, using a UDS video training module could be more effective review tool for urology residents. These findings highlight the need to incorporate multimedia teaching into urology training curriculum. CONCLUSIONS Reviewing a UDS video training module resulted in significantly better scores on objective assessment of urology residents' UDS interpretation skills when compared with a standard teaching document.

    "Abstract": "Background: Informed consent is a complex process to help patients engage in care processes and reach the best treatment decisions. There are many limitations to the conventional consent process that is based on oral discussion of information related to treatment procedures by the health care provider. A conclusive body of research supports the effectiveness of multimedia patient decision aids (PtDAs) in the consent process in terms of patient satisfaction, increased knowledge about the procedure, reduced anxiety level, and higher engagement in the decision making. Little information is available about the effectiveness of multimedia PtDAs in the consent process of invasive therapeutic procedures such as the peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC). Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a multimedia PtDA in supplementing the consent process of the PICC for patients in 10 acute and intensive care units in terms of knowledge recall, knowledge retention, satisfaction with the consent process, and satisfaction with the PICC multimedia PtDA. Methods: This pre-post quasi-experimental study included 130 patients for whom a PICC was ordered. Patients in the control group (n=65) received the conventional consent process for the PICC, while those in the intervention group (n=65) received the multimedia PtDA to support the consent process of a PICC. All patients were surveyed for knowledge recall and retention about the procedure and satisfaction with the consent process. Patients in the intervention group were also surveyed for their satisfaction with the multimedia PtDA. Results: Compared with the control group, patients in the intervention group scored around 2 points higher on knowledge recall ( t 125 =4.9, P 4.5 out of 5 on all items. Items with the highest mean scores were related to the effect of the multimedia PtDA on knowledge retention (mean 4.9 [SD 0.2]), patient readiness to learn (mean 4.8 [SD 0.5]), complete understanding of the procedure-related complications (mean 4.8 [SD 0.4]), and patient role in maintaining the safety of the PICC (mean 4.8 [SD 0.5]). Patients in the two groups were highly satisfied with the consent process. However, 15% (10/65) patients in the control group reported that the following information was omitted from the discussion: patient and provider roles in the safety of the PICC, other treatment options, and common side effects. Furthermore, 2 patients commented that they were not ready to engage in the discussion. Conclusions: The multimedia PtDA is an effective standardized, structured, self-paced learning tool to supplement the consent process of the PICC and improve patient satisfaction with the process, knowledge recall, and knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, the researcher aimed to understand how students learned the targeted knowledge with an interactive response system (IRS) tool, and whether learners in two different learning modes: individual and group use of IRS, differed in their learning performance and knowledge retention after the IRS activity. These two kinds of IRS interaction were integrated into the course which included multiple choice questions for testing memorable knowledge and open-ended questions for enhancing organization and critical thinking ability via a methodology that involved 120 college students and included the analysis of tests, survey questionnaires and a course learning diary. Overall, the results were consistent with the consensus that students perceive the IRS as a positive addition to their classes, as its use increased course participation, fostered interaction, and promoted the general enjoyment of the class. The results revealed that the immediate learning performance of the learners who participated in the activity through group use of the IRS was better than that of the learners with individual IRS accounts; however, the individual IRS users seemed to have better learning retention of the learning contents, and showed significant improvement on the delayed tests. Furthermore, the study also confirmed that the IRS with collaborative work could promote the students’ academic and social-emotional performance because the collaborative learning allowed them to learn from peers’ opinions and to make judgments and co-examine the learning concepts again while finding the correct answer. This paper contributes data and analysis that highlight the pedagogical benefits of the implementation of an IRS, and supports the value of using the IRS for college education.

    "Abstract": "A service learning program for student pharmacists was developed to train other university students to respond effectively to opioid overdoses with naloxone. Assessments were analyzed to determine the effect of program participation on student pharmacists' overdose-related knowledge retention and harm reduction attitudes. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE A service learning program for student pharmacists was developed to train other university students to respond effectively to opioid overdoses with naloxone. Assessments were analyzed to determine the effect of program participation on student pharmacists' overdose-related knowledge retention and harm reduction attitudes.Student pharmacists were invited to attend a 90-min train-the-trainer seminar to obtain foundational knowledge regarding opioid overdose risk, symptoms, and response. Attendees were eligible to participate in a series of 10 community outreach events to educate university students. These two-hour events included a 30-min team huddle, 60-min workshop, and 30-min team debrief. Student pharmacists were asked to complete a follow-up assessment to evaluate knowledge retention and harm reduction attitudes.

Student pharmacists were asked to complete a follow-up assessment to evaluate knowledge retention and harm reduction attitudes.Responses from students who participated in community outreach events (intervention) were compared to those who only attended the train-the-trainer seminar (control). A total of 116 subjects attended a train-the-trainer seminar and 94 completed the follow-up assessment. Thirty-six subjects voluntarily participated in at least one community outreach event while 58 did not participate. The intervention group demonstrated superior knowledge retention compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Cumulative harm reduction attitudes did not differ between groups (p = 0.89). The intervention group exhibited more positive attitudes regarding naloxone access for individuals who use illicit opioids (p = 0.015).

    "Abstract": "High fidelity human patient simulation (HPS) has been incorporated in various United States doctor of pharmacy programs with favorable learning experiences, knowledge retention, and problem-solving skills reported. In Singapore, HPS is a novel learning technique as it has not been utilized in the Bachelor of Science (Pharmacy) curriculum or for continuing professional education (CPE). It is necessary to evaluate acceptance of HPS compared to asynchronous online learning (AOL). BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE High fidelity human patient simulation (HPS) has been incorporated in various United States doctor of pharmacy programs with favorable learning experiences, knowledge retention, and problem-solving skills reported. In Singapore, HPS is a novel learning technique as it has not been utilized in the Bachelor of Science (Pharmacy) curriculum or for continuing professional education (CPE). It is necessary to evaluate acceptance of HPS compared to asynchronous online learning (AOL).Nineteen participants from two institutions completed the study in Singapore. This was an experimental study design with participants randomized into groups A and B. Group A completed AOL followed by HPS, whereas group B completed them in reverse order. Acceptance of teaching modalities was evaluated with a Likert scale survey and analyzed with Fisher's exact test. Educational content was congestive heart failure and was evaluated externally for equivalency. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING Nineteen participants from two institutions completed the study in Singapore. This was an experimental study design with participants randomized into groups A and B. Group A completed AOL followed by HPS, whereas group B completed them in reverse order. Acceptance of teaching modalities was evaluated with a Likert scale survey and analyzed with Fisher's exact test. Educational content was congestive heart failure and was evaluated externally for equivalency.All participants enjoyed the HPS activity compared to 13 (68.4%; p = 0.02) for AOL. Eighteen (94.7%) and 15 (78.9%; p = 0.34) participants felt that HPS activity and AOL improved their critical and decision-making skills respectively. Sixteen (84.2%) and 17 (89.5%) agreed that AOL and HPS activity improved their confidence (p = 1.00). FINDINGS All participants enjoyed the HPS activity compared to 13 (68.4%; p = 0.02) for AOL. Eighteen (94.7%) and 15 (78.9%; p = 0.34) participants felt that HPS activity and AOL improved their critical and decision-making skills respectively. Sixteen (84.2%) and 17 (89.5%) agreed that AOL and HPS activity improved their confidence (p = 1.00).Participants enjoyed HPS activity significantly more than AOL. HPS activity could be used to achieve improved critical and decision-making skills of learners as there was a trend of more learners perceiving improvement compare to AOL. DISCUSSION Participants enjoyed HPS activity significantly more than AOL. HPS activity could be used to achieve improved critical and decision-making skills of learners as there was a trend of more learners perceiving improvement compare to AOL.High fidelity HPS learning was well received by participants in Singapore and can be implemented in CPE.

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Down syndrome (DS) is a population with known hippocampal impairment, with studies showing that individuals with DS display difficulties in spatial navigation and remembering arbitrary bindings. Recent research has also demonstrated the importance of the hippocampus for novel word-learning. Based on these data, we aimed to determine whether individuals with DS show deficits in learning new labels and if they may benefit from encoding conditions thought to be less reliant on hippocampal function (i.e., through fast mapping). Methods: In the current study, we examined immediate, 5-min, and 1-week delayed word-learning across two learning conditions (e.g., explicit encoding vs. fast mapping). These conditions were examined across groups (twenty-six 3- to 5-year-old typically developing children and twenty-six 11- to 28-year-old individuals with DS with comparable verbal and nonverbal scores on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test—second edition) and in reference to sleep quality. Results: Both individuals with and without DS showed retention after a 1-week delay, and the current study found no benefit of the fast mapping condition in either group contrary to our expectations. Eye tracking data showed that preferential eye movements to target words were not present immediately but emerged after 1-week in both groups. Furthermore, sleep measures collected via actigraphy did not relate to retention in either group. Conclusions: This study presents novel data on long-term knowledge retention in reference to sleep patterns in DS and adds to a body of knowledge helping us to understand the processes of word-learning in typical and atypically developing populations.

    "Abstract": "Objective. To develop an effective method in teaching pharmacogenomics as a part of a new course, Biopharmaceutics and Pharmacogenomics. Methods. Teaching effectiveness was measured by quizzes, retrospective pre- and post-surveys, team activities, and journal reflections. Four team activities were included in the course: genomic disease, patient case, genetic counselor and a debate about personalized medicine. Outcomes and course impact were evaluated at the end of the course. The evaluation methods included the assessment of knowledge, students' perceptions regarding the utility of team activities, the impact of the course on students' confidence to discuss pharmacogenomics with health care providers or patients, and long-term knowledge retention, measured in the following P2 semester. Results. Seventy-six students were enrolled in the course. Multiple assessments during the course demonstrated that students' knowledge of pharmacogenomics improved. The team activities had a positive impact on student learning, and the course improved their confidence level to discuss pharmacogenomics with another health care provider or a patient. While 86% of the students considered themselves \"unconfident,\" \"somewhat unconfident\" or \"neither confident nor unconfident\" at the beginning of the course, 91% reported being \"confident\" or \"somewhat confident\" by the end of the course. This increase in confidence was statistically significant. Furthermore, students showed knowledge retention six months after taking the course. Conclusion. Implementation of a new course in pharmacogenomics was effective and well received by the students. It also prepared students for system-based therapeutics courses later in the curriculum.Objective.

    "Abstract": "Provision of stroke education to patients is a Centers for Medicare/Medicaid (CMS) requirement. However, little is known about retention of the educational content. BACKGROUND Provision of stroke education to patients is a Centers for Medicare/Medicaid (CMS) requirement. However, little is known about retention of the educational content.Two pilot studies were conducted: Pilot A delivered CMS-required stroke education during hospitalization in a standardized manner and tested knowledge retention in patients returning to the Stroke Clinic for 1-month follow-up; Pilot B randomized patients to either a control group with standardized education or a test-enhanced learning group (target), with measurement of stroke knowledge retention at hospital discharge. METHODS Two pilot studies were conducted: Pilot A delivered CMS-required stroke education during hospitalization in a standardized manner and tested knowledge retention in patients returning to the Stroke Clinic for 1-month follow-up; Pilot B randomized patients to either a control group with standardized education or a test-enhanced learning group (target), with measurement of stroke knowledge retention at hospital discharge.A total of 198 patients/caregivers participated in Pilot A, with only 25% scoring 100% correct on required stroke education items. The question most commonly answered incorrectly ( n = 117; 59%) was \"personal risk factors for stroke,\" and 74 (37%) could not correctly identify stroke signs and symptoms. Pilot B found that significantly more target group patients could identify their personal stroke risk factors (100 vs. 67%; p = 0.04) and the purpose of their secondary prevention medications (87 vs. 40%; p = 0.02) compared to controls.

We propose study of test-enhanced learning methods through the Targeted Education in Stroke Trial (TEST) to examine the effect of novel teaching methods on patient/caregiver knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "Problem/Goal: Sharing the results of research with General Practitioners (GPs) is crucial for the survival of the discipline of General Practice / Family Medicine (GP/FM). The production of abstracts in GP/FM probably exceeds 15,000 per year worldwide. Each abstract often represents two years of work for its authors and is expressed in local languages. Only 45% of them are published in indexed medical journals. Usual indexing systems like MeSH are not multilingual nor adapted to the particular field of GP/FM. Consequently, these abstracts are lacking bibliographic control and more than half of the research presented by GPs at congresses is lost. Considering the absence of appropriate domain-specific terminologies or classification systems, we propose a new multilingual indexing system. The existing International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) is currently used for clinical purposes and has now been expanded with a taxonomy related to contextual aspects (called Q-Codes) such as education, research, practice organization, ethics or policy in GP/FM, currently not captured. The set is proposed under the name Core Content Classification in General Practice (3CGP). The aim is to facilitate indexing of GP/FM specific scientific work and to improve performance in information storage and retrieval for research purposes in this field. Research Method/Procedure: Using qualitative analysis, a corpus of 1,702 abstracts from six GP/FMrelated European congresses was analyzed to identify main themes discussed by GPs (e.g., continuity, accessibility or medical ethics), handled in a domain-specific taxonomy called Q-Codes and translated in 8 languages. In addition, a methodology for building a lightweight ontology (in OWL-2) was applied to QCodes, adding object and datatype properties to the hierarchical relations, including mapping to the MeSH thesaurus, Babelnet (www.babelnet.org) and Dbpedia. Finally, the Q-Codes in 8 languages have been integrated in a healthcare terminology service (www.hetop.eu/q) with a companion website (http://3cgp.docpatient.net). Results of the Research: The creation and the on-line publication of this multilingual terminological resource (see http://3cgp.docpatient.net), for indexing abstracts and for facilitating Medline searches, could reduce loss of knowledge in the domain. The database is available in 12 human languages and in Web Ontology Language (OWL) for computer use. In addition, through better indexing of the grey literature (online database, congress abstracts, master’s and doctoral thesis) of which we show the first results, we hope to enhance the accessibility of research in GP/FM domain and promote the emergence of networks of researchers. Indication of costs related to the project: This project has not been funded. 3CGP is placed under Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share-Alike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).

    "Abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) is a population with known hippocampal impairment, with studies showing that individuals with DS display difficulties in spatial navigation and remembering arbitrary bindings. Recent research has also demonstrated the importance of the hippocampus for novel word-learning. Based on these data, we aimed to determine whether individuals with DS show deficits in learning new labels and if they may benefit from encoding conditions thought to be less reliant on hippocampal function (i.e., through fast mapping). OBJECTIVES Down syndrome (DS) is a population with known hippocampal impairment, with studies showing that individuals with DS display difficulties in spatial navigation and remembering arbitrary bindings. Recent research has also demonstrated the importance of the hippocampus for novel word-learning. Based on these data, we aimed to determine whether individuals with DS show deficits in learning new labels and if they may benefit from encoding conditions thought to be less reliant on hippocampal function (i.e., through fast mapping).In the current study, we examined immediate, 5-min, and 1-week delayed word-learning across two learning conditions (e.g., explicit encoding vs. fast mapping). These conditions were examined across groups (twenty-six 3- to 5-year-old typically developing children and twenty-six 11- to 28-year-old individuals with DS with comparable verbal and nonverbal scores on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test - second edition) and in reference to sleep quality. METHODS In the current study, we examined immediate, 5-min, and 1-week delayed word-learning across two learning conditions (e.g., explicit encoding vs. fast mapping). These conditions were examined across groups (twenty-six 3- to 5-year-old typically developing children and twenty-six 11- to 28-year-old individuals with DS with comparable verbal and nonverbal scores on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test - second edition) and in reference to sleep quality.Both individuals with and without DS showed retention after a 1-week delay, and the current study found no benefit of the fast mapping condition in either group contrary to our expectations. Eye tracking data showed that preferential eye movements to target words were not present immediately but emerged after 1-week in both groups. Furthermore, sleep measures collected via actigraphy did not relate to retention in either group. RESULTS Both individuals with and without DS showed retention after a 1-week delay, and the current study found no benefit of the fast mapping condition in either group contrary to our expectations. Eye tracking data showed that preferential eye movements to target words were not present immediately but emerged after 1-week in both groups. Furthermore, sleep measures collected via actigraphy did not relate to retention in either group.This study presents novel data on long-term knowledge retention in reference to sleep patterns in DS and adds to a body of knowledge helping us to understand the processes of word-learning in typical and atypically developing populations. (JINS, 2018, 24, 955-965). CONCLUSIONS This study presents novel data on long-term knowledge retention in reference to sleep patterns in DS and adds to a body of knowledge helping us to understand the processes of word-learning in typical and atypically developing populations.

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Down syndrome (DS) is a population with known hippocampal impairment, with studies showing that individuals with DS display difficulties in spatial navigation and remembering arbitrary bindings. Recent research has also demonstrated the importance of the hippocampus for novel word-learning. Based on these data, we aimed to determine whether individuals with DS show deficits in learning new labels and if they may benefit from encoding conditions thought to be less reliant on hippocampal function (i.e., through fast mapping). Methods: In the current study, we examined immediate, 5-min, and 1-week delayed word-learning across two learning conditions (e.g., explicit encoding vs . fast mapping). These conditions were examined across groups (twenty-six 3- to 5-year-old typically developing children and twenty-six 11- to 28-year-old individuals with DS with comparable verbal and nonverbal scores on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test – second edition) and in reference to sleep quality. Results: Both individuals with and without DS showed retention after a 1-week delay, and the current study found no benefit of the fast mapping condition in either group contrary to our expectations. Eye tracking data showed that preferential eye movements to target words were not present immediately but emerged after 1-week in both groups. Furthermore, sleep measures collected via actigraphy did not relate to retention in either group. Conclusions: This study presents novel data on long-term knowledge retention in reference to sleep patterns in DS and adds to a body of knowledge helping us to understand the processes of word-learning in typical and atypically developing populations.

    "Abstract": "To reflect a wide range of social, political and economic viewpoints, the panel consisted of two local councillors, a ward officer, a church leader, and the head of a local enterprise centre (although the latter had to pull out on the day). A local councillor was happy to conduct a question-and-answer session, and we kept the quality high and student involvement broad by submitting one question per student (after vetting for repetition) a week in advance. Evaluating our attempts to integrate place into our A level curriculum is at an early stage, but early indications have included: * good AS level results in questions relating to place * high levels of knowledge retention when we revisited the content at A level * inspiring at least one of our students to study geography at university * perhaps most tellingly, the choice of topics for the independent investigation was overwhelmingly related to the regenerating places unit.",

    "Abstract": "The “Adopt a Bacterium” project is based on the use of social network as a tool in Microbiology undergraduate education, improving student learning and encouraging students to participate in collaborative learning. The approach involves active participation of both students and teachers, emphasizing knowledge exchange, based on widely used social media. Students were organized in groups and asked to adopt a specific bacterial genus and, subsequently, submit posts about “adopted genus”. The formative assessment is based on posting information on Facebook®, and the summative assessment involves presentation of seminars about the adopted theme. To evaluate the project, students filled out three anonymous and voluntary surveys. Most of the students enjoyed the activities and positively evaluated the experience. A large amount of students declared a change in their attitude towards the way they processed information, especially regarding the use of scientific sources. Finally, we evaluated knowledge retention six months after the end of the course and students were able to recall relevant Microbiology concepts. Our results suggest that the “Adopt a Bacterium” project represents a useful strategy in Microbiology learning and may be applied to other academic fields.",

OBJECTIVE To estimate the effects of team-based learning sessions as part of the curriculum for the obstetrics and gynecology clerkship.This is a prospective cohort study of clinical clerkship curriculum undertaken in Kansas City and Wichita between 2013 and 2017. A team-based learning curriculum included the same topics as the traditional lecture-format lectures and was instituted in Kansas City. The primary outcome was the obstetrics and gynecology National Board of Medical Examiners examination given at the end of the clerkship, both before and after the implementation of the team-based learning curriculum in Kansas City. An online questionnaire issued by the University of Kansas School of Medicine assessed learner satisfaction. A voluntary multiple-choice examination taken by both Kansas City and Wichita students months after clerkship completion assessed knowledge retention.

The primary outcome was the obstetrics and gynecology National Board of Medical Examiners examination given at the end of the clerkship, both before and after the implementation of the team-based learning curriculum in Kansas City. An online questionnaire issued by the University of Kansas School of Medicine assessed learner satisfaction. A voluntary multiple-choice examination taken by both Kansas City and Wichita students months after clerkship completion assessed knowledge retention.The post-team-based learning Kansas City cohort scored a mean of 78.6 (95% CI 77.8-79.4) on the National Board of Medical Examiners obstetrics and gynecology subject examination compared with the pre-team-based learning Kansas City cohort scoring a mean of 74.6 (95% CI 73.6-75.6, P<.001). Student surveys did not show significant differences in satisfaction between pre-team- and post-team-based learning cohorts in Kansas City. There was no significant difference in knowledge retention scores between Kansas City and Wichita cohorts. RESULTS The post-team-based learning Kansas City cohort scored a mean of 78.6 (95% CI 77.8-79.4) on the National Board of Medical Examiners obstetrics and gynecology subject examination compared with the pre-team-based learning Kansas City cohort scoring a mean of 74.6 (95% CI 73.6-75.6, P<.001). Student surveys did not show significant differences in satisfaction between pre-team- and post-team-based learning cohorts in Kansas City. There was no significant difference in knowledge retention scores between Kansas City and Wichita cohorts.We found significant improvement in National Board of Medical Examiners subject examination scores, which is likely the result of multiple curriculum changes, including the shift from didactic sessions to the active learning strategy of team-based learning. Team-based learning has provided a beneficial and stimulating learning experience for students.

    "Abstract": "In this study, the researcher aimed to understand how students learned the targeted knowledge with an interactive response system (IRS) tool, and whether learners in two different learning modes: individual and group use of IRS, differed in their learning performance and knowledge retention after the IRS activity. These two kinds of IRS interaction were integrated into the course which included multiple choice questions for testing memorable knowledge and open-ended questions for enhancing organization and critical thinking ability via a methodology that involved 120 college students and included the analysis of tests, survey questionnaires and a course learning diary. Overall, the results were consistent with the consensus that students perceive the IRS as a positive addition to their classes, as its use increased course participation, fostered interaction, and promoted the general enjoyment of the class. The results revealed that the immediate learning performance of the learners who participated in the activity through group use of the IRS was better than that of the learners with individual IRS accounts; however, the individual IRS users seemed to have better learning retention of the learning contents, and showed significant improvement on the delayed tests. Furthermore, the study also confirmed that the IRS with collaborative work could promote the students' academic and social-emotional performance because the collaborative learning allowed them to learn from peers' opinions and to make judgments and co-examine the learning concepts again while finding the correct answer. This paper contributes data and analysis that highlight the pedagogical benefits of the implementation of an IRS, and supports the value of using the IRS for college education.",

    "Abstract": "This paper examines how and what teachers learn from their older and younger colleagues. Data were gathered from interviews and written reports from 27 Belgian and Finnish teachers. Thematic qualitative analysis was used. The results revealed differences in what teachers learn from older and younger colleagues. Teachers reported learning innovative teaching methods and ICT skills from younger colleagues, whereas practical information, classroom management skills, self-regulation and community building were learned mainly from older colleagues. Attitudes regarding teaching and different ways of being a teacher were learned from both younger and older colleagues alike. Similarities were also found in how teachers learned from their older and younger colleagues. Informal activities and relationships, different forms of mentoring, and working in subject teams or seminars were important sources of learning. An intergenerational learning perspective is important with respect to demographic changes in school staff and in preventing knowledge loss and teacher dropout.",

The formative assessment is based on posting information on Facebook®, and the summative assessment involves presentation of seminars about the adopted theme. To evaluate the project, students filled out three anonymous and voluntary surveys. Most of the students enjoyed the activities and positively evaluated the experience.

BACKGROUND Near-peer teaching is used in anatomy education because of its benefits to the learner, teacher and faculty members. Despite the range of reports focusing on the learner, the advantages for the teacher, which are thought to include communication skills, subject knowledge and employability, are only beginning to be explored.A questionnaire was distributed to the teachers involved in anatomy near-peer teaching at the University of Southampton and Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS). This questionnaire was designed using a rating scale of 0-10 to assess teacher perspectives on their level of knowledge, teaching skills and enjoyment of teaching. Free-text responses determined the teachers' motivation and perceived benefits from the teaching. METHOD A questionnaire was distributed to the teachers involved in anatomy near-peer teaching at the University of Southampton and Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS). This questionnaire was designed using a rating scale of 0-10 to assess teacher perspectives on their level of knowledge, teaching skills and enjoyment of teaching. Free-text responses determined the teachers' motivation and perceived benefits from the teaching.Twenty-eight questionnaires were gathered (54.9% response rate), including 20 from Southampton and eight from BSMS. Long-term knowledge retention and better understanding of the material were rated 8.1 and 7.9 out of 10, respectively. Eight responses were from currently practising doctors, who rated how much they now use their teaching skills as doctors as 8.9 out of 10. Of the eight doctors, seven gained points for their foundation programme applications as a direct result of near-peer teaching. The most common motivator for engaging in teaching was to improve subject matter knowledge and the most common benefit was improved communication skills. There are numerous advantages to being a near-peer teacher in medical school DISCUSSION: There are numerous advantages to being a near-peer teacher in medical school, which include knowledge improvement, transferrable professional skills and employability. These initial results support the hypothesised benefits to the teachers and provide a foundation for further longitudinal studies.

    "Abstract": "Objective. To develop an effective method in teaching pharmacogenomics as a part of a new course, Biopharmaceutics and Pharmacogenomics. Methods. Teaching effectiveness was measured by quizzes, retrospective pre- and post-surveys, team activities, and journal reflections. Four team activities were included in the course: genomic disease, patient case, genetic counselor and a debate about personalized medicine. Outcomes and course impact were evaluated at the end of the course. The evaluation methods included the assessment of knowledge, students' perceptions regarding the utility of team activities, the impact of the course on students' confidence to discuss pharmacogenomics with health care providers or patients, and long-term knowledge retention, measured in the following P2 semester. Results. Seventy-six students were enrolled in the course. Multiple assessments during the course demonstrated that students' knowledge of pharmacogenomics improved. The team activities had a positive impact on student learning, and the course improved their confidence level to discuss pharmacogenomics with another health care provider or a patient. While 86% of the students considered themselves \"unconfident,\" \"somewhat unconfident\" or \"neither confident nor unconfident\" at the beginning of the course, 91% reported being \"confident\" or \"somewhat confident\" by the end of the course. This increase in confidence was statistically significant. Furthermore, students showed knowledge retention six months after taking the course. Conclusion. Implementation of a new course in pharmacogenomics was effective and well received by the students. It also prepared students for system-based therapeutics courses later in the curriculum.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine if the presence of a live animal in a post-secondary educational setting affects academic achievement, knowledge retention, and physiological responses. An experimental design was implemented consisting of a control group presented with scientific information regarding nine different animal species and a treatment group presented with the same information in the same format and setting but with the addition of the corresponding live animal present in the room. Ten students from the treatment group were selected to wear heart rate monitors to evaluate physiological responses. A pre-/post-test methodology was utilized to measure academic achievement while a second post-test was administered one week after the presentations to determine knowledge retention. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the presence of a live animal, as well as the type of animal, can influence academic achievement, knowledge retention, and physiological responses such as heart rate. Moreover, the presence of a live animal also has a positive effect on attitudes toward the animal, which may translate into increased interest in the well-being and management of the animal.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG Since the 1970s, in some European countries rabbit meat production has progressively become a highly specialized industry, which has made Europe the second (after China) largest rabbit meat producer in the world. However, the industry is currently facing a critical period due to structural weaknesses, progressive and constant reductions in consumption, and raising criticism related to welfare conditions and other ethical issues. This trend is questioning the future of the rabbit meat industry, which could lead to the loss of knowledge and technical expertise acquired over decades of major investments and research efforts (a valuable cultural and professional heritage for future generations). In the present review, we provide an overview of the rabbit meat industry, market and value chain, we depict consumer's attitude towards rabbit meat, highlighting strengths and weaknesses, and factors driving their current purchase behavior. Finally, we will attempt to outline possible strategies to ensure a sustainable future for the production of rabbits for commercial meat purposes.",

    "Abstract": "The emergence of machine learning inevitably entails the emergence of machine knowledge. Furthermore, the rate at which the latter arises in certain cases is considerably higher than what people are accustomed to. There are both similarities and differences between human and machine knowledge, which requires an update of the concept of knowledge. The similarity that is particularly relevant for the epoch of digital economy is the decision-making process, which inevitably accompanies knowledge. In all cyclic models describing knowledge production, beginning with the Shewhart-Deming cycle (PDCA), the decision making is presented, in one way or another. At the same time, knowledge management has yet to duly adapt promising neuroscience developments that offer higher accuracy in formalization of processes that determine a human-made decision. In a digital economy, we can observe growing demands on the speed and complexity of the decisions made, as well as substantial increase of the share of decisions made by robots (autonomous algorithms). For example, in large retail networks, a human no longer interferes with the pricing decisions for the goods sold. It is currently unknown which parts of the knowledge acquired by machines are unavailable to a human. A disruption in knowledge exchange between humans and machines can be unnoticeable and would not necessarily cause a loss of knowledge at an organizational level. However, safety control in this case is to provide a guarantee against errors for new machine-made decisions. In knowledge exchange between humans, new additional feedback factors arise that reduce the risk of erroneous decisions. But similar mechanisms are not currently provided for machines. Building upon existing approaches to knowledge exchange - stock and flow approaches, - it is proposed to adopt, for knowledge management purposes, a multi-agent approach made known, inter alia, through works of M. Wooldridge. One premise for an application of a multi-agent approach is the definition of knowledge as a network (usually, neural) created to represent the reality and interact with it. Because networks should merge for a more accurate representation of the reality, the carriers of such networks - agents - create an interaction environment. Application of a multi-agent approach assumes establishment of rules at several levels. Basic level - an \"attestation\" of an agent for operations in the environment and a resolution of disputes. Level of statuses requires an agent to be in one of the conditional states for knowledge exchange. Also, the rules can define resource limits for exchange and create stimuluses for agents to perform.

    "Abstract": "Ma’an Qiao Village, a Dai and Yi ethnic minority-based community in Sichuan Province, China sustained complete infrastructure devastation during the 2008 Panzhihua earthquake. Health emergency and disaster risk management (Health-EDRM) education intervention programs were implemented in 2010 and 2011. This serial cross-sectional survey study aimed to examine the immediate and long-term impacts of the Health-EDRM interventions in this remote rural community. The findings demonstrate knowledge improvement in areas of water and sanitation, food and nutrition, and disaster preparedness immediately after the Health-EDRM education interventions. Temporal stability of knowledge retention was observed in household hygiene and waste management and smoking beliefs in 2018, 7 years after the interventions. Other important findings include knowledge uptake pattern differences of oral rehydration solution (ORS) between earthquake-prone and flood-prone communities. Usage of Internet and mobile technology for accessing disaster-related information was found to be independent of gender and income. Overall, this study demonstrated the knowledge improvement through Health-EDRM education interventions in a remote rural community. Promoting behavioral changes through interventions to raise awareness has the potential to reduce health risks in transitional post-disaster settings. Future programs should aim to identify evidence-based practices and explore how technology can support Health-EDRM education among vulnerable subgroups.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate dental students' retention of factual and procedural knowledge gained in a preclinical course in operative dentistry during a clinical dental curriculum. In 2017, all 157 seventh- to tenth-semester dental students at a dental school in Germany were asked to repeat the same written examination performed at the end of the preclinical course in the sixth semester. The examinations consisted of 30 multiple-choice questions covering factual and procedural knowledge. The percentage of correctly answered questions per exam and differences in correct answers between the original examination and the re-examination (per question) were analyzed. Students were also asked to self-rate their percentage of correctly answered questions and their knowledge in various disciplines of operative dentistry at the times of the original examination and the re-examination. After exclusions, data were analyzed for 129 students, for a participation rate of 82%. For the seventh- and tenth-semester students, the results on the original examination and the re-examination were not significantly different, while the eighth- and ninth-semester students performed significantly better on the original examination than the re-examination. In all semesters, procedural knowledge remained stable between the original examination and the re-examination, while factual knowledge decreased slightly. Their performance on the original examination was underestimated by the eighth- and ninth-semester students. All the students underestimated their performance on the re-examination.

    "Abstract": "Background The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic caused surges of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in resource‐limited settings. Several Ministries of Health requested clinical management guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO), which had not previously developed guidance regarding critically ill patients. Objective To assess the acceptability and impact on knowledge of a short course about the management of critically ill patients with acute respiratory infections complicated by sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome delivered to clinicians in resource‐limited ICUs. Methods Over 4 years (2009‐2013), WHO led the development, piloting, implementation and preliminary evaluation of a 3‐day course that emphasized patient management based on evidence‐based guidelines and used interactive adult‐learner teaching methodology. International content experts (n = 35) and instructional designers contributed to development. We assessed participants’ satisfaction and content knowledge before and after the course. Results The course was piloted among clinicians in Trinidad and Tobago (n = 29), Indonesia (n = 38) and Vietnam (n = 86); feedback from these courses contributed to the final version. In 2013, inaugural national courses were delivered in Tajikistan (n = 28), Uzbekistan (n = 39) and Azerbaijan (n = 30). Participants rated the course highly and demonstrated increased immediate content knowledge after (vs before) course completion ( P  < .001). Conclusions We found that it was feasible to create and deliver a focused critical care short course to clinicians in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Collaboration between WHO, clinical experts, instructional designers, Ministries of Health and local clinician‐leaders facilitated course delivery. Future work should assess its impact on longer‐term knowledge retention and on processes and outcomes of care.",

Analyses of data generated from the game included (1) descriptive, (2) logistic regression modeling of factors associated with user attrition, (3) generalized linear mixed model for retention of knowledge, and (4) analysis of variance of final examination performance by play styles. Researchers found a statistically significant increase in the odds of a correct response (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.4) for a round 1 question repeated in round 2, suggesting retention of knowledge.

    "Abstract": "To determine mortality and complications of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) with antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment in a hospital emergency department. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE To determine mortality and complications of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) with antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment in a hospital emergency department.Study of hospital cohorts of the 243 patients who attended with pure TBI to the emergency service of the Arnau de Vilanova University Hospital in Lleida between June 1, 2015 and June 1, 2016. Sociodemographic, clinical and other variables related to clinical management were collected. Presence of complications and in-hospital mortality were registered at 24hours, at 48hours and one week after TBI. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study of hospital cohorts of the 243 patients who attended with pure TBI to the emergency service of the Arnau de Vilanova University Hospital in Lleida between June 1, 2015 and June 1, 2016. Sociodemographic, clinical and other variables related to clinical management were collected. Presence of complications and in-hospital mortality were registered at 24hours, at 48hours and one week after TBI.Overall, 50.2% of patients were men, with median age of 80.8years, and without CT-scan findings at admission in 62.3% of cases. A total of 14 patients died (5.8%). Overall mortality was associated with comorbidity, with knowledge loss and with fluctuation of the Glasgow comma scale in the acute process. Patients treated with anticoagulants (39.5%) or antiplatelet agents (33.3%) were older, with higher degree of dependency and more comorbidity, but did not present more complications. Without reaching statistical significance, higher mortality was observed during the first week in anticoagulated patients (7.3% vs 4.8%, P=.585) or with antiplatelet treatment (8.6% vs 4.3%, P=.241) with respect to those not treated.

The higher mortality could be explained by the greater complexity of these patients. It would be necessary to carry out more studies, preferably prospective with follow-up after discharge, in order to establish causal mechanisms between clinical management and mortality or associated complications to TBI.

    "Abstract": "Since the 1970s, in some European countries rabbit meat production has progressively become a highly specialized industry, which has made Europe the second (after China) largest rabbit meat producer in the world. However, the industry is currently facing a critical period due to structural weaknesses, progressive and constant reductions in consumption, and raising criticism related to welfare conditions and other ethical issues. This trend is questioning the future of the rabbit meat industry, which could lead to the loss of knowledge and technical expertise acquired over decades of major investments and research efforts (a valuable cultural and professional heritage for future generations). In the present review, we provide an overview of the rabbit meat industry, market and value chain, we depict consumer's attitude towards rabbit meat, highlighting strengths and weaknesses, and factors driving their current purchase behavior. Finally, we will attempt to outline possible strategies to ensure a sustainable future for the production of rabbits for commercial meat purposes.Since the 1970s, in some European countries rabbit meat production has progressively become a highly specialized industry, which has made Europe the second (after China) largest rabbit meat producer in the world.

    "Abstract": "The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic caused surges of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in resource-limited settings. Several Ministries of Health requested clinical management guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO), which had not previously developed guidance regarding critically ill patients. BACKGROUND The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic caused surges of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in resource-limited settings. Several Ministries of Health requested clinical management guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO), which had not previously developed guidance regarding critically ill patients.To assess the acceptability and impact on knowledge of a short course about the management of critically ill patients with acute respiratory infections complicated by sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome delivered to clinicians in resource-limited ICUs. OBJECTIVE To assess the acceptability and impact on knowledge of a short course about the management of critically ill patients with acute respiratory infections complicated by sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome delivered to clinicians in resource-limited ICUs.Over 4 years (2009-2013), WHO led the development, piloting, implementation and preliminary evaluation of a 3-day course that emphasized patient management based on evidence-based guidelines and used interactive adult-learner teaching methodology. International content experts (n = 35) and instructional designers contributed to development. We assessed participants' satisfaction and content knowledge before and after the course. METHODS Over 4 years (2009-2013), WHO led the development, piloting, implementation and preliminary evaluation of a 3-day course that emphasized patient management based on evidence-based guidelines and used interactive adult-learner teaching methodology. International content experts (n = 35) and instructional designers contributed to development. We assessed participants' satisfaction and content knowledge before and after the course.The course was piloted among clinicians in Trinidad and Tobago (n = 29), Indonesia (n = 38) and Vietnam (n = 86); feedback from these courses contributed to the final version. In 2013, inaugural national courses were delivered in Tajikistan (n = 28), Uzbekistan (n = 39) and Azerbaijan (n = 30). Participants rated the course highly and demonstrated increased immediate content knowledge after (vs before) course completion (P < .001). RESULTS The course was piloted among clinicians in Trinidad and Tobago (n = 29), Indonesia (n = 38) and Vietnam (n = 86); feedback from these courses contributed to the final version. In 2013, inaugural national courses were delivered in Tajikistan (n = 28), Uzbekistan (n = 39) and Azerbaijan (n = 30). Participants rated the course highly and demonstrated increased immediate content knowledge after (vs before) course completion (P < .001).We found that it was feasible to create and deliver a focused critical care short course to clinicians in low- and middle-income countries. Collaboration between WHO, clinical experts, instructional designers, Ministries of Health and local clinician-leaders facilitated course delivery. Future work should assess its impact on longer-term knowledge retention and on processes and outcomes of care.

    "Abstract": "Transitioning from medical school and general surgery training to cardiothoracic (CT) surgical training poses unique challenges for trainees and patient care. We hypothesized that participation in technology-enhanced simulation modules that provided early exposure to urgent/emergent CT patient problems would improve cognitive skills and readiness to manage common urgencies/emergencies. OBJECTIVE Transitioning from medical school and general surgery training to cardiothoracic (CT) surgical training poses unique challenges for trainees and patient care. We hypothesized that participation in technology-enhanced simulation modules that provided early exposure to urgent/emergent CT patient problems would improve cognitive skills and readiness to manage common urgencies/emergencies.Traditional and integrated cardiothoracic residents at our institution participated in a technology-enhanced simulation curriculum. The course comprised of didactics, hands-on simulation, virtual models, and mock oral examinations. Residents also were given a validated pretest and post-test to evaluate knowledge retention and integration. Resident performance was graded using a previously validated objective structured clinical examination. Resident perception of course usefulness and relevance was determined through the completion of a perception survey. DESIGN Traditional and integrated cardiothoracic residents at our institution participated in a technology-enhanced simulation curriculum. The course comprised of didactics, hands-on simulation, virtual models, and mock oral examinations. Residents also were given a validated pretest and post-test to evaluate knowledge retention and integration. Resident performance was graded using a previously validated objective structured clinical examination. Resident perception of course usefulness and relevance was determined through the completion of a perception survey.This study occurred at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine with the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery. The facility used was the Peter Winter Institute for Simulation, Education and Research. SETTING This study occurred at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine with the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery. The facility used was the Peter Winter Institute for Simulation, Education and Research.From 2013 to 2015, 25 traditional and integrated cardiothoracic residents participated in these training modules who have completed all portions of the simulation were used for analysis. PARTICIPANTS From 2013 to 2015, 25 traditional and integrated cardiothoracic residents participated in these training modules who have completed all portions of the simulation were used for analysis.For our participants, knowledge base significantly increased by 7.9% (pretest = 76.0% vs. post-test = 83.9%, p < 0.01). According to trained-rater evaluation, 93.6% of responses to the 11 objective structured clinical examination competencies were deemed adequate. Postcourse perception survey demonstrated 92% of participants scoring the sessions as important or very important toward development and confidence in managing the cardiothoracic scenarios. These findings were present despite historical assumption that these learners were prepared for complex patient care. RESULTS For our participants, knowledge base significantly increased by 7.9% (pretest = 76.0% vs. post-test = 83.9%, p < 0.01). According to trained-rater evaluation, 93.6% of responses to the 11 objective structured clinical examination competencies were deemed adequate. Postcourse perception survey demonstrated 92% of participants scoring the sessions as important or very important toward development and confidence in managing the cardiothoracic scenarios. These findings were present despite historical assumption that these learners were prepared for complex patient care.After completing a technology-enhanced course combining didactics, simulation, and real-time assessment, residents demonstrated objective improvements in cognitive skills and readiness in managing CT patients. Resident postcourse feedback indicated enhanced confidence, suggesting increased preparedness transitioning to CT surgery. This has strong implications for improved patient safety during these potentially labile transition periods. CONCLUSIONS After completing a technology-enhanced course combining didactics, simulation, and real-time assessment, residents demonstrated objective improvements in cognitive skills and readiness in managing CT patients. Resident postcourse feedback indicated enhanced confidence, suggesting increased preparedness transitioning to CT surgery. This has strong implications for improved patient safety during these potentially labile transition periods.",

    "Abstract": "As a result of demographic changes, workforces are becoming older and more age diverse. While interactions between workers from different age groups can provide opportunities for mutual learning through bidirectional knowledge transfer, research has yet to investigate how age influences knowledge transfer between age-diverse colleagues. Building on the organizational theory of age effects, we conducted two studies to examine how age influenced the roles assigned to individuals in knowledge transfer processes, that is, whether they were perceived as knowledge senders or knowledge recipients. In Study 1, we used an experimental vignette design with 450 employees to assess how age affected perceived ability and motivation to share and receive knowledge. Further, we tested the extent to which trustworthiness moderated these relationships. In Study 2, we extended these findings using a dyadic research design with data from 53 age-diverse knowledge transfer dyads. We examined through which mechanisms the age of one’s colleague affected one’s knowledge transfer behaviour. We found that the age of one’s colleague had a positive effect on one’s knowledge receiving behaviour and a negative effect on one’s knowledge sharing behaviour. Further, perceived ability to receive knowledge and perceived motivation to share knowledge mediated these effects.

    "Abstract": "This study examined how different presentation formats affected knowledge gain among school grounds managers. Results indicate large-group participants (presentation to ≈50 participants at a turfgrass field day) had greater knowledge retention than small-group participants (presentation to 6–10 participants at an interactive workshop). Small-group attendees had more flexibility to discuss issues that affected them directly and may have focused on those issues instead of the targeted information. Large-group meetings were more ridged in format and attendees were less able to deviate from the main subject matter being presented. However, the value of the small-group meeting should not be discounted, especially when athletic field grounds managers and staff require information specific to their situation. When disseminating more general information, the large-group meeting format is a better means of delivery.",

    "Abstract": "This paper explores a path for those of us in the university classroom to re-think our approach to the millennial students we teach. The research question ponders what foremost initiatives we may implement to advance our students’ learning. A signposted series of ideas is posted and prompted by the first four letters in the alphabet. “A” is for “Activating our Millennial Learners.” This is call to set our students up for success at the start. “B” stands for “Building Bonds of Knowledge Retention” for core discipline knowledge. What long term learning should our students take forward? The third initiative is “Collaboration” and urges us to work more closely with those co-responsible for delivering the learning. The final initiative is “Data Analytics”. How can we prioritize our students to leverage analytical skills around big data? In conclusion, the challenge is to shift our focus away from being an ‘instructor’ to becoming a ‘partner in learning.’ (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "Lecturing is widely considered to be a passive, teacher-centred teaching method that fails to foster learning, yet it remains the most feasible method of teaching among higher institutions. Some modern lectures, aligned with recommendations from published guidelines on effective lecturing, are less didactic and more interactive than others, but little is known about converting the classical knowledge-transfer process of lecturing to actual learning. We introduce a cognitive load theory-based lecture guideline that adopts various types of empirically proven strategies to manage learners’ mental loads during lectures. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to evaluate its effectiveness by determining the between-group difference in cognitive load level, self-perceived learning, knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "Lecturing is widely considered to be a passive, teacher-centred teaching method that fails to foster learning, yet it remains the most feasible method of teaching among higher institutions. Some modern lectures, aligned with recommendations from published guidelines on effective lecturing, are less didactic and more interactive than others, but little is known about converting the classical knowledge-transfer process of lecturing to actual learning. We introduce a cognitive load theory-based lecture guideline that adopts various types of empirically proven strategies to manage learners' mental loads during lectures. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to evaluate its effectiveness by determining the between-group difference in cognitive load level, self-perceived learning, knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention. This study discusses the practical application of the guideline and several examples of the principles.",

    "Abstract": "The Choosing Wisely campaign highlights the importance of clinical reasoning abilities for competent and reflective physicians. The principles of this campaign should be addressed in undergraduate medical education. Recent research suggests that answering questions on important steps in patient management promotes knowledge retention. It is less clear whether increasing the authenticity of educational material by the inclusion of videos further enhances learning outcome. BACKGROUND The Choosing Wisely campaign highlights the importance of clinical reasoning abilities for competent and reflective physicians. The principles of this campaign should be addressed in undergraduate medical education. Recent research suggests that answering questions on important steps in patient management promotes knowledge retention. It is less clear whether increasing the authenticity of educational material by the inclusion of videos further enhances learning outcome.In a prospective randomised controlled cross-over study, we assessed whether repeated video-based testing is more effective than repeated text-based testing in training students to choose appropriate diagnostic tests, arrive at correct diagnoses and identify advisable therapies. Following an entry exam, fourth-year undergraduate medical students attended 10 weekly computer-based seminars during which they studied patient case histories. Each case contained five key feature questions (items) on the diagnosis and treatment of the presented patient. Students were randomly allocated to read text cases (control condition) or watch videos (intervention), and assignment to either text or video was switched between groups every week. Using a within-subjects design, student performance on video-based and text-based items was assessed 13 weeks (exit exam) and 9 months (retention test) after the first day of term. The primary outcome was the within-subject difference in performance on video-based and text-based items in the exit exam.

The primary outcome was the within-subject difference in performance on video-based and text-based items in the exit exam.Of 125 eligible students, 93 provided data for all three exams (response rate 74.4%). Percent scores were significantly higher for video-based than for text-based items in the exit exam (76.2 ± 19.4% vs. 72.4 ± 19.1%, p = 0.026) but not the retention test (69.2 ± 20.2% vs. 66.4 ± 20.3%, p = 0.108). An additional Bayesian analysis of this retention test suggested that video-based training is marginally more effective than text-based training in the long term (Bayes factor 2.36). Regardless of presentation format, student responses revealed a high prevalence of erroneous beliefs that, if applied to the clinical context, could place patients at risk.

    "Abstract": "Background: A move towards integrated curriculum questions the desirability and application of image sensitive disciplines like histology. It calls for redefining the role of drawing in learning. Objective: To determine the effect of drawing microscopic images on retention of knowledge of histology. Study design, settings and Duration: The quasi experimental study was conducted at the histology laboratory of Anatomy department, Shifa College of Medicine (SCM), Shifa Tameer-e-Millat University, lasting from January 2017 to September 2017. Subjects and Methods: The second year MBBS students were selected by purposive sampling technique. The study was conducted during an eight week duration module of endocrine and reproductive system. The class of 100 students was divided into group A and group B, comprising of 50 students each. During the first four weeks students in group A were required to draw the histological image. The students in group B did not draw the microscopic image. During the next four weeks the two groups were flipped over by a cross-over design. The group A became the no drawing group and group B became the drawing group. The MCQ test was taken at the end of four and eight weeks respectively. Results: The students scored better when they drew the images compared to when they did not draw. The results are statistically significant (p <0.05). Conclusion: Drawing is an effective teaching strategy for knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Context: To maintain certification, athletic trainers (ATs) are required to obtain continuing education units (CEUs) in the area of evidence-based practice (EBP). Longitudinal analysis of outcomes after attending a Board of Certification-approved Foundations of EBP course is lacking. Objective: To evaluate ATs' knowledge retention of and confidence in EBP concepts 12 months after a Foundations of EBP course. A secondary aim was to determine ATs' perceptions regarding barriers to, use of, and resources for EBP. Design: Repeated measures within-subjects survey. Setting: Online survey. Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-seven respondents (22% response rate) from a convenience sample of 123 ATs. Intervention(s): Board of Certification-approved Foundations of EBP category workshop. Main Outcome Measure(s): The survey instrument, Evidence-Based Concepts: Knowledge, Attitudes, and Use (EBCKAU), ascertained ATs' perceived EBP knowledge over a 12-month period. Descriptive statistics and correlations were calculated; repeated measures analysis of variance determined differences between scores. Responses to openended questions were catalogued according to themes and coded. Results: For the knowledge score, a statistically significant increase in perceived knowledge (F[subscript 2.0,52.0]=18.91, P < 0.001) from preworkshop (6.40 ± 1.77) to immediately postworkshop (8.15 ± 1.51) and from before to 12 months after workshop (7.30 ± 1.64) was noted. Confidence in knowledge was statistically significantly different over time (z = -4.55, P < 0.001). Both before and since the workshop, ATs reported low levels of incorporating patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) and were equally likely to use compilation research findings in their clinical practice. Barriers of time and available resources were identified, and patient care was reported as the primary area in which ATs envision future use of EBP. Conclusions: Athletic trainers improved immediate perceived knowledge and retained knowledge of EBP concepts over time; however, confidence in knowledge decreased over time. ATs did not implement the workshop concepts into their daily clinical practice.",

    "Abstract": "Mobile technology deployment at the point of care (POC) is rapidly being embraced in healthcare as a means to address hospital-acquired infections and improve patient outcomes. Implementing technology-driven tools and best practices can be a challenge due to limited accessibility to clinically relevant resources, and reduced workforce engagement. To address this issue, an evidence-based practice change project was implemented in a community hospital located in New Jersey. The aims of this project were twofold: 1) increase nurses’ knowledge with respect to best practices for catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI); and 2) enhance frontline staff engagement in best practices using a technology-driven platform infused with game-based learning. The project followed a multi-modal, time-series interventional design in which mobile tools were incorporated at the POC to provide targeted CAUTI education, and best practice strategies for registered nurses ( n = 37) working in the intensive care and medical/surgical units. Presentations, videos, quizzes, case studies, and discussion boards were uploaded weekly onto a mobile technology platform (MTP) for eight weeks. This socio-technical frontline strategy allowed for just-in-time training (JIT) that promoted action-oriented learning. To incentivize ongoing user engagement, nurses accrued gamification reward points for completing structured online learning activities. Results demonstrated an 18.2% increase in sustained nursing knowledge retention scores (p = .02). In addition, staff rated technology uptake as very favorable at 87%-100%. Findings revealed the project increased nurses’ knowledge of CAUTI best practices guidelines, promoted active staff engagement, encouraged technology use, and supported a positive change in POC practices overall.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Knowledge loss caused by employee exit has become a significant corporate risk. This paper aims to explore how to measure the impact of knowledge loss. The paper is based on empirical evidence from a five-year longitudinal study. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a longitudinal change project for a large Australian Research Council Linkage Project grant in the period 2008-2013. The method was a single case study using a critical realism paradigm. The project was a transformational change programme which aimed to help make the partner organization a learning organization to minimize the impact of knowledge loss. The partner organization was a large Australian Government Department, which faced the threat of knowledge loss caused by its ageing workforce. The sample was 118 respondents, mainly engineering and technical workers. A total of 150 respondents were invited to participate in the study which involved an annual survey and attendance at regular training workshops and related activities, with a participation rate of 79 per cent. Findings The results found that knowledge loss has most negative impact in terms of organizational problems including low productivity (morale), strategic misalignment of the workforce (capability gaps), resource cuts (stakeholders unhappy with performance), decreased work quantity and quality (inexperienced employees), work outputs not being used (customers mistrust), longer time to competence (learning cost) and slow task completion (increased search cycle time). The second most significant impact was increased sense of risk associated with work activities and declining capacity to manage the risk. The third main impact was decreased organizational knowledge base: knowledge loss creates knowledge deficit which is unlikely to be filled over time, as shown by the knowledge accounts of surviving employees which remained stable overall. The two remaining measurement constructs – psychological contract and learning organizational capacity – improved, which suggests that the negative impact of knowledge loss may be addressed with appropriate knowledge management. Research limitations/implications The research is based on a single case study in a public sector organization. While the longitudinal nature of the study and the rich data collected offsets this issue, it also presents good opportunities for researchers and practitioners to test the ideas presented in this paper in other industry contexts. The complexity and range of the constructs, concepts and scale items is acknowledged. Tables have been used wherever possible to help the reader access the findings. Practical implications Knowledge loss is perhaps the greatest corporate risk facing organizations today. This paper provides a method to measure the impact of knowledge loss. Managers may use this to assess the significance of the risk and use this as a business case to take action to minimize the impact of knowledge loss. Originality/value Prior research has found knowledge loss has caused decreased psychological contract, lost organizational memory, inefficiency and ineffectiveness and declining capability; however, these concepts are discussed in broad terms only. This paper addresses the need for measurement concepts which helps us understand the nature of the impact of knowledge loss. Five knowledge loss concepts are developed: knowledge resources, psychological contract, learning organization capacity, risk management and organizational problems. The results are based on a large-scale longitudinal study providing empirical evidence of change over a three-year period, situated within the context of a research intervention, i.e. knowledge management programme.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the effectiveness of teaching with simulations, compared to active learning without simulations. It utilizes an anonymous extra-credit pop quiz on four topics, each taught with a different method: (1) simulation and in-class debriefing; (2) simulation only; (3) in-class discussions with an accompanying research essay; and (4) in-class discussions only. The study presents a range of assessment techniques used in simulation literature, and suggests the use of the anonymous extra-credit pop quiz as a simple and familiar teaching practice, but an overlooked assessment tool for simulations. The study presents the \"Iranian Plane\" simulation developed to teach decision making in crisis situations to political science undergraduates. It analyzes empirical evidence on knowledge retention with and without simulations based on students' performance on the pop quiz 3 months after the simulation. The analysis shows that learning with simulation and debriefing together attains teaching goals set in advance. Simulation with debriefing was the most effective teaching mode for knowledge retention in terms of students' performance in the quiz, simulation only was almost as successful, but learning without simulation was less efficient.",

    "Abstract": "An in-depth analysis of open-ended biomedical engineering design problems and the role of metacognition in their solutions The need to build problem solving skills in STEM undergraduates has been widely reported1. This paper provides additional insight into the role of knowledge structure, knowledge retention, and misconceptions in solving open-ended biomedical engineering design problems. Correlations in problem solving performance to level of metacognitive awareness were also assessed. Study participants were enrolled in a first-year introductory biomedical engineering (BME) course that introduces the field through BME specialization introductory lectures, prospective BME career guest lectures, and team-based hands-on design challenges. This two-unit course consists of one 50-minute lecture and a 3-hour discussion session focused on engineering design each week of a 10-week quarter. There were 142 students enrolled in this introductory course. To gather a baseline of students’ design knowledge, the Comprehensive Assessment of Design Engineering Knowledge (CADEK) diagnostic test2 was administered to students in the first and last week of class. Students were also asked to complete an online Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI)3 during week 2. In addition to the CADEK and MAI, students answered an open-ended design problem on their first quiz (in Week 5), from which ten high performing and ten low performing students were identified and asked to participate in one hour think-aloud interviews (TAInt). The TAInt were conducted during weeks 7 and 8 of the quarter and participants were encouraged to speak through their thought processes while being asked to solve three open ended BME design problems. To assess levels of knowledge retention, participants were asked to complete a follow up CADEK and participate in a second round of TAInt in the following quarter consisting of the same open-ended problems. The COSINE (Coding System for Investigating Sub-problems and the Network) method was utilized to analyze the difficulties students have during the problem solving process on the open-ended design problems from the in-class quiz and TAInt4. In the COSINE method analysis, sub-problems that correlate with specific steps of the engineering design process were assigned a code based on student performance in a particular task. Quantitative metrics were developed based on resulting codes to gain insight into where and why students are unsuccessful. One developed metric is the complete success rate (CSR), which describes the percentage of successful attempts for an identified sub-problem relative to all codes that were assigned for that sub-problem over all participants. In the first TAInt, problem identification (sub-problem A), had a complete success rate of 70%. In contrast, the tasks of identifying user needs (sub-problem D), and engineering metric formulation (sub-problem F), had lower complete success rates of 16.67% and 1.67% respectively. 75% of all participants identified at least 50% of user needs for all three design problems yet not a single student could develop at least one metric for all three problems. Interestingly, 80% of the high-performing students were able to translate their identified user needs into their design solution (sub-problem E), whereas only 40% of the low-performing students incorporated their identified user needs. Behaviors such as re-reading the problem statement and drawing device designs were also evaluated. 100% of high performing students used drawing as a tool to succeed in problem three compared to 40% of low performing students. Collected data is currently being analyzed to determine how metacognition and prior knowledge correlate with problem-solving behavior. Assessing study participants over the course of the BME undergraduate curriculum will provide insight into strengths and areas for improvement of design instruction across the curriculum.

    "Abstract": "Cybersecurity's increasing relevance and applicability in the research and development community and job market make it an attractive topic for both students and faculty. Thus, it is necessary for institutions of higher learning to provide courses that prepare students for the broad security-based design space. In addition to teaching students about critical security concepts, hardware-based cybersecurity projects and courses sit at the intersection of many electrical and computer engineering concepts, providing knowledge retention evaluation and assessment opportunities to the instructors and departments. A hardware security course, with optional review-based supplemental work, functions as a culmination of past courses or as an introductory Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) course with security-centric applications of foundational concepts. This paper presents the curricular details of an undergraduate hardware security course designed to be self-sufficient and free of advanced prerequisites, thus accessible to a broad student body with a variety of backgrounds. The course covers cryptology, side-channel analysis, hardware Trojan horses, and other hardware-based security exploitations and countermeasures. The course concludes with a multi-week team project where students replicate existing attacks and/or countermeasures, applying their security knowledge and demonstrating skills as ECE professionals. This paper presents the interweaving of ECE topics and evaluation of students' retention of ECE concepts and skills. \"Hardware Security\" has been taught twice in the last year, each time containing around 25 undergraduate students (including electrical, computer, and electromechanical engineers in their third and fourth years). These students were surveyed and evaluated regarding their confidence with and competency of ECE and related concepts at the beginning and end of the course. The data gathered were used to evaluate two metrics: 1) how well students were prepared regarding pre-requisite knowledge; and 2) how the Hardware Security course improved their understanding and confidence of ECE concepts. Student knowledge from previous courses varied, but the post-course data show that students improved their understanding and confidence in various topics. The data also point to possible weaknesses in the students' past courses, which can be used as feedback to improve the respective department curricula. Overall, the course evaluations showed student growth in hardware security and progress in reinforcing ECE fundamental knowledge. The work presented here will help ECE faculty and departments deploy similar curricula to prepare students for a cybersecurity career and provide an evaluation of student conceptual retention and growth within their electrical and computer engineering education.",

    "Abstract": "The incorporation of active learning in our curriculum has been a pedagogical goal of our school toward enforcing learning and long-term knowledge retention. We established state-of-the-arts teaching facilities and infrastructure to enable this goal. We also created a human organization that is capable of empowering students’ learning through experimentation and exploration while being able to dynamically respond to their specific educational needs. This, component of our education, which has been growing rapidly over the past six years, is a result of a collaboration between our faculty and teaching staff. As new experiments and projects are envisioned they must be evaluated and assessed before they become part of our curriculum. Initially, we introduced small groups of our college students to these new activities through focused pilots, but as the demands increased, it became difficult to have a thorough evaluation through these short programs. Thus, we established a pre-collegiate summer program to prototype and develop new learning initiatives before they get integrated into the full curriculum. We decided to engage a different student body, a group of international students of diverse backgrounds. Indeed, this summer program became a valuable platform to develop, experiment, and evaluate new active learning exercises. The outcome of this yearly program has helped modify and enhance our formal offering for “our” College students. This paper will discuss our methodology of addressing factors influencing the success of this program, including: (1) Method of student selection prior to the start, and team formation upon the start of the program. (2) Choice of piloted topics in support of our official college curriculum. (3) Mechanism of curricular development, including program workshops and design competitions. (4) Mechanics of piloting new activities and engaging the participating students. (5) Assessment of learning outcome (before, during, and after program completion).",

    "Abstract": "In second year civil engineering, students participate in a horizontally integrated bridge design project to increase their exposure to engineering application and prepare for their fourth-year design project. To compliment this project, a two-day event called CivE Days was implemented. This event freed students from classes and deadlines and allowed them to completely immerse themselves in a simulated bridge design project. The set-up of the event is split into four stages: preliminary design, bridge construction, bridge testing and project reflection. Learning takes place through a combination of experiential learning, group work, reflective learning, and learning from failure. All of these pedagogical approaches promote a deeper level of learning for students and enhance knowledge retention in upper years. The event was not graded to allow students to experiment and learn in a stress-free environment. This provided a positive atmosphere where design creativity was encouraged without fear of failure. The effectiveness of the CivE Days initiative was evaluated through the final bridge project testing results, final bridge project report marks, and surveys submitted at the end of the CivE Days event. The bridge project grades and testing results for students who participated in CivE Days was compared to the bridge project grades and testing results for a control class who did not have the opportunity to participate in the CivE Days event. It was found that student grades and performance improved, indicating a better understanding of the bridge design project and how the information from the different courses are integrated.",

    "Abstract": "Background: High volumes, ill patients, and steep learning curves can make neurosurgical rotations challenging for medical students. Furthermore, existing rotations often lack neurosurgery-specific orientation materials and level-appropriate pre-reading resources reducing the educational yield of short rotations. This is compounded by the lack of mandatory neurosurgical rotations across medical schools. We hypothesized that a “Neurosurgery Clerkship Manual” covering key orientation, knowledge, and practical topics would enhance educational experiences and generate sustained knowledge retention. Methods: Students rotating through neurosurgery at three hospitals were randomized to receive(intervention) or not receive(control) free access to the manual before their rotation. Participants completed surveys before, immediately after, and 4-weeks after the rotation assessing expectations, experiences, and clinically-relevant knowledge. Results: 61 participants were randomized between 2014 and 2017 with 43(70.5%) completing all three questionnaires. Baseline demographics, characteristics, and experiences were not significantly different. Those receiving the manual reported increased rotation enjoyment(p=0.02), decreased stress levels (p=0.05), and a greater feeling of being “part of the team”(p=0.01). There were also reductions in feeling like they were “not learning” (p=0.01). Finally, those receiving the manual demonstrated significantly better knowledge after the rotation (91.6%vs80.9%;p=0.04) which was sustained at 4-weeks post-rotation (89.2%vs79.0%;p=0.05). Conclusions: A simple and inexpensive clerkship manual can improve the neurosurgery rotation experience and knowledge retention for medical students.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG Traditional plant use is of tremendous importance in many societies, including most rural African communities. A variety of studies have shown knowledge dwindling due to changes towards a more Western lifestyle, and the influence of modern tourism. In the case of the Sekenani Maasai, we hypothesized in 2006 that, while little knowledge loss had been observed at that time, the change from a nomadic to a more sedentary lifestyle would lead to an accelerating loss of traditional plant knowledge. This paper examines the plant use of the Maasai in the Sekenani Valley, North of the Maasai Mara National Reserve 15 years after a first study. Based on the study of 2002 (Bussmann et al. Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2: 22, 2006), semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff of Sekenani Camp in order to document current plant knowledge. The results of this follow-up study indicate dramatic knowledge loss over the last 15 years. Of 139 used species documented in 2002, only 84 remained in use in 2017. Off those species still in use, 30 had experienced a loss of uses, while for 18 species new uses were documented. The knowledge loss observed in Sekenani in 15 years is rather dramatic. Lifestyle changes and over-use of resources have clearly led to a rapid decline of traditional knowledge on plant use. This trend is expected to continue.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Background: Failure to involve hard-to-reachpopulations in clinical research denies the potential benefits of research tothe excluded groups, perpetuating health disparities. Employing community healthworkers (CHWs) may be an effective strategy to increase outreach and engagementof marginalized groups. CHWs are members of the target communities with apersonal commitment to help their neighbors, and who serve as informants andcommunicators among their peers. CHWs may be particularly effective inaddressing individual and cultural barriers to research participation. Becauseof their unique background and community-based roles, tailored training programsfor CHWs are needed. The Recruitment, Retention, and Community EngagementProgram at the UIC Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences seeks to trainCHWs to be involved in the recruitment and enrollment of participants inclinical trials. We developed an 8-hour training that covers basic researchmethods (e.g., randomized clinical trials, longitudinal studies); researchactivities (e.g., surveys, interviews); and research ethics. The trainingfocuses on the development of communication skills necessary for ethicalrecruitment and informed consent, providing strategies for addressing mistrust,fear and misunderstanding around the research process. Aim 1: To evaluate thefeasibility of the CHW training by assessing. Aim 1.1: Recruitment ofparticipants; Aim 1.2: Completion of training session (8 hr). Aim 2: To evaluateacceptability of training by assessing. Aim 2.1: Satisfaction with training; Aim2.2: Cultural competence of training content; Aim 2.3: Participant self-efficacyin reproducing information. Aim 3: To collect performance measures by assessing.Aim 3.1: Knowledge gain and retention; Aim 3.2: Self-efficacy in identifying andaddressing negative beliefs about research; Aim 3.3: Participants’readiness to refer and/or recommend participation in clinical trials.METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Methods: This is a pilot study with asingle-group repeated-measures design with assessments at baseline, 1 weekpost-test, and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. We aim to recruit 25 CHWs working withorganizations serving the needs of ethnic minorities in Chicago. We willevaluate feasibility (recruitment, completion of training and assessments) andacceptability of the training (satisfaction with training, culturalappropriateness of content and delivery, participant self-efficacy inreproducing information). Performance measures assessed throughself-administered surveys at baseline, 1 week post-training, 3 months, and 6months will include knowledge, attitudes toward research, and self-efficacy inidentifying and addressing barriers to participation. Readiness to recruit andobtain informed consent will be assessed during an observed simulation activitywith a standardized participant. Data analysis: Demographic data will becollected, and descriptive and inferential analyses will be conducted. Pretestand post-test questionnaire data will be compared using t -tests. In the informed consent simulation, individuals willbe scored on whether they adequately addressed required elements of the informedconsent process. Data gathered from the informed consent simulation will also beused for program evaluation and formative purposes; feedback on strengths andareas for improvement will be provided to participants.RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Expected results: It will be feasible toimplement the training of CHWs, reaching the expected goal of 25 participants,with at least 70% of them completing the 8-hour training. We expectto collect data demonstrating acceptability of the training with a score of“good” or “excellent” by70% of participants. At least 70% will rate the trainingas “culturally acceptable” or better, and will showimproved self-efficacy in the delivery of information from pretest to post-testby at least 30%. Performance measures will demonstrate improvementsin research knowledge by 30% from pretest to post-test; increasedself-efficacy in identifying and addressing negative beliefs about researchprocess, by at least 30%. A minimum of 70% of participantswill demonstrate readiness to refer and/or recommend participation inclinical trials by scoring at or above 70% in evaluation ofperformance with standardized participants. Evaluation of knowledge retention at3 and 6 months post-training will not take place before the TranslationalScience Conference in March 2018. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT:Discussion/Impact. The outcomes of this evaluation may advance ourknowledge of community obstacles to participation in research, and shed light onsuccessful strategies to address them. Information obtained will be used toaddress limitations of the training. Even though the sample is small we expectto identify trends in quantitative measures that will support an application forfunding for a larger randomized study. Once we have developed an effectivetraining model, we expect to disseminate it to other CTSAs for broadimplementation.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Amongst the Health Care Professionals, midwife has a strategic role in taking care of both mother and child in contributing to their survival, health, and wellbeing. The retaining midwife’s knowledge and quality of care through training on specific skills is strongly needed. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge retention among midwives after the provision of digestive health, nutrition, and parenting education sessions at immediate and three months after the education. Methods: A serial pre-post intervention experimental study was conducted from January to July 2016 to evaluate the knowledge before (pre-test), immediate after (post-test), and three months after the provision of three sessions of digestion health, nutrition, and parenting (character building) topics by the experts which covered from several areas in Indonesia. The improvement of the sufficient knowledge proportion time by time was analyzed by using McNemar test. Results: The low immediate response rate (77.2%) and very low response after the 3-month follow-up (26.4%) were revealed during the study. At baseline, less than 50% of the subjects had sufficient knowledge on digestive health, nutrition, and parenting. At immediate after and after three months, there were significant improvements in the proportion of sufficient knowledge in nutrition and parenting topics. However, there was a declining of sufficient knowledge at after 3 months group compared to immediate group.

    "Abstract": "The present study examined the relationship between second-year medical students’ group performance and individual performance in a collaborative-learning environment. In recent decades, university professors in the scientific and humanistic disciplines have successfully put into practice different modalities of collaborative approaches to teaching. Essentially, collaborative approach refers to a variety of techniques that involves the joint intellectual effort of a small group of students, which encourages interaction and discussion among students and professors. The present results show the efficacy of collaborative learning, which, furthermore, allowed students to participate actively in the physiology class. Average student’s grades were significantly higher when they engaged in single-best-response, multiple-choice tests as a student team, compared with taking the same examinations individually. The method improved notably knowledge retention, as learning is more effective when performed in the context of collaborative partnership. A selected subset of questions answered wrongly in an initial test, both individually and collectively, was used on a second test to examine student retention of studied material. Grade averages were significantly improved, both individually and groupwise, when students responded to the subset of questions a second time, 1, 2, or 3 wk after the first attempt. These results suggest that the collaborative approach to teaching allowed a more effective understanding of course content, which meant an improved capacity for retention of human physiology knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "Didactic lectures are prevalent in physiology courses within veterinary medicine programs, but more active learning methods have also been utilized. Our goal was to identify the most appropriate learning method to augment the lecture component of our physiology course. We hypothesized that case-based learning would be well received by students and would be more effective at helping them learn physiological concepts compared with more traditional laboratory exercises. In this study, approximately one-half of the laboratory sessions for the two-semester course were dedicated to traditional hands-on laboratory exercises, whereas the remaining one-half of the sessions were dedicated to case-based exercises. The lecture portion of the course was not altered. Student attitudes were evaluated after each session and at the end of each semester via quantitative and qualitative survey questions. Student performance was evaluated using section exams and end-of-semester posttests. The vast majority of survey responses received were positive for both cased-based activities and traditional hands-on laboratories. In addition, participation in both types of active learning activities, but not lecture, was associated with retention of conceptual knowledge based on student performance between the section exams and posttests (P < 0.002). These results indicate that both case-based learning and laboratory exercises are beneficial learning activities to incorporate into a lecture-based physiology course. However, positive survey responses were significantly greater following case-based activities vs. traditional hands-on laboratories, and only participation in case-based activities resulted in greater student performance on the posttest (P < 0.04). Therefore, case-based activities may be the preferred supplemental learning activity for veterinary medical physiology.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional plant use is of tremendous importance in many societies, including most rural African communities. A variety of studies have shown knowledge dwindling due to changes towards a more Western lifestyle, and the influence of modern tourism. In the case of the Sekenani Maasai, we hypothesized in 2006 that, while little knowledge loss had been observed at that time, the change from a nomadic to a more sedentary lifestyle would lead to an accelerating loss of traditional plant knowledge. This paper examines the plant use of the Maasai in the Sekenani Valley, North of the Maasai Mara National Reserve 15 years after a first study. Based on the study of 2002 (Bussmann et al. Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2: 22, 2006), semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff of Sekenani Camp in order to document current plant knowledge. The results of this follow-up study indicate dramatic knowledge loss over the last 15 years. Of 139 used species documented in 2002, only 84 remained in use in 2017. Off those species still in use, 30 had experienced a loss of uses, while for 18 species new uses were documented. The knowledge loss observed in Sekenani in 15 years is rather dramatic.

    "Abstract": "The present study examined the relationship between second-year medical students' group performance and individual performance in a collaborative-learning environment. In recent decades, university professors in the scientific and humanistic disciplines have successfully put into practice different modalities of collaborative approaches to teaching. Essentially, collaborative approach refers to a variety of techniques that involves the joint intellectual effort of a small group of students, which encourages interaction and discussion among students and professors. The present results show the efficacy of collaborative learning, which, furthermore, allowed students to participate actively in the physiology class. Average student's grades were significantly higher when they engaged in single-best-response, multiple-choice tests as a student team, compared with taking the same examinations individually. The method improved notably knowledge retention, as learning is more effective when performed in the context of collaborative partnership. A selected subset of questions answered wrongly in an initial test, both individually and collectively, was used on a second test to examine student retention of studied material. Grade averages were significantly improved, both individually and groupwise, when students responded to the subset of questions a second time, 1, 2, or 3 wk after the first attempt. These results suggest that the collaborative approach to teaching allowed a more effective understanding of course content, which meant an improved capacity for retention of human physiology knowledge.The present study examined the relationship between second-year medical students' group performance and individual performance in a collaborative-learning environment.

    "Abstract": "Didactic lectures are prevalent in physiology courses within veterinary medicine programs, but more active learning methods have also been utilized. Our goal was to identify the most appropriate learning method to augment the lecture component of our physiology course. We hypothesized that case-based learning would be well received by students and would be more effective at helping them learn physiological concepts compared with more traditional laboratory exercises. In this study, approximately one-half of the laboratory sessions for the two-semester course were dedicated to traditional hands-on laboratory exercises, whereas the remaining one-half of the sessions were dedicated to case-based exercises. The lecture portion of the course was not altered. Student attitudes were evaluated after each session and at the end of each semester via quantitative and qualitative survey questions. Student performance was evaluated using section exams and end-of-semester posttests. The vast majority of survey responses received were positive for both cased-based activities and traditional hands-on laboratories. In addition, participation in both types of active learning activities, but not lecture, was associated with retention of conceptual knowledge based on student performance between the section exams and posttests ( P < 0.002). These results indicate that both case-based learning and laboratory exercises are beneficial learning activities to incorporate into a lecture-based physiology course. However, positive survey responses were significantly greater following case-based activities vs. traditional hands-on laboratories, and only participation in case-based activities resulted in greater student performance on the posttest ( P < 0.04). Therefore, case-based activities may be the preferred supplemental learning activity for veterinary medical physiology.Didactic lectures are prevalent in physiology courses within veterinary medicine programs, but more active learning methods have also been utilized.

    "Abstract": "Aim: The aim of this report, written for the 40th anniversary issue of Medical Teacher, is to document 20 years of development of the Utrecht undergraduate medical curriculum, as both to exhibit accountability and to inform the community of the process and choices that can be made in long-term curriculum development. Methods: We used the SPICES model, created by Medical Teacher’s Editor Ronald Harden and colleagues in 1984. Results: The Utrecht six-year program, now called “CRU+”, has many distinct features that were introduced, most of which are well documented. A limited selection includes -  • A new 3+3 years Bachelor-Master structure following the EU Bologna rules leading to MD registration for cohorts of about 300. -  • Horizontally integrated classroom teaching of basic sciences with clinical disciplines predominantly in groups of 12 and limited lectures. -  • Mandatory knowledge retention tests, retesting the clinically relevant core knowledge from block tests of semesters one through four. -  • Vertical integration not only linking clinical experience with background knowledge, but also exemplified by a stepwise increase in health care responsibilities throughout the curriculum. -  • A final year focussing on growth towards the level of a primary responsible physician in a 12-week sub-internship for a limited number of patients and beds, in a chosen specialty. The student is called a semi-physician in the clerkship of this transitional year to residency. -  • Teaching skills training for all medical graduates, an elective teaching rotation and various peer-teaching arrangements throughout the curriculum. -  • Integrated semi-longitudinal clerkships with an assessment focus on entrustment decisions for Entrustable Professional Activities. Conclusion: UMC Utrecht has made a continuous attempt to both develop its medical curriculum and to study and report on its development in the literature, regarding new methods found and insights derived. UMC Utrecht will remain committed to developing training to meet twenty-first century demands of medical graduates.",

    "Abstract": "Testicular self-examination (TSE) promotional interventions historically operate without a theoretical framework, which negatively influences their effectiveness. As TSE is critical to the early detection of testicular cancer, this behavior is an essential component to improving overall male well-being. To address this need, the Control Identity personality typology was developed to assist in creating more effective TSE promotional interventions. Four outcome control dispositions were defined a priori based on the dimensions of illusions of control and locus of control. An original 41-item survey, the Control Identity Assessment Scale, was used to assess perceived vulnerability, value of health promotion, and health outcome control among a convenience sample of 300 university males aged 18 to 35 years via a cross-sectional research design. Factor and cluster analyses were employed to extract salient factors in the data and to identify subgroups within the sample. A consistent five-factor structure matrix (~70% explained variance) served as the foundation from which a k-means cluster analysis was employed to classify four types of individuals. Significant differences were detected between clusters on primary variables, including behavioral intentions to conduct TSE. The Control Identity typology aims to provide the needed mechanism for health practitioners to create more effective preventive health messaging to promote TSE. Future implications on employing this typology to segment audiences in order to increase overall effectiveness are offered. Application of this typology could ultimately lead to increasing TSE knowledge retention, behavioral intentions, actual performance, and adherence.

    "Abstract": "Testicular self-examination (TSE) promotional interventions historically operate without a theoretical framework, which negatively influences their effectiveness. As TSE is critical to the early detection of testicular cancer, this behavior is an essential component to improving overall male well-being. To address this need, the Control Identity personality typology was developed to assist in creating more effective TSE promotional interventions. Four outcome control dispositions were defined a priori based on the dimensions of illusions of control and locus of control. An original 41-item survey, the Control Identity Assessment Scale, was used to assess perceived vulnerability, value of health promotion, and health outcome control among a convenience sample of 300 university males aged 18 to 35 years via a cross-sectional research design. Factor and cluster analyses were employed to extract salient factors in the data and to identify subgroups within the sample. A consistent five-factor structure matrix (~70% explained variance) served as the foundation from which a k-means cluster analysis was employed to classify four types of individuals. Significant differences were detected between clusters on primary variables, including behavioral intentions to conduct TSE. The Control Identity typology aims to provide the needed mechanism for health practitioners to create more effective preventive health messaging to promote TSE. Future implications on employing this typology to segment audiences in order to increase overall effectiveness are offered. Application of this typology could ultimately lead to increasing TSE knowledge retention, behavioral intentions, actual performance, and adherence.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Improving public access and training for epinephrine auto-injectors (EAIs) can reduce time to initial treatment in anaphylaxis. Effective use of EAIs by the public requires bystanders to respond in a timely and proficient manner. We wished to examine optimal methods for effective training and skill retention for public use of EAIs. Methods: In this prospective, stratified randomized study, 154 participants at 15 sites receiving installation of public EAIs were randomized to one of three experimental education interventions: A) didactic poster (POS) teaching; B) poster with video teaching (VID), and C) Poster, video, and simulation training (SIM). Participants were tested by participation in a standardized simulated anaphylaxis scenario at 0-months, immediately following training, and again at follow-up at 3 months. Participants responses were videoed and assessed by blinded raters. Patient recorded experience measures (PREMs) assessed participant-patient interaction for every scenario. Data that was non-normally distributed was analyzed using non-parametric testing (Kruskall-Wallis-Rank Sum-Test). Results: Initial analysis showed differences between group baseline characteristics for age and first aid training; with a multivariable analysis providing the effect size of these differences. PREM data and video assessment data were not normally distributed. Analysis of PREM data revealed significantly higher scores in the SIM group at 0-months (median=6.5, IQR=5; p=0.05) and 3-months (median=5, IQR=3; p<0.01), compared to those groups that did not receive SIM. Video assessment performance scores show trends in higher skills and knowledge retention for SIM participants at 3-months; full data analysis will be performed at a later date. Final video assessment analysis will involve a weighted scoring system, using a consensus process, and an inter-rater agreement analysis. Conclusion: Simulation training improves interaction, essential skills, and retention of knowledge in simulated anaphylaxis response with public EAIs compared to non-simulation-based training.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The 2015 CanMEDS framework requires all residency programs to increase their focus on Quality Improvement and Patient Safety (QIPS). We created a longitudinal (4-year), modular QIPS curriculum for FRCP emergency medicine residents at the University of Toronto (UT) using multiple educational methods. The curriculum addresses three levels of QIPS training: knowledge, practical skills at the microsystem level, and practical skills at the organization level. Aim Statement: To increase the UT FRCP emergency medicine residents absolute score on the QIKAT-R (Quality Improvement Knowledge Application Tool Revised) by 10% after the completion of the QIPS curriculum. Methods: Physicians and other healthcare professionals with QI expertise collaboratively designed and taught the curriculum. We used the QIKAT-R as the outcome measure to evaluate QI knowledge and its applicability. The QIKAT-R is a validated measure that assesses an individuals ability to decipher a QI issue within the healthcare context, and propose a change initiative to address it. The first cohort of residents completed the QIKAT-R prior to the first session in 2014 (pre) and at the completion of the curriculum in 2017 (post). Each response was anonymized and scored by physicians with QI expertise. The QIKAT-R scores and comments from course evaluations are used to make yearly iterative curriculum changes. Results: The QIPS curriculum was implemented in September 2014. All nine residents in the first cohort completed the curriculum; they demonstrated an absolute increase of 19.6% (5.3/27) in the mean QIKAT-R score (13.0 +/− 3.3 pre vs. 18.3 +/− 3.8 post, p=0.001). Of the pre-test responses, 26% were categorized as poor, 70% as good, and 4% as excellent, whereas of the post-test 11% of responses were categorized as poor, 37% as good, and 52% as excellent (p<0.001). Two iterative curriculum changes were made at the end of each academic year since 2014: (1) The time between sessions were decreased to promote knowledge retention, and (2) different PGY3 QI practical project options were provided to suit residents individual QI interests. QIKAT-R scores and resident feedback were used to evaluate the impact of the curriculum changes. Conclusion: A collaborative, modular, longitudinal QIPS curriculum for UT FRCP emergency medicine residents that met CanMEDS requirements was created using multiple educational methods. The first resident cohort that completed the curriculum demonstrated an absolute increase in QI knowledge and its applicability (as measured by the QIKAT-R) by 19.6%. Two PDSA cycles were completed to improve the curriculum with the change ideas generated from resident feedback. Ongoing challenges include limited staff availability to teach and supervise resident QI projects. Future directions include incentivising staff participation and providing mentorship for residents with a career interest in QI beyond what is offered by the curriculum.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge management is one of the most potent means for the improvement of Lithuanian armed forces efficiency in context of transformations. Knowledge retention is one of the knowledge management processes that is related to knowledge selection, accumulation of the organization experience, renewal of the organizational memory in order to preserve the valuable knowledge from the potential loss. In order for the Lithuanian armed forces to manage the knowledge effectively and develop – it is important to purposefully preserve the valuable knowledge. The knowledge retention management problems of the Lithuanian armed forces are classified into: human, organizational, functional, technological and technical. In order to solve the problematics of such type, the identification of the factors, that provides the premises for the complex assessment of the knowledge retention process, becomes an important factor. The purpose of the article is to identify the factors that are significant for the evaluation of the knowledge retention process effectiveness of the Lithuanian armed forces. In order to achieve the objective such methods as the analysis of the scientific literature, multiple criteria and expert assessment are employed. According to the research results most factors were attributed to the group of the organizational and knowledge content factors.",

    "Abstract": "Importance: The instruction of dermatology can be challenging due to its large scope, heavy clinical nature, and limited curriculum space. Case-based learning (CBL) is an emerging education paradigm and has no current literature on its use in dermatology. Objectives: Assess CBL in undergraduate dermatology medical education. Methods: Case-based learning was implemented in the preclerkship dermatology curriculum at the University of Toronto to 3 student cohorts (totaling 710 students and 93 tutors) between May 2016 and April 2017. We analyzed assignment performance, pre- and post-CBL knowledge test scores, and experience surveys on students and tutors. Surveys were evaluated using aggregate descriptive statistics for quantitative data and thematic data analysis for qualitative data. All assessments were anonymous and voluntary. Results: We received strong positive feedback on the CBL experience, with no score less than 3.8 on a 5-point scale (where 5 indicated strongly agree with a positively phrased question). Thematic data analysis revealed several key themes, including positive comments for a specialist tutor, the use of visual media, and the “mini-cases” style of CBL, while challenges included a lack of motivation. Group assignments scored high, ranging from 88.9% to 99.3%. Tracked pre- and post-CBL knowledge test scores showed a 32% (from 42% to 74%) increase in scores after the CBL experience. Conclusion and Relevance: CBL in dermatology medical education was well received by students and tutors, with high scores in content evaluation and knowledge assessment. Future studies should examine optimal delivery methods and its long-term effects on knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Students whose math self-concept is threatened in stressful classroom situations activate self-defense mechanisms to forget those experiences, which jeopardize future learning and knowledge retention. External cues to forget might be critical to activate these self-defense mechanisms. We tested this idea by employing a directed-forgetting paradigm using math-related materials. Participants were presented with math problems to enhance anxiety, followed by a list of math-related words with instructions to either remember or forget those words. All participants were then asked to remember a second math list. We predicted that people most vulnerable to experiencing threat—those with high math anxiety and high math self-concept—would have the internal motivation to most effectively carry out the forgetting instructions. Participants with high math anxiety and high math self-concept had a greater forgetting score than other participants. These findings are consistent with a motivated forgetting account and suggest that educational materials are susceptible to forgetting.

    "Abstract": "Abstract The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (2004) reporting on preventing infant death and injury during delivery identified human errors during neonatal resuscitation as responsible for more than two thirds of perinatal mortality and morbidity. One of the main causes of human error in neonatal resuscitation stems from a lack of practical learning experiences highlighted by the neonatal training paradox of high-acuity, low-occurrence (HALO) situations that arise infrequently. simulation-based medical education (SBME) is resource and cost intensive, and not offered frequently enough for development of competency and for supporting knowledge retention. Therefore, other methods of training to improve knowledge retention and decision-making are needed. We therefore developed a complementary tool to the physical SBME to improve knowledge retention during neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room. Specifically, we developed a game-based neonatal resuscitation training simulator called RETAIN. We hypothesized that HCP playing the video game will have an improved mindset and therefore an improved neonatal resuscitation performance. HCPs trained in NRP, including registered nurses, respiratory therapists, neonatal nurse practitioners, neonatal consultants, and neonatal fellows were recruited from the Royal Alexandra Hospital, a tertiary NICU. Each participant was asked to complete a pre-game questionnaire to obtain demographics (e.g. last Neonatal Resuscitation Course (NRP)-course, years of experience) and assess their neonatal resuscitation knowledge by completing a Resuscitation scenario. Afterwards each participant played the RETAIN simulator, which started with a tutorial before the actual three rounds and there was a countdown for each of the rounds to simulate the stress of a real-world scenario. After completion of the game each participant also completed a Post-game questionnaire to assess the player's mindset (e.g. How much do you agree with the following statements? You can always change how good you are at your job or You can get better at your job with practice) using a Likert scale (1=Strongly Disagree to 5=Strongly agree). We recruited 50 (45 females, 4 males, and 1 not reported) HCP who were all NRP-trained and had completed a NRP refresher course within the last 24 months. Participants needed a mean (SD) 8.47 (8.66) minutes to complete the game. On average, participants reported high levels of growth mindset (with scores ranging from seven to ten), took their latest NRP course more than eight months prior to the current study, and scored 93% in the game (32 was a perfect score). Interestingly, participants who took the NRP course more recently made more mistakes in the simulation game. There was a significant interaction of Last NRP Course and Growth Mindset in predicting Number of Tries (b =.09, S.E.=.04, beta=.32, t =2.25, p =.03), as well as a main effect for Last NRP Course (b= -.08, S.E.=.04, beta=-.30, t =-2.04, p <.05). Thus, participants who took an NRP course recently (i.e., within eight months), before the current study, completed the game in significantly fewer tries when they endorsed more rather than less of a growth mindset. However, participants who endorsed more of a growth mindset performed similarly on the game regardless of when they took the NRP course. The study examined the relation between HCP task performance and time elapsed since their latest NRP course and found that growth mindset moderates this relation. Specifically, HCP who took the NRP course within the past eight months, those who endorsed a higher growth mindset made fewer mistakes in a simulation game. Some implications include growth mindset interventions and increased opportunities to practice skills in simulation sessions to help HCP achieve better performance after taking a refresher NRP course.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to evaluate how managers influence accidental and intentional organizational forgetting, i.e. knowledge depreciation, knowledge loss and unlearning. Design/methodology/approach The literature was reviewed based on predetermined search terms to identify peer-reviewed articles published in English and available in full-text format from the EBSCOhost and Google Scholar databases. Empirical and theoretical contributions were included. Additional articles, books and book chapters were manually selected and included based on recent reviews and syntheses of organizational forgetting work. Findings Findings revealed that managers contributed to preventing accidental knowledge depreciation and loss and preserving organizational memory. With respect to intentional forgetting, findings revealed contradictory positions: on the one hand, managers contributed to the disbandment of existing beliefs and frames of reference, but on the other hand, they preserved existing knowledge and power structures. Research limitations/implications The study was limited by the accessibility of subscribed journals and databases, research scope and time span. Practical implications This paper provides useful guidelines to managers who need to reduce the disruptive effects of accidental forgetting or plan intentional forgetting, i.e. managed unlearning. Originality/value This paper represents a first attempt to review and define the influence of managers on organizational forgetting.",

BACKGROUND The current state of health care encompasses highly acute, complex patients, managed with ever-changing technology. The ability to function proficiently in critical care relies on knowledge, technical skills, and interprofessional teamwork. Integration of these factors can improve patient outcomes. Simulation provides \"hands-on\" practice and allows for the integration of teamwork into knowledge/skill training. However, simulation can require a significant investment of time, effort, and financial resources. The Institute of Medicine recommendations from 2015 include \"strengthening the evidence base for interprofessional education (IPE)\" and \"linking IPE with changes in collaborative behavior.\" In one surgical-trauma-burn intensive care unit (STBICU), no IPE existed. The highly acute and diverse nature of the patients served by the unit highlights the importance of appropriate training. This is heightened during critical event situations where patients deteriorate rapidly and the team intervenes swiftly.The aims of this study were to (1) evaluate knowledge retention and analyze changes in perceptions of teamwork among nurses and resident physicians in a STBICU setting after completion of an interprofessional critical event simulation and (2) provide insight for future interprofessional simulations (IPSs), including the ideal frequency of such training, associated cost, and potential effect on nursing turnover. PURPOSE The aims of this study were to (1) evaluate knowledge retention and analyze changes in perceptions of teamwork among nurses and resident physicians in a STBICU setting after completion of an interprofessional critical event simulation and (2) provide insight for future interprofessional simulations (IPSs), including the ideal frequency of such training, associated cost, and potential effect on nursing turnover.A comparison-cohort pilot study was developed to evaluate knowledge retention and analyze changes in perceptions of teamwork. DESIGN A comparison-cohort pilot study was developed to evaluate knowledge retention and analyze changes in perceptions of teamwork.A 1-hour critical event IPS was held for nurses and resident physicians in a STBICU setting. A traumatic brain injury patient with elevated intracranial pressure, rapid deterioration, and cardiac arrest was utilized for the simulation scenario. The simulation required the team to use interventions to reduce elevated intracranial pressure and then perform cardiac resuscitation according to Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines. A semistructured debriefing guided by the TENTS tool highlighted important aspects of teamwork. Participants took knowledge and Teamwork Skills Scale (TSS) pretests, posttests, and 1-month posttests. Mean scores were calculated for each time point (pre, post, and 1-month post), and paired t tests were used to evaluate changes.

Participants recommended retraining intervals of 3 to 6 months. Cost of each simulation was estimated to be $324.44. Analysis of nursing turnover rates did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in turnover; however, confounding factors were not controlled for.

Participants recommended retraining intervals of 3 to 6 months. Cost of each simulation was estimated to be $324.44. Analysis of nursing turnover rates did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in turnover; however, confounding factors were not controlled for.Significant improvements on both knowledge test and TSS scores demonstrate the effectiveness of the intervention, and retention of the information gained and teamwork skills learned. Participants valued the intervention and recommended to increase the frequency of training. Future studies should develop a framework for \"best practice\" IPS, analyze the relationship with nursing turnover, and ultimately seek correlations between IPS and improved patient outcomes.

    "Abstract": "To study the impact of a novel comprehensive eLearning approach in delivering diabetes related education program that includes knowledge and sets of practices to the school personnel in Kuwait to enable them to provide a supportive environment for students with diabetes. AIMS To study the impact of a novel comprehensive eLearning approach in delivering diabetes related education program that includes knowledge and sets of practices to the school personnel in Kuwait to enable them to provide a supportive environment for students with diabetes.The program was designed with three components namely; knowledge, skills and recommendations. The diabetes knowledge was delivered through an interactive eLearning program, the effectiveness of which was assessed using diabetes knowledge questionnaires which were deployed pre- and post-course delivery. Additionally, the participants' knowledge retention and confidence in caring for a student with diabetes were evaluated at 6 or 12 months post-intervention. METHODS The program was designed with three components namely; knowledge, skills and recommendations. The diabetes knowledge was delivered through an interactive eLearning program, the effectiveness of which was assessed using diabetes knowledge questionnaires which were deployed pre- and post-course delivery. Additionally, the participants' knowledge retention and confidence in caring for a student with diabetes were evaluated at 6 or 12 months post-intervention.A total of 124 public schools' personnel participated in the program. Post e-Learning delivery, diabetes knowledge increased significantly from baseline (p < 0.0001) and knowledge was retained over 6 and 12 months. Average of overall confidence scores in caring for students with diabetes was 61.86% in all items of care. RESULTS A total of 124 public schools' personnel participated in the program. Post e-Learning delivery, diabetes knowledge increased significantly from baseline (p < 0.0001) and knowledge was retained over 6 and 12 months. Average of overall confidence scores in caring for students with diabetes was 61.86% in all items of care.Offering eLearning diabetes education for school personnel increases their knowledge which can be retained for up to 12 months and imparts confidence in caring for students with diabetes. This novel approach of delivering diabetes education will help school personnel in managing students with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS Offering eLearning diabetes education for school personnel increases their knowledge which can be retained for up to 12 months and imparts confidence in caring for students with diabetes. This novel approach of delivering diabetes education will help school personnel in managing students with diabetes.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this report, written for the 40th anniversary issue of Medical Teacher, is to document 20 years of development of the Utrecht undergraduate medical curriculum, as both to exhibit accountability and to inform the community of the process and choices that can be made in long-term curriculum development. AIM The aim of this report, written for the 40th anniversary issue of Medical Teacher, is to document 20 years of development of the Utrecht undergraduate medical curriculum, as both to exhibit accountability and to inform the community of the process and choices that can be made in long-term curriculum development.We used the SPICES model, created by Medical Teacher's Editor Ronald Harden and colleagues in 1984. METHODS We used the SPICES model, created by Medical Teacher's Editor Ronald Harden and colleagues in 1984.The Utrecht six-year program, now called \"CRU+\", has many distinct features that were introduced, most of which are well documented. A limited selection includes  • A new 3+3 years Bachelor-Master structure following the EU Bologna rules leading to MD registration for cohorts of about 300.  • Horizontally integrated classroom teaching of basic sciences with clinical disciplines predominantly in groups of 12 and limited lectures.  • Mandatory knowledge retention tests, retesting the clinically relevant core knowledge from block tests of semesters one through four.  • Vertical integration not only linking clinical experience with background knowledge, but also exemplified by a stepwise increase in health care responsibilities throughout the curriculum.  • A final year focussing on growth towards the level of a primary responsible physician in a 12-week sub-internship for a limited number of patients and beds, in a chosen specialty. The student is called a semi-physician in the clerkship of this transitional year to residency.  • Teaching skills training for all medical graduates, an elective teaching rotation and various peer-teaching arrangements throughout the curriculum.  • Integrated semi-longitudinal clerkships with an assessment focus on entrustment decisions for Entrustable Professional Activities.

IMPORTANCE The instruction of dermatology can be challenging due to its large scope, heavy clinical nature, and limited curriculum space. Case-based learning (CBL) is an emerging education paradigm and has no current literature on its use in dermatology.Assess CBL in undergraduate dermatology medical education. OBJECTIVES Assess CBL in undergraduate dermatology medical education.Case-based learning was implemented in the preclerkship dermatology curriculum at the University of Toronto to 3 student cohorts (totaling 710 students and 93 tutors) between May 2016 and April 2017. We analyzed assignment performance, pre- and post-CBL knowledge test scores, and experience surveys on students and tutors. Surveys were evaluated using aggregate descriptive statistics for quantitative data and thematic data analysis for qualitative data. All assessments were anonymous and voluntary. METHODS Case-based learning was implemented in the preclerkship dermatology curriculum at the University of Toronto to 3 student cohorts (totaling 710 students and 93 tutors) between May 2016 and April 2017. We analyzed assignment performance, pre- and post-CBL knowledge test scores, and experience surveys on students and tutors. Surveys were evaluated using aggregate descriptive statistics for quantitative data and thematic data analysis for qualitative data. All assessments were anonymous and voluntary.We received strong positive feedback on the CBL experience, with no score less than 3.8 on a 5-point scale (where 5 indicated strongly agree with a positively phrased question). Thematic data analysis revealed several key themes, including positive comments for a specialist tutor, the use of visual media, and the \"mini-cases\" style of CBL, while challenges included a lack of motivation. Group assignments scored high, ranging from 88.9% to 99.3%. Tracked pre- and post-CBL knowledge test scores showed a 32% (from 42% to 74%) increase in scores after the CBL experience. Conclusion and Relevance: CBL in dermatology medical education was well received by students and tutors, with high scores in content evaluation and knowledge assessment. Future studies should examine optimal delivery methods and its long-term effects on knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "Workflow mapping can yield valuable results wherever complex processes are used. Some of its many benefits include knowledge retention, identification of inefficiencies, and more effective decision making. However, despite the promise of improved productivity and stewardship of library resources, tackling diagrams of complex and often long-unexamined workflows can seem too daunting a task to even attempt—at least without the right tool. This review takes a look at the robust features for flowchart creation offered by Lucidchart, a free online software that greatly reduces the challenges of constructing complicated diagrams. Lucidchart’s intuitive interface and built-in library of templates and design elements bring the benefits of visual mapping well within the reach of busy librarians and managers attempting to chart, understand, and streamline workflows in their units.",

    "Abstract": "Background To address unmet needs for family planning and advance women’s rights, US federal foreign aid recipients must ensure compliance with the family planning legislative and policy requirements. Because many health providers work in rural and remote settings, blended learning, which combines in-person and online experiences, is a promising approach for strengthening their compliance knowledge. Methods This cross-sectional study examined the effect of blended learning that included three components (online course, in-person training and conference call) on retention of family planning compliance knowledge. A total of 660 learners from 44 countries completed the online survey (8% response rate). Study participants were asked about their knowledge of family planning compliance and suggestions to improve their learning experiences. Findings Knowledge retention was higher in the group that utilised all three learning approaches compared with the online course plus conference call group (P<0.05). Participants who took the online course multiple times tended to retain knowledge better than respondents who took it only once, although this result was not statistically significant. Limitations The study relied on a convenience sample, which may contribute to bias. The response rate, while low at 8%, was representative of the user base, and included 660 respondents. Conclusion Participation in a blended learning training resulted in the highest gains in knowledge retention compared with online-only learning.

    "Abstract": "This study compared the efficacy of linguistically and dialectically localized animated educational videos (LAV) against traditional learning extension (TLE) presentations for learning gains of knowledge around agricultural- and healthcare-related topics within a rural population in Benin. While both approaches demonstrated learning gains, LAV resulted in significantly higher test scores and more detailed knowledge retention. A key contribution of this research, moreover, involves the use of mobile phone technologies to further disseminate educational information. That is, a majority of participants expressed both a preference for the LAV teaching approach and a heightened interest in digitally sharing the information from the educational animations with others. Because the animations are, by design, readily accessible to mobile phones via Africa’s explosively expanding digital infrastructure, this heightened interest in sharing the animated videos also transforms each study participant into a potential a learning node and point of dissemination for the educational video’s material as well.

    "Abstract": "Workflow mapping can yield valuable results wherever complex processes are used. Some of its many benefits include knowledge retention, identification of inefficiencies, and more effective decision making. However, despite the promise of improved productivity and stewardship of library resources, tackling diagrams of complex and often long-unexamined workflows can seem too daunting a task to even attempt-at least without the right tool. This review takes a look at the robust features for flowchart creation offered by Lucidchart, a free online software that greatly reduces the challenges of constructing complicated diagrams. Lucidchart's intuitive interface and built-in library of templates and design elements bring the benefits of visual mapping well within the reach of busy librarians and managers attempting to chart, understand, and streamline workflows in their units.",

    "Abstract": "Background A strategy to close the gap in relation to Indigenous health is the employment of more Indigenous health professionals. However, despite government reviews, research studies and educational initiatives, Indigenous students' retention and completion rates of tertiary education remains below those of non-Indigenous Australians. Objective To evaluate two enhancements to an Away-from-Base Bachelor of Midwifery program for Indigenous students, namely the appointment of an Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife to provide academic and cultural support and an additional clinical placement in a high-volume tertiary hospital. Method In this qualitative study, 10 Indigenous students enrolled in the Away-from-Base Bachelor of Midwifery program participated in one of two focus groups. Focus group transcriptions were subjected to a manual thematic analysis, and key themes were identified and explored. Findings The role of the Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife was highly valued as students had access to a resource who provided cultural and academic support, and who encouraged and advocated for them. Regular contact with the Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife enabled students to stay connected with and focussed on their study. Students were overwhelmingly positive about the opportunity to undertake the additional clinical placement, as it exposed them to complex clinical cases they may not have seen in their home communities. Conclusions The introduction of an Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife and an additional clinical placement in a high-volume tertiary hospital were perceived as valuable additions to the range of support mechanisms already in place for Indigenous Away-from-Base Bachelor of Midwifery students. These interventions have had a direct impact on retention, course progression and completion rates for Indigenous students.

BACKGROUND To address unmet needs for family planning and advance women's rights, US federal foreign aid recipients must ensure compliance with the family planning legislative and policy requirements. Because many health providers work in rural and remote settings, blended learning, which combines in-person and online experiences, is a promising approach for strengthening their compliance knowledge.This cross-sectional study examined the effect of blended learning that included three components (online course, in-person training and conference call) on retention of family planning compliance knowledge. A total of 660 learners from 44 countries completed the online survey (8% response rate). Study participants were asked about their knowledge of family planning compliance and suggestions to improve their learning experiences.

FINDINGS Knowledge retention was higher in the group that utilised all three learning approaches compared with the online course plus conference call group (P<0.05). Participants who took the online course multiple times tended to retain knowledge better than respondents who took it only once, although this result was not statistically significant.The study relied on a convenience sample, which may contribute to bias. The response rate, while low at 8%, was representative of the user base, and included 660 respondents. LIMITATIONS The study relied on a convenience sample, which may contribute to bias. The response rate, while low at 8%, was representative of the user base, and included 660 respondents.Participation in a blended learning training resulted in the highest gains in knowledge retention compared with online-only learning. These findings suggest that blended learning and repeat online trainings are critical to ensuring health professionals are aware of family planning compliance regulations. CONCLUSION Participation in a blended learning training resulted in the highest gains in knowledge retention compared with online-only learning. These findings suggest that blended learning and repeat online trainings are critical to ensuring health professionals are aware of family planning compliance regulations.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG Conservation professionals recognize the need to evaluate education initiatives with a flexible approach that is culturally appropriate. Cultural‐consensus theory (CCT) provides a framework for measuring the extent to which beliefs are communally held and has long been applied by social scientists. In a conservation‐education context, we applied CCT and used free lists (i.e., a list of items on a topic stated in order of cultural importance) and domain analysis (analysis of how free lists go together within a cultural group) to evaluate a conservation education program in which we used a children's picture book to increase knowledge about and empathy for a critically endangered mammal, the Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus). We extracted free lists of keywords generated by students (n = 580 in 18 schools) from essays they wrote before and after the education program. In 2 classroom sessions conducted approximately 18 weeks apart, we asked students to write an essay about their knowledge of the target species and then presented a book and several activities about slow loris ecology. Prior to the second session, we asked students to write a second essay. We generated free lists from both essays, quantified salience of terms used, and conducted minimal residuals factor analysis to determine presence of cultural domains surrounding slow lorises in each session. Students increased their use of words accurately associated with slow loris ecology and conservation from 43% in initial essays to 76% in final essays. Domain coherence increased from 22% to 47% across schools. Fifteen factors contributed to the domain slow loris. Between the first and second essays, factors that showed the greatest change were feeding ecology and slow loris as a forest protector, which increased 7‐fold, and the humancentric factor, which decreased 5‐fold. As demonstrated by knowledge retention and creation of unique stories and conservation opinions, children achieved all six levels of Bloom's taxonomy of learning domains. Free from the constraints of questionnaires and surveys, CCT methods provide a promising avenue to evaluate conservation education programs.",

    "Abstract": "The rate at which internet changes fast in turn changes most of business arena. As a result, most of the workers are exposed to new responsibilities and procedures at an ever-increasing rate to cope with the process and manage the changes. This implies that the workers need to be trained and retrained. Also, it would surely incur additional cost implications for the business. This paper avers that technology and processes are not agile and flexible enough to allow interoperability between the technology itself, people and process. Based on this, the paper applies a combination of process-centric, objective-centric and humancentric management theory of process change caused by smart era evolution and revolution in order to cope with technology agility and flexibility. The approach is applied to workflow orchestration in blacksmith industry and determines its development effort, knowledge spillover and knowledge retention on the course of interoperability using proximity approach. The approach is scalable and easy to apply to evaluate workflow development effort. The implication of this work is that interoperability and technology flexibility and its agility can be supported at management level and workflow effort can be estimated more precisely, helping to estimate the benefit of interoperability of workflow through the business process measurement.",

    "Abstract": "A central argument in the research on traditional knowledge, which persists in the scientific literature, is that the entrance of exotic plants in local medical systems is directly associated with acculturation. However, this logic has put an end for a long period to efforts to understand why such species have so successfully entered socio-ecological systems or even their real role in such systems. This study provides evidence that (1) in some socio-environmental contexts, exotic medicinal species usually confer greater adaptive advantages to local populations, and (2) despite their general importance, exotic species only excel in medical systems when cost-benefit ratio is favorable to them. Thus, in order to avoid the loss of knowledge about native plants and to ensure biocultural conservation, it is necessary to create strategies to amplify the advantages of these species.",

    "Abstract": "Aims and objectives To investigate the effectiveness of a multimethod venous thromboembolism prevention patient education plan on participants' knowledge retention. Background A potential complication of surgery requiring general anaesthesia, worldwide, is the development of life‐threatening venous thromboembolism. Patients need education on preventing, recognising and immediately responding to a suspected thromboembolism. Written instructional materials given to patients at discharge may be inadequate. Design A randomised controlled trial. Methods Setting was multiple general surgery units at a large Midwestern United States academic medical centre. Sample included patients recovering from surgery with general anaesthesia: ( N  = 66), 68% female, 34 = experimental, 32 = usual care. Prior to discharge, participants in the experimental group were given a multimethod venous thromboembolism prevention education plan including a video, pamphlet and verbal instruction; control group received usual instructional pamphlet. Both groups received a knowledge test immediately before instruction. Two weeks following discharge, a phone call was made to participants to complete the postinstruction test. The relevant EQUATOR guideline, CONSORT checklist, was used for reporting this study. Conclusions There were no statistically significant differences in age, gender, race, length of stay, surgery and history of venous thromboembolism among participants and group or test score results. No statistically significant difference in postinstruction score was found between groups. However, there was a trend in greater perception of importance in all groups and higher knowledge scores in the experimental group, with the percentage of participants in the experimental group answering all questions correctly rising from 38.2% correct to 73.5% correct. Relevance to clinical practice Teaching patients the importance of knowing venous thromboembolism signs and preventive/survival skills is potentially life‐saving and nurses must know the importance of using the most effective methods for the learning needs of their patients. Further research including different education methods and testing is suggested.",

    "Abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in India. Since community health workers (CHWs) have historically played a pivotal role in improving maternal and child health, it has been hypothesized that they have the potential to mitigate the impact of CVD in countries such as India. Project SEHAT is a cluster RCT to test the hypothesis that CHWs can improve the control of cardiovascular risk factors in a community in West Bengal, India. This study sought to quantitatively assess the training outcomes of CHWs recruited for Project SEHAT, and qualitatively assess their recruitment, training and fieldwork experiences. CHWs were recruited through a 2 step process- a written test and an interview. Upon completion of training, their knowledge and experiences were assessed. All intervention CHWs scored > 80% on the knowledge test, implying a high rate of knowledge retention. Important themes identified during a focus group discussion with CHWs included satisfaction with a 2 step recruitment process, emphasis on communication skills, a preference for audio-visual aids in training and recognition of the importance of a supportive supervisory framework. Respect from society and a positive impact on people was consistently cited as the most satisfying aspects of the job, followed by financial compensation. Recruitment and training processes for CHWs in CVD programs should be more standardized to enable replication, scalability and adequate assessment of their potential to mitigate CVD mortality in countries such as India.

    "Abstract": "Introduction We report on learning outcomes of a standardized national education program aimed at improving general practitioner ( GP ) knowledge about radiation therapy ( RT ) and referral pathways to radiation oncologists ( RO s). Methods In 2014, a GP education program was developed through the Targeting Cancer public awareness campaign of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists ( RANZCR ) Faculty of Radiation Oncology. The sessions were held in RT departments and comprised of RO ‐led case‐based group learning and a department tour. Pre‐ and immediate post‐session surveys assessed four domains: Objective knowledge about RT , understanding of referral pathways to RO s, self‐reported referral behaviours, feedback on the session. A 6‐month follow up survey assessed ongoing knowledge retention. Results Eighteen sessions were held nationwide between October 2014 and March 2016. One hundred and seventy‐four were surveyed. Pre‐session, 96% of GP s reported their knowledge of RT required improvement. Post‐session, 95% rated their knowledge as ‘excellent’, ‘above average’ or ‘competent’. 32.5% of GP s were not aware of the location of their local RT department. 81% reported patients would benefit from having clearer referral pathways to RO s. 96% agreed the GP 's role is to refer cancer patients to relevant specialists to discuss treatment options. However, only 49% were comfortable referring directly to an RO . Post‐session rose to 92%. All respondents felt the session improved their understanding of RT . In the follow up survey, 17 respondents (94%) reported the session had improved their ability to care for cancer patients. Conclusion A national GP education program improves GP knowledge about RT and may influence patient referrals for RT .",

    "Abstract": "Local and indigenous knowledge is being transformed globally, particularly being eroded when pertaining to ecology. In many parts of the world, rural and indigenous communities are facing tremendous cultural, economic and environmental changes, which contribute to weaken their local knowledge base. In the face of profound and ongoing environmental changes, both cultural and biological diversity are likely to be severely impacted as well as local resilience capacities from this loss. In this global literature review, we analyse the drivers of various types of local and indigenous ecological knowledge transformation and assess the directionality of the reported change. Results of this analysis show a global impoverishment of local and indigenous knowledge with 77% of papers reporting the loss of knowledge driven by globalization, modernization, and market integration. The recording of this loss, however, is not symmetrical, with losses being recorded more strongly in medicinal and ethnobotanical knowledge. Persistence of knowledge (15% of the studies) occurred in studies where traditional practices were being maintained consiously and where hybrid knowledge was being produced as a resut of certain types of incentives created by economic development. This review provides some insights into local and indigenous ecological knowledge change, its causes and implications, and recommends venues for the development of replicable and comparative research. The larger implication of these results is that because of the interconnection between cultural and biological diversity, the loss of local and indigenous knowledge is likely to critically threaten effective conservation of biodiversity, particularly in community-based conservation local efforts.",

    "Abstract": "This study compared the efficacy of linguistically and dialectically localized animated educational videos (LAV) against traditional learning extension (TLE) presentations for learning gains of knowledge around agricultural- and healthcare-related topics within a rural population in Benin. While both approaches demonstrated learning gains, LAV resulted in significantly higher test scores and more detailed knowledge retention. A key contribution of this research, moreover, involves the use of mobile phone technologies to further disseminate educational information. That is, a majority of participants expressed both a preference for the LAV teaching approach and a heightened interest in digitally sharing the information from the educational animations with others. Because the animations are, by design, readily accessible to mobile phones via Africa's explosively expanding digital infrastructure, this heightened interest in sharing the animated videos also transforms each study participant into a potential a learning node and point of dissemination for the educational video's material as well.",

    "Abstract": "Conservation professionals recognize the need to evaluate education initiatives with a flexible approach that is culturally appropriate. Cultural‐consensus theory (CCT) provides a framework for measuring the extent to which beliefs are communally held and has long been applied by social scientists. In a conservation‐education context, we applied CCT and used free lists (i.e., a list of items on a topic stated in order of cultural importance) and domain analysis (analysis of how free lists go together within a cultural group) to evaluate a conservation education program in which we used a children's picture book to increase knowledge about and empathy for a critically endangered mammal, the Javan slow loris ( Nycticebus javanicus ). We extracted free lists of keywords generated by students ( n = 580 in 18 schools) from essays they wrote before and after the education program. In 2 classroom sessions conducted approximately 18 weeks apart, we asked students to write an essay about their knowledge of the target species and then presented a book and several activities about slow loris ecology. Prior to the second session, we asked students to write a second essay. We generated free lists from both essays, quantified salience of terms used, and conducted minimal residuals factor analysis to determine presence of cultural domains surrounding slow lorises in each session. Students increased their use of words accurately associated with slow loris ecology and conservation from 43% in initial essays to 76% in final essays. Domain coherence increased from 22% to 47% across schools. Fifteen factors contributed to the domain slow loris. Between the first and second essays, factors that showed the greatest change were feeding ecology and slow loris as a forest protector, which increased 7‐fold, and the humancentric factor, which decreased 5‐fold. As demonstrated by knowledge retention and creation of unique stories and conservation opinions, children achieved all six levels of Bloom's taxonomy of learning domains. Free from the constraints of questionnaires and surveys, CCT methods provide a promising avenue to evaluate conservation education programs. Alternate abstract: Una Aplicación Novedosa de los Modelos de Consenso Cultural para Evaluar los Programas de Educación para la Conservación Los profesionales de la conservación reconocen la necesidad de evaluar las iniciativas de educación con una estrategia flexible que sea apropiada culturalmente. La teoría del consenso cultural (TCC) aporta un marco de trabajo para medir la extensión a la cual las creencias se mantienen comunalmente y se ha aplicado durante mucho tiempo por los científicos sociales. Aplicamos la TCC en un contexto de educación para la conservación y utilizamos listas gratuitas (es decir, una lista de puntos sobre un tema mencionados por importancia cultural) y análisis de dominio (el análisis de cómo las listas gratuitas van juntas dentro un grupo cultural) para evaluar un programa de educación para la conservación en el cual usamos un libro infantil de dibujos para incrementar el conocimiento sobre y la empatía hacia un mamífero en estado crítico de peligro de extinción: el loris lento de Java ( Nycticebus javanicus ). Extrajimos listas gratuitas de palabras clave generadas por los estudiantes ( n = 580 en 18 escuelas) a partir de ensayos escritos por ellos antes y después del programa educativo. En dos sesiones dentro del salón realizadas con aproximadamente 18 semanas entre ellas, les preguntamos a los estudiantes que escribieran un ensayo sobre su conocimiento de la especie objetivo y después presentamos un libro y varias actividades sobre la ecología del loris lento. Previo a la segunda sesión, les pedimos a los estudiantes que escribieran un segundo ensayo. Generamos listas gratuitas a partir de ambos ensayos, cuantificamos la prominencia de los términos utilizados, y realizamos un análisis de factor mínimo residual para determinar la presencia de los dominios culturales en torno a los loris lentos en cada sesión. Los estudiantes incrementaron el uso de las palabras asociadas correctamente con la ecología del loris lento y la conservación de un 43% en los ensayos iniciales a un 76% en los ensayos finales. La coherencia del dominio incrementó de 22% a 47% de manera global en las escuelas. Quince factores contribuyeron al dominio del loris lento. Entre el primer y el segundo ensayo, los factores que mostraron el mayor cambio fueron la ecología de la alimentación y el loris lento como protector del bosque, los cuales incrementaron siete veces, y el factor humano‐céntrico, el cual disminuyó cinco veces. Como se demostró con la retención del conocimiento y la creación de historias únicas y opiniones sobre la conservación, los niños adquirieron los seis niveles de dominio del aprendizaje de la taxonomía de Bloom. Libre de las restricciones de los cuestionarios y las encuestas, los métodos de la TCC aportan una vía prometedora para evaluar los programas de educación para la conservación.",

    "Abstract": "Aims and objectives: To investigate the effectiveness of a multimethod venous thromboembolism prevention patient education plan on participants’ knowledge retention. Background: A potential complication of surgery requiring general anaesthesia, worldwide, is the development of life-threatening venous thromboembolism. Patients need education on preventing, recognising and immediately responding to a suspected thromboembolism. Written instructional materials given to patients at discharge may be inadequate. Design: A randomised controlled trial. Methods: Setting was multiple general surgery units at a large Midwestern United States academic medical centre. Sample included patients recovering from surgery with general anaesthesia: ( N = 66), 68% female, 34 = experimental, 32 = usual care. Prior to discharge, participants in the experimental group were given a multimethod venous thromboembolism prevention education plan including a video, pamphlet and verbal instruction; control group received usual instructional pamphlet. Both groups received a knowledge test immediately before instruction. Two weeks following discharge, a phone call was made to participants to complete the postinstruction test. The relevant EQUATOR guideline, CONSORT checklist, was used for reporting this study. Conclusions: There were no statistically significant differences in age, gender, race, length of stay, surgery and history of venous thromboembolism among participants and group or test score results. No statistically significant difference in postinstruction score was found between groups. However, there was a trend in greater perception of importance in all groups and higher knowledge scores in the experimental group, with the percentage of participants in the experimental group answering all questions correctly rising from 38.2% correct to 73.5% correct. Relevance to clinical practice: Teaching patients the importance of knowing venous thromboembolism signs and preventive/survival skills is potentially life-saving and nurses must know the importance of using the most effective methods for the learning needs of their patients. Further research including different education methods and testing is suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "Video education has many advantages over traditional education including efficiency, convenience, and individualized learning. Learning sterile surgical technique (SST) is imperative for medical students, because proper technique helps prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). We hypothesize that video education is at least as effective as traditional skill demonstration in teaching first-year medical students SST. BACKGROUND Video education has many advantages over traditional education including efficiency, convenience, and individualized learning. Learning sterile surgical technique (SST) is imperative for medical students, because proper technique helps prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). We hypothesize that video education is at least as effective as traditional skill demonstration in teaching first-year medical students SST.A video series was created to demonstrate SST ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcRU-gvOmxE2mwMWkowouBkxGXkLZ8Uis ). A randomized controlled trial was designed to assess which education method best teaches SST: video education or skill demonstration. First-year medical students (n = 129) were consented and randomly assigned into two groups: those who attended a skill demonstration (control group; n = 70) and those who watched the video series (experimental group; n = 59). The control group attended a pre-existing 90-minute nurse educator-led skill demonstration. Participants then completed a 30-item multiple choice quiz to test their knowledge. Each group then received the alternate education method and completed a 23-item follow-up survey to determine their preferred method.

Each group then received the alternate education method and completed a 23-item follow-up survey to determine their preferred method.Seven 2- to 6-minute videos (30 minutes total) were created on surgical attire, scrubbing, gowning and gloving, and maintaining sterility. The experimental group (n = 51) scored higher on the quiz compared with the control group (n = 63) (88% ± 1% versus 72% ± 1%; p < 0.0001). Students preferred the videos when it came to convenience, accessibility, efficiency, and review, and preferred the skill demonstration when it came to knowledge retention, preparedness, and ease of completion. RESULTS Seven 2- to 6-minute videos (30 minutes total) were created on surgical attire, scrubbing, gowning and gloving, and maintaining sterility.

Students identified strengths to each method of teaching. Video education can augment medical students' knowledge prior to their operating room experience to ensure that a sterile environment is maintained for patients. The ultimate goal is to reduce SSIs.

    "Abstract": "A strategy to close the gap in relation to Indigenous health is the employment of more Indigenous health professionals. However, despite government reviews, research studies and educational initiatives, Indigenous students' retention and completion rates of tertiary education remains below those of non-Indigenous Australians. BACKGROUND A strategy to close the gap in relation to Indigenous health is the employment of more Indigenous health professionals. However, despite government reviews, research studies and educational initiatives, Indigenous students' retention and completion rates of tertiary education remains below those of non-Indigenous Australians.To evaluate two enhancements to an Away-from-Base Bachelor of Midwifery program for Indigenous students, namely the appointment of an Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife to provide academic and cultural support and an additional clinical placement in a high-volume tertiary hospital. OBJECTIVE To evaluate two enhancements to an Away-from-Base Bachelor of Midwifery program for Indigenous students, namely the appointment of an Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife to provide academic and cultural support and an additional clinical placement in a high-volume tertiary hospital.In this qualitative study, 10 Indigenous students enrolled in the Away-from-Base Bachelor of Midwifery program participated in one of two focus groups. Focus group transcriptions were subjected to a manual thematic analysis, and key themes were identified and explored. METHOD In this qualitative study, 10 Indigenous students enrolled in the Away-from-Base Bachelor of Midwifery program participated in one of two focus groups. Focus group transcriptions were subjected to a manual thematic analysis, and key themes were identified and explored.The role of the Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife was highly valued as students had access to a resource who provided cultural and academic support, and who encouraged and advocated for them. Regular contact with the Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife enabled students to stay connected with and focussed on their study. Students were overwhelmingly positive about the opportunity to undertake the additional clinical placement, as it exposed them to complex clinical cases they may not have seen in their home communities. FINDINGS The role of the Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife was highly valued as students had access to a resource who provided cultural and academic support, and who encouraged and advocated for them. Regular contact with the Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife enabled students to stay connected with and focussed on their study. Students were overwhelmingly positive about the opportunity to undertake the additional clinical placement, as it exposed them to complex clinical cases they may not have seen in their home communities.The introduction of an Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife and an additional clinical placement in a high-volume tertiary hospital were perceived as valuable additions to the range of support mechanisms already in place for Indigenous Away-from-Base Bachelor of Midwifery students. These interventions have had a direct impact on retention, course progression and completion rates for Indigenous students. Students expressed enhanced clinical learning and knowledge retention as a result of the additional clinical placement, and the Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife provided culturally sensitive support for students undertaking remote learning, and during on-campus intensive sessions. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of an Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife and an additional clinical placement in a high-volume tertiary hospital were perceived as valuable additions to the range of support mechanisms already in place for Indigenous Away-from-Base Bachelor of Midwifery students.

    "Abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in India. Since community health workers (CHWs) have historically played a pivotal role in improving maternal and child health, it has been hypothesized that they have the potential to mitigate the impact of CVD in countries such as India. Project SEHAT is a cluster RCT to test the hypothesis that CHWs can improve the control of cardiovascular risk factors in a community in West Bengal, India. This study sought to quantitatively assess the training outcomes of CHWs recruited for Project SEHAT, and qualitatively assess their recruitment, training and fieldwork experiences. CHWs were recruited through a 2 step process- a written test and an interview. Upon completion of training, their knowledge and experiences were assessed. All intervention CHWs scored > 80% on the knowledge test, implying a high rate of knowledge retention. Important themes identified during a focus group discussion with CHWs included satisfaction with a 2 step recruitment process, emphasis on communication skills, a preference for audio-visual aids in training and recognition of the importance of a supportive supervisory framework. Respect from society and a positive impact on people was consistently cited as the most satisfying aspects of the job, followed by financial compensation. Recruitment and training processes for CHWs in CVD programs should be more standardized to enable replication, scalability and adequate assessment of their potential to mitigate CVD mortality in countries such as India.Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in India.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To investigate the effectiveness of a multimethod venous thromboembolism prevention patient education plan on participants' knowledge retention.A potential complication of surgery requiring general anaesthesia, worldwide, is the development of life-threatening venous thromboembolism. Patients need education on preventing, recognising and immediately responding to a suspected thromboembolism. Written instructional materials given to patients at discharge may be inadequate. BACKGROUND A potential complication of surgery requiring general anaesthesia, worldwide, is the development of life-threatening venous thromboembolism. Patients need education on preventing, recognising and immediately responding to a suspected thromboembolism. Written instructional materials given to patients at discharge may be inadequate.A randomised controlled trial. DESIGN A randomised controlled trial.Setting was multiple general surgery units at a large Midwestern United States academic medical centre. Sample included patients recovering from surgery with general anaesthesia: (N = 66), 68% female, 34 = experimental, 32 = usual care. Prior to discharge, participants in the experimental group were given a multimethod venous thromboembolism prevention education plan including a video, pamphlet and verbal instruction; control group received usual instructional pamphlet. Both groups received a knowledge test immediately before instruction. Two weeks following discharge, a phone call was made to participants to complete the postinstruction test. The relevant EQUATOR guideline, CONSORT checklist, was used for reporting this study. METHODS Setting was multiple general surgery units at a large Midwestern United States academic medical centre.

No statistically significant difference in postinstruction score was found between groups. However, there was a trend in greater perception of importance in all groups and higher knowledge scores in the experimental group, with the percentage of participants in the experimental group answering all questions correctly rising from 38.2% correct to 73.5% correct.

    "Abstract": "We report on learning outcomes of a standardized national education program aimed at improving general practitioner (GP) knowledge about radiation therapy (RT) and referral pathways to radiation oncologists (ROs). INTRODUCTION We report on learning outcomes of a standardized national education program aimed at improving general practitioner (GP) knowledge about radiation therapy (RT) and referral pathways to radiation oncologists (ROs).In 2014, a GP education program was developed through the Targeting Cancer public awareness campaign of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) Faculty of Radiation Oncology. The sessions were held in RT departments and comprised of RO-led case-based group learning and a department tour. Pre- and immediate post-session surveys assessed four domains: Objective knowledge about RT, understanding of referral pathways to ROs, self-reported referral behaviours, feedback on the session. A 6-month follow up survey assessed ongoing knowledge retention. METHODS In 2014, a GP education program was developed through the Targeting Cancer public awareness campaign of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) Faculty of Radiation Oncology. The sessions were held in RT departments and comprised of RO-led case-based group learning and a department tour. Pre- and immediate post-session surveys assessed four domains: Objective knowledge about RT, understanding of referral pathways to ROs, self-reported referral behaviours, feedback on the session. A 6-month follow up survey assessed ongoing knowledge retention.Eighteen sessions were held nationwide between October 2014 and March 2016. One hundred and seventy-four were surveyed. Pre-session, 96% of GPs reported their knowledge of RT required improvement. Post-session, 95% rated their knowledge as 'excellent', 'above average' or 'competent'. 32.5% of GPs were not aware of the location of their local RT department. 81% reported patients would benefit from having clearer referral pathways to ROs. 96% agreed the GP's role is to refer cancer patients to relevant specialists to discuss treatment options. However, only 49% were comfortable referring directly to an RO. Post-session rose to 92%. All respondents felt the session improved their understanding of RT. In the follow up survey, 17 respondents (94%) reported the session had improved their ability to care for cancer patients. RESULTS Eighteen sessions were held nationwide between October 2014 and March 2016. One hundred and seventy-four were surveyed. Pre-session, 96% of GPs reported their knowledge of RT required improvement. Post-session, 95% rated their knowledge as 'excellent', 'above average' or 'competent'. 32.5% of GPs were not aware of the location of their local RT department. 81% reported patients would benefit from having clearer referral pathways to ROs. 96% agreed the GP's role is to refer cancer patients to relevant specialists to discuss treatment options. However, only 49% were comfortable referring directly to an RO. Post-session rose to 92%. All respondents felt the session improved their understanding of RT. In the follow up survey, 17 respondents (94%) reported the session had improved their ability to care for cancer patients.A national GP education program improves GP knowledge about RT and may influence patient referrals for RT. CONCLUSION A national GP education program improves GP knowledge about RT and may influence patient referrals for RT.",

    "Abstract": "Conservation professionals recognize the need to evaluate education initiatives with a flexible approach that is culturally appropriate. Cultural-consensus theory (CCT) provides a framework for measuring the extent to which beliefs are communally held and has long been applied by social scientists. In a conservation-education context, we applied CCT and used free lists (i.e., a list of items on a topic stated in order of cultural importance) and domain analysis (analysis of how free lists go together within a cultural group) to evaluate a conservation education program in which we used a children's picture book to increase knowledge about and empathy for a critically endangered mammal, the Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus). We extracted free lists of keywords generated by students (n = 580 in 18 schools) from essays they wrote before and after the education program. In 2 classroom sessions conducted approximately 18 weeks apart, we asked students to write an essay about their knowledge of the target species and then presented a book and several activities about slow loris ecology. Prior to the second session, we asked students to write a second essay. We generated free lists from both essays, quantified salience of terms used, and conducted minimal residuals factor analysis to determine presence of cultural domains surrounding slow lorises in each session. Students increased their use of words accurately associated with slow loris ecology and conservation from 43% in initial essays to 76% in final essays. Domain coherence increased from 22% to 47% across schools. Fifteen factors contributed to the domain slow loris. Between the first and second essays, factors that showed the greatest change were feeding ecology and slow loris as a forest protector, which increased 7-fold, and the humancentric factor, which decreased 5-fold. As demonstrated by knowledge retention and creation of unique stories and conservation opinions, children achieved all six levels of Bloom's taxonomy of learning domains. Free from the constraints of questionnaires and surveys, CCT methods provide a promising avenue to evaluate conservation education programs.Conservation professionals recognize the need to evaluate education initiatives with a flexible approach that is culturally appropriate.
