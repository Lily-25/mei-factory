Abstract: Diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) is the leading cause of nontraumatic amputations in people with diabetes. Research shows that improving patient awareness can result in short-term improvements, but Cochrane reviews report insufficient high-quality evidence. Background Diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) is the leading cause of nontraumatic amputations in people with diabetes. Research shows that improving patient awareness can result in short-term improvements, but Cochrane reviews report insufficient high-quality evidence.This study aims to investigate the effects of multimedia presentation and smartphone alerts to enhance long-term knowledge and foot care behaviors in individuals at moderate-to-high risk of DFU. Objective This study aims to investigate the effects of multimedia presentation and smartphone alerts to enhance long-term knowledge and foot care behaviors in individuals at moderate-to-high risk of DFU.Participants were randomized to a control group, receiving usual diabetic foot care advice (n=40), or an intervention group, receiving a multimedia diabetic foot care presentation and regular "foot alerts" through the MyU smartphone app on top of usual care (n=37). Patient's knowledge and behaviors related to diabetic foot care were assessed at baseline and after 12 months. Repeated measures ANOVA was conducted in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness. Methods Participants were randomized to a control group, receiving usual diabetic foot care advice (n=40), or an intervention group, receiving a multimedia diabetic foot care presentation and regular "foot alerts" through the MyU smartphone app on top of usual care (n=37). Patient's knowledge and behaviors related to diabetic foot care were assessed at baseline and after 12 months. Repeated measures ANOVA was conducted in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness.The findings were consistent across intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. In the intervention group, the number of podiatry visits was positively correlated with improved foot care behavior (r=0.408; P=.02), while the control group showed a negative correlation (r=-0.402; P=.02). No significant correlations were observed with knowledge scores. Although no significant time×group interactions were seen, the main effects of time were found for both knowledge (η²=0.12; P=.004) and behavior scores (η²=0.31; P<.001). Post hoc analysis showed a decline in knowledge scores in the control group (Cohen d=-0.24; P=.007) and improvements in behavior scores in both groups (Cohen d: intervention=0.61, control=0.63; all P<.001). Results The findings were consistent across intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. In the intervention group, the number of podiatry visits was positively correlated with improved foot care behavior (r=0.408; P=.02), while the control group showed a negative correlation (r=-0.402; P=.02).

Post hoc analysis showed a decline in knowledge scores in the control group (Cohen d=-0.24; P=.007) and improvements in behavior scores in both groups (Cohen d: intervention=0.61, control=0.63; all P<.001).The MyU app-based multimedia intervention was associated with improved foot care behaviors over 12 months, indicating potential benefits as an adjunct to usual diabetic foot care. However, no significant changes in diabetic foot care knowledge were observed. These findings suggest that while the applied digital multimedia tool may support behavior change, further research is needed to enhance knowledge retention and clinical impact. The study revealed that multimedia education alone may not be effective for long-term improvement in foot self-care knowledge and behavior among individuals at moderate-high DFU risk, but the reinforcement of educational material during follow-up podiatry visits could be effective.

Abstract: Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future human poses at different moments according to observed past motion sequences. Previous approaches mainly treated the prediction of different temporal moments as a single prediction task and learned the predictions of varied moments simultaneously, which would encounter a main limitation: the learning of short term predictions (referring to "near-future" prediction) could be hindered by the predictions of long-term (referring to "far future" prediction) motions. In this paper, we develop a novel temporal continual learning framework called Continual Prior Compensation (CPC) to progressively train HMP models, in which we divide the prediction task of motions corresponding to varied temporal moments into several subtasks and train the model in a multi-stage manner. To mitigate the prior information forgetting in the progressive training, we further introduce a learnable random variable Prior Compensation Factor (PCF) to explicitly measure the prior knowledge loss. We theoretically show that the PCF can be efficiently learned together with the model parameters by minimizing a reasonable upper bound of the objective function. The proposed CPC is further enhanced to estimate the prior information loss for each subtask and a new framework called Continual Prior Compensation++ (CPC++) with Fine-Grained Prior Compensation Factor (FGPCF) is finally developed. Our CPC and CPC++ frameworks are quite flexible and can be easily integrated with different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications. Extensive experiments on three HMP benchmark datasets using multiple SOTA HMPbackbones (PGBIG, siMLPe, MotionMixer, and LTD) demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our frameworks.Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future human poses at different moments according to observed past motion sequences.

Abstract: Neurosurgical education relies on rigorous training to help learners develop technical proficiency and neuroanatomical comprehension. Traditional teaching methods, such as cadaveric dissections and live surgical observations, face limitations associated with accessibility, cost, and ethical concerns. Mixed reality (MR), an emerging technology within extended reality, offers an interactive and immersive approach to surgical training. This review examines the effectiveness of MR in neurosurgical education through established adult learning theories, aiming to determine the optimal integration model for enhancing trainee skill acquisition and knowledge retention.

Mixed reality (MR), an emerging technology within extended reality, offers an interactive and immersive approach to surgical training. This review examines the effectiveness of MR in neurosurgical education through established adult learning theories, aiming to determine the optimal integration model for enhancing trainee skill acquisition and knowledge retention.A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane databases was conducted. The search included studies of MR applications in neurosurgical education aligned with adult learning theories. A total of 341 articles were identified, with 18 meeting the inclusion criteria after screening. Studies were categorized based on their integration of adult learning theories, including experiential learning, constructivism, behaviorism, cognitivism, and self-directed learning. Data extraction focused on MR applications, assessment metrics, and performance improvements among trainees.

Experiential learning was the most frequently applied model (18 studies), followed by constructivism (15 studies), behaviorism (7 studies), and cognitivism (6 studies). Studies on cranial procedures demonstrated enhanced spatial cognition and motor skills, whereas studies exploring spinal procedures, such as pedicle screw placement, showed increased precision and greater trainee confidence. Although no studies explicitly emphasized andragogy or connectivism, MR's integration of feedback mechanisms and real-time simulation was found to facilitate skill refinement and knowledge retention.

Abstract: To assess whether the Thyroid Informed Surgical Consent Augmenting Video (TISCAV) improves knowledge retention, reduces decisional conflict, alleviates anxiety, and enhances satisfaction in thyroidectomy decision-making compared to standard verbal consent. OBJECTIVE To assess whether the Thyroid Informed Surgical Consent Augmenting Video (TISCAV) improves knowledge retention, reduces decisional conflict, alleviates anxiety, and enhances satisfaction in thyroidectomy decision-making compared to standard verbal consent.Randomized controlled trial. STUDY DESIGN Randomized controlled trial.Academic tertiary care center with urban outpatient and community-based clinics. SETTING Academic tertiary care center with urban outpatient and community-based clinics.Forty-nine English-speaking adults scheduled for thyroid surgery were randomized to receive either standard verbal consent alone (control) or TISCAV followed by standard consent (intervention). Forty-three completed preoperative assessments and were included in the analysis. Knowledge was assessed before and after consent. Visual Analog Scale for Anxiety (VAS-A), Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), and Satisfaction with Decision Scale (SDS) were measured preoperatively; SDS, Decision Regret Scale (DRS), and anxiety were reassessed at 22 and 100 days postoperatively. METHODS Forty-nine English-speaking adults scheduled for thyroid surgery were randomized to receive either standard verbal consent alone (control) or TISCAV followed by standard consent (intervention). Forty-three completed preoperative assessments and were included in the analysis. Knowledge was assessed before and after consent. Visual Analog Scale for Anxiety (VAS-A), Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), and Satisfaction with Decision Scale (SDS) were measured preoperatively; SDS, Decision Regret Scale (DRS), and anxiety were reassessed at 22 and 100 days postoperatively.Both groups demonstrated significant knowledge gains post-consent (P < .0001), with no significant difference between groups (P = .1812). Patients with malignant/suspicious cytopathology had lower decisional conflict than those with benign findings (P = .03); scores in indeterminate cases trended similarly (P = .11). Among patients with indeterminate cytopathology, decisional conflict did not differ significantly (P = .06), while preoperative satisfaction was lower in the video group (P = .02); group differences resolved postoperatively (P ≥ .55). RESULTS Both groups demonstrated significant knowledge gains post-consent (P < .0001), with no significant difference between groups (P = .1812). Patients with malignant/suspicious cytopathology had lower decisional conflict than those with benign findings (P = .03); scores in indeterminate cases trended similarly (P = .11). Among patients with indeterminate cytopathology, decisional conflict did not differ significantly (P = .06), while preoperative satisfaction was lower in the video group (P = .02); group differences resolved postoperatively (P ≥ .55).TISCAV and standard consent both improved knowledge acquisition. While video-based consent may transiently increase decisional conflict and reduce satisfaction among patients with indeterminate pathology, these effects did not persist postoperatively. Video tools may serve as a safe and accessible adjunct to verbal consent. CONCLUSION TISCAV and standard consent both improved knowledge acquisition. While video-based consent may transiently increase decisional conflict and reduce satisfaction among patients with indeterminate pathology, these effects did not persist postoperatively. Video tools may serve as a safe and accessible adjunct to verbal consent.

Abstract: Debates have emerged as an active learning strategy in pharmacy education, aiming to enhance critical thinking, communication, engagement, and knowledge acquisition. This review aims to broadly identify and describe debate activities implemented in U.S. Doctor of Pharmacy programs, characterize their design and assessment methods, summarize reported effectiveness on learning and skill development, and identify themes and gaps to inform best practices. BACKGROUND Debates have emerged as an active learning strategy in pharmacy education, aiming to enhance critical thinking, communication, engagement, and knowledge acquisition. This review aims to broadly identify and describe debate activities implemented in U.S. Doctor of Pharmacy programs, characterize their design and assessment methods, summarize reported effectiveness on learning and skill development, and identify themes and gaps to inform best practices.A scoping review identified 13 studies conducted in U.S. pharmacy programs that integrated debate activities. Most were implemented in third- and fourth-year coursework, frequently using Lincoln-Douglas or modified formats. Outcomes evaluated included student confidence, skill development, engagement, and knowledge retention, assessed through subjective and objective measures. METHODS A scoping review identified 13 studies conducted in U.S. pharmacy programs that integrated debate activities. Most were implemented in third- and fourth-year coursework, frequently using Lincoln-Douglas or modified formats. Outcomes evaluated included student confidence, skill development, engagement, and knowledge retention, assessed through subjective and objective measures.Students consistently reported that debates strengthened confidence in critical thinking, analytical reasoning, and oral communication. Several studies demonstrated significant knowledge gains from pre- to post-debate; however, when compared with alternative methods such as lectures or Journal Clubs, debates were generally non-inferior for knowledge retention. Students valued debates for their engaging format and perceived skill-building benefits. Reported challenges included time demands, logistical complexity, and variability in assessment methods. The lack of standardized evaluation tools limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about effectiveness.

Current evidence, however, relies heavily on self-reported outcomes and limited objective measures. Future research should emphasize standardized implementation, development of reliable assessment instruments, and rigorous comparisons with other instructional strategies to clarify the educational impact of debates in pharmacy education.

Abstract: This study evaluated the effectiveness of three retrieval practice strategies: re-solving virtual patient (VP) cases, answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and answering short answer questions (SAQs), on long-term memory retention of medical students using a VP simulation platform. OBJECTIVES This study evaluated the effectiveness of three retrieval practice strategies: re-solving virtual patient (VP) cases, answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and answering short answer questions (SAQs), on long-term memory retention of medical students using a VP simulation platform.Eighty fifth-year medical students participated in a stratified randomized trial conducted in three phases. In the initial learning phase, participants completed a 14-item baseline test (seven MCQs and seven SAQs) to assess prior knowledge and enable stratified randomization. They then engaged with two clinical cases using the Paciente 360 ® VP platform. One week later, participants were randomly assigned to one of three retrieval practice conditions: re-solving the original VP cases, answering 24 related MCQs, or answering 24 related SAQs. Six weeks after the intervention, participants completed a 40-item retention test (20 MCQs and 20 SAQs), which included both previously encountered and novel questions to assess long-term retention and transfer of learning.

No significant differences were observed between performance on repeated versus novel questions or between MCQs and SAQs. RESULTS Participants in the SAQ condition demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in performance over time, while those in the re-solving the virtual case and MCQ conditions maintained their knowledge levels. No significant differences were observed between performance on repeated versus novel questions or between MCQs and SAQs.Retrieval practice using VP simulations supports knowledge retention, with SAQs yielding the greatest improvement from baseline. Comparable performance on repeated and novel questions suggests that retrieval practice may also promote transfer of learning to new clinical scenarios. CONCLUSIONS Retrieval practice using VP simulations supports knowledge retention, with SAQs yielding the greatest improvement from baseline. Comparable performance on repeated and novel questions suggests that retrieval practice may also promote transfer of learning to new clinical scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of digital education, including mobile learning (mLearning), is transforming the training of future health professionals, offering advantages such as improved accessibility, timeliness, and affordability. While mLearning enhances clinical training by providing flexible access to information and supporting practical skills development, challenges such as inadequate resources and resistance from staff and patients need to be addressed for successful integration. This review aims to explore the factors for successful adoption of mLearning in clinical placements, providing valuable insights to inform best practices in its implementation. A scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Arksey and O'Malley and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology was applied. Searching 6 electronic databases plus manual searching returned 5178 articles, with 76 articles included in analysis. All studies were published between 2008 and 2024, with a significant proportion originating from Canada (n = 12), the United States (n = 12), the United Kingdom (n = 11), and Australia (n = 11). The majority of the studies involved nursing (n = 47) and medical (n = 24) students. The analysis revealed 6 facilitators and 6 barriers. It identified positive attitudes toward mobile applications, highlighting their role in enhancing education in clinical environment, organizing training, and improving patient care. However, barriers such as the absence of regulations, ethical concerns, and technical issues were also noted, along with the need to address information literacy and skills. Mapping research regarding facilitators and barriers for introducing mobile learning technologies into undergraduate education in clinical environment has helped in creating a set of solutions which are capable to ensure the success and sustainability of mLearning. These solutions should be considered at the innovation's design, implementation, and post-implementation stages to guarantee its effectiveness in education in clinical environments. This may help to enhance the learning experience, improve knowledge retention, and develop clinical skills, while providing a cost-effective solution for clinical training programs for healthcare professions. This, in turn, has positive implications for quality of care provided.The increasing adoption of digital education, including mobile learning (mLearning), is transforming the training of future health professionals, offering advantages such as improved accessibility, timeliness, and affordability.

Abstract: Medical educators should understand the differences within the medical student population, including gender. Research on gender effects on learning and skill acquisition has yielded contradictory results, particularly in anatomy learning among undergraduate medical students. While various dissection course settings have been evaluated, gender-specific differences have largely been overlooked. This study examined gender differences in several aspects of anatomy education. First, the ability of undergraduate medical students to identify anatomical structures was assessed to determine gender differences in learning gains. Second, learning outcomes were compared between a 3-month and a 1-month regional anatomy course, with attention to gender. Third, knowledge retention was evaluated at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Finally, student perceptions of different embalming methods for anatomy learning were assessed with a focus on gender. Minor differences were observed between genders across different regions in learning gains. Scores from the 3-month course were higher than those from the 1-month course, regardless of gender, particularly for the neck, thorax, and abdomen. A significant knowledge gain was noted in abdominal anatomy at the 6- and 12-month follow-up: scores improved by 56% in females and by 68% in males. The comparison of Thiel- versus ethanol-based embalming revealed gender differences regarding tissue pliability and the utility of tissues for achieving learning objectives. In conclusion, subtle differences appear to exist between female and male students in terms of perceptions and learning outcomes in gross anatomy dissection courses. These findings will be useful in developing new curricula for undergraduate medical students, taking into account gender differences in the context of regional anatomy dissection courses.

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of digital simulation‐based training (DSBT) for acquiring complex knowledge and skills. After identifying key aspects of DSBT, it explains how they were used to design a new DSBT activity with Minecraft Education® for teaching agile project management to dispersed students. It then presents a theoretically grounded model that links these key aspects of DSBT to learning perceptions. The model was tested over a 3‐year period through an online survey administered to groups of students who had participated in the new DSBT activity in a project management course. The findings show that two learning‐related beliefs, involvement and enjoyment, are crucial to the success of DSBT, and they offer valuable insights into the acquisition of these beliefs. The findings should be useful to educators and human resource professionals interested in integrating DSBT into their teaching and training practices. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? - Digital simulation‐based training (DSBT) enhances learning and knowledge retention. - Experiential activities have been used effectively at business schools to teach complex managerial skills. - Learning involvement and enjoyment have been shown to be crucial to successful learning outcomes. What this paper adds? - A theoretically grounded model linking DSBT to learning perceptions, particularly for teaching agile project management (APM) using Minecraft Education®. - Empirical evidence for the important role of factors such as psychological safety, task interdependence and content relevance in shaping student involvement and enjoyment when DSBT is used. - Insights into the unique challenges and opportunities related to implementing DSBT for remote learners. Implications for practice and/or policy - Educators and practitioners can leverage the study findings to design effective DSBT courses and programmes that enhance both individual and collaborative learning experiences. - Especially in remote learning contexts, they should strive to maintain focus and clarity while at the same time creating a psychologically safe learning environment. - Incorporating real‐world scenarios into DSBT enhances learner engagement and ensures the applicability of knowledge and skills to real‐world settings.

Abstract: Background As medicine advances and preclinical learning phases are shortened, medical students face an increasingly information-dense curriculum. At the University of Michigan Medical School (UMMS) – where the preclinical curriculum is largely lecture-based and asynchronous over a 12 month period– local web-based resources have enhanced student engagement and knowledge retention in several content areas. However, no such learning resource exists for preclinical Infectious Disease (ID)/Microbiology. To fill this gap, we used Kern’s approach to curriculum development as part of the tool design process, starting with a targeted needs assessment. Medical Students' Preferred Topics Methods We designed an anonymous survey with Likert-scale items to assess student satisfaction with, preparedness for clinical application of, and interest in supplemental resources for the ID/Microbiology content. Students were also asked to choose preferred features for an online learning tool. Results Fifty-three medical students in the 2nd through 4th years responded (10% response rate). Only 62% of students reported being at least partially satisfied with opportunities to apply their ID knowledge in the pre-clinical curriculum. In terms of clinical readiness, 55% felt at least somewhat prepared to diagnose infections, while only 17% felt at least somewhat prepared to propose initial treatment plans for infections. Notably, 94% of respondents expressed interest in a web-based ID supplement, with their feedback informing specific components for inclusion in the proposed tool (Figure 1). Conclusion This needs assessment highlights significant gapsin students’ preparation to apply ID/Microbiology knowledge in a clinical context and affirms student interest in an interactive web-based tool to address this need. We have used Kern’s steps to design MicroModules, asynchronous case-based modules that emphasize clinical reasoning and the application of microbiology in a clinical context. Following implementationthis year, formative and summative evaluations will be used to refine the tool and assess its impact on learner self-efficacy and academic performance. This approach ensures MicroModules is learner-centered and aligned with evolving educational needs. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures

Abstract: Background Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective at preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and reduces risk of transmission up to 99% when taken optimally. 1 However, only 30% of eligible patients in U.S. received PrEP in 2020. 2 While over 90% of primary care physicians (PCPs) have an awareness of PrEP, less than half have prescribed or referred out for PrEP. 7-9 Lack of knowledge with managing PrEP has been noted as a major barrier to prescription for PCPs specifically. 4, 5 This may result in fewer prescriptions for eligible patients, especially amongst trainees. This quality improvement (QI) project aimed to assess internal medicine resident PrEP prescribing competency and comfort before and after educational intervention designed to facilitate appropriate PrEP prescription in accordance with USPSTF guidelines. Methods Second- and third-year internal medicine residents completed an hour-long didactic course reviewing the purpose, mechanism of action, side effects and eligibility criteria of PrEP. Residents completed pre-, post- (1-month), and follow-up (6-month) intervention surveys to characterize prescribing competency and comfort using Likert scales. Out of a residency cohort of 45 trainees, 25 completed the pre-intervention survey, and 15 completed the post-intervention survey. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon’s Signed-Rank test. Results Following our intervention, residents felt significantly more confident in their knowledge of PrEP mechanism of action (p=0.001), side effect profile (p = 0.001) and eligibility criteria (p =0.002), as well as significantly more comfortable prescribing PrEP (p=0.007). The most common barrier cited to PrEP prescription was lack of knowledge with additional concerns regarding possible cost to the patient or lack of preceptor support. Conclusion While this QI project was limited by small sample size, it emphasizes how brief educational interventions may have significant impact on trainee knowledge and comfort with PrEP prescription. Future QI projects may examine knowledge retention over time, as well as PrEP prescription patterns by examining proportion of PrEP-eligible patients with active PrEP prescriptions in resident clinic.

Abstract: Background Clinical pharmacists are key contributors to Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) program efforts. Baseline knowledge of infectious diseases among hospital pharmacists across an 11-hospital system was inconsistent due to several factors including residency training, year since educational training, site-specific onboarding procedures, and more. Based on Joint Commission Standard MM.09.01.01 EP12, hospitals must document AMS competency for staff. To address these gaps, we implemented an annual pharmacist competency “The Antimicrobial Resistance Fighter Curriculum” with the first round consisting of 3 modules. Methods A multi-disciplinary working group within ADSP developed competency content for the antimicrobial stewardship concepts. Feedback from stakeholders and frontline users was incorporated prior to the launch to ensure objectives were being met. Knowledge retention was reinforced through built-in knowledge checks and creative graphics (Images 1,2). Baseline metrics were also assessed on a scale of 1-5 (1= no knowledge, 5= confident using knowledge daily) before and after implementation. New hire education began May 2024, and system wide education was assigned on August 27 th , 2024, to any remaining pharmacists. We also tracked the competency of staff by a mandatory 100% quiz pass rate. This curriculum is also applied during the on-boarding period for new pharmacists. Results 415 pharmacists across the health system completed the curriculum. Confidence in using AMS topics in daily practice increased from an average of 3.8 to 4.6 out of 5 for Module 1:Antimicrobial Stewardship 101 and Guidelines, 3.5 to 4.6 for Module 2:ADSP Website and Resources, 3.9 to 4.7 for Module 3:Vancomycin Use and Dosing (Table 1). We had 93 responses to a second survey 9 months after the launch of the competency to assess if end users still felt that our competency was useful for daily patient care activities and found 1% did not make changes, 5% were planning to make changes, and 78% made changes to their clinical practice due to this education. Conclusion This type of competency-based intervention demonstrates that antimicrobial stewardship knowledge can improve across a healthcare system. The content was well-received, and many pharmacists appreciated the creative learning style (Image 3). Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures

Abstract: Aim To map instruments assessing nursing students’ knowledge of HIV prophylaxis and critically appraise their measurement properties using the COSMIN framework. Design Scoping review. Methods This scoping review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. Systematic searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase and Google Scholar (gray literature) through August 28, 2025. Eligible studies included those reporting instruments designed to measure HIV prophylaxis knowledge among nursing students. Study selection and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the MMAT, while the quality of the measurement instruments was evaluated using the COSMIN checklist. Results Of 1286 records screened, nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The included studies were published between 2014 and 2025, involving a total of 2302 nursing students. Only four of the nine included studies provided adequate information regarding the validation process of the instruments. Most tools were administered online and employed Likert scales, predefined scoring systems, or assertive questions. Only one study conducted post-testing to assess knowledge retention. Conclusions This review documents the recent emergence of instruments measuring PrEP/PEP knowledge among nursing students and highlights important methodological and implementation gaps. The limited use of these tools in educational interventions signals the need for future studies to evaluate their responsiveness and utility in improving HIV prevention competencies in nursing education.

Abstract: This study sought to investigate the efficacy of the Culturo-techno-contextual approach (CTCA) as an intervention in enhancing the knowledge retention of secondary school students in biology. A quasi-experimental (pre-test post-test non-equivalent group) design was employed. A total of 103 biology students in senior secondary year II (11th grade), comprising 56 females and 47 males in education district V, Lagos, Nigeria, participated in the study. The average age of the students was 14 years. The Achievement Test in Tissue and Supporting System (ATTSS), which had a reliability coefficient of 0.80, was designed to collect data on students’ achievement. The study revealed that (a) students taught using the culture-techno-contextual approach had a higher knowledge retention ability than those in the comparison group and (b) CTCA had no differential impact on students in the experimental group based on gender. Hence, the study concluded that the CTCA approach is an effective tool for enhancing student knowledge retention in biology and can help bridge the gap between male and female students’ performance in biology. Recommendations were made for the implementation of the findings of this study and further research.

Abstract: This staff education project was a quality improvement initiative aimed at reducing medication transcription errors by implementing a standardized verification protocol. The project addressed the critical practice problem of transcription-related medication errors, which contribute to wrong medication administration, adverse drug events, and patient harm. The practice-focused question was: How does implementing a staff education program on standardized medication transcription verification processes in healthcare institutions affect the rate of wrong medication administration compared to traditional transcription methods without education? The project was implemented over 8 weeks in an outpatient clinic with 20 participants (8 prescribers and 12 nurses). The primary data collection tool was a structured pre- and post-intervention Likert-scale survey, developed to assess staff confidence, satisfaction, and knowledge retention. The findings showed significant improvements following the intervention. Transcription errors dropped from 20% to 13% (a 35% reduction), and compliance with verification protocols rose from 62% to 88%. Confidence in using the protocols increased from 45% to 92% among participants, while overall staff satisfaction with the training improved from 50% to 90%. Sustaining the improvement will require continued staff education, periodic competency assessments, and routine audit feedback. Overall, the project demonstrates that nurse-led educational interventions can lead to measurable enhancements in minimizing transcription errors, improving communication between nurses and prescribers, and strengthening a culture of safety, confidence, and professional accountability in clinical practice.

Abstract: High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training, including both technical and non-technical skills, is essential for medical students. Virtual reality (VR) offers immersive learning environments that may enhance traditional teaching methods. This study investigates the impact of a single VR session prior to an Advanced Life Support (ALS) course on knowledge and performance of basic life support skills among medical students. Background High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training, including both technical and non-technical skills, is essential for medical students. Virtual reality (VR) offers immersive learning environments that may enhance traditional teaching methods. This study investigates the impact of a single VR session prior to an Advanced Life Support (ALS) course on knowledge and performance of basic life support skills among medical students.In this single blind randomized controlled trial, 126 fourth-year medical students with prior Basic Life Support (BLS) training were assigned to either an intervention group ( n  = 66) with an additional 3-part immersive VR session covering BLS theory and practice or a control group ( n  = 60) receiving standard preparation. All participants underwent a seminar based on advanced life support principles as dictated by the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) guidelines. Theoretical knowledge was assessed via multiple-choice questionnaires at three time points (baseline, post-course, 12 weeks later). Practical skills were evaluated through an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon tests, repeated-measures ANOVA, and linear mixed models. Student evaluations were used to gauge subjective satisfaction with the scenario during teaching.

The intervention group demonstrated significantly greater gains in knowledge at both post-course ( p  < 0.01) and follow-up ( p  = 0.04). However, no significant differences were found in OSCE performance. The VR group's improvement over time was significantly higher, suggesting a positive effect of VR on knowledge retention. Students were satisfied with the addition of a VR scenario in the teaching format. Results No significant differences were observed between groups at baseline.

Abstract: Conventional medical education faces resource constraints, including limited access to cadavers, difficulties in safely replicating high-risk scenarios, and uneven distribution of training opportunities. Virtual and augmented reality technologies address these issues by providing immersive, interactive simulations that replicate medical environments with high fidelity. Through 3D modeling, real-time rendering, and multisensory feedback, these platforms allow trainees to practice complex procedures risk-free, enhancing skill development and decision-making. Innovations in AI-driven content generation, adaptive learning, and edge computing further improve scalability and effectiveness. By overcoming physical barriers, VR/AR democratizes access to specialized training, reshaping medical education for improved skill acquisition, knowledge retention, and global collaboration.

Abstract: Decentralized approaches are inspired by the self-organizing principles observed in natural and social systems. These methods offer a scalable and resilient framework for collaborative learning. Decentralized federated learning (DFL) uses these principles to avoid the dependency on a central controller. However, a key challenge arises from data heterogeneity. This often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the model significantly loses its ability to remember and use previously learned information. This loss of knowledge can reduce the reliability of DFL in critical applications, such as autonomous systems, financial services, energy management, and transportation networks. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we investigate how data distribution affects DFL performance, with a focus on how bias propagates across nodes. We also explore how local model learning rates affect the trade-off between learning stability and convergence speed. At the same time, we evaluate the performance drops at individual nodes. Furthermore, to improve connectivity and speed up knowledge sharing, we propose adding a limited number of teleportation links, which aims to reduce the average distance between pairs of nodes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy, showing reduced catastrophic forgetting, faster convergence, and improved resilience across various scenarios.

Beyond the flow: A critical examination of engagement and learning outcomes in game-based learning through bibliometric and manual literature analysis

Author: Singletary, Daniel Ray11 Boise State University, Educational Technology, US

Publication info: Singletary, Daniel Ray. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/beyond-flow-critical-examination-engagement/docview/3272805060/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: This study examines the role of flow in game‐based learning and compares the effects of continuous flow states with those produced by structured cognitive interruptions. The research combines a bibliometric analysis of 2,466 peer‐reviewed articles (2004–2024) with a manual review of 106 studies using a custom Flow‐Impact Analysis Framework (FIAF). This framework was developed specifically for the review and may assist future investigations into flow in game‐based learning. FIAF categorizes studies based on how they define flow, the instruments used for its measurement, and the links between flow and cognitive, affective, and behavioral learning outcomes. Findings show that most research builds on Csikszentmihalyi's flow theory (1990), with common dimensions including challenge–skill balance, concentration, and enjoyment. Although continuous-flow states are associated with high engagement, studies incorporating structured cognitive interruptions—such as scaffolding and reflection prompts—report better knowledge retention and increased reflective behavior (Hamari et al., 2016; Lin & Hou, 2024b). Variations in measurement methods across studies point to a need for standardized approaches in future work. Findings offer guidance for educators and instructional designers in creating game‐based learning environments that balance immersive engagement with opportunities for critical reflection.

How surgical nurses describe the influence of self-guided learning on self-efficacy and performance expectations

Author: Savinell, Robert Patrick11 Grand Canyon University, College of Doctoral Studies, US

Publication info: Savinell, Robert Patrick.

Abstract: It is not known how surgical nurses describe the influence of self-guided digital learning (SDLM) on their self-efficacy and performance expectations. This gap affects how nurses perceive and utilize digital learning platforms to enhance their skills. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore how surgical nurses in Ohio describe the impact of SDLMs on self-efficacy and performance expectations. The study involved 16 surgical nurses, supplemented by two focus groups of six participants each. Data were collected through demographic questionnaires, interviews, and focus group discussions and analyzed using Braun and Clarke's six-phase reflective thematic analysis with MAXQDA 2022 for data management. Grounded in self-efficacy theory, findings revealed that SDLMs positively influenced nurses' learning strategies, innovation, and ability to work under pressure, fostering self-efficacy. Barriers to self-efficacy emerged, yet SDLMs were associated with improved quality of service, deeper field understanding, and better teamwork. Notably, new nurses displayed enhanced knowledge retention and confidence, while seasoned nurses showed signs of complacency. These results highlight the need to balance repetitive learning without alienating experienced staff. Positive social implications include fostering teamwork and continuous professional development among surgical nurses. Future research should focus on strategies to incorporate repetitive module use effectively for all experience levels. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

Abstract: This dissertation explores a structured educational intervention aimed at enhancing confidence and knowledge retention among phase II cardiac rehabilitation patients through the "teach back" method. Drawing from a semi-structured interview with a former patient, fishbone diagram and empathy interview, insights regarding the need for structured education in cardiac rehabilitation and the missed opportunity for improved patient engagement were gained. This study proposed a 12-session individualized education program designed to equip phase II cardiac rehabilitation patients with the knowledge, skills and confidence to excel in their cardiac health maintenance in phase III cardiac rehabilitation. The program aims to foster a more holistic care approach, improving patient outcomes and reducing clinician burnout. The proposed changes were assessed through 3 key inquiry questions: 1. Are phase II cardiac rehabilitation patients comfortable with the teach back method and the structure of education? 2. To what extent did the intervention impact the phase II cardiac rehabilitation patients knowledge of their individual cardiac health and confidence in themselves to maintain their improved cardiac health into phase III? 3. How did this intervention impact my co-workers time management with their responsibilities? This study's methods, results, implications and conclusions are expected to inform best practices in phase II cardiac rehabilitation and contribute to the development of more comprehensive, supportive care models that integrate physical, mental, and social health.

Abstract: Pharmacy law knowledge is an important component of a pharmacy student's education, guiding future pharmacists on regulatory frameworks for pharmacy practice. However, limited research exists regarding longitudinal retention of pharmacy law knowledge. The objective of this study was to assess the short-term and long-term retention of pharmacy law knowledge for a single cohort of pharmacy students by comparing individual performance across three law-focused assessments. BACKGROUND Pharmacy law knowledge is an important component of a pharmacy student's education, guiding future pharmacists on regulatory frameworks for pharmacy practice. However, limited research exists regarding longitudinal retention of pharmacy law knowledge. The objective of this study was to assess the short-term and long-term retention of pharmacy law knowledge for a single cohort of pharmacy students by comparing individual performance across three law-focused assessments.Percent change in individual student performance was tracked across three specific assessments. The change between the first two assessments (P2 didactic course and P3 summer IPPE) assessed short-term retention, and the change between the first and third (P4 Community Pharmacy APPE) assessed long-term retention. Assessment results were converted to percentages to allow for direct comparisons given diversity of assessment structure. METHODS Percent change in individual student performance was tracked across three specific assessments. The change between the first two assessments (P2 didactic course and P3 summer IPPE) assessed short-term retention, and the change between the first and third (P4 Community Pharmacy APPE) assessed long-term retention. Assessment results were converted to percentages to allow for direct comparisons given diversity of assessment structure.63 of 65 (96.9 %) of students completed all three assessments. Knowledge of pharmacy law was maintained from Assessment 1 to Assessment 2 and from Assessment 1 to Assessment 3. Student scores indicated a slight increase in short-term knowledge (average + 8 %, range -34 % to +38 %, p = 0.00016) and a slight decrease in long-term knowledge (average -6 %, range -34 % to +18 %, p = 0.000047). RESULTS 63 of 65 (96.9 %) of students completed all three assessments. Knowledge of pharmacy law was maintained from Assessment 1 to Assessment 2 and from Assessment 1 to Assessment 3. Student scores indicated a slight increase in short-term knowledge (average + 8 %, range -34 % to +38 %, p = 0.00016) and a slight decrease in long-term knowledge (average -6 %, range -34 % to +18 %, p = 0.000047).Assessing pharmacy law knowledge scores at multiple points in the curriculum provided an analysis of short-term and long-term knowledge retention. While short-term knowledge of law was retained, long-term knowledge showed deterioration, but not to the extent expected. This may be due to the modified spaced repetition of pharmacy law assessments, blunting the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve effect or students exhibiting a testing effect. However, law touch points, such as incorporating a regulatory assessment into care plans, throughout the curriculum may be beneficial to overall law knowledge retention.

Abstract: The rise of virtual learning has been significant in recent years, with the percentage of degree programs offered exclusively online increasing from 15.4% in 2019 to 60% in 2022. While online courses provide flexibility and convenience, concerns have emerged regarding student engagement, learning outcomes, and satisfaction. Due to limited interactions with peers and instructors, virtual students often struggle with motivation and experience higher levels of anxiety, stress, and isolation compared to their in-person counterparts.A key factor influencing student success in online courses is social presence, defined as the extent to which learners feel connected and engaged with their instructor and classmates. Research indicates higher levels of social presence contribute to increased student satisfaction, improved knowledge retention, and stronger sense of community. Conversely, a lack of social presence can lead to disengagement, dissatisfaction, and higher dropout rates. Non-traditional graduate students, defined as students pursuing advanced degrees while balancing work and family responsibilities, represent a significant portion of online learners. They choose virtual education for its flexibility, yet often struggle with engagement and social connection. These challenges can negatively impact their learning experiences, program completion rates, and overall success. Professional degree programs, designed to prepare individuals for industry-specific careers, further complicate this dynamic. Unlike academic degrees focused on research, professional degree programs require high levels of engagement and application-based learning, making social presence particularly important.Despite the growing number of non-traditional students in online professional degree programs, research on their specific social and emotional needs remains limited. This Dissertation in Practice will explore how this demographic perceives and experiences social presence in online professional degree programs through semi-structured interviews designed to capture their subjective experiences and interactions within virtual learning environments. Ultimately, this study aims to provide deeper insight into non-traditional graduate student perceptions of social presence—including potential barriers—to help foster more transformative, equitable, and inclusive online learning experiences.

Abstract: Gamification is the application of gaming elements in a nongame context. The use of gamification in education increases motivation, participation and both short- and long-term knowledge retention. Millennial and Generation Z learners are the largest percentage of radiology residents and medical students, respectively, and gamification is an educational tool they are likely familiar with and may enjoy. To date, performance of a gamified learning platform for radiology residents has not been compared to validated resources such as RadExam. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES Gamification is the application of gaming elements in a nongame context. The use of gamification in education increases motivation, participation and both short- and long-term knowledge retention. Millennial and Generation Z learners are the largest percentage of radiology residents and medical students, respectively, and gamification is an educational tool they are likely familiar with and may enjoy. To date, performance of a gamified learning platform for radiology residents has not been compared to validated resources such as RadExam.This is an IRB-approved prospective study evaluating the performance of R1-R4 radiology residents participating in a month-long voluntary novel app-based game at a tertiary care academic program. Questions were created by radiology attendings from several radiology subspecialties and reviewed by a radiologist experienced in radiology education. Informed consent was acquired from all participants, and questions were delivered by Kaizen's secure online app. Performance was recorded for each group. Scores overall and within each discipline were compared institutional RadExam performance using a one-way Anova test. Likert survey was administered at the conclusion of the study to assess participant engagement, motivation, clinical knowledge, board preparation, satisfaction and likelihood to play again. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is an IRB-approved prospective study evaluating the performance of R1-R4 radiology residents participating in a month-long voluntary novel app-based game at a tertiary care academic program. Questions were created by radiology attendings from several radiology subspecialties and reviewed by a radiologist experienced in radiology education. Informed consent was acquired from all participants, and questions were delivered by Kaizen's secure online app. Performance was recorded for each group. Scores overall and within each discipline were compared institutional RadExam performance using a one-way Anova test. Likert survey was administered at the conclusion of the study to assess participant engagement, motivation, clinical knowledge, board preparation, satisfaction and likelihood to play again.There were 25 radiology residents (65.7 %, 25/38) who completed at least one question. First year residents made up the largest percentage of class participation with 89 % (8/9) answering at least one question. Third-year residents answered the highest percentage of questions correctly, while the first-year class answered the lowest percentage correctly. One-way Anova analysis showed no significant difference between mean Kaizen and RadExam scores (p = 0.3641). There was also no significant difference between the RadExam and Kaizen scores separated by question category. Most enjoyed the game and 75 % of survey participants would participate in a Kaizen game again. Team collaboration and question feedback significantly increased motivation for most. Most participants felt the game enhanced their radiology knowledge and was beneficial for daily work and board preparation.

Team competition appeared to play a role in maintaining engagement and motivation. Resident performance on the RadExam and Kaizen game by both overall and topic-based assessments showed similar results. More research is needed to assess the reliability and validity of gamified learning for radiology residents. CONCLUSION The Kaizen game was well-received among radiology residents with positive feedback on content, perceived educational benefits and motivation. Team competition appeared to play a role in maintaining engagement and motivation. Resident performance on the RadExam and Kaizen game by both overall and topic-based assessments showed similar results. More research is needed to assess the reliability and validity of gamified learning for radiology residents.

Abstract: Two interactive e-learning modules were developed, focusing on dental panoramic radiograph (DPR) interpretation and a virtual dental clinic (VDC) for communication skills. The aim of the study was twofold: to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the modules in enhancing students' skills in interpreting DPRs and complying with reporting standards in clinical practice, and to qualitatively assess students' perceptions of the module's effectiveness. OBJECTIVES Two interactive e-learning modules were developed, focusing on dental panoramic radiograph (DPR) interpretation and a virtual dental clinic (VDC) for communication skills. The aim of the study was twofold: to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the modules in enhancing students' skills in interpreting DPRs and complying with reporting standards in clinical practice, and to qualitatively assess students' perceptions of the module's effectiveness.A mixed-methods cohort study was conducted over four weeks and included forty-five dental students in their final year. Students were assessed using objective structured radiographic interpretation and objective structured clinical examination assessments before (baseline) and after the e-learning modules. Student perceptions of the modules were evaluated quantitatively using an online questionnaire and qualitatively in focus group discussions. Quantitative data were analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Qualitative data from focus group discussions were analyzed using thematic analysis. METHODS A mixed-methods cohort study was conducted over four weeks and included forty-five dental students in their final year. Students were assessed using objective structured radiographic interpretation and objective structured clinical examination assessments before (baseline) and after the e-learning modules. Student perceptions of the modules were evaluated quantitatively using an online questionnaire and qualitatively in focus group discussions. Quantitative data were analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Qualitative data from focus group discussions were analyzed using thematic analysis.After the modules, students' DPR interpretation skills improved for reporting radiographic findings (all p < 0.01), anatomical landmark identification (all p < 0.05), and pathology detection (all p < 0.05). Communication skills improved for reduced jargon usage (p < 0.01). Compliance with DPR reporting increased from 63.3% before to 81.3% after the module (p = 0.03). Students indicated positive perceptions of the modules, highlighted their flexibility, and provided reinforcement. RESULTS After the modules, students' DPR interpretation skills improved for reporting radiographic findings (all p < 0.01), anatomical landmark identification (all p < 0.05), and pathology detection (all p < 0.05). Communication skills improved for reduced jargon usage (p < 0.01). Compliance with DPR reporting increased from 63.3% before to 81.3% after the module (p = 0.03). Students indicated positive perceptions of the modules, highlighted their flexibility, and provided reinforcement.The e-learning modules with DPR and VDC significantly enhanced student skills in DPR interpretation and clinical communication. These findings support the integration of e-learning modules in dental curricula to improve diagnostic accuracy, knowledge retention, and communication skills. CONCLUSION The e-learning modules with DPR and VDC significantly enhanced student skills in DPR interpretation and clinical communication. These findings support the integration of e-learning modules in dental curricula to improve diagnostic accuracy, knowledge retention, and communication skills.

Abstract: Medical educators should understand the differences within the medical student population, including gender. Research on gender effects on learning and skill acquisition has yielded contradictory results, particularly in anatomy learning among undergraduate medical students. While various dissection course settings have been evaluated, gender-specific differences have largely been overlooked. This study examined gender differences in several aspects of anatomy education. First, the ability of undergraduate medical students to identify anatomical structures was assessed to determine gender differences in learning gains. Second, learning outcomes were compared between a 3-month and a 1-month regional anatomy course, with attention to gender. Third, knowledge retention was evaluated at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Finally, student perceptions of different embalming methods for anatomy learning were assessed with a focus on gender. Minor differences were observed between genders across different regions in learning gains. Scores from the 3-month course were higher than those from the 1-month course, regardless of gender, particularly for the neck, thorax, and abdomen. A significant knowledge gain was noted in abdominal anatomy at the 6- and 12-month follow-up: scores improved by 56% in females and by 68% in males. The comparison of Thiel- versus ethanol-based embalming revealed gender differences regarding tissue pliability and the utility of tissues for achieving learning objectives. In conclusion, subtle differences appear to exist between female and male students in terms of perceptions and learning outcomes in gross anatomy dissection courses. These findings will be useful in developing new curricula for undergraduate medical students, taking into account gender differences in the context of regional anatomy dissection courses.Medical educators should understand the differences within the medical student population, including gender.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated impressive performance on general medical examinations; however, their effectiveness significantly declines in specialized board examinations due to limited domain-specific training data and computational constraints inherent to their self-attention mechanisms. This study investigates a novel token-splitting strategy informed by Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), aimed at overcoming these limitations by optimizing cognitive processing and enhancing knowledge retention in specialized educational contexts. We implemented a token-splitting approach by segmenting Taiwan plastic surgery board examination materials and associated textbook content into cognitively manageable segments ranging from 4,000 to 20,000 tokens. These segmented inputs were provided to GPT-4.1 via its standard ChatGPT web interface. Model performance was rigorously evaluated, comparing accuracy and efficiency across various token lengths and question complexities classified according to Bloom's taxonomy.The GPT-4.1 model utilizing the token-splitting strategy significantly outperformed the baseline (unmodified) model, achieving notably higher accuracy. The optimal segmentation length was determined to be 6,000 tokens, effectively balancing cognitive coherence with information retention and model attention. Errors observed at this optimal length primarily resulted from content absent from textual materials or requiring multimodal interpretation (e.g., image-based reasoning). Provided relevant textual content was adequately segmented, GPT-4.1 consistently demonstrated high accuracy (From 75.88% to 92.93%). The findings highlight that a token-splitting approach, grounded in Cognitive Load Theory, significantly enhances LLM performance on specialized medical board examinations. This accessible, user-friendly strategy provides educators and clinicians with a practical means to improve AI-assisted education outcomes without requiring complex technical skills or infrastructure. Future research and development integrating multimodal capabilities and adaptive segmentation strategies promise to further optimize educational applications and clinical decision-making support.Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated impressive performance on general medical examinations; however, their effectiveness significantly declines in specialized board examinations due to limited domain-specific training data and computational constraints inherent to their self-attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Biochemistry forms the foundation for understanding biomolecules and molecular processes crucial to dental and oral biology. However, it is often perceived as a challenging subject for dental students with diverse educational backgrounds. Analogies are a pedagogical tool that helps explain new and abstract concepts in biochemistry. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted teaching and learning activities, prompting shifts in instructional models. This cross-sectional study evaluates dental students' perceptions of analogies in biochemistry education through surveys conducted at the National University of Singapore. Participants included pre-pandemic (2019) and post-pandemic (2024) dental student cohorts, consisting of 57 and 64 students, respectively. Both cohorts reported overwhelmingly positive responses toward the usefulness of analogies, with average scores of 4.6 ± 0.6 in 2019 and 4.7 ± 0.5 in 2024. Most students indicated that analogies enhanced their visualization of abstract concepts (100% in 2019 and 96.9% in 2024) and improved knowledge retention (82.5% in 2019 and 68.8% in 2024). However, a small proportion of students noted that analogies are taken literally and difficult to differentiate from reality (5.3% in 2019 and 4.7% in 2024). Students generally found analogies associated with unfamiliar topics to be more memorable. These findings suggest that analogies remain a relevant and effective tool in biochemistry education, even amid shifts in educational delivery models.Biochemistry forms the foundation for understanding biomolecules and molecular processes crucial to dental and oral biology.

Abstract: The integration of Team Based Learning (TBL) into medical ethics education has gained attention as a means of promoting active engagement, ethical reasoning, and professional development. This systematic review evaluates the characteristics, outcomes, challenges and quality of studies on TBL in teaching medical ethics across healthcare education contexts. BACKGROUND The integration of Team Based Learning (TBL) into medical ethics education has gained attention as a means of promoting active engagement, ethical reasoning, and professional development. This systematic review evaluates the characteristics, outcomes, challenges and quality of studies on TBL in teaching medical ethics across healthcare education contexts.Following PRISMA guideline, a systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from 2000 to March 31, 2025. Only peer-reviewed empirical studies published in English and focusing on TBL in ethics education were included. Data were extracted on study characteristics, TBL interventions, measurement tools and outcomes. The identified outcomes were then analyzed and categorized using the Kirkpatrick framework to evaluate their hierarchical levels. Methodological quality was assessed using the MERSQI instrument. Due to heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis was conducted. METHODS Following PRISMA guideline, a systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from 2000 to March 31, 2025. Only peer-reviewed empirical studies published in English and focusing on TBL in ethics education were included. Data were extracted on study characteristics, TBL interventions, measurement tools and outcomes. The identified outcomes were then analyzed and categorized using the Kirkpatrick framework to evaluate their hierarchical levels. Methodological quality was assessed using the MERSQI instrument. Due to heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis was conducted.The 15 studies, involving 2,134 participants, demonstrated TBL's effectiveness in ethics education across diverse global settings. Studies originated from the United States (6), Turkey (2), Korea (2), a joint Bahrain/Ireland study (1), and single studies from the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Oman, and Nepal. Asia contributed 9 studies, North America 6, and Europe 1. Most studies were published between 2019 and 2025. When evaluated through the Kirkpatrick model, TBL demonstrated positive outcomes across multiple levels. Learner Reaction (Level 1) was highly favorable, with consistent reports of high satisfaction and engagement. In terms of Learning (Level 2), the intervention enhanced knowledge retention, ethical reasoning, and moral sensitivity. Furthermore, there was evidence of Behavioral change (Level 3), as students transferred learning to practice by applying ethical principles more effectively, demonstrating deeper cultural awareness, and engaging in more robust team-based decision-making. The fostering of a stronger professional identity suggests a foundational shift aligned with long-term Results (Level 4). Challenges included low pre-reading compliance, resource intensity, and ambiguous assessments. MERSQI scores ranged from 7.5 to 13.0, with an average of 10.2, indicating moderate methodological quality overall.

Its interactive, learner-centered design promotes cultural and moral awareness and team-based decision-making, with high student satisfaction. Despite implementation challenges, the evidence supports its broader adoption in ethics teaching. Future research should prioritize rigorous study designs, validated assessment tools, and long-term outcome evaluation.

Abstract: To evaluate whether ChatGPT-generated informed consent forms improve comprehension, attitudinal responses, and readability compared with standard informed consent forms in two interventional radiology procedures. OBJECTIVES To evaluate whether ChatGPT-generated informed consent forms improve comprehension, attitudinal responses, and readability compared with standard informed consent forms in two interventional radiology procedures.This prospective, single blind, randomized controlled study was conducted at a tertiary-care interventional radiology department between March and August 2025. A total of 122 participants with no prior exposure to the procedures were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a web-based Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-4o-generated or a standard informed consent form for transarterial radioembolization (TARE) or percutaneous hydatid cyst treatment (PHCT). All participants completed a ten-item comprehension test and a four-item attitudinal survey. Readability was analyzed using multiple indices (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Coleman-Liau, SMOG, Automated Readability Index, and Ateşman) and the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT).

Readability was analyzed using multiple indices (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Coleman-Liau, SMOG, Automated Readability Index, and Ateşman) and the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT).Participants who read ChatGPT-generated consent forms achieved higher comprehension scores than those who read standard forms (82.9 % vs. 77.3 %, p = 0.04). The benefit was consistent across procedures and education levels, with the greatest relative improvement among participants with lower educational attainment (p = 0.04). Readability analysis showed that ChatGPT-generated forms had shorter sentences and lower linguistic complexity (Flesch 39.2; Ateşman 53.9) than standard forms. Test-retest results indicated better knowledge retention for ChatGPT-generated forms, particularly in the TARE subgroup. No significant attitudinal differences were observed between groups.

Abstract: The inspection of power transmission lines using unmanned aerial vehicles primarily relies on object detection. However, the continuous emergence of new obstacle types necessitates frequent updates to detection models, leading to substantial retraining costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named IViT, which integrates incremental learning with a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture for improved identification. We combined knowledge distillation with the elastic response selection distillation strategy to enhance detection performance for old classes and strengthen knowledge retention through star convolutional residual blocks constructed via element-wise multiplication. We designed a separable convolution aggregation block that integrates PConv with an attention mechanism, effectively merging global and local information to improve detection accuracy. Finally, we unified the two modules into a hybrid block. In the static detection task, IViT achieves a mAP of 55.3%, a mAP 50 of 83.6%, and a mAP 75 of 61.0%. For the incremental detection task, it attains a mAP of 57.8%, a mAP 50 of 79.7%, and a mAP 75 of 62.3%. Extensive experiments on the transmission line corridor external damage dataset and the INSPLAD dataset demonstrate that IViT exhibits outstanding detection performance compared to mainstream static object detection models and incremental object detection models.The inspection of power transmission lines using unmanned aerial vehicles primarily relies on object detection.

Abstract: To evaluate the effectiveness of short-duration self-learning (SSL) and mastery learning (ML) strategies on the acquisition and 6-month retention of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills and basic life support (BLS) knowledge among hospital administrative staff in Thailand. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of short-duration self-learning (SSL) and mastery learning (ML) strategies on the acquisition and 6-month retention of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills and basic life support (BLS) knowledge among hospital administrative staff in Thailand.Comparative assessment of two CPR training strategies. DESIGN Comparative assessment of two CPR training strategies.Tertiary-level academic institution in Thailand. SETTING Tertiary-level academic institution in Thailand.A total of 163 hospital administrative staff aged ≥18 years without prior BLS certification were enrolled and randomly allocated to either the SSL group (n=82) or the ML group (n=81). Participants with previous CPR certification, medical limitations preventing chest compressions or those unwilling to attend the 6-month retention test were excluded. 71 participants in each group completed the 6-month follow-up. PARTICIPANTS A total of 163 hospital administrative staff aged ≥18 years without prior BLS certification were enrolled and randomly allocated to either the SSL group (n=82) or the ML group (n=81). Participants with previous CPR certification, medical limitations preventing chest compressions or those unwilling to attend the 6-month retention test were excluded. 71 participants in each group completed the 6-month follow-up.All participants viewed an 8 min self-directed instructional video on BLS and subsequently performed CPR practice using real-time feedback manikins. The SSL group practised independently for up to five 1 min sessions, while the ML group practised until achieving a predefined mastery threshold (QCPR (Quality Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) score >90%). INTERVENTIONS All participants viewed an 8 min self-directed instructional video on BLS and subsequently performed CPR practice using real-time feedback manikins. The SSL group practised independently for up to five 1 min sessions, while the ML group practised until achieving a predefined mastery threshold (QCPR (Quality Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) score >90%).The primary outcome was CPR skill retention at 6 months, measured by QCPR overall performance score. Secondary outcomes included observational BLS performance (scene safety, responsiveness, emergency activation, breathing assessment and correct hand placement), knowledge retention scores and the number of attempts required to achieve mastery in the ML group. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was CPR skill retention at 6 months, measured by QCPR overall performance score. Secondary outcomes included observational BLS performance (scene safety, responsiveness, emergency activation, breathing assessment and correct hand placement), knowledge retention scores and the number of attempts required to achieve mastery in the ML group.Both SSL and ML groups demonstrated significant improvement in CPR performance and BLS knowledge immediately after training (p<0.001). At 6 months, no statistically significant differences were found between groups in CPR skill retention (mean difference 0.7%, 95% CI -1.9% to 3.3%, p=0.62) or BLS knowledge retention (mean difference 0.2, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.8, p=0.51). Female participants required more attempts to achieve mastery compared with males (mean 3.0 vs 2.1, p=0.007). RESULTS Both SSL and ML groups demonstrated significant improvement in CPR performance and BLS knowledge immediately after training (p<0.001). At 6 months, no statistically significant differences were found between groups in CPR skill retention (mean difference 0.7%, 95% CI -1.9% to 3.3%, p=0.62) or BLS knowledge retention (mean difference 0.2, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.8, p=0.51). Female participants required more attempts to achieve mastery compared with males (mean 3.0 vs 2.1, p=0.007).Both SSL and ML effectively enhanced CPR performance and knowledge retention among non-medical hospital staff. SSL offers a practical, resource-efficient and scalable approach for CPR training in large-scale community or institutional settings. Future studies should investigate the cost-effectiveness and optimal refresher frequency for sustaining CPR competency. CONCLUSIONS Both SSL and ML effectively enhanced CPR performance and knowledge retention among non-medical hospital staff. SSL offers a practical, resource-efficient and scalable approach for CPR training in large-scale community or institutional settings.

Abstract: Distal radius fractures (DRFs) are among the most common orthopedic injuries and are often challenging for students to fully understand when taught using only 2D radiographs or healthy models. This study aimed to evaluate the educational impact of tomography-based 3DP DRF models on medical students' knowledge acquisition and anatomical understanding compared with conventional teaching methods. BACKGROUND Distal radius fractures (DRFs) are among the most common orthopedic injuries and are often challenging for students to fully understand when taught using only 2D radiographs or healthy models. This study aimed to evaluate the educational impact of tomography-based 3DP DRF models on medical students' knowledge acquisition and anatomical understanding compared with conventional teaching methods.The study was designed as a parallel-group, single-blinded prospective randomized controlled trial conducted over two days of structured education. Ninety-four second year physiotherapy students (19.62 ± 1.2 years; 45 F, 49 M) were enrolled and randomly assigned into intervention (n = 47) and control (n = 47) groups. The intervention group received tomography-based fracture 3DP training, while the control group received a healthy 3D-printed model. Primary outcomes included theoretical knowledge (MCQs) and practical case-solving. Secondary outcomes were Test-Taking Motivation Questionnaire (TTMQ); Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI), puzzle assembly time, satisfaction, and willingness-to-recommend ratings. Assessments were conducted pre- and post-training, with knowledge retention re-assessed at one month after education. Statistical analyses were performed using independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests for between-group comparisons, paired t-tests for within-group changes. METHODS The study was designed as a parallel-group, single-blinded prospective randomized controlled trial conducted over two days of structured education.

Primary outcomes included theoretical knowledge (MCQs) and practical case-solving. Secondary outcomes were Test-Taking Motivation Questionnaire (TTMQ); Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI), puzzle assembly time, satisfaction, and willingness-to-recommend ratings. Assessments were conducted pre- and post-training, with knowledge retention re-assessed at one month after education. Statistical analyses were performed using independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests for between-group comparisons, paired t-tests for within-group changes.The intervention group included 47 students (19.51 ± 1.1 years; 36 F, 11 M), while the control group consisted of 47 students (19.74 ± 1.3 years; 33 F, 14 M). Demographic characteristics were similar between the groups. In the 3D group, theoretical knowledge scores improved (50.68 [45.34, 55.93], p < .001), TTMQ scores increased (28.06 [24.22, 31.91], p < .001), and TAI scores decreased (-10.89 [-14.33, - 7.46], p < .001). Similarly, in the control group, theoretical knowledge scores improved (49.46 [44.86, 54.03], p < .001), TTMQ scores increased (21.60 [17.13, 26.06], p < .001), and TAI scores decreased (-9.70 [-14.35, - 5.05], p < .001). Post-training comparisons showed that the intervention group achieved significantly higher scores in case-solving (-18.55 [-23.87, - 13.23], p < .001), MCQ performance (4.17 [0.15, 8.18], p = .042), puzzle assembly time (11.34 [4.24, 18.44], p = .002), TTMQ (8.04 [3.20, 12.87], p = .030), and TAI (-4.42 [-7.54, - 1.30], p = .030). No significant between-group differences were observed for color recognition (p = .301), weight identification (p = .161), detail recognition (p = .669), or knowledge retention (p = .160). RESULTS The intervention group included 47 students (19.51 ± 1.1 years; 36 F, 11 M), while the control group consisted of 47 students (19.74 ± 1.3 years; 33 F, 14 M).

Abstract: The lack of clinical skills in reception and obstetric risk classification among nursing students has prompted the use of innovative educational technologies. In this scenario, educational hypermedia has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing interactive learning and developing clinical reasoning. This study evaluated the effectiveness of an educational hypermedia in teaching obstetric risk reception and classification among third-year undergraduate nursing students at a private university in northeastern Brazil. This was a cluster-randomized clinical trial with 2 parallel groups (intervention and control), each with 30 participants. The intervention group used educational hypermedia after theoretical and practical classes, whereas the control group followed only traditional strategies. The primary outcome was knowledge gain, measured by pre-intervention and post-intervention tests. Both groups showed an improvement in performance, but the intervention group obtained a significantly higher average in the post-test (P=.001), with a high effect size (Cohen d=1.131), in contrast to a small effect in the control group. In addition, the students' evaluation using the LORI scale showed high satisfaction with the quality of the hypermedia (mean=4.77). The results indicate that hypermedia is an effective and complementary tool to traditional teaching, promoting greater knowledge retention and stimulating clinical reasoning in the context of obstetrics.The lack of clinical skills in reception and obstetric risk classification among nursing students has prompted the use of innovative educational technologies.

Abstract: Advances in health professions education increasingly emphasize the use of digital technologies to enhance student engagement and support diverse learning needs. In physiotherapy training, particularly in technically complex subjects like electrotherapy, conventional instruction may fall short in fostering active learning and knowledge retention. Game-based platforms such as Ren'Py offer an opportunity to integrate interactive, scenario-based learning into the curriculum. This study aimed to assess the impact of Ren'Py-based digital materials on learning outcomes by comparing conventional, digital, and hybrid teaching models in an undergraduate electrotherapy course. BACKGROUND Advances in health professions education increasingly emphasize the use of digital technologies to enhance student engagement and support diverse learning needs. In physiotherapy training, particularly in technically complex subjects like electrotherapy, conventional instruction may fall short in fostering active learning and knowledge retention. Game-based platforms such as Ren'Py offer an opportunity to integrate interactive, scenario-based learning into the curriculum. This study aimed to assess the impact of Ren'Py-based digital materials on learning outcomes by comparing conventional, digital, and hybrid teaching models in an undergraduate electrotherapy course.This single-blind, three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted between October-December 2024 at the Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation. Eighty second-year physiotherapy students who had not previously taken the course were randomly assigned via computerized sequence to one of three groups: Conventional Education Group (CEG, n = 23), Digital Education Group (DEG, n = 29), or Conventional and Digital Education Group (CaDEG, n = 28). Instructional delivery included theoretical and practical sessions, followed by theoretical and practical exams. Outcomes included exam scores, the Cognitive Load Scale, the Attitude Scale Towards the Physiotherapy Profession, and the Educational Materials Motivation Survey. The data were analyzed using SPSS 27.0 package program. The parametric ANOVA test was used for normally distributed data, and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for nonnormally distributed data. Post-hoc analyses were performed using the Bonferroni test for normally distributed data and the Dunn-Bonferroni test for non-normally distributed data. A p < 0.05 level of significance was accepted for all findings.

Post-hoc analyses were performed using the Bonferroni test for normally distributed data and the Dunn-Bonferroni test for non-normally distributed data. A p < 0.05 level of significance was accepted for all findings.Theoretical exam scores were similar between groups (CI(95%) = 0.00 to 0.07; p = 0.616), but practical exam scores were significantly different (CI(95%) = 0.03 to 0.30; p < 0.001); both CEG and CaDEG performed better than DEG (CI(95%) = 2.22 to 18.01, p = 0.007 and CI(95%)=-18.51 to -3.52, p = 0.002, respectively). In ASTPP scores, no significant difference was observed between the groups in pre-training, post-training, post-pre-training differences, and in within-group comparisons in any of the CEG, DEG and CaDEG groups (CI(95%) = 130.13 to 136.16, p = 0.858; CI(95%) = 131.91 to 137.08, p = 0.511; CI(95%)=-1.27 to 3.97, p = 0.852; CI(95%)=-4.59 to 3.63, p = 0.987; CI(95%)=-7.31 to 5.10, p = 0.335; CI(95%)=-5.22 to 0.57, p = 0.075, respectively). Cognitive load was significantly higher in the CEG group compared to DEG and CaDEG (CI(95%)=-2.04 to 0.09, p = 0.020; CI(95%)=-0.01 to 2.11, p = 0.016, respectively). IMMS scores were significantly higher in the CaDEG group than in CEG (CI(95%) = 1.77 to 30.32, p = 0.022). RESULTS Theoretical exam scores were similar between groups (CI(95%) = 0.00 to 0.07; p = 0.616), but practical exam scores were significantly different (CI(95%) = 0.03 to 0.30; p < 0.001); both CEG and CaDEG performed better than DEG (CI(95%) = 2.22 to 18.01, p = 0.007 and CI(95%)=-18.51 to -3.52, p = 0.002, respectively).

IMMS scores were significantly higher in the CaDEG group than in CEG (CI(95%) = 1.77 to 30.32, p = 0.022).Face-to-face and hybrid models were more effective than digital-only instruction for developing practical skills in physiotherapy education. The hybrid model also reduced cognitive load and increased motivation. These findings suggest that integrating tools like Ren'Py into conventional instruction may enhance learning when used as a complement. Further studies with larger samples and extended durations are recommended. CONCLUSION Face-to-face and hybrid models were more effective than digital-only instruction for developing practical skills in physiotherapy education. The hybrid model also reduced cognitive load and increased motivation. These findings suggest that integrating tools like Ren'Py into conventional instruction may enhance learning when used as a complement. Further studies with larger samples and extended durations are recommended.This study was retrospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT07274839).

Abstract: Physics education of students in disciplines in which physics is a minor subject faces various challenges such as the frequent students' perception as difficult and abstract, and the often limited intrinsic motivation and engagement of minor-subject students. Gamification and game-based learning methods, such as educational escape rooms, are discussed as potential solution approaches. We present the concept of an educational escape room for the physics education of minor-subject students. The concept was developed as a hybrid between a classical educational escape room with sequential physics puzzles and the motivational elements of modern European board games (Eurogames). For example, this includes a corresponding victory point system and optional puzzles (called Eurogame puzzles) to provide individual paths for players. In the context of a first pilot study, the concept was designed for and evaluated with students of veterinary medicine and aims to increase both engagement and knowledge retention. An advantage is the flexibility of choosing from a broad range of optional puzzles to fascinate and motivate students, taking into account individual preferences and improving educational escape rooms by decision-making skills. We have addressed the two questions of (i) the acceptance of the concept by the students and (ii) the increase in knowledge of the students. To answer (i), the students anonymously completed a feedback questionnaire to communicate their personal opinion of the elements of the concept. To answer (ii), an approach of 12 physics questions was chosen by testing puzzle-associated factual knowledge, neglecting possible beneficial increases in experimental skills or reduction in physics anxiety for the present, through a pre- and posttest. Both, (i) and (ii), could be answered positively. The concept was successfully and gratefully accepted by the students, while the learning gain was measurable.Physics education of students in disciplines in which physics is a minor subject faces various challenges such as the frequent students' perception as difficult and abstract, and the often limited intrinsic motivation and engagement of minor-subject students.

Abstract: Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming higher education by offering accessible tools that enhance comprehension and efficiency. While AI use in clinical decision-making is expanding, little research explores how Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) students use AI to support their academic learning. Objective: The aim of the study was to describe a DNP student's experience using a generative AI tool to supplement traditional study strategies and improve learning outcomes. Methods: This case narrative outlines how Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), an AI tool, was integrated into a first-year DNP student's daily study routines for concept simplification, reinforcement through repetition, and clarification of complex content. The approach is evaluated against academic performance, clinical feedback, and alignment with the American Association of Colleges of Nursing Essentials. Results: ChatGPT improved study efficiency, enhanced understanding of complex material, and supported academic and clinical performance. The tool aligned with core nursing competencies by promoting critical thinking, personalized learning, and ethical technology use. Conclusions: When used responsibly and verified against reliable sources, AI tools can supplement traditional learning methods in nursing education. Implications for Nursing: By using AI as a study tool, graduate-level nursing students can strengthen critical thinking, improve knowledge retention, and support the development of confident, self-directed advanced practice nurses who are prepared for modern clinical practice.Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming higher education by offering accessible tools that enhance comprehension and efficiency.

OBJECTIVES Disaster medicine (DM) prepares health care professionals to manage emergencies caused by significant societal disruptions. Training recent graduates and final-year students is an essential element of disaster preparedness. This review aims to examine the use of Virtual Simulation (VS) in undergraduate students' DM training.The research team searched Scopus, PubMed, WOS, and Scielo. The team followed the 6-step approach described by Mak to conduct Scoping Reviews. We identified 262 reports, and 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. We extracted and analyzed data, focusing on educational settings, professions involved, and intervention characteristics. The report followed PRISMA guidelines.

We identified 262 reports, and 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. We extracted and analyzed data, focusing on educational settings, professions involved, and intervention characteristics. The report followed PRISMA guidelines.The implementation of VS in DM training has been geographically concentrated, with most studies focused on nursing education. Most programs use virtual reality, with limited augmented or mixed reality integration, principally in nursing students. The training focused primarily on triage, disaster preparedness, evacuation, decontamination, improving knowledge retention, self-confidence, and decision-making.

The training focused primarily on triage, disaster preparedness, evacuation, decontamination, improving knowledge retention, self-confidence, and decision-making.Although VS has effectively enhanced technical skills and disaster preparedness, its use remains limited in undergraduate health education. Further research is needed to expand its application in interprofessional and non-nursing contexts, with deliberate practice principles to maximize efficiency. Integrating VS into community training can reduce costs and enhance large-scale emergency response. CONCLUSIONS Although VS has effectively enhanced technical skills and disaster preparedness, its use remains limited in undergraduate health education. Further research is needed to expand its application in interprofessional and non-nursing contexts, with deliberate practice principles to maximize efficiency. Integrating VS into community training can reduce costs and enhance large-scale emergency response.Disaster medicine (DM) prepares health care professionals to respond to emergencies that disrupt society. Training recent graduates and final-year students is crucial for preparedness, yet traditional methods often fail to provide hands-on experience. To bridge this gap, a scoping review explored the role of Virtual Simulation (VS) in DM training for undergraduate students. A team of 6 experts analyzed 262 studies, narrowing down to 17 relevant articles. Results revealed that VS is predominantly used in nursing education, focusing on triage, preparedness, evacuation, and decision-making key components in protecting both hospital resilience and community well-being. Programs largely relied on virtual reality, with minimal integration of augmented or mixed reality. Despite its potential to enhance skills and confidence, VS training seldom applied deliberate practice principles, limiting its effectiveness. Expanding VS adoption across health professions and incorporating deliberate practice could improve disaster preparedness, optimize resource use, and enhance community resilience, underscoring the need for further research and program development.Disaster medicine (DM) prepares health care professionals to respond to emergencies that disrupt society.

Abstract: To evaluate the effectiveness of integrating 3D digital holographic reconstruction and intraoperative navigation with case-based learning (CBL) in enhancing the educational outcomes of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy training for urology residents. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of integrating 3D digital holographic reconstruction and intraoperative navigation with case-based learning (CBL) in enhancing the educational outcomes of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy training for urology residents.A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Second People's Hospital of Hefei from August 2021 to May 2024. A total of 120 urology residents were randomly assigned to either a combined teaching group (3D holography + CBL, n = 60) or a conventional CBL-only group (n = 60). The experimental group utilized reconstructed CT/MRI DICOM data rendered into interactive holographic models via Microsoft HoloLens 2 for real-time anatomical visualization and intraoperative guidance. Key outcome measures included post-training performance (theoretical and practical scores), self-directed learning ability, teaching satisfaction, critical thinking disposition, and knowledge retention at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups.

Key outcome measures included post-training performance (theoretical and practical scores), self-directed learning ability, teaching satisfaction, critical thinking disposition, and knowledge retention at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups.The combined teaching group demonstrated significantly superior outcomes across all measured domains (P < 0.05). Post-training scores were higher in theoretical knowledge (44.58 ± 2.09 vs. 40.28 ± 2.96), practical skills (44.63 ± 2.69 vs. 40.00 ± 2.64), and total score (89.21 ± 4.33 vs. 80.28 ± 5.55). Additionally, the group showed enhanced self-directed learning (4.38 ± 0.74 vs. 3.07 ± 0.73), higher teaching satisfaction (4.30 ± 0.74 vs. 3.15 ± 0.58), and improved critical thinking, notably in analyticity and cognitive maturity. Longitudinal assessments revealed better knowledge retention at all time points, with 6-month total scores of 76.92 ± 2.25 vs. 60.77 ± 5.97. RESULTS The combined teaching group demonstrated significantly superior outcomes across all measured domains (P < 0.05).

This multimodal teaching model may serve as a valuable adjunct to traditional residency training frameworks. CONCLUSIONS Integrating 3D holographic reconstruction and intraoperative navigation into CBL teaching significantly improves urology residents' comprehension, critical thinking, surgical preparedness, and long-term knowledge retention during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy training. This multimodal teaching model may serve as a valuable adjunct to traditional residency training frameworks.

Abstract: Drawing on threat rigidity theory, this paper argues that the threat of knowledge loss gives rise to a threat rigidity effect in firms’ R&D function, that is, reduces their R&D dynamism. It further argues that the dampening of R&D dynamism is greater for firms more vulnerable to the threat of knowledge loss due to facing greater product market competition, yet lower for firms that can better respond to the threat due to having relatively higher absorptive capacity and/or greater financial slack. Using a sample of publicly listed US manufacturing firms tracked over a 15‐year observation period from 1991 to 2015 and leveraging the quasi‐natural experiment created by the staggered rejection of the inevitable disclosure doctrine (IDD) across fourteen US states, it empirically tests and finds support for the above hypotheses.

Abstract: Effective visualisation is crucial for interpreting and disseminating data in both professional and public domains. This study investigates the impact of colour hue and visualisation modes – static maps, short videos, and augmented reality (AR) animations – on knowledge accuracy (KA), cognitive evaluation, and emotional response using January 2022 COVID-19 data from the continental U.S. Participants (N = 105) viewed maps depicting COVID-19 cases or vaccination rates in each mode and in either red or green hues. Results indicate that negative emotional impact was greater for static compared to video mode, but only in the green condition, while KA improved for static mode in both colour conditions and for AR in the red condition. Cognitive evaluations were not significantly affected by mode or colour. A second model with KA as outcome and including surprise and cognitive evaluation as mediators showed that static mode associated with improved KA, with surprise positively associated with KA scores, but only in video mode. The results suggest insights into effective health data visualisation strategies and the potential of AR technology for enhancing knowledge retention and engagement.

Abstract: Power-FULL Biofilms is a 5-week, hands-on outreach workshop designed to introduce KS2 students (ages 7+) to microbiology, electricity, and renewable energy. Students build their own microbial fuel cells (MFCs) using inexpensive plastic components and then inoculate these with mud from their school playground. The MFCs are fed with a simple food source and monitored as an electroactive biofilm develops; they produce electrical current. In the final session, the MFCs are connected together to power a small electronic device, proving we can get power from the playground. This activity builds on previous outreach initiatives like Powerful Soil and Blast a Biofilm , adapting complex microbiological ideas into a fun, age-appropriate format. Sessions combine structured instruction with storytelling, vocabulary development, and hands-on experimentation. Conducting the workshop at a UK primary school showed high levels of engagement and knowledge retention. Teachers praised the balance between challenge and support, and students responded enthusiastically to using real scientific equipment and terms, a way to introduce foundational science, technology, engineering, and mathematics concepts through real-world experimentation.Power-FULL Biofilms is a 5-week, hands-on outreach workshop designed to introduce KS2 students (ages 7+) to microbiology, electricity, and renewable energy.

Abstract: Pelvic Floor Disorders (PFDs) are common and negatively affect women's quality of life. Despite availability of treatments, women often do not seek medical care. Patient knowledge is a known barrier to accessing care. It has been shown that knowledge of PFDs is lower in Canadian immigrant communities. We hypothesized that educating Cultural Health Brokers (CHBs) on PFD will significantly increase the CHBs' knowledge and empower them to effectively communicate this knowledge to their communities, improving awareness and access to care among immigrant women. INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Pelvic Floor Disorders (PFDs) are common and negatively affect women's quality of life. Despite availability of treatments, women often do not seek medical care. Patient knowledge is a known barrier to accessing care. It has been shown that knowledge of PFDs is lower in Canadian immigrant communities. We hypothesized that educating Cultural Health Brokers (CHBs) on PFD will significantly increase the CHBs' knowledge and empower them to effectively communicate this knowledge to their communities, improving awareness and access to care among immigrant women.We developed a "train-the-trainer" model on PFD knowledge for CHBs. Two workshops were held for 36 CHBs. Written material was produced in ten languages. CHB perspectives on the training was assessed with the Kirkpatrick model and knowledge retention was assessed with Prolapse and Incontinence Knowledge Questionnaires (PIKQ) pre and post workshops and at 1-year follow-up. METHODS We developed a "train-the-trainer" model on PFD knowledge for CHBs. Two workshops were held for 36 CHBs. Written material was produced in ten languages. CHB perspectives on the training was assessed with the Kirkpatrick model and knowledge retention was assessed with Prolapse and Incontinence Knowledge Questionnaires (PIKQ) pre and post workshops and at 1-year follow-up.Participants found that workshop content, the facilitators' knowledge, and delivery were appropriate. Participating in the workshop increased knowledge in urinary incontinence PIKQ score (9.6 ± 1.9 vs. 11.2 ± 0.9; p = 0.0003); and prolapse (7.8 ± 2.4 vs. 9.8 ± 1.4; p < 0.0005). The 1-year follow-up survey revealed that over 80% of CHBs felt empowered to discuss PFD with clients, and 80% of CHBs believed that the training empowered clients to seek care. RESULTS Participants found that workshop content, the facilitators' knowledge, and delivery were appropriate. Participating in the workshop increased knowledge in urinary incontinence PIKQ score (9.6 ± 1.9 vs. 11.2 ± 0.9; p = 0.0003); and prolapse (7.8 ± 2.4 vs. 9.8 ± 1.4; p < 0.0005). The 1-year follow-up survey revealed that over 80% of CHBs felt empowered to discuss PFD with clients, and 80% of CHBs believed that the training empowered clients to seek care.The "train-the-trainer" model was well received by our community partners and improved PFD knowledge in CHBs. We expect this will result in increased knowledge of PFDs among immigrant women and better access to care for this population. CONCLUSIONS The "train-the-trainer" model was well received by our community partners and improved PFD knowledge in CHBs. We expect this will result in increased knowledge of PFDs among immigrant women and better access to care for this population.

Abstract: Medical education continues to favor didactic lectures as the predominant method of instruction. However, in recent years, there has been a shift toward active learning methodologies such as gamification. Background Medical education continues to favor didactic lectures as the predominant method of instruction. However, in recent years, there has been a shift toward active learning methodologies such as gamification.This study aimed to describe the implementation of 3 open-access, web-based pharmacology games tailored for medical students: Cross DRUGs, Find the DRUG, and DRUGs Escape Room. The study also evaluated the impact of gamification on knowledge retention, student engagement, and learning experience in pharmacology education. Objective This study aimed to describe the implementation of 3 open-access, web-based pharmacology games tailored for medical students: Cross DRUGs, Find the DRUG, and DRUGs Escape Room. The study also evaluated the impact of gamification on knowledge retention, student engagement, and learning experience in pharmacology education.We used a quasi-experimental design to examine the effects of gamification on knowledge retention by comparing pretest and posttest scores between the gamer and control groups. Each week, students self-selected into either the gamer group or the control group based on personal preference. All students were provided with online access to the same lecture slides. Students in the control group completed both the pretest and posttest but did not play any of the games. A survey was administered to assess students' perceptions of gamification as a learning tool. Methods We used a quasi-experimental design to examine the effects of gamification on knowledge retention by comparing pretest and posttest scores between the gamer and control groups. Each week, students self-selected into either the gamer group or the control group based on personal preference. All students were provided with online access to the same lecture slides. Students in the control group completed both the pretest and posttest but did not play any of the games. A survey was administered to assess students' perceptions of gamification as a learning tool.Of the 72 students enrolled in the course, 49 (68%) agreed to participate, with 40 (56%) students completing both the pretest and posttest and being included in our analysis. As participation could vary weekly, an individual student might have appeared in both groups across different weeks, resulting in 59 gamer sessions and 20 control sessions. The mean pretest scores were 6.05 (SD 2.31) for the control group and 6.20 (SD 2.13) for the gamer group. The mean posttest scores were 6.90 (SD 2.02) for the control group and 8.47 (SD 1.30) for the gamer group. The gamer group exhibited significantly improved posttest scores (P=.006), while the control group did not (P=.21). Most respondents (25/30, 83%) found the games enjoyable and agreed that the games effectively helped them understand pharmacological concepts (24/30, 80%). Additionally, 70% (21/30) of students believed they learned better from the gaming format than from didactic lectures. Most favored a blended approach that combines lectures with games or case studies.

Abstract: Objective This study investigates the integration of psychological principles—namely Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)—within digital training frameworks aimed at tourism talent development. It focuses on how such integration enhances learning motivation, optimizes cognitive load regulation, and mitigates mental health issues including chronic stress and decision fatigue among students. Subjects and Methods A mixed-methods design was adopted, incorporating quantitative and qualitative approaches. The quantitative strand involved surveying 386 vocational students enrolled in digital tourism programs using validated instruments—SDT-derived motivation scales and the NASA-TLX for cognitive load—along with measures for stress and fatigue. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 industry and educational experts to gain contextual insights into cognitive and emotional challenges in digital learning environments. Results Analysis revealed that training designs stimulating intrinsic motivation led to a 32% increase in task efficiency and significantly reduced cognitive overload (β = –0.41, p <.01). Autonomy-supportive methods were found to mediate decision fatigue effectively (mediation effect: 58%, F = 12.73, p <.001). In contrast, environments dominated by extrinsic pressure raised cognitive strain, resulting in a 24% decrease in task retention. Furthermore, gamified mindfulness interventions substantially alleviated anxiety by 19% and improved knowledge retention by 37%. Conclusions These findings underscore the importance of embedding psychological principles into digital pedagogy to support both cognitive performance and mental well-being. Effective balancing of motivational elements and cognitive load is crucial for sustaining mental health and enhancing educational outcomes in tourism training. Further cross-cultural validation is recommended to generalize the applicability of these results.

Abstract: Background Distal radius fractures (DRFs) are among the most common orthopedic injuries and are often challenging for students to fully understand when taught using only 2D radiographs or healthy models. This study aimed to evaluate the educational impact of tomography-based 3DP DRF models on medical students’ knowledge acquisition and anatomical understanding compared with conventional teaching methods. Methods The study was designed as a parallel-group, single-blinded prospective randomized controlled trial conducted over two days of structured education. Ninety-four second year physiotherapy students (19.62 ± 1.2 years; 45 F, 49 M) were enrolled and randomly assigned into intervention ( n  = 47) and control ( n  = 47) groups. The intervention group received tomography-based fracture 3DP training, while the control group received a healthy 3D-printed model. Primary outcomes included theoretical knowledge (MCQs) and practical case-solving. Secondary outcomes were Test-Taking Motivation Questionnaire (TTMQ); Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI), puzzle assembly time, satisfaction, and willingness-to-recommend ratings. Assessments were conducted pre- and post-training, with knowledge retention re-assessed at one month after education. Statistical analyses were performed using independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests for between-group comparisons, paired t-tests for within-group changes. Results The intervention group included 47 students (19.51 ± 1.1 years; 36 F, 11 M), while the control group consisted of 47 students (19.74 ± 1.3 years; 33 F, 14 M). Demographic characteristics were similar between the groups. In the 3D group, theoretical knowledge scores improved (50.68 [45.34, 55.93], p  < .001), TTMQ scores increased (28.06 [24.22, 31.91], p  < .001), and TAI scores decreased (–10.89 [–14.33, − 7.46], p  < .001). Similarly, in the control group, theoretical knowledge scores improved (49.46 [44.86, 54.03], p  < .001), TTMQ scores increased (21.60 [17.13, 26.06], p  < .001), and TAI scores decreased (–9.70 [–14.35, − 5.05], p  < .001). Post-training comparisons showed that the intervention group achieved significantly higher scores in case-solving (–18.55 [–23.87, − 13.23], p  < .001), MCQ performance (4.17 [0.15, 8.18], p  = .042), puzzle assembly time (11.34 [4.24, 18.44], p  = .002), TTMQ (8.04 [3.20, 12.87], p  = .030), and TAI (–4.42 [–7.54, − 1.30], p  = .030). No significant between-group differences were observed for color recognition ( p  = .301), weight identification ( p  = .161), detail recognition ( p  = .669), or knowledge retention ( p  = .160). Conclusions Within the limits of this study, tomography-based fracture-specific 3D printed models led to greater improvements in knowledge, motivation, reduced anxiety, and better practical performance compared with conventional teaching methods. These models showed educational benefits; further research is needed to confirm long-term and clinical impacts. Trial registration clinicaltrials.gov NCT06061003 24/09/2023.

Abstract: Background Understanding pathophysiology and pharmacology is essential for nursing students to ensure safe medication administration and clinical decision-making. In response, an integrated course was developed to help students translate theory into practice and build the competencies required for safe, effective care. Objective This main aim was to identify strengths, challenges, and the practical applicability of acquired knowledge to inform targeted instructional improvements. Methods This study used a cross-sectional survey among nurses’ student at Umm Al-Qura University (UQU) during the 2024/2025 academic year, to evaluate students’ perceptions of the integrated pathophysiology and pharmacology (IPP) course. Data was collected using a validated questionnaire covering four domains: course content and difficulty, general pharmacology, general pathophysiology, and medication management. Statistical analyses involved Fisher’s exact test, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and internal-consistency assessment with Cronbach’s alpha. Results Of 236 eligible students, 150 participated (63.6%). Most agreed the course was appropriate (86%), the content was manageable (81%), and delivery was satisfactory (89%). 72% felt confident applying pharmacology concepts in clinical scenarios. Notably, 62% agreed they could recall drug names, side effects, and contraindications, the weakest measurement relative to other areas, highlighting a memorization gap. Higher GPA and longer weekly study time were independently associated with better understanding across all of the domains ( p  < 0.05). Conclusion The integrated course improved nursing students’ understanding and application of pharmacology, highlighting the need for strategies that reinforce knowledge retention strategies. Thus, this may reduce stress and resilience which remains a key factor of performance during clinical placements.

Abstract: Background The integration of intelligent technologies in surgical nursing education offers opportunities to enhance learning outcomes and address challenges in mastering complex topics. Knowledge graphs serve as a visual and interactive learning tool. It represents a novel approach to improving systematic thinking and enhancing knowledge retention in blended teaching models. Aim This study explored nursing undergraduates’ experiences with a knowledge graph platform in surgical nursing education, focusing on perceptions of its usefulness and ease of use, factors influencing engagement, and suggestions for improvement. Methods A qualitative descriptive study approach was employed to investigate the experiences of 13 nursing students. Semi-structured interviews were conducted after completing a surgical nursing course. The interviews were guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis to identify key themes related to knowledge graph use. Results The analysis identified three main themes: (1) Developing conceptual clarity through knowledge integration, where knowledge graphs helped students build systematic thinking, discover learning pathways, and enhance post-class review efficiency; (2) Stimulating interest through enriched content, where enriched and well-organized content increased students’ interest and enthusiasm for independent study; and (3) Navigating challenges and envisioning opportunities, where participants reported technical and access limitations, a need for richer content, and requests for clearer usage guidance. Conclusion Knowledge graphs offer innovative intelligent technology integration within blended nursing education. These tools cultivate systematic thinking, enhance surgical nursing knowledge and skill development, and enrich the comprehensive learning experience. Future studies should explore sustained educational outcomes, broaden technological capabilities, and examine cross-contextual adaptability.

Abstract: Introduction Immersive virtual reality (IVR) based on head-mounted displays (HMD), can construct virtual learning environments for medical education. This study aims to explore the application and effectiveness of IVR in medical education. Methods This review followed the PRISMA guidelines and searched the databases of Web of Science, Springer Link, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Science Direct for controlled experimental studies published between January 1 2017 and October 1, 2025 on the application of IVR to medical education. Results 36 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Among them 34 reported significantly better objective learning outcomes and 29 showed more positive subjective feedback. The findings suggest that IVR is particularly effective in areas such as clinical surgery training, anatomy education, medical skill development, and nursing education. IVR demonstrates long-term effects in medical knowledge acquirement. Conclusions The systematic review reveals that IVR is particularly effective in practice-based medical education. It highlights that VR demonstrates superior long-term knowledge retention and knowledge enhancement. A comprehensive evaluation of IVR use in medical education requires additional perspectives from teachers, and consideration from the dark side of IVR, i.e., technology-induced stress and time. Future IVR implementation in medical education calls for more efforts to address challenges in user adaptability, cost, privacy and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Background The integrated clinical case approach connects foundational medical concepts to real-life clinical scenarios, encouraging active problem-solving and interdisciplinary thinking. In contrast, traditional lecture-based teaching often presents subjects in isolation, without emphasizing clinical relevance. This study explores the potential impact of Early Clinical Exposure (ECE) through integrated clinical cases on biochemistry learning among Phase I MBBS students. Materials and methods background The integrated clinical case approach connects foundational medical concepts to real-life clinical scenarios, encouraging active problem-solving and interdisciplinary thinking. In contrast, traditional: After obtaining informed consent, 100 Phase I MBBS students were randomly allocated into two groups: an ECE group and a non-ECE (traditional lecture-based) group, using a computer-generated random number table to minimize allocation bias. Both groups underwent pre-test and post-test assessments comprising multiple-choice questions (MCQs) (15 marks) and problem-based learning (PBL) questions (10 marks) designed to assess knowledge retention and application. A validated perception questionnaire was also administered post-intervention to gather students’ self-reported feedback on the learning experience. Results Both groups demonstrated statistically significant improvement in post-test scores compared to pre-test scores ( p  < 0.001). The ECE group achieved higher mean post-test scores in MCQ (9.34 ± 1.45) and PBL (6.89 ± 0.99) compared to the non-ECE group (MCQ: 7.24 ± 1.29; PBL: 5.72 ± 0.73). An ANCOVA controlling for pre-test scores confirmed that these between-group differences in post-test scores were statistically significant for both MCQs (F(1,97) = 55.2, p  < 0.001) and PBL scores (F(1,97) = 38.1, p  < 0.001), indicating a significant effect of the intervention. Responses from the perception questionnaire indicated that most students felt ECE improved their understanding of biochemistry’s clinical relevance and enhanced motivation. Between 94% and 98% of students agreed that ECE helped them connect biochemistry concepts with clinical cases and aided content retention. However, these outcomes were subjective perceptions, not objectively measured indicators of engagement or motivation. Conclusion The findings indicate that ECE was associated with improved knowledge retention and application of biochemistry concepts in clinical contexts compared to traditional lecture-based learning. While students reported increased motivation and appreciation of clinical relevance, these perceptions were self-reported and should be interpreted cautiously. Objective, long-term measures of engagement, clinical reasoning, and performance are recommended in future studies to substantiate these observations.

Abstract: Introduction Opportunities to practice ultrasound-guided/assisted (USGA) neuraxial techniques in pediatric patients are limited due to the high-risk nature and anatomical variability of this population. Simulation-based education offers a safe and effective method for trainees to develop competence in these challenging procedures. Methods We developed a curriculum using a previously validated, shelf-stable pediatric spine phantom designed to replicate sonographic anatomy. Pediatric anesthesiology trainees participated in a structured workshop that included pre-workshop online content, a hands-on scanning session, and a three-minute skills assessment. Participants completed identical pre-, post-, and six-month or more follow-up quizzes consisting of 14 knowledge-based questions and items assessing comfort and practice behavior. Paired-samples t-tests were used to compare mean percent correct scores between pre- and post-intervention and between pre- and follow-up assessments. To control for multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni correction was applied (adjusted α=0.025). Analyses were verified using R software (version 4.4.0). Descriptive statistics evaluated shifts in comfort and behavior. Results Twenty-six trainees (13 fellows, 13 residents) enrolled; 20 completed the full curriculum, and 18 completed follow-up assessment. Participants demonstrated significant improvement from pre- to post-workshop ( t (27)=-5.72, p <.001, d =1.15, large), with sustained knowledge retention at follow-up ( t (27)=-4.15, p <.001, d =0.63, medium); similar trends were observed among fellows and residents, indicating consistent learning gains across training levels. All workshop attendees demonstrated proficiency in obtaining six critical neuraxial ultrasound views. Self-reported comfort and frequency of ultrasound use increased across all groups, with positive trends sustained at follow-up. Participant feedback was uniformly favorable. Conclusions A phantom-based, simulation-enhanced curriculum significantly improved and sustained pediatric regional anesthesia knowledge, technical skills (based on end-of-workshop assessment), comfort, and reported use of ultrasound for neuraxial procedures in pediatric anesthesia trainees, demonstrating durable learning gains and strong educational impact. This low-risk, reproducible educational model may help institutions implement structured training in USGA neuraxial techniques and promote broader adoption of ultrasound in pediatric regional anesthesia. Future multicenter validation should evaluate its generalizability across diverse training environments.Introduction Opportunities to practice ultrasound-guided/assisted (USGA) neuraxial techniques in pediatric patients are limited due to the high-risk nature and anatomical variability of this population.

Abstract: Introduction Medical virology requires students to master complex concepts in a limited timeframe, yet traditional lectures often struggle to sustain engagement and ensure long-term retention. Serious games have emerged as promising tools to promote active learning. Building on the success of BacteriaGame, ViroGame was developed to reinforce virology knowledge through gamification. This study evaluated its effectiveness in enhancing student engagement, knowledge mobilization, and supervisor-perceived feasibility for curricular integration. Materials and methods A total of 318 learners participated in ViroGame sessions during the 2023–2024 academic year. Of these, 266 students/residents completed a structured questionnaire assessing with likert scale [1, 2, 3, 4–5] gameplay fluidity, knowledge consolidation, perceived difficulty and potential integration with BacteriaGame. Nine supervisors also provided evaluations on rule clarity, session management and educational value. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann–Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests, with qualitative feedback examined thematically. Results Residents rated gameplay fluidity significantly higher than students (4.4/5 vs. 4.1/5; p  = 0.039). Both groups reported high knowledge mobilization scores (students 4.5/5; residents 4.3/5; p  = 0.378). Nearly half perceived some content as exceeding expected knowledge, despite alignment with national standards (47.4% vs. 41.8%; p  = 0.482). A greater proportion of students than residents reported difficulties with virological concepts (78.9% vs. 60.3%; p  = 0.021), particularly regarding diagnostic methods and viral structures. Supervisors rated the game positively, endorsing its use primarily as a revision tool. Discussion ViroGame is a well-received, effective and engaging tool for teaching medical virology. It promotes active learning, collaboration and knowledge retention while addressing the inherent complexity of virology. Further controlled studies are planned to evaluate its long-term impact on learning outcomes and exam performance.

Abstract: Background Virtual Simulation Experiments (VSE) are increasingly applied in medical education, yet their role in medical microbiology remains underexplored. This study evaluated a VSE system designed for the isolation, culture, and identification of enteric pathogens, framed by Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). Methods Ninety medical students were randomly assigned to either a VSE group or a traditional teaching group. Outcomes were assessed through operational skill and knowledge tests, supplemented by qualitative feedback. Results The VSE group achieved higher scores in operational skills (89.6 ± 5.2 vs. 81.8 ± 6.3, p  < 0.01) and knowledge retention (87.4 ± 4.4 vs. 81.8 ± 5.0, p  < 0.01). Students reported that VSE’ immersive environment and instant feedback enhanced satisfaction and autonomy, aligning with SDT. Conclusions VSE significantly improved learning outcomes in medical microbiology and promoted intrinsic motivation. These findings provide empirical support for integrating VSE into medical curricula and highlight the need for further research on its long-term and broader educational impact.

Abstract: Background The use of electronic or digital resources has been shown to be effective in improving knowledge retention and skills development through many fields of medical education. Few systematic reviews have studied the effects of electronic learning (‘e-learning’) compared to traditional learning methods in anaesthesia education. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies assessing learning outcomes from e-learning modalities compared to ‘traditional’, face-to-face or didactic teaching methods. Methods Medical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC, Scopus, CENTRAL, Google Scholar) were searched for applicable studies from January 2002 to January 2023 on the 12th of February 2023. Studies comparing an ‘e-learning arm’ against a ‘traditional learning’ arm including anaesthetic doctors of any level within the study population were considered and assessed for inclusion. The systematic review tool Covidence™ was utilised to track studies for inclusion, results were synthesised be each reviewer prior to independent assessment for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool ‘RoB-2’. Results Our search strategy identified 1681 papers for review. Thirteen studies were deemed eligible for inclusion, assessing 572 health practitioners at varying stages of their clinical careers. Four eligible studies showed a statistically significant difference in their primary outcomes favouring e-learning, while one study found e-learning non-inferior to traditional learning. Three studies found a statistically significant change in favour of traditional learning and the remaining five studies did not find a significant difference when comparing e-learning and traditional learning. Qualitative analysis of various secondary outcomes (where applicable) found considerable variation regarding participant preference in favour of both traditional and e-learning models. Conclusion E-learning is an important adjunct to traditional learning methods and when undertaken in the appropriate clinical teaching context, outcomes from e-learning programs can outperform those from traditional learning methodologies. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the research and shows no consistent benefit to either e-learning or traditional learning. Further research is required to explore the most effective teaching contexts and the efficient implementation of different e-learning modalities in anaesthesia.

Abstract: Background Artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into health professions education, but evidence regarding their application in physiotherapy remains limited. This study aims to investigate the impact of AI-assisted problem-based learning (AI-PBL) on theoretical knowledge, clinical competence, AI self-efficacy, internet addiction, and reading motivation compared with traditional PBL. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted with undergraduate physiotherapy students assigned to AI-PBL or PBL groups. Participants completed assessments before, immediately after, and two weeks after the group intervention. Outcome measures included a theoretical knowledge test, the Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise (Mini-CEX), the AI ​​Self-Efficacy Scale (AI-SES), the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), and the Adult Reading Motivation Scale (ARMS). Results Forty students were randomized equally into two groups: AI-PBL ( n  = 20) and traditional PBL ( n  = 20). Both groups showed significant improvements in knowledge and reading motivation. The AI-PBL group showed significantly greater improvement in knowledge retention at 2 weeks (Cohen’s d  = 3.14) and greater gains in AI self-efficacy. Although Mini-CEX scores were higher in the AI-PBL group, the differences between groups were not statistically significant. No significant increase in internet addiction was observed in the AI-PBL group. Conclusion These findings emphasize that supervised, structured use of generative AI in education can enhance sustained learning and digital self-efficacy without posing behavioral risks. The AI-PBL approach appears to foster active reflection, self-directed learning, and deeper academic engagement offering a promising direction for digital innovation in physiotherapy education. Future studies should explore long-term outcomes, track behavioral engagement, and further validate the benefits of AI-enhanced instructional strategies. Trial registration Prior to the initiation of the study, the protocol was registered on https//www.clinicaltrials.gov/, and registration status was made publicly available (Identifier NCT07010991 Date 08.06.2025). ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07010991?term=NCT07010991&rank=1 ).

Abstract: Background In Oral Pathology, traditional slide-based teaching methods often focus on passive observation which may not completely ignite the pathology resident’s critical thinking and diagnostic capabilities. Hence we designed and evaluated a modified teaching method which was integrating Problem-Based Learning (PBL) with Six Thinking Hats (STH) methodology in enhancing diagnostic skills in the assessment of diagnostically challenging cases. Methods A cohort of n  = 15 Oral Pathology residents were included for the study. Their diagnostic accuracy, critical thinking, and knowledge retention were assessed through traditional slide-based teaching and a PBL integrated with STH approach. The PBL-STH framework engaged residents in a multi-perspective analysis of clinical data, histopathological features, and immunohistochemical markers (e.g., CD20, CD138), using structured group discussions based on the six thinking hats to foster collaborative decision-making. Results Diagnostic accuracy significantly improved with the PBL-STH method, with 86.6% of residents accurately diagnosing DLBCL compared to 40% in traditional teaching. Critical thinking and risk analysis were markedly higher with PBL-STH (93.3% vs. 30%), and peer collaboration was observed in all PBL-STH sessions. Additionally, knowledge retention after two weeks was better among residents trained with the PBL-STH approach (90% vs. 55%), and overall satisfaction was significantly higher (93% vs. 50%). Conclusion The PBL integrated with STH approach offers substantial benefits over traditional teaching methods, improving diagnostic accuracy, critical thinking, engagement, and knowledge retention in Oral Pathology. This innovative methodology encourages deeper analysis and collaboration, proving to be a highly effective educational tool for complex diagnostic cases especially in oral pathology which is the backbone for treatment, follow up, prognosis and quality of life of patients Also, implementation of PBL-STH in medical and dental curricula could enhance clinical reasoning and diagnostic skills across specialties.

Abstract: Background The Kazakh people of Altay, Xinjiang, possess rich traditional knowledge associated with medicinal food plants (MFPs), shaped by their nomadic pastoralist heritage and the unique mountain-grassland ecosystems of the region. However, this biocultural heritage remains insufficiently documented and is increasingly threatened by human’s economic activities, rapid globalization, climate change, and generational knowledge loss. This study aimed to record MFPs, evaluate their cultural and ecological relevance, and assess their conservation challenges. Methods Ethnobotanical fieldwork was conducted in 2012 and 2017 across Altay Prefecture. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews with 100 key informants, including traditional healers, herders, and merchants, complemented by focal group discussions, field observations, and voucher specimen collection. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Herbarium of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ethnomedicine (XJNM). Use-value (UV) index was calculated to assess the relative importance of each species. Traditional knowledge, edible applications, and sustainability concerns were systematically documented. Results A total of 118 MFP species were identified, belonging to 37 families and 85 genera. Rosaceae (12.7%), Asteraceae (7.6%), Polygonaceae (7.6%) and Fabaceae (7.6%) were the most represented families. Herbaceous plants dominated (69.5%), with fruits (33.9%) and roots (20.3%) being the primary edible parts. Species with the highest medicinal UV included Glycyrrhiza uralensis (UV = 0.56), Taraxacum officinale (UV = 0.41), and Codonopsis pilosula (UV = 0.34). MFPs were primarily used to treat digestive (26.1%) and respiratory (17.7%) ailments, reflecting the health challenges associated with a nomadic lifestyle. These plants are also deeply embedded in cultural practices, including seasonal dietary customs (e.g., sea buckthorn jam), spiritual rituals, and ecological taboos such as phenology-based harvest timing. Key threats to MFPs sustainability include overharvesting (30.5% of species are now cultivated to mitigate pressure), climate change impacts on alpine habitats, and the erosion of traditional knowledge, as only 9% of informants with rich knowledge of MFPs were under the age of 30. Conclusions Kazakh MFPs represent a culturally integrated “medicine-food continuum” intricately adapted to local ecological conditions. Sustainable utilization requires the incorporation of traditional knowledge—such as phenology-informed harvesting practices—into conservation strategies, the promotion of community-led cultivation of vulnerable species, and the documentation of associated cultural practices. Given accelerating environmental and sociocultural shifts, urgent efforts are needed to preserve this fragile biocultural heritage.

Abstract: Background The integration of gamification in educational settings has emerged as an innovative strategy to enhance student engagement and knowledge retention, particularly in complex fields like dentistry. This descriptive, survey-based study investigates the impact of gamified lectures on the learning experiences of undergraduate dental students in endodontic instrument education. Methods By incorporating interactive elements such as real-time quizzes, live polls, and immediate feedback, the research explores how gamification can transform traditional passive learning environments. The study involved undergraduate dental students and employed a structured survey questionnaire to assess engagement, knowledge retention, and student perceptions. Results Quantitative analysis using SPSS revealed significant findings: 56.6% of students rated the lectures as "very engaging" or "extremely engaging", and 66% reported that gamification significantly contributed to their understanding of the subject matter. Correlation analyses demonstrated positive relationships between engagement, retention, and satisfaction, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.535 (p = 0.003) to 0.621 (p < 0.01). The results underscore the potential of gamification in dental education, particularly in enhancing student engagement and perceived understanding. However, the findings reflect short-term, self-reported outcomes and do not yet confirm long-term knowledge retention, which warrants further investigation. Conclusion The results underscore the potential of gamification in dental education, highlighting its effectiveness in motivating active participation and improving learning outcomes. By providing empirical evidence of gamification's benefits, this study contributes valuable insights for curriculum development and innovative pedagogical approaches in health professions education.

Abstract: Background Standardized training for orthopedic and traumatology residents is a crucial component of postgraduate medical education. Traditional teaching methods, such as Lecture-Based Learning (LBL), often fail to stimulate student initiative and clinical thinking. To address this, our study aimed to explore the effectiveness of a combined Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Standardized Patients (SP) teaching method in enhancing the clinical skills and self-learning abilities of orthopedic residents. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 59 orthopedic residents from three medical institutions in China. The participants were randomly divided into a control group ( n  = 29) receiving traditional LBL combined with SP and a study group ( n  = 30) receiving PBL combined with SP. Both groups were instructed on common orthopedic diseases for 21 h. Teaching effectiveness was assessed through self-designed electronic questionnaires, classroom performance metrics, and final exams. Results Compared with the control group, the study group demonstrated significantly greater levels of self-study initiative, teamwork ability, classroom learning efficiency, learning interest, and clinical processing ability ( P  < 0.05). The study group also showed greater improvement in their ability to handle clinical problems and had higher postclass knowledge retention and learning interest scores ( P  < 0.05). Practical exam scores and overall scores were significantly higher in the study group ( P  < 0.05), although written exam scores did not differ significantly. Conclusions The combined PBL and SP teaching method was found to be superior to traditional LBL in improving the clinical skills and self-learning abilities of orthopedic residents. This approach enhances student engagement, clinical thinking, and overall educational outcomes, suggesting that it is a valuable addition to orthopedic resident training programs.

Abstract: Objective Emergency medical service (EMS) professionals are increasingly using point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) into the prehospital management and triage of critically ill patients. However, few institutions offer organized POCUS training for this community. Our goal was to offer and evaluate the effectiveness of a simulation-based POCUS course for EMS professionals. Methods We developed and implemented an eight-hour course to train EMS providers in the fundamentals of POCUS for blunt trauma patients. The course design included lectures, standardized patients hands-on scanning, simulation-based ultrasound cases, clinical cases based on real patients, and an end-of-course review game. Before the day of the course, participants were assigned e-learning modules on the fundamentals of POCUS and on the Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma Exam (eFAST). The effectiveness of the course was evaluated using Kirkpatrick’s methodology for Level 1 (course evaluation by participants) and Level 2 (pre- and post-course knowledge assessments including image interpretation). Pre- and post-knowledge scores were presented using means and ranges. Percent improvements and a paired sample t-test with the effect size (Cohen’s d) were used to compare pre-post improvements. For course evaluation ratings, the mean Likert scale rating was calculated. Results A total of 128 learners (103 paramedics, 22 flight nurses, and one EMS physician from 32 EMS agencies, as well as two United States Army medics, completed the course. The average age of participants was 39.0 years, and 98 (76.6%) were male. The pre-course assessment mean knowledge score was 67.6% (95% CI 64.7–70.5). The post-course mean knowledge score was 89.0% (95% CI 87.3–97.0), resulting in a 21.4% point increase ( p  <.001; Cohen’ s d  = 1.52). We received 122 course evaluations. Participants expressed nearly unanimous strong agreement across all measures, with a mean rating ranging from 4.8 to 4.9 on a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire. Conclusions Our data suggests that an 8-hour POCUS course, incorporating e-learning and simulation, can significantly improve EMS providers’ knowledge of the fundamentals of POCUS and image interpretation of eFAST examination in trauma patients. Course evaluation results are highly supportive of this course’s benefits. As EMS agencies increasingly incorporate POCUS for patient care, effective and efficient training methodologies will be critical for successful implementation. Our course offers one approach as part of a comprehensive training program. Further studies should assess POCUS utilization and sustained knowledge retention. Clinical trial number Not applicable.

Abstract: Background Learning about neurological syndromes is an essential component of medical education, but traditional teaching methods often lack interactivity and practical engagement. This study investigates the impact of an innovative teaching approach using the Neurological Syndrome Card Game (NSCG) on students’ learning outcomes. Methods A randomized controlled trial design was implemented, with participants divided into an experimental group and a control group. The control group received traditional lecture-based instruction (e.g., PowerPoint presentations and case analyses), whereas the experimental group engaged in NSCG-based learning. The game involved card-matching competitions and anatomical injury location tasks to enhance students’ recognition, understanding, and memory of neurological syndromes. Learning outcomes were evaluated through assessments of learning effectiveness, knowledge retention rates, cognitive load, and learning experience. Results A total of 48 students participated in the study. No significant differences were found in baseline characteristics between the groups. Following the intervention, the experimental group showed significantly better immediate learning effects at 1 week (13.33 ± 2.12 vs. 11.92 ± 1.44, t = 3.344, P  = 0.002), 3 weeks (12.83 ± 2.04 vs. 10.63 ± 1.86, t = 3.923, P  = 0.000), and 6 weeks (10.04 ± 1.20 vs. 7.79 ± 1.61, t = 5.484, P  = 0.000). In terms of long-term memory retention, the experimental group demonstrated superior knowledge retention rates at all time points: 22.53% at week 1, 29.49% at week 3, and 31.12% at week 6. Regarding cognitive load, the experimental group exhibited significantly lower total scores (46.96 ± 1.65 vs. 69.08 ± 4.06) and scores across all dimensions ( P  < 0.05). Evaluations of the learning experience indicated that students in the experimental group rated their interest and memory outcomes more positively. Conclusion The NSCG-based teaching method significantly enhances students’ learning and memory retention of neurological syndromes, reduces cognitive load, and increases learning interest. This method may be a useful approach for enhancing clinical syndrome teaching in medical education.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/combined-impact-ai-vr-on-interdisciplinary/docview/3292123778/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Introduction The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) in healthcare education offers innovative ways to enhance collaborative learning and improve patient safety. This narrative review examines the synergistic impact of AI-powered virtual reality (VR) simulations, such as those used in surgical training and patient communication, on knowledge acquisition, clinical skill development, and collaborative competencies among healthcare students. It also explores long-term knowledge retention, ethical considerations within virtual scenarios, and the psychological impact of high-stakes simulations on learner resilience. Methods This review is distinguished by its exhaustive literature search, which spanned PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, and other pertinent databases, to identify studies published between 2005 and 2024. The distinct focus on AI and VR interventions in healthcare education, particularly those with outcomes related to interdisciplinary learning or patient safety, distinguishes this review. Data were thematically analyzed across domains, including adaptive learning, technical skill development, teamwork, patient safety, and ethics. Results The findings of this review carry significant practical implications. Five key themes emerged: adaptive learning ( n  = 17), immersive skill development ( n  = 10), teamwork enhancement ( n  = 10), patient safety ( n  = 18), and ethical considerations ( n  = 21). These themes underscore the potential of AI and VR in healthcare education. AI-driven adaptive systems enabled personalized VR training, enhancing engagement and knowledge retention. Real-time AI feedback during simulations improved decision-making in safe, controlled environments. Interdisciplinary team simulations enhanced communication and collaboration, which are crucial for effective clinical care. Ethical modules embedded in VR scenarios promoted moral reasoning. Several studies also reported increased learner confidence in performing clinical procedures following VR training, suggesting enhanced preparedness for practice. Conclusion The integration of AI and VR holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare education, fostering personalized, immersive, and ethically informed learning. These technologies enhance technical proficiency and equip students with the complex demands of modern clinical practice. Strategic implementation can contribute to error reduction, improved patient outcomes, and a culture of safety. However, the journey is not over. Continued research is crucial for assessing the long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of these educational innovations, as well as for keeping pace with the rapidly evolving field of AI and VR in healthcare education.

Abstract: Background Medical educationists are concerned that the retention of basic science concepts weakens beyond the early years of medical programs, with clinicians rarely using basic sciences in clinical practice. This study was conducted to evaluate the knowledge retention of physiology courses in medical students at Kerman University of Medical Sciences. Methods This is a cross-sectional study at Kerman University of Medical Sciences. A retention test was conducted in physiology courses using multiple-choice questions. This study included 104 medical students who had completed their basic science courses. The students were in physiopathology, internship, and clerkship were selected. The mean and standard deviation were applied to analyze the data, and a two-sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, was performed with a significance level of P -value < 0.05. Results The results of this study in retention test scores showed that lost knowledge was revealed throughout the years. Additionally, the results showed that in three subjects—gastrointestinal, nervous system, and respiratory—the scores of students in Y1 were higher than those of students in other years. In the course of endocrinology, the highest mean score belonged to the students who entered medical school in Y4, and the difference in mean scores among the different groups was statistically significant ( P  < 0.001). The mean scores in the urinary system course achieved by the medical students are presented, with students who entered medical school in Y3 having the highest mean scores compared to those in other years. Conclusions The key takeaway is that knowledge retention is not passive; it requires active reinforcement through educational strategies.

Abstract: Background Active learning approaches that promote participation, critical thinking, and practical competency are becoming more and more necessary in medical and nursing education. Virtual reality (VR) and gamification, especially in the context of escape rooms, have become popular instructional technology in response to these issues. The interactive, scenario-based learning environments provided by these tools encourage motivation, teamwork, and decision-making. The impact and transformative possibilities of incorporating virtual reality and gamified escape rooms into medical and nursing education are examined in this paper. Methods The use of virtual reality (VR), gamification, and escape rooms in medical and nursing education was investigated using a thorough narrative literature review. In order to give a comprehensive and holistic overview of new subjects, this method was selected. Keywords like “escape room,” “digital escape room,” “online escape room,” “gamification,” “game-based education,” “virtual reality in medical education,” “medical student,” “nursing education,” “nursing student,” and “nursing staff” were used in the January 10, 2025, search across Web of Science, PubMed, ERIC, and Scopus. English-language publications from the past ten years that addressed virtual reality, gamification, or escape rooms in medical or nursing education were included in the inclusion criteria. Non-relevant papers, non-peer-reviewed literature, and research with unclear methodology or no empirical data were among the exclusion criteria. 25 studies were chosen for a thorough assessment after a rigorous screening process based on methodological rigor and relevance. Results The total number of retrieved articles in Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science on January 10, 2025, was 172. After removing 64 duplicate articles, 108 papers were screened by experts. After this investigation, 25 articles were extensively reviewed for the results section. The findings from the selected studies can be categorized into four main areas: enhancing clinical decision-making, improving teamwork and collaboration, increasing knowledge retention and engagement, and reducing stress in high-pressure scenarios. These studies, summarized in Table 1, highlight the effectiveness of escape rooms and VR-based training in medical and nursing education, particularly in emergency medicine, pharmacy, radiology, internal medicine, and psychiatry. Conclusion The integration of VR and gamified escape rooms in healthcare education presents a promising approach to improving clinical training and competency development among medical students, nursing students, and healthcare professionals. The findings underscore the need for further research and implementation of these tools to enhance experiential learning and optimize medical education outcomes. By leveraging gamification and VR simulations, medical training programs can bridge educational gaps and improve patient care delivery in both traditional and remote learning environments. Clinical trial number Not applicable.

Abstract: Background Generative AI technologies offer significant opportunities to enhance orthodontic education by improving knowledge retention, clinical decision-making, and skills training. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact of generative AI tools in orthodontic education, focusing on knowledge retention, decision-making, and practical skills. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, ERIC, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore from January 2010 to December 2023. Studies evaluating the integration of generative AI in dental and orthodontic education were included. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, with the GRADE approach used to evaluate evidence quality. Results Generative AI improved knowledge retention and clinical decision-making through adaptive learning pathways and real-time feedback. Barriers included limited faculty training, technical infrastructure deficits, and educator resistance. Conclusions Generative AI holds transformative potential for orthodontic education but requires addressing practical and ethical challenges. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to validate long-term impact and explore integration strategies.

Abstract: Background Major obstetric hemorrhage is the leading direct cause of maternal mortality throughout the world. To prevent maternal mortality, it is crucial to raise concerns regarding the knowledge and skill levels of the healthcare providers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of simulation-based learning on the knowledge retention and skills of health professionals managing postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in the maternity hospitals of a low-resource country. Methods This was a prospective randomized controlled study consisting of two groups: Control Group was made up of maternity hospital healthcare providers whose training was exclusively theory-based and Intervention Group healthcare providers who underwent simulation training in conjunction with theoretical instruction on diagnosing and managing PPH. The training modules were taken from the John Hopkins University Affiliate (JHPIEGO) Helping Mothers Survive version 2018 training program. The mean percentage of correct answers in MCQs and OSCEs was collected from pre-tests, immediate post-tests, and post-tests at 3- and 6-months post training. Results The post-test immediately after the theoretical training showed an increase in the mean MCQ percentages for both groups. From 47.5 to 66.7% for intervention group versus 49.6–69.6% for control group; no significant difference between the two groups ( p  = 0.285). After simulation training, for the interventional group, the mean percentage increased from 66.7 to 79.2%, an increase of approximately 12%. There was a regression in the mean percentage in both groups in the post-test at 3- and 6-months after the training, but it was much more pronounced in the control group, p  = 0.000. OSCE assessments revealed a statistically significant improvement in skills in interventional group compared to control group ( p  < 0.05). Knowledge and skills diminished over time in control group, bordering on pre-training levels at 6 months post training. The member team in the intervention group had maintained a high level of knowledge and skill 6 months after the training. Conclusion Simulation-based training has a part to play in training healthcare providers to manage post-partum hemorrhage. Training should be repeated after a period of 6 months to enhance knowledge and skill retention. Trial registration NCT05979701.

Abstract: Background Podcasts have become increasingly prominent as tools for health communication, offering flexible and accessible formats for patient education. While widely used in professional training, their role in supporting patient-centered learning remains underexplored. Methods This systematic review synthesized studies published from 2010 to 2024 concerning podcast use in patient education. Five databases—PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Embase—were searched using defined keywords. Studies were selected based on relevance to patient education through podcasts, and outcomes such as knowledge retention, comprehension, and engagement. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. Quality assessment was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the CASP checklist. A thematic synthesis approach was employed to analyze qualitative and quantitative findings. Results Of the twenty-one included studies, seven demonstrated improved patient knowledge retention, comprehension, and engagement through podcast use. Five studies emphasized accessibility and learner autonomy, highlighting the benefits of asynchronous and flexible delivery. Three studies explored the integration of podcasts with traditional teaching methods, showing positive outcomes when used as complementary tools. However, three studies identified challenges including content quality variability, limited production standards, and digital access disparities. Thematic synthesis categorized findings into four domains: educational effectiveness, integration with traditional education, accessibility and learner autonomy, and implementation challenges. Conclusions Podcasts represent a promising adjunct to patient education. Their effectiveness depends on thoughtful design, contextual relevance, and equitable delivery. Standardization, blended learning models, and ongoing evaluation are essential for maximizing their impact. Clinical trial number Not applicable.

Abstract: Background Medical residents often struggle with complex clinical scenarios that require sophisticated decision-making skills. While case-based discussion (CBD) is widely used in medical education, its effectiveness can be limited by insufficient guidance and structured support. Scaffolding teaching, which provides graduated assistance aligned with learners’ development, may address these limitations. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials evaluating the integration of scaffolding with CBD in residency training remains limited. This study aims to compare an integrated scaffolded case-based learning approach with traditional lecture-based teaching that utilizes the same clinical case materials in enhancing residents’ clinical reasoning, self-directed learning, and knowledge acquisition in anesthesiology training. Methods This prospective randomized controlled trial encompassed 12 anesthesiology residents, systematically randomized into an experimental cohort (receiving scaffolding teaching integrated with case-based discussion) and a control cohort (receiving traditional lecture-based instruction utilizing the same clinical case). The intervention consisted of a structured 4-week curriculum focusing on HOCM anesthesia management, delivered through weekly instructional sessions. The investigation utilized validated assessment instruments to measure primary outcomes, including clinical reasoning proficiency and self-directed learning capacity, at three time points: baseline, post-intervention (Week 4), and follow-up (Week 8). Secondary outcome measures encompassed teaching satisfaction indices and knowledge retention metrics. Statistical analysis employed t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests for comparative assessment. Results Post-intervention evaluation at Week 4 revealed statistically significant superiority in the experimental cohort across multiple parameters: clinical reasoning proficiency (83.58 ± 3.28 versus 74.17 ± 4.55, p  = 0.002), self-directed learning capacity (79.92 ± 2.56 versus 63.33 ± 3.52, p  < 0.001), and teaching satisfaction indices (100.00 ± 0.00 versus 73.00 ± 5.02, p  < 0.001). Follow-up assessment at Week 8 demonstrated sustained enhancement in the experimental group, maintaining significant advantages in clinical reasoning proficiency (89.08 ± 5.93 versus 68.17 ± 2.70, p  < 0.001), self-directed learning capacity (87.83 ± 2.56 versus 71.58 ± 3.50, p  < 0.001), and knowledge retention (98.33 ± 2.58 versus 95.00 ± 0.00, p  = 0.010). Conclusion This investigation demonstrates that an integrated scaffolding-supported case-based learning approach offers significant advantages over traditional lecture-based teaching that incorporates the same clinical case. The integrated approach significantly enhances clinical reasoning capabilities, self-directed learning competencies, and knowledge acquisition in complex clinical scenarios compared to the lecture-based approach. These findings establish a robust empirical foundation for the optimization of residency training methodologies, particularly within high-complexity clinical domains such as HOCM anesthesia management. The sustained improvements observed at follow-up further validate the long-term effectiveness of this integrated pedagogical approach. Clinical trial registration Not applicable. This study is an educational research project evaluating teaching methodologies through simulated training and does not involve health-related interventions or patient outcomes.

Abstract: Background Effective patient education is critical in enhancing treatment outcomes and reducing anxiety in dental procedures. This study compares the effectiveness of AI-generated educational materials with traditional methods in improving patient comprehension and reducing anxiety during endodontic and restorative dental treatments. Methods A cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted with 100 participants undergoing restorative or endodontic procedures. Patients were randomized into two groups: those receiving AI-generated instructional materials (via ChatGPT) and those receiving traditional education (verbal explanations and pamphlets). Baseline knowledge and post-intervention knowledge retention were assessed using structured tests. Patient perceptions of clarity, usefulness, comprehensiveness, trust, and anxiety were measured using Likert-scale surveys. Three dental experts evaluated the educational content for accuracy and suitability. Statistical analysis included t-tests and Cohen’s kappa to measure inter-rater reliability. Results AI-generated materials significantly outperformed traditional methods in all measured dimensions, including clarity (4.42 vs. 3.25), usefulness (4.63 vs. 3.50), comprehensiveness (4.50 vs. 3.29), trust (4.00 vs. 2.96), and anxiety reduction (mean anxiety score: 2.63 vs. 3.38, p  < 0.001). Pre- and post-intervention knowledge assessments revealed substantial knowledge improvement in the AI group. Expert evaluations confirmed the accuracy and suitability of AI-generated materials, with high inter-rater reliability (κ = 0.75, p  < 0.001). Conclusions AI-generated educational materials demonstrate superior effectiveness in improving patient comprehension and reducing anxiety compared to traditional methods. Their integration into dental practice could enhance patient satisfaction and streamline the educational process, particularly for complex or anxiety-inducing procedures. Future research should explore their application in diverse dental specialties and assess long-term impacts on patient behavior and clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Background Mexico is one of the countries with the highest cultural, biological, and agrobiological diversity. However, an accelerated process of ancestral knowledge loss, related to the management of agrobiodiversity, native seeds, and other edible plant species management is affecting food sovereignty. This process of knowledge loss was documented at the Ñäñho region, of southern Querétaro, where our study took place. Our objective was to document the diversity of edible plant diversity, management, and use as well as the agroecosystems from which they are obtained. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted over 2 years (2021–2023) with 50 informants selected through a snowball sampling. Informal interviews and participant observations were also used with these and other people from the same community. Herbarium specimens and seed accessions were collected and photographed. Results In total, 119 edible plant species were identified. The richest families were Solanaceae, Rosaceae, Cactaceae, and Asteraceae. The edible species occur in 11 agroecosystems with 58.6% of the species native to Mexico, and 41.4% introduced. The orchard, rustic greenhouse, house “milpa,” mountain hill, and backyard, have the highest species diversity. The main management types were sowing and gathering plants. Eighty-five plant names were recorded in the Hñäñho language. The plant parts used were fruits (60.5%) and stems (46.2%). The gastronomic categories with the highest species percentage were stews, beverages, and refreshments, while the highest species number used in the gastronomic categories were cacti stalks or “nopales” ( Opuntia spp.), maize ( Zea mays ), and amaranth ( Amaranthus spp.). Conclusions The records in Southern Querétaro of edible plants and agroecosystems diversity were high. The plants, local knowledge documentation, and species management provide the basis for promoting projects focused on the Ñäñho biocultural wealth. Efforts are needed to encourage the least represented regional species. Community development programs are needed for food security and sovereignty; these are based on the local biocultural resources.

Abstract: Background Traditional lecture-based learning has been the cornerstone of dental education; however, active learning strategies such as flipped classrooms are gaining popularity for their potential to enhance student engagement and performance. This study evaluated the effectiveness of three teaching methods—traditional live lectures, flipped video classrooms, and interactive flipped classrooms—on improving academic performance and student perceptions among fourth-year dental students. Methods This study employed a stratified randomization design involving 156 fourth-year dental students using a single lecture in an undergraduate orthodontics course. The students were first grouped into four categories based on their Grade Point Average (GPA): Excellent, Very Good, Good, and Satisfactory. From these groups, students were randomly drawn and placed into one of three intervention groups: live lecture, flipped classroom with video lectures, and flipped classroom with interactive video lectures. Pre- and post-intervention assessments evaluated knowledge improvement, while objective structured assessments measured academic performance. Student perceptions were gauged using validated Likert-scale questionnaires. Paired t-tests assessed within-group differences, and ANOVA compared effectiveness across teaching methods. Pearson’s correlation analysis examined the relationship between academic performance and GPA of the students. Results All three teaching methods showed significant improvements in post-intervention scores ( p  < 0.001). The Live Lecture Group had the greatest mean improvement (27.69), followed by the Flipped Video Lecture Group (27.30) and the Flipped Interactive Lecture Group (27.11). However, ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups ( F (2, 153) = 0.007, p  = 0.993). Female students performed better in the live lecture setting (32.60 ± 25.08) compared to males (23.79 ± 21.44). Students with lower GPAs benefited most from the interactive flipped classroom, Pearson’s correlation indicated a strong positive association between GPA and post-intervention scores ( r  = 0.708, p  < 0.001). Student satisfaction was highest in the interactive flipped classroom, with 97.7% rating the experience as “Excellent” or “Very Good.” Conclusions All three teaching methods led to significant improvement in post-test scores. While students reported higher engagement and satisfaction in flipped and interactive flipped lectures, the live lecture method was also effective for knowledge retention. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring educational strategies to diverse student needs in dental education. Educators should consider a blended model that integrates flipped and traditional strategies selectively, balancing feasibility with student needs, as developing multiple formats can be time-intensive with only modest differences in outcomes.

Abstract: Background Basic science knowledge is essential for understanding clinical studies and enhancing clinical reasoning in medical practice. However, medical students retain only a portion of the knowledge gained during the early years of medical school. We aimed to examine medical students’ knowledge retention of repeated and recently learned topics in physiology and microbiology with additional analysis of individual variability. Given that prior studies have raised concerns about the validity of retention rate as an indicator of stable knowledge, we also explored alternative measures of retention. Methods Nineteen third- and 22 fourth-year medical students volunteered to repeat the written examinations in physiology and microbiology, respectively, in September 2022 at the University of Pécs. Students previously completed a summative test in the fall semester and another test in the spring semester. Both examinations consisted of multiple-choice questions and the second test included questions from both semesters introducing a unique form of spaced repetition. In our study, students repeated the complete second test after a 16-week non-use retention interval. Besides retention rates, we calculated the percentage of consistently correct and incorrect answers as retention measures. Correlations between retention measures and students’ grade point averages (GPAs) were examined. Results Significant declines in test scores were observed, with physiology scores dropping from 70.4 to 53.5% and microbiology scores from 72.1 to 57.3%. Retention rates varied significantly, with values ranging from 54.5 to 97.2%. Microbiology revealed better results of first-semester content compared to the second semester in some of the retention measures, while physiology showed no difference between semesters. Retention rates did not correlate with GPA, however, the percentage of consistently correct answers showed moderate positive correlations, while the consistently incorrect answers showed moderate negative correlations with GPA. Conclusions There was a substantial knowledge loss among medical students with high individual variability indicating the need to explore factors affecting long-term knowledge retention in real-life educational settings more deeply. Previously acquired knowledge in microbiology demonstrated superior retention, potentially attributable to the beneficial effects of spaced repetition. The lack of correlation between retention rates and GPA suggests that other measures may better reflect stable knowledge.

Abstract: Background Educational research highlights active approaches to learning are more effective in knowledge retention and problem-solving. It has long been acknowledged that adapting to more active ways of learning form part of the challenge for new university students as the pedagogical distance between the didactical approach largely followed by secondary school systems the world over differs quite significantly from the often more student-led, critical approach taken by universities. University students encounter various learning challenges, particularly during the transition from secondary school to university. Poor adaptation and low performance in the first year of tertiary education can lead to higher failure rates and potential withdrawal from study programmes. Adopting active learning strategies early in this transition phase is crucial for supporting students’ adaptation and success. Gaining student engagement with active learning can be a significant challenge when there is an expectation to participate in a discussion or voice an opinion. Case-based learning (CBL), with its scaffolded form of learning, is an approach that could provide the support needed to help multicultural learners adapt to their new learning environment in a non-threatening classroom-based setting. The research question in this study was: what features of CBL support active learning? Methods Data was collected using Structured Group Feedback Sessions (SGFS) from 36 students from 12 different countries. Students were placed in eight Structured Group Feedback sessions, a method that facilitates structured discussions and is effect in curriculum evaluation and feedback. The Experience Based Learning model was used as the conceptual framework to guide the analysis, which was completed using the framework analysis method. Results Themes were derived from the Experience Based Learning model: affective, pedagogical, and organisational and analysed according to the research question. We found CBL can be used to facilitate active learning with all students at a multicultural medical university. We identified six learning points to highlight features of CBL that support active learning: CBL increased contact with peers and facilitated student bonding; students need to feel psychologically safe to participate; prior learning can enhance confidence to participate; facilitators need to be aware of their role, know about psychological safety, and manage student participation including the dominant voice; some students have a lower tolerance of uncertainty and need additional clarity at the end either via the facilitator or additional notes that provide the key learning points to take away; students became more engaged when a case is aligned to a real patient case giving it authenticity. Conclusions This study explores how CBL can support active learning in a multicultural medical school. We identified that CBL did facilitate active learning and students engaged with it and enjoyed it. We identified six learning points to support others going forward.

Abstract: Background The flipped classroom (FC) approach has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing the learning process, including within higher education contexts such as medical education. Recently, FC has emerged as potential alternative to traditional teaching models across various disciplines, particularly due to its more engaging nature. However, there is limited data available regarding its impact on student performance, particularly in the context of long-term knowledge retention in pharmacology. In this study, our objective was to assess the short- and long-term impact of FC on student performance in Hungarian pharmacology teaching at medical faculty in Semmelweis University (Budapest, Hungary). Methods and results 161 medical students and 10 teachers were involved in this study. We flipped four seminars, then we assessed the academic performance by using multiple choice tests immediately and two weeks after the flipped class. A follow-up assessment was conducted six months after the initial two FC sessions. Our findings indicated that the FC approach enhanced both short- and long-term knowledge retention across most topics. Notably, this long-term improvement was evident even six months after the original seminars on specific subjects. However, despite these topic-specific benefits, the overall performance, including exam grades, did not show significant improvement when compared to the conventional teaching approach. Additionally, we assessed student and teacher perceptions using two questionnaires immediately after practice and at the end of the year. According to the questionnaire responses, students perceived positively the FC approach, emphasizing its interactive and thought-provoking aspects. However, they identified the time-consuming nature of preparation as a significant concern. Teachers also viewed the FC approach favorably, particularly appreciating its interactivity and potential for greater effectiveness. Interestingly, more experienced teachers were less receptive to the FC method, and their perceptions of it were less favorable compared to those of their younger colleagues. Conclusions The flipped classroom approach presents a viable strategy for teaching pharmacology, with the potential to enhance student performance and engagement. However, student occupation and faculty resistance may pose significant challenges to the implementation of such alternative teaching methods.

Abstract: Background Sepsis is one of the most challenging and complex clinical states, with persistently high mortality rates. Guidelines recommend the early identification of sepsis patients and immediate initiation of the Hour-1 Bundle treatment to reduce mortality from sepsis. Emergency nurses play a vital role in the early screening of sepsis. Studies indicate that mind mapping and In-Situ Simulation (ISS) training not only aid healthcare professionals in reinforcing theoretical knowledge retention but also enhance skills in coordination, task management, and communication during simulation exercises. This, in turn, promotes the effective implementation of various treatments during resuscitation. The combination of theoretical and practical training methods is more effective than a single training approach. In June 2023, our hospital's emergency department conducted training for emergency nurses on sepsis mind mapping combined with ISS. Objective To explore the effect of mind mapping combined with ISS training in promoting the emergency nurses' implementation of the Hour-1 Bundle in sepsis patients. Methods Using mind mapping and ISS training methods, 24 emergency nurses were divided into 6 groups for a 12-week training period. The study compared their pre- and post-training knowledge of sepsis, identification and diagnostic time, Hour-1 Bundle treatment completion rate, and non-technical skill scores. Post-training, the emergency nurses evaluated the effectiveness of the training. Results The scores for sepsis knowledge among emergency nurses before and after training were 44.17 ± 9.21 and 60.42 ± 5.29, respectively. The identification and diagnostic times (hours) were 0.63 ± 0.18 and 0.49 ± 0.13, respectively. The Hour-1 Bundle treatment completion rates were 58.33% and 85.7%, respectively. There was a significant increase in all non-technical skill scores, with statistical significance ( P  < 0.05, P  < 0.001). After two ISS trainings, the SET-M scores progressively increased, indicating a high satisfaction rate among nurses with the mind mapping and ISS training. Conclusion The combination of mind mapping and ISS training enables emergency nurses to identify sepsis earlier and promotes the effective implementation of the Hour-1 Bundle treatment in sepsis patients, while also enhancing their cognitive understanding of sepsis and non-technical skills.

Abstract: Study Objective Student-centered learning and unconventional teaching modalities are gaining popularity in medical education. One notable approach involves engaging students in producing creative projects to complement the learning of preclinical topics. A systematic review was conducted to characterize the impact of creative project-based learning on metacognition and knowledge gains in medical students. Methods A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE and Embase via Ovid, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Scopus from January 1st, 1995, to July 6th, 2023. Studies using quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods approaches that explored the impact of creative project-based lessons on medical students' educational outcomes were included. Two investigators independently screened the titles and abstracts and extracted data from included articles. A narrative synthesis was conducted to summarize study designs and outcome measures. Content analysis was conducted to generate codes and themes. Study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool in view of the range of study types employed. Results The review included 17 studies published between 2010 to 2022. These studies implemented various creative project interventions such as handicraft models, drawings, and concept maps covering multiple topics, including anatomy, histopathology, and fundamental sciences. The identified themes of Enhanced Learning, Collaborative Learning, and Deep Learning led to further themes of Student Engagement, Student Disengagement, and Faculty Engagement. Collaborative learning involves students working in teams and benefitting from effective mentorship. Creative projects facilitated deep learning objectives via interdisciplinary learning and promoted new ways of perceiving concepts. Learning was enhanced through increased interactivity, high conceptual fidelity and improved knowledge retention. Conclusion Creative projects undertaken by medical students exhibit attributes that facilitate the acquisition of collaborative and deep learning objectives through self-directed learning, cognitive load modulation, and metacognitive behaviours. Faculty mentorship and group learning amongst peers facilitate these processes, although challenges such as high task demands, cognitive and emotional intensiveness, and mismatch with students; professional identities remain. Overall, students and faculty received these interventions well, thus, warranting further exploration for uses in medical curricula. Trial registration Not applicable as this study is a systematic review.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus worldwide necessitates that medical undergraduates acquire a deep understanding of the disease to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective management. Traditional teaching methods, while foundational, often lack the interactive elements that enhance student engagement and knowledge retention. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel educational board game, “Diabe-teach,” in enhancing knowledge retention among medical students compared with conventional self-study methods. A randomized controlled design involving 56 preclinical medical students at Dubai Medical College for Girls was used. The participants were randomly assigned to either the game-based learning group or the control group, with both groups receiving identical instructional materials on diabetes. Knowledge retention was assessed via pre- and post-test scores, whereas student engagement and perceptions were measured via a feedback survey. The results indicated that while both groups showed significant improvement in post-test scores ( p  < .001), the game-based group demonstrated a notably greater frequency of correct responses and a greater tendency to recognize knowledge gaps, as evidenced by the increased “I do not know” responses compared with incorrect guesses in the control group. Feedback from the game-based learning group highlighted enhanced confidence, improved communication skills, and a preference for the gamified approach over traditional methods. The findings suggest that the “Diabe-teach” board game is an effective tool for teaching complex medical concepts, fostering both knowledge retention and critical self-assessment among students. These results contribute to the growing body of literature on game-based learning, supporting its potential as a valuable adjunct to traditional medical education methods. Further research could explore the application of this approach across other medical disciplines.

Abstract: Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global health threat, partly driven by inappropriate antibiotic use. Healthcare students, as future practitioners, must have a good understanding of AMR to contribute to antimicrobial stewardship. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an educational intervention on healthcare students’ knowledge of AMR and to assess patterns of antibiotic use prior to the intervention. Methods A quasi-experimental pre-and-post study design was conducted with unpaired groups of healthcare students. An educational intervention was carried out comprising of two 20-minute PowerPoint lectures, as well as question and answer sessions focused on understanding the spread, impact, and prevention of AMR. A self-administered questionnaire was given as a pre-test and repeated as a post-test immediately after the training. Students’ knowledge of AMR and patterns of antibiotic use was assessed pre-intervention while knowledge of AMR was assessed post-intervention. The knowledge was categorised into domains (Understanding Antibiotic and Antimicrobial Resistance; Spread and Impact of Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance; Prevention of Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance). The total score for each domain of knowledge tested was categorized into good knowledge (≥ 80%) and poor knowledge (< 50%). Results The number of participants in the pre- and post-intervention were 185 and 157 students with average age of 17.7 years and 17.8 years respectively. Post-intervention, there was a significant increase in students’ AMR knowledge, with correct responses regarding spread and impact of AMR increasing from 40.5% pre-intervention to 62.4% post-intervention ( p  < 0.001; φ (effect size = 0.218). The proportion of students demonstrating good overall knowledge increased from 28.1 to 44.6% ( p  = 0.001; φ (effect size = 0.171). Misconceptions, such as misunderstanding that antibiotic resistance does not result from the body becoming resistant to antibiotics, persisted but not statistically significant (24.9–17.2%, p  = 0.055). Pre-intervention also revealed varied antibiotic use patterns, including the inappropriate use of antibiotics for malaria (51.7%, ( n  = 76)), and common cold (25.2% ( n  = 37)). Conclusions The study findings indicate that educational interventions can effectively improve healthcare students’ knowledge of AMR, though persistent misconceptions underscore the need for more targeted educational efforts. Incorporating structured AMR content into healthcare curricula could help the students contribute to antimicrobial stewardship. Future research should evaluate knowledge retention and behaviour changes to optimize the long-term impact of AMR education.

Abstract: Background Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality in low resource settings. Prompt diagnosis and correct management improves outcomes. To improve clinician knowledge and confidence in DKA management, we designed a novel curriculum for training local clinicians in a low-resource setting. This curriculum aligned to international guidelines, adapted for local resources. Our aim was to assess if the curriculum improved clinician knowledge and confidence. Methods Participants included physicians and nurses in the Emergency Department (ED) at a tertiary academic center in Nairobi, Kenya. Participants completed pre/post-tests of knowledge, which permitted prospective curriculum evaluation based on the second level Kirkpatrick hierarchy, knowledge retention. The cases focused on local evidence-based DKA management pathways. They were delivered using novel in-person with virtual (recorded) teaching techniques, permitting both conventional and independent learning. Outcome measures related to knowledge improvement were analyzed using independent t -tests; clinician confidence was assessed via self-reported survey and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results 125 clinicians (79.8% nurses and 20.2% physicians) completed pre-training assessment; 104 completed post-training assessment. Prior to training, 53.6% of all trainees reported that they were “highly confident” compared with 61.5% of all trainees post-training ( p =0.16). Post-training, there were statistically significant increases in knowledge scores related to DKA diagnosis (14% increase, p =0.03), electrolyte management (41% increase, p <0.0001), fluid administration (28% increase, p =0.01) and insulin administration (24% increase, p =0.01). There was a significant increase in overall clinician knowledge scores with 34.4% ( n =43) attaining a knowledge score of 7 or above correct responses out of the 10 cases presented pre-training versus 65.4% n =68 post-training ( p <0.0001). Conclusion Our pretest-posttest results demonstrate that our DKA management course improved clinical knowledge among physicians and nurses working in low-resource ED. Future research is underway to evaluate clinical practice changes and patient care outcomes related to this improved knowledge.

Abstract: Background The rapid evolution of healthcare necessitates a new generation of doctors with strong critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability skills. This systematic review explores current longitudinal assessment practices in undergraduate medical education in Saudi Arabia with particular emphasis on progress test and its utility, advantages, and disadvantages. Methods A systematic search was conducted across relevant databases to identify studies that discuss progress test in undergraduate medical education in Saudi Arabia. The studies were analyzed to evaluate their alignment with study objectives and to the demands of a changing healthcare landscape. Results The review highlights the dynamic nature of progress test (PT) as a longitudinal assessment method in undergraduate medical education in Saudi Arabia. The advantages included yearly assessments and holistic feedback to enhance learning techniques and knowledge retention. Moreover, PT serves as both a summative and formative assessment, offering personalized learning experiences tailored to individual needs and pacing. Contrasting traditional assessments, PT promotes deep learning strategies and meaning-oriented approaches, fostering holistic understanding rather than rote memorization. Additionally, PT’s continuous nature allows for early identification of knowledge gaps and facilitates ongoing improvement. Conclusion This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of progress test as a longitudinal assessment method in undergraduate medical education. It identifies areas for improvement and informs the development of more effective assessment methods that better prepare future doctors for a future of innovation and personalized medicine.

Abstract: The overarching goal of this study is to inform institutional policy, support systems, and future research focused on enhancing retirement transitions within academia. In this scoping review we: (1) explore key factors influencing the retirement decisions of higher education faculty, including common pathways and barriers faced by faculty; (2) synthesize prominent study designs and findings in this area; and (3) evaluate the current state of the literature. A scoping review was conducted to address the outlined objectives. Relevant studies were identified through comprehensive searches across multiple academic databases using terms related to retirement decisions among university faculty. Four independent reviewers screened the literature and extracted key data using a standardized process to ensure rigor and consistency in study selection and synthesis. A total of 74 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most utilized cross-sectional survey designs, with qualitative interviews also commonly employed. Frequently examined variables included chronological age, partner or spousal retirement timing, health status, institutional policies, and professional identity. Geographical focus and academic subfields varied across the literature, revealing gaps in cross-contextual understanding. A concentration on individual and organizational factors was noted, with limited longitudinal research capturing transitions over time. This review builds on prior work by highlighting the varied nature of retirement among academic professionals, who often work in environments characterized by high autonomy. Understanding these retirement processes is critical for designing policies and practices that support career satisfaction and institutional knowledge retention. The findings have implications for retirement education and the development of inclusive retirement policies.

Abstract: Providing evidence-based care is essential to optimizing healthcare outcomes, particularly for senior adult women in underserved areas. Older women often face pelvic health challenges, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), pelvic floor dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence, and chronic pelvic pain. Access to healthcare in rural areas remains a significant barrier, particularly for homebound seniors. Virtual education offers a promising avenue for addressing these disparities. This study evaluated the impact of a virtual pelvic health education session on knowledge retention among women in an underserved area. Forty-two female participants were recruited in Western Arkansas. Participants completed an online pre-session questionnaire (pre) to assess baseline pelvic health knowledge, attended a single virtual education session led by a healthcare provider specializing in pelvic health, and completed an on-line post-session (post-1) knowledge questionnaire, and one month post virtual (post-2) interview. The results demonstrate a significant increase in pelvic health knowledge immediately after the education session post-1 (p < 0.001) and in the follow-up post-2 (p < 0.001) assessment. Thematic interview results indicated that learning about pelvic health in a virtual environment was a positive experience. Thus, virtual education sessions appear to be a viable strategy for enhancing pelvic health knowledge, particularly among rural and homebound senior women with limited access to healthcare. This approach has the potential to empower older women to address pelvic health concerns proactively, thereby improving health outcomes and quality of life. Additionally, telehealth and virtual healthcare sessions provide significant benefits, including increased accessibility, convenience, cost-effectiveness, and the ability to reach underserved populations.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/rethinking-dementia-awareness-training-how/docview/3289892984/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Dementia-Friendly Businesses (DFBs) play a crucial role in fostering inclusive environments for individuals living with dementia. While workforce training aims to enhance dementia-friendly awareness, little research has examined how training mode or time elapsed since training may influence long-term knowledge retention and behavioral adaptation. This study assessed dementia knowledge retention among 510 employees in DFB settings, evaluating whether training mode or time elapsed had a greater impact on knowledge retention for longer-term dementia-friendly awareness. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TBP) and Dementia-Centered Person Care (DCPC), findings show that the training mode does not significantly vary workforce dementia awareness. A two-way ANOVA examined the effects of training mode and time elapsed on dementia awareness scores. The training mode was insignificant (F(2, 501) = .709, p = .492), suggesting that in-person, hybrid, and online training were equally effective. However, time elapsed significantly impacted awareness (F(2, 501) = 17.547, p < .001), with employees trained over a year ago exhibiting higher scores (M = 132.93, SE = 1.43) than those trained 6–12 months ago (M = 128.46, SE = 1.27, p < .001) or < 6 months ago (M = 119.89, SE = 1.68, p < .001). Post-hoc analyses confirmed that awareness increases over time, regardless of training mode. Findings reinforce the importance of sustained engagement and exposure in strengthening dementia awareness, aligning with the TBP’s emphasis on sustained normative influences and DCPC’s focus on continued, person-centered learning. Future research should explore optimal reinforcement strategies to sustain dementia awareness in business settings.

Abstract: Addressing misconceptions is widely recognized as important for effective science learning. Refutation texts have been shown to reduce incorrect beliefs and enhance conceptual understanding. This quasi-experimental study examined the effects of the knowledge revision components (KReC) framework, digital stories containing refutation texts (DSRT), printed stories containing refutation texts (SRT), and a curriculum-based teaching method without refutation texts (TMC), on fourth-grade students’ conceptual understanding and misconceptions about Earth’s crust and movements. A pretest-posttest design was implemented with 156 students, using a three-tier test to assess their conceptual understanding and misconceptions. Results indicated that both DSRT and SRT significantly reduced misconceptions compared to TMC; however, neither intervention led to a statistically significant increase in conceptual understanding. These findings suggest the effectiveness of refutation texts in digital and narrative formats while emphasizing the need for further research on instructional design, learner characteristics, and long-term knowledge retention in science education.

Abstract: This study reviews the literature on board games for collaborative learning in science education, analysing 76 articles from 2000 to 2024. It examines research methodologies, data collection tools, sample sizes, and data analysis methods, focusing on subject areas and types of board games used. Key findings reveal a predominance of physical (paper‐based) board games. Research methodologies were primarily quantitative, with descriptive analysis being the most common approach, typically employing varied sample sizes (median 48.5 participants). Evidence suggests that board games can enhance scientific knowledge acquisition, improve student engagement, and foster collaborative skills. However, the review identifies critical limitations in the existing literature, including a prevalence of small sample sizes, a lack of long‐term effectiveness studies, and insufficient focus on specific game mechanisms. Future research should prioritise investigating game mechanisms, explicitly measuring collaborative learning outcomes, improving methodological rigour, and assessing long‐term impacts on knowledge retention. Context and implications Rationale for this study: This systematic review addresses a gap by synthesising empirical evidence on board games for collaborative learning in science education, providing a comprehensive overview of existing research. Why the new findings matter: Our findings quantify board games' positive impacts on science knowledge, engagement, and collaborative skills, while identifying methodological gaps and crucial future research directions. Implications for educational institutions, policymakers, educators and learners: This review highlights effective practices for integrating board games into science education, guiding the creation of more engaging and impactful collaborative learning experiences. For researchers: It identifies critical gaps in the literature, emphasising the need for studies on specific game mechanisms, long‐term effectiveness, enhanced methodological rigour (e.g. control groups, inferential statistics), and exploration across diverse populations and digital technologies. This provides a roadmap for future investigations to deepen our understanding and optimise the integration of board games.

Abstract: Teaching Cities and Climate Change demands more than retrieving concepts and scenarios; it should involve students in the complexities of sustainability and the cascading consequences of global warming. This study draws on a five-semester experience while teaching an online course titled 'Cities and Climate Change ' at the Central American University 'José Simeón Cañas' (UCA) in El Salvador. This research aims to address the question: How can teaching this course promote immediate effectiveness, long-term retention, and transformative competencies among undergraduate students at a Global South university? The course, taken by 738 students enrolled in ten academic programs, prompted the application of theory to concrete situations and, conversely, contributed to other courses in their curriculum by providing a holistic view of cities. By employing a multi-phase sequential design (MSD) with a longitudinal perspective, this study combines in-course surveys conducted during five semesters of teaching (2020–2022), ex-post semi-structured interviews in 2022, and ex-post surveys administered in 2025 to assess the long-term impact and knowledge retention. The results show that the complex approach to cities and climate change, although challenging, emerged as one of the most valuable aspects of the course, engaging students with this century's wicked problems that they still remember. The pedagogical evaluation of students in the cross-semester data yielded high ratings for course quality, encompassing effectiveness, cognitive aspects, pedagogical design, engagement, communication, and assessment. Follow-up qualitative evaluations after 2 years of taking the course, and surveys after 5, 4, and 3 years, revealed lasting competencies, including conceptual knowledge that participants could still recall, as well as applied skills and abilities reflected in personal changes, such as shifts in behavior, increased adaptability, enhanced agency, and refined communication practices. This paper contributes to the academic study of teaching Cities and Climate Change by integrating longitudinal mixed-methods evaluation tools with a student-centered view of curriculum effectiveness in a Global South context.

Abstract: Severe anaphylaxis in patients with clonal mast cell disorders highlights the need for proper use of adrenaline autoinjectors. This study assessed knowledge retention and adherence to autoinjector use in c-KIT p.D816V-positive individuals with hymenoptera venom allergy undergoing venom immunotherapy (VIT) and prescribed two autoinjectors. INTRODUCTION Severe anaphylaxis in patients with clonal mast cell disorders highlights the need for proper use of adrenaline autoinjectors. This study assessed knowledge retention and adherence to autoinjector use in c-KIT p.D816V-positive individuals with hymenoptera venom allergy undergoing venom immunotherapy (VIT) and prescribed two autoinjectors.Seventy-one VIT patients received personalized autoinjector education, with knowledge assessed at 3, 4 to 12, 12 to 24, and > 24 months. Fifteen patients 5 years post-VIT underwent video-based retraining and were assessed 1 month later. METHODS Seventy-one VIT patients received personalized autoinjector education, with knowledge assessed at 3, 4 to 12, 12 to 24, and > 24 months. Fifteen patients 5 years post-VIT underwent video-based retraining and were assessed 1 month later.Knowledge retention was 82.3% at 3 months, dropping to 40.0% at 12 to 24 months (p = 0.0160) and 22.2% after 24 months (p = 0.0005), indicating a clear decline over time. Common errors included ignoring the safety cap (16.7%), insufficient injection force, finger injection risk, and upper arm activation (totaling 19.0%). In addition, 19.8% failed to hold the autoinjector in the muscle for 3 seconds, 26.9% did not know to lie supine during anaphylaxis, and 14.3% did not seek emergency help. In the video-retrained group, 80.0% lacked proficiency 1 month later, 73.3% were unaware of the second dose, and 66.7% did not carry their devices. RESULTS Knowledge retention was 82.3% at 3 months, dropping to 40.0% at 12 to 24 months (p = 0.0160) and 22.2% after 24 months (p = 0.0005), indicating a clear decline over time.

Abstract: ABSTRACT Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated impressive performance on general medical examinations; however, their effectiveness significantly declines in specialized board examinations due to limited domain-specific training data and computational constraints inherent to their self-attention mechanisms. This study investigates a novel token-splitting strategy informed by Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), aimed at overcoming these limitations by optimizing cognitive processing and enhancing knowledge retention in specialized educational contexts. We implemented a token-splitting approach by segmenting Taiwan plastic surgery board examination materials and associated textbook content into cognitively manageable segments ranging from 4,000 to 20,000 tokens. These segmented inputs were provided to GPT-4.1 via its standard ChatGPT web interface. Model performance was rigorously evaluated, comparing accuracy and efficiency across various token lengths and question complexities classified according to Bloom's taxonomy.The GPT-4.1 model utilizing the token-splitting strategy significantly outperformed the baseline (unmodified) model, achieving notably higher accuracy. The optimal segmentation length was determined to be 6,000 tokens, effectively balancing cognitive coherence with information retention and model attention. Errors observed at this optimal length primarily resulted from content absent from textual materials or requiring multimodal interpretation (e.g., image-based reasoning). Provided relevant textual content was adequately segmented, GPT-4.1 consistently demonstrated high accuracy (From 75.88% to 92.93%). The findings highlight that a token-splitting approach, grounded in Cognitive Load Theory, significantly enhances LLM performance on specialized medical board examinations. This accessible, user-friendly strategy provides educators and clinicians with a practical means to improve AI-assisted education outcomes without requiring complex technical skills or infrastructure. Future research and development integrating multimodal capabilities and adaptive segmentation strategies promise to further optimize educational applications and clinical decision-making support.

Abstract: Objectives Disaster medicine (DM) prepares health care professionals to manage emergencies caused by significant societal disruptions. Training recent graduates and final-year students is an essential element of disaster preparedness. This review aims to examine the use of Virtual Simulation (VS) in undergraduate students’ DM training. Methods The research team searched Scopus, PubMed, WOS, and Scielo. The team followed the 6-step approach described by Mak to conduct Scoping Reviews. We identified 262 reports, and 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. We extracted and analyzed data, focusing on educational settings, professions involved, and intervention characteristics. The report followed PRISMA guidelines. Results The implementation of VS in DM training has been geographically concentrated, with most studies focused on nursing education. Most programs use virtual reality, with limited augmented or mixed reality integration, principally in nursing students. The training focused primarily on triage, disaster preparedness, evacuation, decontamination, improving knowledge retention, self-confidence, and decision-making. Conclusions Although VS has effectively enhanced technical skills and disaster preparedness, its use remains limited in undergraduate health education. Further research is needed to expand its application in interprofessional and non-nursing contexts, with deliberate practice principles to maximize efficiency. Integrating VS into community training can reduce costs and enhance large-scale emergency response. Narrative Abstract Disaster medicine (DM) prepares health care professionals to respond to emergencies that disrupt society. Training recent graduates and final-year students is crucial for preparedness, yet traditional methods often fail to provide hands-on experience. To bridge this gap, a scoping review explored the role of Virtual Simulation (VS) in DM training for undergraduate students. A team of 6 experts analyzed 262 studies, narrowing down to 17 relevant articles. Results revealed that VS is predominantly used in nursing education, focusing on triage, preparedness, evacuation, and decision-making key components in protecting both hospital resilience and community well-being. Programs largely relied on virtual reality, with minimal integration of augmented or mixed reality. Despite its potential to enhance skills and confidence, VS training seldom applied deliberate practice principles, limiting its effectiveness. Expanding VS adoption across health professions and incorporating deliberate practice could improve disaster preparedness, optimize resource use, and enhance community resilience, underscoring the need for further research and program development.

Abstract: ABSTRACT Cognitive research consistently demonstrates that spaced repetition enhances memory consolidation and retrieval by reinforcing learned material over time. This study applies the Precede–Proceed Model of Learning framework to examine how predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing educational strategies support sustained knowledge retention among healthcare professionals. The analysis focused on three accredited continuing professional development (CPD) programs conducted between 2022 and 2024. Participants engaged in educational activities that included baseline pre-test and post-activity post-test assessments, with exposure categorized based on prior interaction with related content. Learners were stratified into groups by timing and frequency of exposure to the material. The primary outcome measured was improvement in test performance across sequential learning engagements. Results indicated that learners who accessed educational content prior to the activity demonstrated a significantly higher mean pre-test score of 31% ( n = 443) compared to 27% ( n = 1,416) among those who viewed it afterward ( p = 0.041). Furthermore, repeat learners, regardless of content timing, achieved greater knowledge gains, improving by 34% ( p < 0.001), in contrast to a 26% improvement among first-time learners ( p < 0.001). These findings highlight the additive value of progressive and repeated exposure in CPD programs. By analysing longitudinal engagement patterns, this study reinforces the importance of strategically structured educational design to foster enduring clinical competence.

Abstract: Purpose Despite Point‐of‐Care Ultrasound (PoCUS) emerging as an essential clinical skill, evidence regarding practitioners' knowledge retention and competence remains poorly synthesized. This systematic review sought to evaluate PoCUS competency retention patterns using the Indication, Acquisition, Interpretation, Medical decision‐making (I‐AIM) framework following various educational interventions and to identify factors influencing long‐term skill retention among healthcare professional trainees. Methods The authors conducted a systematic review by searching PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Embase databases (1990–2024) for studies evaluating PoCUS educational interventions with objective competency measures and retention assessment. Data were analysed based on educational strategies, course duration and retention patterns across I‐AIM domains. Results Thirty‐one studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 1638 participants (38.6% medical students, 20.5% attending physicians). Most studies employed a single‐group pretest‐posttest design (54.8%) and demonstrated moderate‐to‐high methodological quality (Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument median: 12.5, interquartile range [IQR]: 11.0 to 13.0). Within the I‐AIM framework analysis, all domains of competency retention demonstrated a decline over a 1–12‐month follow‐up period. The Acquisition domain showed the most significant decline with median percentage changes of −11.8% (IQR: −16.5% to −6.4%), followed by Interpretation, Medical decision‐making and Indication. Short‐course programs (≤4 h) demonstrated greater competency decline (median: ‐11.8%, IQR: −16.9% to −4.4%) compared to long‐course programs (median: ‐2.6%, IQR: −6.8% to 1.3%). Hands‐on practice with high‐fidelity simulation and clinical context integration were associated with superior retention outcomes across multiple domains. Conclusions Ultrasound competence retention showed variable decay patterns across I‐AIM domains, with Acquisition skills showing the most pronounced deterioration, particularly following short‐course programs. Comprehensive training programs integrating high‐fidelity hands‐on practice and clinical context may enhance PoCUS retention for healthcare providers.

Abstract: This review aims to explore the use and educational impact of the Pecha Kucha presentation format in medical education, as well as its integration with active learning methodologies. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Medline, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Scopus to identify studies that assessed Pecha Kucha in undergraduate, postgraduate, or patient education. Fourteen English-language studies published up to September 2024 were included. Studies were evaluated for design, participant population, learning outcomes, and pedagogical integration. The selected studies employed quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method approaches. Most studies reported positive educational outcomes, including improved knowledge retention, clearer communication, and enhanced learner engagement. Pecha Kucha was particularly effective when integrated with self-directed, problem-based, case-based, or team-based learning strategies. Participants, including students, residents, and patients, highlighted the format's value in promoting concise, visually engaging presentations, although some noted difficulties adapting to its strict timing constraints. Pecha Kucha is a promising educational tool that incites active learning, efficient communication, and engagement in medical education. When combined with other pedagogical strategies, it contributes to a more dynamic and student-centered learning environment.This review aims to explore the use and educational impact of the Pecha Kucha presentation format in medical education, as well as its integration with active learning methodologies.

Abstract: Knowledge resources are a critical element of firms’ core competitiveness. Many firms have suffered significant losses due to their failure to address the issue of knowledge loss, which has become a major challenge affecting their survival and development. To prevent and manage technical knowledge loss in firms, this study proposes an invulnerability analysis model for the firms’ technical knowledge network (FTKN) is first proposed based on complex networks. Key invulnerability metrics such as network connectivity, average risk path, and network risk efficiency are defined according to the unique characteristics of FTKN. Besides, the invulnerability of FTKN is analyzed based on the simulation analysis of random attacks and deliberate attacks. Additionally, a node importance evaluation method is introduced, incorporating factors such as degree value, betweenness centrality, efficiency, and the contributions of adjacent nodes. To enhance the survivability of FTKN, the network structure is optimized through redundant design. Simulation results demonstrate that external deliberate attacks and technical blockades cause more damage to the system compared to attacks on strongly correlated technologies. From a short-term perspective, prioritizing the protection of nodes with high betweenness can greatly improve the invulnerability of the network. Conversely, from a long-term perspective, the protection strategy of firms for moderate technology nodes is more conducive to the connectivity of the entire technology evolution network. Firms should adopt strategies such as redundancy backup of key technologies/equipment, classified protection of technical talents, and establishment of technical knowledge security early warning control mechanisms to enhance the survivability of firms’ technical systems.

Abstract: Certainty-based marking (CBM) requires students to indicate their certainty levels alongside their answers. CBM has been shown to enhance self-assessment and metacognitive awareness. This study aimed to explore the implementation of CBM in multiple-choice assessments in physiology. The CBM assessment tool was developed with an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant, Claude 3.5, with prompts focused on functional rather than technical requirements. The assessment consisted of 15 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), which were administered as a pretest and posttest during a small group teaching session to first-year medical students. Following the assessment, students completed a survey to evaluate their perceptions regarding the format, knowledge-gap identification, and overall acceptability. Answers from 195 students were analyzed, and significant improvements were observed in performance measures and certainty indices from the pretest to the posttest. Most students (80.9%) found the certainty scale beneficial, and 78.3% changed their answers after reflecting on their certainty. CBM demonstrated metacognitive benefits, with 86.4% of students better recognizing their knowledge gaps and 85.8% feeling more aware of their learning progress. About 73% of students preferred the CBM format and expressed greater engagement (82.8%) than traditional MCQs. CBM implemented through a web-based platform functioned as an assessment tool and an instructional intervention that enhanced students' metacognitive awareness and self-monitoring skills in physiology education. Our study focused on a single physiology topic and showed improvements in knowledge retention and certainty calibration. However, further longitudinal studies across multiple topics are needed to determine whether students maintain these self-assessment skills over time.

Abstract: Bite-Sized Learning (BSL), characterised by the delivery of content in brief, targeted segments, has emerged as a pedagogical strategy within increasingly digital and flexible higher education landscapes. This systematic literature review, conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, synthesises findings from ten peer-reviewed articles published between 2020 and 2025 to examine BSL’s reported effects, benefits, challenges, and research gaps. Analysis indicates that BSL is associated with improved short-term knowledge retention, heightened learner engagement, and support for personalised learning, particularly in disciplines such as medicine, ICT, and technical training. Nevertheless, limited evidence exists regarding its long-term efficacy, and its pedagogical value in abstract, discussion-intensive fields remain insufficiently examined. By employing Cognitive Load Theory and Constructivist Learning Theory as interpretive frameworks, the review offers a theoretically grounded account of BSL’s instructional potential and constraints. The findings inform future inquiry into design strategies, disciplinary relevance, and learner-centred implementations of BSL across diverse educational contexts.

Abstract: Illustrative examples demonstrate how abstract information can be applied in real-world. In the context of advancing evidence-informed teaching practice, the current intervention study investigated to what extent student teachers should be supported in learning educational theories and findings by different example-based approaches. Conducting a 1 × 3-factorial design, N  = 105 student teachers were randomly assigned to three experimental groups: After a pre-test, all groups received the same learning instruction on the topic of cooperative learning. Then, (1) n  = 35 students were prompted to generate own examples for the instructional text, (2) n  = 35 students received examples along with the text, and (3) n  = 35 students studied the text only, without any prompts or examples. In a post-questionnaire, it was retrospectively assessed how students perceived their learning control in engaging with the material; in a post-test, knowledge retention and knowledge transfer were measured. As assumed, findings revealed that generating examples enhanced perceived learning control and learning outcomes compared to studying provided examples. Students who learned with the instructional text only achieved lowest learning outcomes; but contrary to the expectations, these students perceived their learning control comparably high as those who generated examples. Mediation analyses indicated that for students who received illustrative examples or the instructional text only, a greater learning control perception was positively associated with knowledge retention, subsequently enhancing knowledge transfer. The study underscores the benefits of illustrative examples in teacher education, particularly when students engage in generating them. It suggests further examination of how and why example generation facilitates learning.

Abstract: As an emerging technology, virtual reality (VR) is being widely used in the field of safety training. However, a potential drawback arises when the learning theory is weakly considered during the development of safety training models. This oversight may result in several defects, such as a lack of alignment with training priorities and needs, ultimately affecting trainees' learning outcomes and diminishing safety awareness. To address this issue, this study introduces a systematic framework that integrates Bloom's learning taxonomy with VR safety training model development, named the VR Safety Training Goal Taxonomy Framework (VR-Safety-TGT). VR-Safety-TGT provides a comprehensive method for safety trainers and VR model developers to communicate and understand each other's perspectives. Specifically, it assists VR model developers in better-aligning safety training learning objectives. The efficacy of VR-Safety-TGT is examined through a pilot study involving a sample of 91 university students. The students were divided into three groups, each subjected to one of the following training modalities: slideshow-based training, traditional VR training, and VR-Safety-TGT training. The experimental results reveal that the VR-Safety-TGT group exhibits a significant advantage compared to the other two groups. VR-Safety-TGT demonstrates superior outcomes in terms of knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, self-efficacy, and users’ acceptance of technology.

Abstract: The healthcare sector plays a significant role in environmental sustainability due to its high material use and waste production. Laboratories, in particular, generate considerable amounts of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. However, awareness of environmentally friendly practices among healthcare staff remains limited. This study aimed to assess the effect of educational training on the “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle” (3R) principles among employees in a Pathology Department. A pre–post educational design was applied in February 2024, involving structured training sessions tailored to different working groups. An 11-question survey focused primarily on recycling practices was administered before and after the training to evaluate knowledge improvement. Seventy-five employees completed both questionnaires. Statistical analysis showed a significant increase in the number of correct answers after the sessions (p < 0.001). The most notable improvements occurred in questions related to proper waste segregation of gloves, cutting tools, and packaging materials. Informal observations during follow-up site visits suggested a possible increase in practices aligned with the reduce and reuse principles, though these were not systematically measured. These findings indicate that training sessions can effectively improve staff knowledge of recycling practices and may influence broader 3R-related behavior. However, further studies are needed to evaluate long-term knowledge retention and sustained behavior change.

Abstract: Non-dermatologist physicians see many skin disorders, yet the majority of internal medicine trainees express uncertainty when managing dermatologic conditions. Furthermore, there is no standardized dermatology training for internal medicine residents, which may lead to disparities in physician knowledge and patient care. A didactic curriculum utilizing the most common skin disorders seen at a large urban academic medical center from 2020 to 2021 was developed. All internal medicine residents ( n  = 81) were advised to complete an anonymized pre-lecture survey containing questions that assessed residents’ knowledge, confidence, and behaviors when managing the most common skin disorders. Participating internal medicine residents ( n  = 21) were given a one-hour lecture on these dermatologic conditions and completed a post-lecture survey within 24 h. A 6-month follow-up survey ( n  = 10) was administered to track long-term learning from the didactic session and to measure self-reported change in clinic behaviors. Immediate post-lecture scores on confidence-based questions overall increased by an average of 63% ( p  < 0.001) and knowledge-based questions by an average of 15% ( p  = 0.02). The specific skin conditions most significantly improved in confidence were basal cell carcinoma (+ 119%, p  < 0.001), squamous cell carcinoma (+ 85%, p  < 0.001), and actinic keratosis (+ 83%, p  < 0.001). After 6 months, there was no statistically significant improvement from baseline dermatology knowledge, but residents reported a higher confidence in managing common skin disorders by an average of 21% ( p  = 0.04) and reported a lower likelihood to refer to dermatology by an average of 16% ( p  = 0.045). Implementation of a dermatology-focused didactic session for internal medicine residents highlights a greater need for educational exposure in managing skin conditions to improve physician confidence and minimize unnecessary referrals. Future work will focus on increasing regular dermatology curriculum delivery and tracking long-term dermatology knowledge retention.

Abstract: Certainty-based marking (CBM) requires students to indicate their certainty levels alongside their answers. CBM has been shown to enhance self-assessment and metacognitive awareness. This study aimed to explore the implementation of CBM in multiple-choice assessments in physiology. The CBM assessment tool was developed with an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant, Claude 3.5, with prompts focused on functional rather than technical requirements. The assessment consisted of 15 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), which were administered as a pretest and posttest during a small group teaching session to first-year medical students. Following the assessment, students completed a survey to evaluate their perceptions regarding the format, knowledge-gap identification, and overall acceptability. Answers from 195 students were analyzed, and significant improvements were observed in performance measures and certainty indices from the pretest to the posttest. Most students (80.9%) found the certainty scale beneficial, and 78.3% changed their answers after reflecting on their certainty. CBM demonstrated metacognitive benefits, with 86.4% of students better recognizing their knowledge gaps and 85.8% feeling more aware of their learning progress. About 73% of students preferred the CBM format and expressed greater engagement (82.8%) than traditional MCQs. CBM implemented through a web-based platform functioned as an assessment tool and an instructional intervention that enhanced students' metacognitive awareness and self-monitoring skills in physiology education. Our study focused on a single physiology topic and showed improvements in knowledge retention and certainty calibration. However, further longitudinal studies across multiple topics are needed to determine whether students maintain these self-assessment skills over time. NEW & NOTEWORTHY To introduce certainty-based marking (CBM) to novice students, a custom web-based multiple-choice question (MCQ) test was developed with assistance from an artificial intelligence (AI) tool. This enhanced accessibility and allowed for data collection to evaluate and analyze student performance. The integration of AI in creating this assessment tool highlights the potential of technology to improve educational practices, especially in designing various assessment strategies.Certainty-based marking (CBM) requires students to indicate their certainty levels alongside their answers.

Abstract: Reproductive coercion (RC) and intimate partner violence (IPV) threaten women's health and reproductive agency globally. The Addressing Reproductive Coercion in Health Settings (ARCHES) intervention integrates screening for RC and IPV, covert contraceptive options, IPV referrals, and an educational booklet into family planning (FP) services. This study examines client and provider perspectives on ARCHES in Nairobi, Kenya. A qualitative study was conducted in the three private clinics implementing ARCHES. Data were collected through 35 in-depth client interviews and 12 provider interviews three months post-intervention. Participants were purposively sampled based on age and RC/IPV experience. Thematic content analysis was used. Clients reported greater reproductive autonomy through increased knowledge of covert contraception, IPV services, and reproductive rights. Providers reported gaining confidence to address RC and IPV and building stronger relationships with clients. Barriers included stigma around IPV referrals and limited counselling time. Screening for RC/IPV was widely accepted, with some clients recognising abuse for the first time. The compact educational booklet improved knowledge retention and community outreach. Perspectives on male partner engagement were mixed due to concerns about safety and confidentiality. ARCHES was well-received by clients and providers, enhancing FP care and addressing critical gaps in RC and IPV support. Future adaptations should address barriers to IPV referral uptake and provider first-line IPV support, and carefully track implementation to ensure continued client-centred counselling. These findings support ARCHES as a scalable model for integrating FP and violence prevention interventions in Kenya and similar contexts.Reproductive coercion (RC) and intimate partner violence (IPV) threaten women's health and reproductive agency globally.

Abstract: Gesture-based interactions in a virtual reality (VR) setting can enhance our experience of traditional practices as part of preserving and communicating heritage. Cultural experiences embodied within VR environments are suggested to be an effective approach for experiencing intangible cultural heritage. Ceremonies, rituals, and related ancestral enactments are important for preserving cultural heritage. Kāi Bǐ Lǐ, also known as the First Writing Ceremony, is traditionally held for Chinese children before their first year of elementary school. However, gesture-based immersive VR for learning this tradition is new, and have not been developed within the community. This study focused on how users experienced learning cultural practices using gesture-based interactive VR across different age groups and hardware platforms. We first conducted an experiment with 60 participants (30 young adults and 30 children) using the First Writing Ceremony as a case study in which gestural interactions were elicited, designed, implemented, and evaluated. The study showed significant differences in play time and presence between the head-mounted display VR and desktop VR. In addition, children were less likely to experience fatigue than young adults. Following this, we conducted another study after eight months to investigate the VR systems’ long-term learning effectiveness. This showed that children outperformed young adults in demonstrating greater knowledge retention. Our results and findings contribute to the design of gesture-based VR for different age groups across different platforms for experiencing, learning, and practicing cultural activities.

Abstract: [See PDF for image] Fig. 1 Summarises the changes in the mean percentage of medical students’ confidence in managing Necrotising Fasciitis, Burns, Hand injuries, and Flap failure before and after the workshops The low baseline confidence in managing PS emergencies among all delegates likely reflects inadequate exposure to and teaching in PS, as highlighted in this study and supported by prior literature [2, 3, 4–5]. The pilot study on simulation-based education demonstrated improved confidence outcomes, suggesting its potential for broader application. [...]it indicates that simple CBD, which could be adopted virtually, offers a practical and helpful modality for teaching key concepts in PS emergencies without incurring costs and without adding to the workload of the current medical school curriculum. Another limitation is that the post-workshop scores were collected immediately after the teaching session. [...]research, including quantitative knowledge assessment at different time points, is needed to evaluate the long-term impact of a CBD-based teaching approach on confidence and knowledge retention. [...]CBD education improved understanding of PS emergencies, and further research is necessary to evaluate its effectiveness on a larger scale.

Abstract: Purpose There is growing interest in simulation in cardiothoracic surgery, but published simulation models lack evidence of educational effect. We hypothesized that a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy simulation would improve general surgery resident knowledge of pulmonary anatomy. Methods A porcine tissue block was adapted from published models for simulated VATS lobectomy. A written knowledge test was developed internally based on general surgery objectives. All post-graduate year 2–4 general surgery residents ( n  = 31) at a single academic institution completed the test before and after participating in a VATS lobectomy skills lab, then repeated the written test 3 months later to assess knowledge retention. Likert-scale items were compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank test and test scores were compared with the paired t -test. Results After completion of the lab, residents had improved confidence in their ability to place VATS ports (5-point Likert, median: 2 vs 3), perform a VATS lobectomy (median: 1 vs 3), and in their knowledge of pulmonary hilar anatomy (median: 2 vs 3), all p  < 0.001. Written test scores improved from a pre-test average of 11.3 out of 22 points (± 3.1) to post-test average of 15.0 (± 3.1, p  < 0.001). This improvement was sustained on repeat assessment 3 months later, with delayed re-test average of 16.3 (± 3.5, p  < 0.001 vs pre-test). Conclusions VATS lobectomy simulation produced a durable improvement in general surgery resident knowledge of pulmonary anatomy. This study provides evidence of the educational impact of this popular simulation model and contributes validity evidence to simulation-based education in cardiothoracic surgery.

Abstract: Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) require specific infection control measures in healthcare settings. Escape rooms (ERs) are used in healthcare education but remain unevaluated for MDRO training and poorly assessed for long-term knowledge retention. This study assessed the impact of an ER intervention on healthcare workers' MDRO knowledge over the short and long term. A prospective, single-centre study was conducted in a French university hospital (May-December 2023). Nurses, nurse assistants, and medical fellows from 24 wards participated. An 11-item test was administered before, after, and three months post-intervention. The intervention consisted of a 60 min escape room session with MDRO-related riddles and a debriefing. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess factors associated with better performance. Among 141 participants (52.5% nurses, 44.0% nurse assistants, 3.5% medical fellows), correct response rates increased from 53.3% pre-training to 74.9% post-training (P < 0.001). Nurses improved from 55.9% to 78.5%, and nurse assistants from 49.6% to 71.4%. Nurses were associated with better post-test scores. Retained knowledge at three months was significantly higher than pre-intervention test in 44 participants (71.3%, P < 0.001). Satisfaction was high (9.3/10). An ER can enhance nurses' and nurse assistants' knowledge and retention of MDRO-related infection control measures. This gamified approach is not without challenges (time, equipment, logistics) but achieves great satisfaction among participants.Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) require specific infection control measures in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Despite the high prevalence of harassment in health professions education, empirical investigations into effective anti-harassment interventions remain scarce. Our study examined the effectiveness of an innovative anti-harassment intervention that featured instructional videos and high-fidelity simulation training for medical residents. We drew from the knowledge-learning-instruction framework and the idea of productive failure to conceptualize our research questions and discussion. We examined how the sequence of educational activities may be linked to simulation performance and increases in knowledge levels. INTRODUCTION Despite the high prevalence of harassment in health professions education, empirical investigations into effective anti-harassment interventions remain scarce. Our study examined the effectiveness of an innovative anti-harassment intervention that featured instructional videos and high-fidelity simulation training for medical residents. We drew from the knowledge-learning-instruction framework and the idea of productive failure to conceptualize our research questions and discussion. We examined how the sequence of educational activities may be linked to simulation performance and increases in knowledge levels.Our pretest posttest study contacted all 88 eligible internal medicine residents, randomly assigning them to the intervention (n = 60) or equivalent training later (n = 28). Of those assigned to the intervention, 52 (86.6%) consented and were further randomized to a video-first or simulation-first group. We provided educational activities in different sequences accordingly. We assessed knowledge via a questionnaire, and simulation performance via a performance checklist. METHOD Our pretest posttest study contacted all 88 eligible internal medicine residents, randomly assigning them to the intervention (n = 60) or equivalent training later (n = 28). Of those assigned to the intervention, 52 (86.6%) consented and were further randomized to a video-first or simulation-first group. We provided educational activities in different sequences accordingly. We assessed knowledge via a questionnaire, and simulation performance via a performance checklist.The video-first group demonstrated significantly better initial simulation performance compared with the simulation-first group, aligning with traditional learning sequential benefits. Both groups showed significant postintervention knowledge gains. Notably, the simulation-first group, despite starting with lower performance, ended with significantly higher knowledge levels than the video-first group, suggesting the efficacy of the productive failure approach in fostering deeper learning. RESULTS The video-first group demonstrated significantly better initial simulation performance compared with the simulation-first group, aligning with traditional learning sequential benefits. Both groups showed significant postintervention knowledge gains. Notably, the simulation-first group, despite starting with lower performance, ended with significantly higher knowledge levels than the video-first group, suggesting the efficacy of the productive failure approach in fostering deeper learning.The sequence of educational activities may impact the effectiveness of anti-harassment training. The video-first approach enhances immediate performance, while the simulation-first approach fosters better knowledge retention. Further research should investigate the long-term effects of such educational strategies and their applicability in diverse healthcare settings. CONCLUSIONS The sequence of educational activities may impact the effectiveness of anti-harassment training. The video-first approach enhances immediate performance, while the simulation-first approach fosters better knowledge retention.

Abstract: The building sector remains a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, with residential retrofits playing a crucial role in decarbonization efforts. However, effective implementation of retrofit measures faces multiple sociotechnical barriers, including limited understanding and knowledge gaps among citizens. This research develops and evaluates the Net-Zero Home Race (NZHR), an educational board game designed to address these challenges by modeling the technical, financial, and behavioral aspects of home energy retrofits. The game incorporates real-world financial constraints, extreme weather events, and occupant behaviors to create an engaging learning environment for reducing energy use toward net-zero homes. Through gameplay logs and pre/postsurvey results, we demonstrate the effectiveness of NZHR in increasing participants’ awareness of retrofit measures and player interactions with the game. The collaborative nature of the board game format also facilitates social learning and knowledge retention compared with traditional educational approaches. The findings suggest a potential for integrating NZHR into policy and academic programs to engage more people in sustainable building retrofits.

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) suffers from the catastrophic forgetting problem when learning from non-stationary data streams. Existing exemplar-based and knowledge distillation-based LReID methods encounter data privacy and limited acquisition capacity, respectively. In this paper, we introduce the prototype, which is under-investigated in LReID, to better balance knowledge retention and acquisition. Previous prototype-based works primarily focused on the classification task, where prototypes were modeled as discrete points or statistical distributions. However, they either discarded the distribution information or omitted instance-level diversity, which are crucial fine-grained clues for LReID. Furthermore, the domain shifts between data sources result in a feature gap between the new and old data, which restricts the utilization of the fine-grained information in prototypes. To address these challenges, we propose Distribution-aware Knowledge Aligning and Prototyping (DKP++), a novel framework for modeling and leveraging prototypes in LReID. First, an Instance-level Distribution Modeling network is introduced to capture the local diversity of each instance. Next, a Distribution-oriented Prototype Generation algorithm transforms the instance-level diversity into identity-level distributions which are stored as prototypes. Then, a Prototype-based Knowledge Transfer module distills the knowledge within the prototypes to the new model. To mitigate the impact of domain shifts during knowledge transfer, we introduce a privacy-friendly Distribution Aligning module that transforms new input data to fit the historical distribution, which is incorporated with feature-level alignment constraints to enhance the coherence between new and old knowledge, effectively improving historical prototype utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a superior balance between plasticity and stability, outperforming state-of-the-art LReID methods by a large margin.Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) suffers from the catastrophic forgetting problem when learning from non-stationary data streams.

Abstract: Background Blood transfusion is increasingly utilised to manage haemorrhagic shock in prehospital environments. This practice is particularly relevant in settings where delays to definitive treatment are common due to extended evacuation timelines, limited resupply, and challenging environmental conditions. Safe and effective transfusion in these contexts depends on competent, well-prepared providers. Non-physician personnel may be required to perform transfusions independently in high-stakes situations without direct physician supervision. This scoping review synthesizes current literature on blood transfusion training for prehospital providers, with a focus on instructional design, simulation modalities, knowledge retention, and outcome evaluation. Methods We conducted a scoping review following Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and reported in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR framework. Seven databases were systematically searched through 20 February 2025. Eligible studies described transfusion training for non-physician healthcare providers in prehospital or austere environments. Data were extracted on instructional strategies, simulation modalities, and outcome measures. Outcomes were categorised using the Kirkpatrick Model, and instructional design features mapped to simulation-based education frameworks. Results Six studies involving 475 participants were included. Participants included combat medics, paramedics, registered nurses, physician assistants, and medical students. Training was delivered across environments including simulation centres, field-based exercises, and in-theatre deployments. All studies featured face-to-face instruction and hands-on skills training. Simulation modalities included part-task trainers in four studies, high-fidelity mannequins in two, live human models in two, and real-world transfusions in one. Instructional design features such as team-based learning, repeated practice, and structured feedback were reported in most studies. Outcomes were reported across all four Kirkpatrick levels. Four studies assessed learner satisfaction and confidence (Level 1), five evaluated knowledge and procedural skill acquisition (Level 2), three assessed behavioural change in practice (Level 3), and one reported patient-level outcomes during operational missions (Level 4). None assessed long-term retention. Variability in instructional methods and limited evaluation at higher outcome levels constrained generalizability. Conclusions Blood transfusion training for prehospital providers appears feasible and associated with short-term improvements in knowledge, skills, and confidence. However, inconsistent instructional design and limited evaluation of long-term or clinical outcomes indicate important gaps. Structured, simulation-informed programs aligned with operational needs may improve training consistency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Background Exsanguinating hemorrhage is the most common cause of preventable trauma death at the injury scene, and it is often due to the inability to control bleeding immediately. Training layperson first responders (LFR) in trauma care, particularly hemorrhage control, has been recommended to address this trauma care gap. We conducted a systematic review (SR) to analyze the effect of hemorrhage control training courses for LFRs on knowledge, skill, and attitude to intervene in trauma patients. Methods PubMed and Google Scholar databases were used to identify relevant peer-reviewed research articles describing evaluations of hemorrhage control courses for LFR between 2013 and 2024. Studies examined whether the training course was implemented in low- and middle-income countries (LMICS); trainees were LFR and had outcome measures, including knowledge, skills, attitudes (confidence gained, willingness, comfort, and likelihood to intervene) toward care utilization for trauma patients, as well as outcomes. Results The SR included 12 articles. The quality of the selected studies was generally high. Five studies (42%) reported improved willingness, confidence, comfort, and the likelihood of responding safely to trauma. Nine studies (75%) used pre-and post-tests to document knowledge acquired, and five studies (42%) used knowledge retention evaluation at different intervals and reported substantial knowledge and skill reductions after a few months (1–3 months, 3–6 months, or both 6 and 9 months or up to 3 years). A few studies followed incident reports to document the utilization of knowledge and skills acquired during training. None reported patient outcomes. Conclusion Bleeding control training courses for layperson first responders in LMICS significantly improve knowledge, skill, confidence, and willingness to intervene to apply bleeding control techniques to trauma patients. Evaluating clinically relevant outcomes is needed to strengthen the evidence.

Abstract: Despite Point-of-Care Ultrasound (PoCUS) emerging as an essential clinical skill, evidence regarding practitioners' knowledge retention and competence remains poorly synthesized. This systematic review sought to evaluate PoCUS competency retention patterns using the Indication, Acquisition, Interpretation, Medical decision-making (I-AIM) framework following various educational interventions and to identify factors influencing long-term skill retention among healthcare professional trainees. PURPOSE Despite Point-of-Care Ultrasound (PoCUS) emerging as an essential clinical skill, evidence regarding practitioners' knowledge retention and competence remains poorly synthesized. This systematic review sought to evaluate PoCUS competency retention patterns using the Indication, Acquisition, Interpretation, Medical decision-making (I-AIM) framework following various educational interventions and to identify factors influencing long-term skill retention among healthcare professional trainees.The authors conducted a systematic review by searching PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Embase databases (1990-2024) for studies evaluating PoCUS educational interventions with objective competency measures and retention assessment. Data were analysed based on educational strategies, course duration and retention patterns across I-AIM domains. METHODS The authors conducted a systematic review by searching PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Embase databases (1990-2024) for studies evaluating PoCUS educational interventions with objective competency measures and retention assessment. Data were analysed based on educational strategies, course duration and retention patterns across I-AIM domains.Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 1638 participants (38.6% medical students, 20.5% attending physicians). Most studies employed a single-group pretest-posttest design (54.8%) and demonstrated moderate-to-high methodological quality (Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument median: 12.5, interquartile range [IQR]: 11.0 to 13.0). Within the I-AIM framework analysis, all domains of competency retention demonstrated a decline over a 1-12-month follow-up period. The Acquisition domain showed the most significant decline with median percentage changes of -11.8% (IQR: -16.5% to -6.4%), followed by Interpretation, Medical decision-making and Indication. Short-course programs (≤4 h) demonstrated greater competency decline (median: -11.8%, IQR: -16.9% to -4.4%) compared to long-course programs (median: -2.6%, IQR: -6.8% to 1.3%). Hands-on practice with high-fidelity simulation and clinical context integration were associated with superior retention outcomes across multiple domains. RESULTS Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 1638 participants (38.6% medical students, 20.5% attending physicians). Most studies employed a single-group pretest-posttest design (54.8%) and demonstrated moderate-to-high methodological quality (Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument median: 12.5, interquartile range [IQR]: 11.0 to 13.0). Within the I-AIM framework analysis, all domains of competency retention demonstrated a decline over a 1-12-month follow-up period.

Hands-on practice with high-fidelity simulation and clinical context integration were associated with superior retention outcomes across multiple domains.Ultrasound competence retention showed variable decay patterns across I-AIM domains, with Acquisition skills showing the most pronounced deterioration, particularly following short-course programs. Comprehensive training programs integrating high-fidelity hands-on practice and clinical context may enhance PoCUS retention for healthcare providers. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound competence retention showed variable decay patterns across I-AIM domains, with Acquisition skills showing the most pronounced deterioration, particularly following short-course programs. Comprehensive training programs integrating high-fidelity hands-on practice and clinical context may enhance PoCUS retention for healthcare providers.

Perceived usefulness and effectiveness of a MOOC on healthcare during the pandemic

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/perceived-usefulness-effectiveness-mooc-on/docview/3216444534/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant constraints to healthcare professionals in accessing evidence-based and certified education. This has highlighted the need for massive open online courses (MOOCs), considering their flexibility in digital access and time management. This study aimed to assess the intention of healthcare professionals to use a MOOC in lifelong learning during a pandemic outbreak and its effectiveness in knowledge retention. A descriptive study was conducted involving 2629 participants enrolled in a COVID-19-related open-access MOOC who agreed to participate in this study. A validated questionnaire was applied to collect the data. Data were processed and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The study revealed the existence of certified trainees and non-certified explorers. The MOOC was useful to the healthcare professionals’ lifelong training (mean of 4.4 in 5) and perceived ease of use (mean of 4.4 in 5), with most professionals intending to continue using lifelong training (mean of 4.4 in 5). Moreover, participants reported high levels of satisfaction (4.5 in 5). The analysis of the mean score of the initial and final assessment per participant showed statistically significant differences ( t 795  = 58.5; P  < 0.001; d  = 0.19), confirming the programme’s effectiveness in knowledge retention. Findings also reveal higher completion rates (32.2%) compared to the literature (~12%), emphasising the importance of implementing a learning experience tailored to reskilling based on practical, collaborative, and dynamic content. These study results underscore the perceived ease of use, usefulness, and the intention of healthcare professionals to use MOOCs in lifelong learning and demonstrate their effectiveness in knowledge retention. Results emphasise the need for developing modular, practical, interactive, collaborative and immersive learning experiences to increase completion rates and meet the needs of professionals in this area.

Abstract: Podcasts are rapidly gaining popularity within medical education, but their acceptability and effectiveness within primary care education remains understudied. BACKGROUND Podcasts are rapidly gaining popularity within medical education, but their acceptability and effectiveness within primary care education remains understudied.To evaluate the attitudes of general practice specialty trainees (GPSTs) and GP trainers towards audio podcasts for primary care medical education. AIM To evaluate the attitudes of general practice specialty trainees (GPSTs) and GP trainers towards audio podcasts for primary care medical education.A cross-sectional questionnaire distributed to all GPSTs and GP trainers in Scotland. DESIGN & SETTING A cross-sectional questionnaire distributed to all GPSTs and GP trainers in Scotland.The survey evaluated podcast usage patterns, their perceived effectiveness, and perspectives on the benefits and challenges of podcast-based education. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics, and qualitative data underwent thematic analysis. METHOD The survey evaluated podcast usage patterns, their perceived effectiveness, and perspectives on the benefits and challenges of podcast-based education. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics, and qualitative data underwent thematic analysis.Of 1995 invited participants, 219 individuals (11.0%) responded. Medical education podcasts were used by 69.9% of responders, with higher usage among GPSTs (73.5%) than GP trainers (65.7%). Most responders (89.0%) perceived podcasts as an effective medium for primary care education. The majority of responders noted improvements in professional knowledge (92.8%), confidence in delivering patient care (73.5%), and clinical care provision (81.6%), as a result of podcast usage. Key benefits of podcasts included flexibility and accessibility, while the main challenge was personal time constraints. Responders highlighted quality assurance and awareness as key areas for improving the experience of podcast-based education. RESULTS Of 1995 invited participants, 219 individuals (11.0%) responded.

Abstract: ENG English ENG BACKGROUND: Mexico is one of the countries with the highest cultural, biological, and agrobiological diversity. However, an accelerated process of ancestral knowledge loss, related to the management of agrobiodiversity, native seeds, and other edible plant species management is affecting food sovereignty. This process of knowledge loss was documented at the Ñäñho region, of southern Querétaro, where our study took place. Our objective was to document the diversity of edible plant diversity, management, and use as well as the agroecosystems from which they are obtained. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted over 2 years (2021–2023) with 50 informants selected through a snowball sampling. Informal interviews and participant observations were also used with these and other people from the same community. Herbarium specimens and seed accessions were collected and photographed. RESULTS: In total, 119 edible plant species were identified. The richest families were Solanaceae, Rosaceae, Cactaceae, and Asteraceae. The edible species occur in 11 agroecosystems with 58.6% of the species native to Mexico, and 41.4% introduced. The orchard, rustic greenhouse, house “milpa,” mountain hill, and backyard, have the highest species diversity. The main management types were sowing and gathering plants. Eighty-five plant names were recorded in the Hñäñho language. The plant parts used were fruits (60.5%) and stems (46.2%). The gastronomic categories with the highest species percentage were stews, beverages, and refreshments, while the highest species number used in the gastronomic categories were cacti stalks or “nopales” (Opuntia spp.), maize (Zea mays), and amaranth (Amaranthus spp.). CONCLUSIONS: The records in Southern Querétaro of edible plants and agroecosystems diversity were high. The plants, local knowledge documentation, and species management provide the basis for promoting projects focused on the Ñäñho biocultural wealth. Efforts are needed to encourage the least represented regional species. Community development programs are needed for food security and sovereignty; these are based on the local biocultural resources.

Abstract: Background The Basic Emergency Care (BEC) course was created by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM) to train frontline providers in low-resource settings. This study aims to evaluate long-term retention and maintenance of emergency care knowledge and confidence among University of Nairobi School of Medicine graduates after completing the BEC course. Methods This longitudinal, prospective, comparative study was conducted with recent graduates of the University of Nairobi School of Medicine from October 2021 to May 2023. Participants’ retention of emergency medicine knowledge was assessed comparing a pre/post course test and a multiple-choice examination 12 to 18 months after completing the BEC course. A survey assessed participants’ confidence in managing patients with emergencies 12–18 months after completing the BEC course using a 4-point Likert scale. These results were compared to a control group of recent University of Nairobi School of Medicine graduates who did not take the BEC course. Results The follow-up test scores were lower than the immediate post-course test scores, which suggests some knowledge loss over time. Compared to the control group, the BEC participants had higher test scores during the follow-up period although the difference was not significant. There was no difference between most of the immediate post-course and follow-up survey responses. On follow-up evaluation, BEC participants reported a significant decrease in confidence in understanding emergency drugs and managing an obstructed airway and a patient requiring immobilization. However, compared to the control group, BEC participants had significantly higher self-reported confidence in most areas assessed by the survey. Conclusion The WHO BEC course is effective for emergency care training for medical students at the University of Nairobi. However, the participants’ decrease in knowledge and confidence 12 to 18 months after the BEC course suggests the need for regular refresher courses.

Abstract: This study addressed three key challenges in subject-independent electroencephalography (EEG) emotion recognition: limited data availability, restricted cross-domain knowledge transfer, and suboptimal feature extraction. The aim is to develop an innovative framework that enhances recognition performance while preserving data privacy. BACKGROUND This study addressed three key challenges in subject-independent electroencephalography (EEG) emotion recognition: limited data availability, restricted cross-domain knowledge transfer, and suboptimal feature extraction. The aim is to develop an innovative framework that enhances recognition performance while preserving data privacy.This study introduces a novel multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework that incorporates data privacy considerations. The framework first comprises n subnets, each sequentially trained on distinct EEG datasets without data sharing. The subnets, excluding the initial one, acquire knowledge through the weights and features of all preceding subnets, enabling access to more EEG signals during the training process while maintaining privacy. To enhance cross-domain knowledge transfer, a multi-teacher knowledge distillation strategy was designed, featuring knowledge filters and adaptive multi-teacher knowledge distillation losses. The knowledge filter integrates cross-domain information using a multi-head attention module with a gate mechanism, ensuring effective inheritance of knowledge from all previous subnets. Simultaneously, the adaptive multi-teacher knowledge distillation loss dynamically adjusts the direction of knowledge transfer based on filtered feature similarity, preventing knowledge loss in single-teacher models. Furthermore, a spatio-temporal gate module is proposed to eliminate unnecessary frame-level information from different channels and extract important channels for improved feature representation without requiring expert knowledge.

Abstract: Zoos play a crucial role in public education and wildlife engagement, yet traditional visits often lack interactive elements that foster meaningful connections between visitors and animals. In this paper, we introduce ZooWear, a head-mounted wearable featuring cartoon-style animal ears that provides haptic feedback patterns simulating an animal’s reactions to other species in the food chain. With ZooWear, we focused on examining its effectiveness in affording perspective-taking during human-animal encounters, promoting embodied knowledge retention, and enriching the zoo experiences. We first conducted a between-subject experiment in lab-based virtual zoo visits to evaluate its effectiveness in creating effective learning experiences and enhancing connections to wildlife. This was followed by a real-world zoo experiment, which showed that ZooWear promoted nature connectedness and enabled more emotionally and socially engaging experiences. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating perspective-taking into zoo experiences through animal-inspired wearables, embodied sensory feedback, and narrative-driven experiences.

Abstract: Game-based learning (GBL) is increasingly used in medical education to supplement traditional didactic learning methods. Adult learners in particular may benefit from GBL, given the autonomous and iterative nature of a well-designed educational game. A table-top, multipart board game was designed to help medical students consolidate clinical knowledge-related clinical skills were also included for a holistic experience. Medical students (n = 12) participated in an observed 1-h game session. Semi-structured individual interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by independent researchers to interpret and identify themes. Analysis of interviews and observational data identified five key themes relating to the GBL experience: (1) gameplay discussion facilitated self-identification of gaps in knowledge, giving students a roadmap of what to study next; (2) peer-to-peer knowledge shared during the game prompted players to reflect upon individual study techniques; (3) gameplay created memorable "lightbulb" moments in understanding, allowing linking together of broader concepts; (4) gameplay created a judgment-free environment that provided relief from prevailing "medical school guilt" associated with taking breaks, thus improving well-being; (5) game mechanics are critical to ensure GBL delivers effective learning experiences. An aspect of learning that is often neglected is the ability for adult learners to cultivate joy in their studies-a drive to make learning fun. This qualitative study provides further insight into GBL, supporting and expanding upon preexisting literature. Namely, developing refined, accessible GBL resources improves knowledge retention, increases motivation, and facilitates metacognitive insight into a learner's revision approach.Game-based learning (GBL) is increasingly used in medical education to supplement traditional didactic learning methods.

Abstract: Orthopedic training, one of the most useful but under-represented specialties in undergraduate medical curricula, has some difficulties in clinical teaching. BACKGROUND Orthopedic training, one of the most useful but under-represented specialties in undergraduate medical curricula, has some difficulties in clinical teaching.To determine if simulation-based learning (SBL) was effective in enhancing procedural accuracy, skill confidence, and knowledge recall in final-year medical students. AIM To determine if simulation-based learning (SBL) was effective in enhancing procedural accuracy, skill confidence, and knowledge recall in final-year medical students.This was a cross-sectional observational study performed in the Department of Orthopaedics in a tertiary care teaching hospital with simulation training facilities. The trial was conducted over 2 months (January 2025-February 2025) and was designed to determine the effect of SBL on procedural skills, knowledge retention, and self-perceived confidence in a group of final-year medical students. The inclusion criterion was undergraduate medical students in their final year who had clinical postings in orthopedics. Convenience sampling was used to recruit 106 students. The sample size was estimated to achieve a post-training 50% improvement ratio in procedural accuracy, a confidence interval of 95%, and an absolute precision of 10%. The simulation sessions included exercises with synthetic bone models, cast equipment, and procedural packs [orthopedic skills: (1) Closed fracture reduction; (2) Application of plaster; and (3) Traction]. Each session consisted of an instructor-led demonstration, practice under supervision, and immediate feedback.

Knowledge retention also improved markedly with post-test scores increasing from 63.4% to 78.2% ( P < 0.001). Self-reported confidence levels showed a substantial gain, increasing from 4.6 to 8.2 on a 10-point scale. Prior simulation exposure and academic performance ≥ 75% were significantly associated with higher post-training accuracy. Gender had no significant influence on outcomes.

Abstract: The integration of intelligent technologies in surgical nursing education offers opportunities to enhance learning outcomes and address challenges in mastering complex topics. Knowledge graphs serve as a visual and interactive learning tool. It represents a novel approach to improving systematic thinking and enhancing knowledge retention in blended teaching models. BACKGROUND The integration of intelligent technologies in surgical nursing education offers opportunities to enhance learning outcomes and address challenges in mastering complex topics. Knowledge graphs serve as a visual and interactive learning tool. It represents a novel approach to improving systematic thinking and enhancing knowledge retention in blended teaching models.This study explored nursing undergraduates' experiences with a knowledge graph platform in surgical nursing education, focusing on perceptions of its usefulness and ease of use, factors influencing engagement, and suggestions for improvement. AIM This study explored nursing undergraduates' experiences with a knowledge graph platform in surgical nursing education, focusing on perceptions of its usefulness and ease of use, factors influencing engagement, and suggestions for improvement.A qualitative descriptive study approach was employed to investigate the experiences of 13 nursing students. Semi-structured interviews were conducted after completing a surgical nursing course. The interviews were guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis to identify key themes related to knowledge graph use. METHODS A qualitative descriptive study approach was employed to investigate the experiences of 13 nursing students. Semi-structured interviews were conducted after completing a surgical nursing course. The interviews were guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis to identify key themes related to knowledge graph use.The analysis identified three main themes: (1) Developing conceptual clarity through knowledge integration, where knowledge graphs helped students build systematic thinking, discover learning pathways, and enhance post-class review efficiency; (2) Stimulating interest through enriched content, where enriched and well-organized content increased students' interest and enthusiasm for independent study; and (3) Navigating challenges and envisioning opportunities, where participants reported technical and access limitations, a need for richer content, and requests for clearer usage guidance. RESULTS The analysis identified three main themes: (1) Developing conceptual clarity through knowledge integration, where knowledge graphs helped students build systematic thinking, discover learning pathways, and enhance post-class review efficiency; (2) Stimulating interest through enriched content, where enriched and well-organized content increased students' interest and enthusiasm for independent study; and (3) Navigating challenges and envisioning opportunities, where participants reported technical and access limitations, a need for richer content, and requests for clearer usage guidance.Knowledge graphs offer innovative intelligent technology integration within blended nursing education. These tools cultivate systematic thinking, enhance surgical nursing knowledge and skill development, and enrich the comprehensive learning experience. Future studies should explore sustained educational outcomes, broaden technological capabilities, and examine cross-contextual adaptability. CONCLUSION Knowledge graphs offer innovative intelligent technology integration within blended nursing education.

Abstract: Emotions significantly influence decision-making and performance in critical care settings. In situ simulation (ISS) has emerged as an educational tool that replicates real scenarios in clinical environments, potentially evoking authentic emotional responses. This scoping review examined how emotions have been studied in critical care ISS and their impact on learning and performance. BACKGROUND Emotions significantly influence decision-making and performance in critical care settings. In situ simulation (ISS) has emerged as an educational tool that replicates real scenarios in clinical environments, potentially evoking authentic emotional responses. This scoping review examined how emotions have been studied in critical care ISS and their impact on learning and performance.Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search across SCOPUS, PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases for articles published between January 2014 and June 2024. Studies examining emotional responses during ISS among healthcare professionals in critical care settings were included. Data were extracted using a standardized form and analyzed through narrative synthesis. METHODS Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search across SCOPUS, PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases for articles published between January 2014 and June 2024. Studies examining emotional responses during ISS among healthcare professionals in critical care settings were included. Data were extracted using a standardized form and analyzed through narrative synthesis.Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Analysis revealed that ISS evokes both positive and negative emotions comparable to real clinical scenarios, demonstrating psychological fidelity measured through standardized scales and physiological variables. While negative emotions like stress and anxiety were most extensively studied, positive emotions showed a significant correlation with enhanced performance. The concept of affective bonding emerged as a key component for knowledge retention and skill transfer. RESULTS Nine studies met the inclusion criteria.

While negative emotions like stress and anxiety were most extensively studied, positive emotions showed a significant correlation with enhanced performance. The concept of affective bonding emerged as a key component for knowledge retention and skill transfer.ISS can recreate both technical and certain emotional aspects of clinical environments, particularly stress responses. The dual presence of positive and negative emotions contributes to learning effectiveness, with positive emotions enhancing performance and negative emotions building resilience when properly managed. The reported equivalence between emotional responses in simulated and real clinical scenarios validates ISS as an effective preparatory tool for critical care practice through the mechanism of affective bonding.

Abstract: Immersive virtual reality (IVR) based on head-mounted displays (HMD), can construct virtual learning environments for medical education. This study aims to explore the application and effectiveness of IVR in medical education. INTRODUCTION Immersive virtual reality (IVR) based on head-mounted displays (HMD), can construct virtual learning environments for medical education. This study aims to explore the application and effectiveness of IVR in medical education.This review followed the PRISMA guidelines and searched the databases of Web of Science, Springer Link, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Science Direct for controlled experimental studies published between January 1 2017 and October 1, 2025 on the application of IVR to medical education. METHODS This review followed the PRISMA guidelines and searched the databases of Web of Science, Springer Link, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Science Direct for controlled experimental studies published between January 1 2017 and October 1, 2025 on the application of IVR to medical education.36 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Among them 34 reported significantly better objective learning outcomes and 29 showed more positive subjective feedback. The findings suggest that IVR is particularly effective in areas such as clinical surgery training, anatomy education, medical skill development, and nursing education. IVR demonstrates long-term effects in medical knowledge acquirement. RESULTS 36 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Among them 34 reported significantly better objective learning outcomes and 29 showed more positive subjective feedback. The findings suggest that IVR is particularly effective in areas such as clinical surgery training, anatomy education, medical skill development, and nursing education. IVR demonstrates long-term effects in medical knowledge acquirement.The systematic review reveals that IVR is particularly effective in practice-based medical education. It highlights that VR demonstrates superior long-term knowledge retention and knowledge enhancement. A comprehensive evaluation of IVR use in medical education requires additional perspectives from teachers, and consideration from the dark side of IVR, i.e., technology-induced stress and time. Future IVR implementation in medical education calls for more efforts to address challenges in user adaptability, cost, privacy and regulatory compliance. CONCLUSIONS The systematic review reveals that IVR is particularly effective in practice-based medical education. It highlights that VR demonstrates superior long-term knowledge retention and knowledge enhancement. A comprehensive evaluation of IVR use in medical education requires additional perspectives from teachers, and consideration from the dark side of IVR, i.e., technology-induced stress and time. Future IVR implementation in medical education calls for more efforts to address challenges in user adaptability, cost, privacy and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Large language models such as ChatGPT offer significant opportunities for medical education. However, empirical data on actual usage patterns, perceived benefits, and limitations among medical students remain limited. Background Large language models such as ChatGPT offer significant opportunities for medical education. However, empirical data on actual usage patterns, perceived benefits, and limitations among medical students remain limited.This study aimed to assess how medical students in Germany use ChatGPT, their perceptions of its educational value, and the challenges and concerns associated with its use. Objective This study aimed to assess how medical students in Germany use ChatGPT, their perceptions of its educational value, and the challenges and concerns associated with its use.A cross-sectional 17-item online survey was conducted between May and August 2024 among medical students from Philipps University Marburg, Germany. A mixed methods approach was applied, combining descriptive and inferential statistical analysis with qualitative content analysis of open-ended responses. Methods A cross-sectional 17-item online survey was conducted between May and August 2024 among medical students from Philipps University Marburg, Germany. A mixed methods approach was applied, combining descriptive and inferential statistical analysis with qualitative content analysis of open-ended responses.A total of 84 fully completed surveys were included in the analysis (response rate: 26.7%; 315 surveys started). Overall, 76.2% (64/84) of the participants reported having used ChatGPT for medical education, with significantly higher usage during exam periods (P=.003). Preclinical students reported higher overall usage than clinical students (P=.02). ChatGPT was primarily used for summarizing information by 60.7% (51/84) of students, for literature research by 57.7% (49/84), and for clarifying concepts by 47.1% (40/84). A total of 70.2% (59/84) felt that it helped them save time, and 51.2% (43/84) reported an improved understanding of content. In contrast, only 31% (26/84) saw benefits for applying knowledge and 15.5% (13/84) for long-term knowledge retention. Qualitative responses highlighted clear benefits such as time savings and support in exam preparation, while also pointing to potential applications in clinical documentation and expressing concerns about misinformation and source transparency. However, 73.3% (55/75) expressed concerns about misinformation, and 72.6% (61/84) reported lacking confidence in their artificial intelligence (AI)-related skills. Only 41.7% (35/84) stated that they trust ChatGPT's outputs. Students who used the tool more frequently also reported higher levels of trust in ChatGPT's outputs (r=0.374, P<.001). Over 70% of respondents indicated a strong desire for increased integration of AI-related education and practical applications within the medical curriculum.

Over 70% of respondents indicated a strong desire for increased integration of AI-related education and practical applications within the medical curriculum.ChatGPT was already widely used among medical students, especially in exam preparation and the early stages of training. Students valued its efficiency and support for understanding complex material, but its long-term influence on learning is limited. Concerns about reliability, source transparency, and data privacy remain, and AI skills played a key role in shaping usage. These findings underscore the need to integrate structured, practice-oriented AI education into medical training to support critical, informed, and ethical use of large language models.

Abstract: A focused, practical guide for general paediatricians and resident doctors managing neonates with suspected critical congenital heart disease (CHD), a spectrum of life-threatening cardiac defects requiring intervention. Through detailed case examples, we simulate real-world scenarios that highlight the diagnostic challenges and importance of early recognition. The article reviews essential clinical signs-including differential preductal and postductal oxygen saturations, persistent cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen, poor perfusion and weak femoral pulses-that should raise suspicion for critical CHD. It outlines a stepwise approach to initial management, encompassing immediate stabilisation with cautious fluid administration, and the early use of prostaglandin E1 infusions to maintain and increase ductal patency in duct-dependent lesions. Guidance is provided on prostaglandin, escalation, monitoring for side effects and the need for early discussion with tertiary cardiac centres. The article also addresses the careful titration of oxygen therapy to avoid potential risks unique to certain cardiac physiologies. Emphasis is placed on the limitations of prenatal screening programmes and the need for vigilance in postnatal care. Supplementary quiz questions reinforce key learning objectives and ensure knowledge retention. In summary, this article serves as an educational resource for prompt recognition, stabilisation and referral of neonates with critical CHD.A focused, practical guide for general paediatricians and resident doctors managing neonates with suspected critical congenital heart disease (CHD), a spectrum of life-threatening cardiac defects requiring intervention.

Abstract: Infection prevention and control (IPC) education is critical in reducing healthcare-associated infections, yet traditional teaching methods often lack engagement and practical relevance. Simulation-based education, particularly game-based learning, offers an innovative approach to improve knowledge retention and learner motivation. This study explores the use of a simulation game, Microbe Hunters, designed to enhance IPC awareness and practice among IPC link practitioners through an immersive escape room format. Microbe hunters is an escape-room style simulation that creates a more immersive educational experience. The simulation tasked participants with identifying an outbreak organism, completing the chain of infection, and recommending appropriate transmission-based precautions, PPE, and terminal cleaning. The activity concluded with team presentations and a structured debrief. A qualitative evaluation was conducted to assess learning experiences. Participants reported high levels of engagement, enjoyment, and improved understanding of IPC principles. They valued the hands-on problem-solving, teamwork, and realistic scenario design. The experience promoted critical thinking and practical application of knowledge. Microbe Hunters demonstrated that simulation-based, game-style learning is an effective and enjoyable method for IPC education. Grounded in experiential and constructivist learning theories, the approach supports active engagement and knowledge construction. Future research should investigate broader implementation, long-term outcomes, and scalability across healthcare teams.Infection prevention and control (IPC) education is critical in reducing healthcare-associated infections, yet traditional teaching methods often lack engagement and practical relevance.

Abstract: Advancing the integration of blended learning within genuine physical education (PE) settings, this research explores the effects of an innovative Gamified Blended Learning model on the learning experiences of secondary school students in gymnastics. This study presents data from 127 students, aged 17.42 ± 0.80 years, divided quasi-experimentally between 67 in the Gamified Blended Learning classroom (GBL) group and 60 in the traditional approach (TA) group. Data were collected before and after a six-week intervention, assessing motor learning through gymnastics floor routines, knowledge retention in gymnastics via a custom-designed written test, and both autonomous (AMI) and controlled motivation indexes (CMI) through the “Situational Motivation Scale” (SIMS). During the intervention, Results showed that the GBL group significantly outperformed the TA group in motor learning (ΔGBL = 6.53 ± 1.61 vs. ΔTA = 4.98 ± 1.46) and knowledge retention (ΔGBL = 3.88 ± 2.55 vs. ΔTA = 1.31 ± 3.23), with p  < 0.001. The GBL group also exhibited a significant increase in AMI (z = 6.94; p  < 0.001) and a decrease in CMI (z = 4.12; p  < 0.001), opposite to the TA group. This research underscores the efficacy of the suggested GBL model in boosting motor, cognitive, and affective outcomes for secondary school students within genuine PE settings.

Abstract: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) simulation in tracheostomy teaching for healthcare professionals and its impact on short- and medium-term knowledge retention. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) simulation in tracheostomy teaching for healthcare professionals and its impact on short- and medium-term knowledge retention.A prospective educational study was conducted among 26 healthcare professionals (17 VR; 9 non-VR). Both groups received standard face-to-face tracheostomy teaching, while the VR group additionally completed a 40-minute hybrid simulation using Goggleminds™ software based on the National Tracheostomy Safety Project algorithm. Knowledge was assessed using an eight-item multiple-choice questionnaire immediately after training (Day 0) and after 30 days (Day 30). Data were analysed using independent-samples t -tests and Mann-Whitney U tests to confirm robustness. METHOD A prospective educational study was conducted among 26 healthcare professionals (17 VR; 9 non-VR). Both groups received standard face-to-face tracheostomy teaching, while the VR group additionally completed a 40-minute hybrid simulation using Goggleminds™ software based on the National Tracheostomy Safety Project algorithm. Knowledge was assessed using an eight-item multiple-choice questionnaire immediately after training (Day 0) and after 30 days (Day 30). Data were analysed using independent-samples t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests to confirm robustness.Participants in the VR group achieved significantly higher mean scores immediately after training (7.24 ± 0.75) compared with the non-VR group (6.33 ± 0.87; p = 0.01). At 30 days, the VR group demonstrated superior knowledge retention (6.88 ± 0.93) compared with the non-VR group (4.67 ± 1.00; p < 0.001). These findings indicate that VR-based tracheostomy simulation enhances both learning and retention of knowledge compared with conventional teaching. RESULTS Participants in the VR group achieved significantly higher mean scores immediately after training (7.24 ± 0.75) compared with the non-VR group (6.33 ± 0.87; p = 0.01). At 30 days, the VR group demonstrated superior knowledge retention (6.88 ± 0.93) compared with the non-VR group (4.67 ± 1.00; p < 0.001). These findings indicate that VR-based tracheostomy simulation enhances both learning and retention of knowledge compared with conventional teaching.VR-based tracheostomy simulation significantly improved knowledge acquisition and 30-day retention among healthcare professionals. Integrating VR into tracheostomy education may help to standardise training, improve confidence, and enhance patient safety in emergency airway management.

Abstract: To compare the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-based continuing medical education (CME) with traditional lecture-based methods in enhancing radiation safety knowledge among health care professionals. PURPOSE To compare the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-based continuing medical education (CME) with traditional lecture-based methods in enhancing radiation safety knowledge among health care professionals.Thirty-six health care professionals, including scrub nurses, cardiologists, and orthopedic surgeons, completed VR-based (RadSafe VR; Virtual Medical Coaching) and traditional training. Evaluations taken before and after training assessed knowledge retention, learner satisfaction, and radiation safety practices. Occupational eye dose radiation exposure also was monitored for 40 weeks using dosimeters. METHODS Thirty-six health care professionals, including scrub nurses, cardiologists, and orthopedic surgeons, completed VR-based (RadSafe VR; Virtual Medical Coaching) and traditional training. Evaluations taken before and after training assessed knowledge retention, learner satisfaction, and radiation safety practices. Occupational eye dose radiation exposure also was monitored for 40 weeks using dosimeters.VR training improved knowledge retention by 30% at 3 months after training compared with traditional methods. Eye dose exposure decreased by 25%, indicating the intervention effectively reduced occupational radiation risks. In addition, 85% of participants preferred VR training because of its interactive and immersive features. RESULTS VR training improved knowledge retention by 30% at 3 months after training compared with traditional methods. Eye dose exposure decreased by 25%, indicating the intervention effectively reduced occupational radiation risks. In addition, 85% of participants preferred VR training because of its interactive and immersive features.VR training demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing radiation exposure while fostering behavioral adherence to safety protocols. This aligns with prior studies that emphasize VR's ability to address the limitations of traditional methods of CME such as limited engagement and practical application. The sustained reductions in radiation exposure observed in this study suggest VR has the potential to promote long-term improvements in safety culture among health care professionals. DISCUSSION VR training demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing radiation exposure while fostering behavioral adherence to safety protocols. This aligns with prior studies that emphasize VR's ability to address the limitations of traditional methods of CME such as limited engagement and practical application. The sustained reductions in radiation exposure observed in this study suggest VR has the potential to promote long-term improvements in safety culture among health care professionals.VR-based CME improved radiation safety knowledge retention and significantly reduced radiation exposure. Its integration into training programs offers a cost-effective and successful approach to advancing safety protocols in clinical practice. Further research is warranted to confirm these outcomes. CONCLUSION VR-based CME improved radiation safety knowledge retention and significantly reduced radiation exposure. Its integration into training programs offers a cost-effective and successful approach to advancing safety protocols in clinical practice. Further research is warranted to confirm these outcomes.

Abstract: Graduate medical education (GME) is undergoing a significant pedagogical transformation, moving away from traditional, passive learning environments toward more dynamic, learner-centered approaches. This narrative review examines the implementation and impact of active teaching methods in GME, with a specific focus on the flipped classroom model. In this narrative review, we compare and contrast these innovative strategies with traditional didactic lectures, evaluating their effects on learner engagement, knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, and overall satisfaction. Active learning, grounded in constructivist theory, repositions the resident as an active participant in their education, utilizing methods such as case-based learning, team-based learning, and simulation. The flipped classroom, a prominent example, inverts the conventional educational structure by delivering foundational content outside the classroom to reserve in-person time for collaborative problem-solving and application of knowledge. While traditional methods are efficient for information dissemination, evidence suggests that active learning models foster the development of higher-order thinking and essential clinical competencies. Successfully overcoming implementation challenges requires a strategic approach centered on faculty and learner engagement, continuous feedback, and robust institutional support. This review concludes that the adoption of active teaching methodologies is critical for preparing future physicians with the skills necessary to navigate the complexities of modern healthcare.Graduate medical education (GME) is undergoing a significant pedagogical transformation, moving away from traditional, passive learning environments toward more dynamic, learner-centered approaches.

Abstract: This study examines the impact of Napkin AI, a generative artificial intelligence tool, on student learning outcomes and knowledge retention via creative mind mapping. The research model, which combines the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) with the Information Adoption Model (IAM), comprises six principal independent variables: Social Influence, Learning Support Environment, Ease of Use, Perceived Benefit, Information Quality of Mind Mapping, and Usefulness of Mind Mapping. Mediating variables comprise Behavioral Intention to Use, Actual Use of Mind Mapping, and Cognitive Engagement in Mind Mapping, while Knowledge Retention and Learning Outcome serve as dependent variables. The study employed a quantitative approach with a sample of 570 Vietnamese university students majoring in STEM. Data analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with IBM SPSS 25 and AMOS 24. The model exhibited a satisfactory fit ( χ ²/ df  = 1.906, GFI = 0.889, CFI = 0.935, TLI = 0.929, RMSEA = 0.040, PCLOSE = 1.000), with all direct routes being statistically significant ( p  < 0.001 to p  = 0.037). The findings underscore the significance of user perception and involvement in improving the educational efficacy of AI‐driven mind mapping tools, providing practical implications for technology integration in higher education.

Abstract: Traditional methods for teaching Internet‐of‐things (IoT) in engineering education often lack interactivity and hands‐on engagement, limiting skill development. This study explores Augmented Reality (AR) based learning environment as a solution, enabling students to visualize real‐time data flows, interact with virtual components, and configure IoT systems in a risk‐free setting. Using tools like Unity 3D, Blender, Vuforia SDK, and Arduino IDE, an AR‐based framework is developed and tested against traditional methods. The results show increased student engagement, knowledge retention, and skill acquisition, with a System Usability Score of 82.00%. The paper presents the framework's design, usability assessment, and comparative evaluation, highlighting AR's potential to enhance IoT education. It is observed that the proposed AR‐based framework improves the skill retention by 36% over the traditional method. Further, the performance comparison of proposed method with traditional method is evaluated in terms of students' engagement, learning speed, and user satisfaction. In the end, the limitations of proposed study are addressed, and the future directions are presented.

Abstract: Aim To explore the effectiveness of an immersive educational strategy based on the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework in enhancing nurses’ knowledge retention and learning satisfaction in pressure injury prevention. Background Traditional digital learning alone may not ensure sustained knowledge or engagement in clinical training. The CoI framework provides an effective model for integrating cognitive, social and teaching presence to enhance learning outcomes. Design A single-blind, two-group quasi-experimental study with pre- and post-intervention assessments. Methods Participants were registered nurses from a regional hospital in Taiwan, assigned to either the traditional group or the intervention group. Both groups received digital self-directed learning, while the intervention group additionally engaged in multimedia modules, LINE@ asynchronous discussions and an in-person workshop. Knowledge was assessed at three time points and learning satisfaction was measured post-intervention. Generalized Estimating Equations were used for analysis. Results Both groups showed significant knowledge improvement over time ( p  < .001). The intervention group exhibited greater immediate posttest gains than the traditional group (B = 1.500, p  = .023), but the difference was not sustained at three months ( p  = .881). Learning satisfaction was significantly higher in the intervention group, particularly in comprehension and job relevance ( p  < .05). Conclusion The CoI-based multimodal strategy effectively enhanced nurses’ short-term knowledge and satisfaction through cognitive, social and teaching presence. However, its long-term effects appear limited, indicating the need for continuous reinforcement and extended evaluation to sustain knowledge retention in clinical education.

Abstract: Introduction Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly applied in medical education to enhance learning and patient care. Teaching birth mechanics poses particular challenges, as students must understand complex, dynamic, and rotating intrauterine processes that traditional models cannot adequately represent. VR offers immersive, interactive visualization and has shown promise in other fields, but its role in obstetrics remains underexplored. This study evaluated a novel VR module (Virtual Training for Obstetric Birth Simulation, V.T.O.B.S.) for undergraduate obstetrics education. Methods In this single-center study, 46 medical students used V.T.O.B.S. during their obstetrical block internship and were compared with 120 students without VR exposure (non-equivalent intervention group design). The module consisted of a single, self-directed session. Knowledge retention was assessed 11–17 weeks later in a theoretical Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) station consisting mainly of image-based questions on birth mechanics. Secondary outcomes included acceptance, motion sickness, and free-text feedback. Results No significant differences were found in long-term scores of the OSCE study station between VR and control groups. Subgroup analyses showed no consistent effects, except that visual impairment was associated with significantly lower performance (median 13 [IQR 11–15] vs. 14.5 [12–16], p = 0.003). Acceptance of VR was very high (median = 5 [IQR 4–5]), and motion sickness was rare and mild (median = 2 [1–3]). Free-text responses emphasized the innovative nature of the module, immersive 3D visualization, and the value of VR exposure in a university setting. Observed between-group effects were small and below the detectable threshold, suggesting that minor advantages may have remained uncaptured. Discussion Although no significant knowledge gain was demonstrated, the strong acceptance and usability support the feasibility of VR in undergraduate obstetrics curricula. The absence of measurable effects may relate to the broad learning objective, brief OSCE assessment, single self-directed exposure, and heterogeneous timing between intervention and assessment. V.T.O.B.S. nonetheless represents an innovative educational tool addressing curricular gaps in visualizing dynamic birth mechanics. Future research should explore repeated exposures, assessment formats that directly capture spatial–conceptual understanding, and integration into interprofessional formats for medical and midwifery students as well as postgraduate training.

Abstract: Using the resumes of 200,708 individual auditors from LinkedIn to identify audit personnel turnover in the US Big 4 audit offices, we document a higher probability of financial misstatements among clients of offices with higher auditor turnover. This adverse effect is driven by both busy‐season turnover and voluntary turnover. This effect is also more pronounced when the departing auditors are more experienced and skilled as well as when their offices have less industry expertise, suggesting that the loss of knowledge and skills is one driving force behind turnover‐induced audit quality deterioration. Workload compression serves as another driving force, as the detrimental role of auditor turnover concentrates on offices with more complex clients and more accelerated filers. More importantly, we find that audit offices respond to high auditor turnover directly through internal and external hiring and indirectly through adjusting compensation and promotion schemes, as lower relative salary, higher wage inequity, and lower likelihood of promotion positively affect auditor turnover. We further show that both direct and indirect responses can effectively improve future audit quality. Overall, our results provide insights into audit personnel turnover and human capital management in the United States and suggest that human capital disclosures can help stakeholders evaluate the quality of audit offices’ services.

Abstract: To explore the effectiveness of an immersive educational strategy based on the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework in enhancing nurses' knowledge retention and learning satisfaction in pressure injury prevention. AIM To explore the effectiveness of an immersive educational strategy based on the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework in enhancing nurses' knowledge retention and learning satisfaction in pressure injury prevention.Traditional digital learning alone may not ensure sustained knowledge or engagement in clinical training. The CoI framework provides an effective model for integrating cognitive, social and teaching presence to enhance learning outcomes. BACKGROUND Traditional digital learning alone may not ensure sustained knowledge or engagement in clinical training. The CoI framework provides an effective model for integrating cognitive, social and teaching presence to enhance learning outcomes.A single-blind, two-group quasi-experimental study with pre- and post-intervention assessments. DESIGN A single-blind, two-group quasi-experimental study with pre- and post-intervention assessments.Participants were registered nurses from a regional hospital in Taiwan, assigned to either the traditional group or the intervention group. Both groups received digital self-directed learning, while the intervention group additionally engaged in multimedia modules, LINE@ asynchronous discussions and an in-person workshop. Knowledge was assessed at three time points and learning satisfaction was measured post-intervention. Generalized Estimating Equations were used for analysis. METHODS Participants were registered nurses from a regional hospital in Taiwan, assigned to either the traditional group or the intervention group. Both groups received digital self-directed learning, while the intervention group additionally engaged in multimedia modules, LINE@ asynchronous discussions and an in-person workshop. Knowledge was assessed at three time points and learning satisfaction was measured post-intervention. Generalized Estimating Equations were used for analysis.Both groups showed significant knowledge improvement over time (p < .001). The intervention group exhibited greater immediate posttest gains than the traditional group (B = 1.500, p = .023), but the difference was not sustained at three months (p = .881). Learning satisfaction was significantly higher in the intervention group, particularly in comprehension and job relevance (p < .05). RESULTS Both groups showed significant knowledge improvement over time (p < .001). The intervention group exhibited greater immediate posttest gains than the traditional group (B = 1.500, p = .023), but the difference was not sustained at three months (p = .881). Learning satisfaction was significantly higher in the intervention group, particularly in comprehension and job relevance (p < .05).The CoI-based multimodal strategy effectively enhanced nurses' short-term knowledge and satisfaction through cognitive, social and teaching presence. However, its long-term effects appear limited, indicating the need for continuous reinforcement and extended evaluation to sustain knowledge retention in clinical education. CONCLUSION The CoI-based multimodal strategy effectively enhanced nurses' short-term knowledge and satisfaction through cognitive, social and teaching presence. However, its long-term effects appear limited, indicating the need for continuous reinforcement and extended evaluation to sustain knowledge retention in clinical education.

Abstract: Background The Eastern Mediterranean Region suffers disproportionately from paediatric traffic-related injuries. Despite governmental laws, Lebanon—an Eastern Mediterranean Country—has low child restraint (CR) use prevalence. This study examined the impact of using car seat distribution, and child passenger safety education and awareness intervention to improve child passenger safety knowledge and practices among caregivers. Methods This study recruited Lebanese caregivers with one child or more, using a 4-wheel motor vehicle, and not using a car seat. The intervention comprised an educational session followed by a car seat or booster seat distribution and installation check by a certified child passenger safety technician. A baseline assessment questionnaire was used to identify reasons for prior CR non-use. A child passenger safety knowledge test was administered before, immediately after and 3 months post-intervention to assess child passenger safety knowledge retention and compare it to the baseline using the conditional logit model for pre–post interventions. Results Fifty-eight participants underwent the intervention. Affordability was identified as the primary reason for car seat non-use. Three months after the intervention, compliance with CRs use was reported at 100%, and correct responses on the knowledge test significantly increased (p < 0.05) for all items except for harness tightness (p = 0.673). Conclusions Our child passenger safety intervention resulted in improved knowledge and increased self-reported use of CRs in a caregivers’ cohort in Lebanon. Further efforts should address sociocultural and economic barriers and the lack of local child passenger safety technicians to mitigate the region’s paediatric road traffic injury and death toll. Key messages • Our study shows that a distribution plus education intervention facilitated by a certified Child Passenger Safety Technician can effectively improve caregiver-child passenger safety knowledge and restraint use in a low-income and middle-income country with low overall compliance with restraint laws and use. • A distribution plus education intervention aimed at raising awareness, improving knowledge, and increasing the use of child passenger safety restraint systems received high receptivity among caregivers in a low- and middle-income country with a very low baseline use of vehicle restraint systems. Topic Child road safety, motor vehicle - occupant, vehicle restraint systems.

Abstract: Introduction Forensic clinical medicine examines injuries in living individuals and plays a critical role in criminal violence cases, trauma compensation, and judicial rulings. In China, this field contributes substantially to upholding social justice. Current educational approaches struggle to bridge the gap between theory and practice, largely due to privacy constraints during forensic examinations, leaving students ill-prepared to assess real cases and identify key evaluation criteria. Scenario-based simulation training presents a promising alternative to conventional case-based teaching. Methods We compared the efficacy of traditional case-based teaching with scenario-based simulation in a forensic clinical medicine course. Two cohorts of undergraduate forensic science students from consecutive academic years underwent each teaching method. Post-course assessments included theoretical examinations and practical evaluations as quantitative measures of knowledge acquisition. Professional instructors graded students’ performance, while self-evaluation surveys captured learning experiences. Results Scenario-based simulation teaching yielded superior learning outcomes. The simulation group (2020 cohort) achieved higher scores than the traditional group (2019 cohort) in both theoretical ( *p  < 0.05) and practical assessments, with notably better knowledge retention (subjective questions: **p  < 0.01; objective questions: *p  < 0.05). The simulation group also demonstrated stronger theory-practice integration ( r  = 0.9622 vs. 0.9115). Instructor evaluations (n = 11) demonstrated that scenario-based simulation teaching improved students’ learning motivation (81.8%), theoretical application (72.7%), communication skills (81.8%), analytical abilities (63.6%), and teamwork competencies (54.5%). All instructors reported enhanced professional image, with 90.9% noting increased teaching motivation. Student self-assessments reinforced these results: over 80% of the simulation group reported gains in theoretical learning effectiveness, analytical/operational capabilities, and professional self-assurance, versus ≤31.9% in the traditional group. Classroom metrics favored the simulation group (self-study interest: 65% vs. 45.5%; engagement: 90% vs. 45.5%; collaboration: 80% vs. 36.4%), though 10% cited challenges with preparatory workload. Conclusion Scenario-based simulation teaching significantly enhances forensic clinical education by strengthening the connection between theory and practice while improving student competencies. Addressing teaching costs and adapting to student needs will further refine its effectiveness.

Abstract: Sports injuries represent a growing global health challenge, placing substantial demands on healthcare systems and requiring multidisciplinary management. As orthopaedic sports trauma becomes increasingly complex, high-quality education and standardised training are essential to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes. This narrative review aims to analyse current educational models and training pathways in orthopaedic sports injury management worldwide, evaluate the role of technological innovations, and highlight opportunities for international collaboration to enhance clinical practice and education. A wide spectrum of training methods is currently employed, ranging from traditional time-based models to modern competency-based curricula. Innovations such as virtual and augmented reality, simulation-based learning, and e-learning have demonstrated promising results in surgical skill acquisition and knowledge retention. International fellowships and consensus frameworks further contribute to the harmonisation of training standards. However, disparities persist in access to educational resources, healthcare infrastructure, and implementation of new technologies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. To meet the demands of contemporary orthopaedic sports medicine, educational strategies must evolve through global collaboration, integration of emerging technologies, and commitment to equity. Standardised, multidisciplinary, and evidence-informed training models are needed to ensure optimal patient care and professional competence across diverse healthcare environments.Sports injuries represent a growing global health challenge, placing substantial demands on healthcare systems and requiring multidisciplinary management.

Abstract: Background In the wake of social distancing, many institutions resorted to using varying levels of digital education modalities and virtual tours for education or recruitment. The virtual reality (VR) simulations use partial immersion through a digital learning environment to foster a perceived lived experience for an intended outcome. Integrating simulation and interactive media fits within gamification with has shown effectiveness to increase learner engagement and retention. Objective This study aimed to enhance medical education by integrating 360° VR tours into the clinical pathology curriculum and to evaluate the effectiveness of VR compared to traditional didactic methods, primarily in regards to interactivity and with a secondary outcome of retention. Methods Seven 360° VR tours were developed for pathology laboratories at a large academic medical center. Two (Microbiology and Transfusion Services) were selected for further enhancement and integration into the curriculum of remote learning courses. A controlled crossover study was conducted with 171 medical students (83% MS4) from April 2021 to April 2023. The students were randomly assigned to participate in either VR or PowerPoint (PP) presentations. Surveys on a 5-point Likert scale and learning assessments were used to measure understanding, interactivity, relevance, engagement, and knowledge retention. Results 15 course cohorts contained 171 enrolled students. Approximately 14% of students (n = 23) stated a primary career interest in pathology at the outset of the rotation, and 6 students (3.5%) later became residents in the institution’s pathology department. 16 students were unable to participate in the proctored activity due to scheduling conflicts. 155 students were randomized into the experimental comparison of the VR and PP tour formats. With a response rate exceeding 90%, VR participants rated interactivity significantly higher than PP participants (average 4.48 vs. 3.48, p < 0.001). VR participants also demonstrated higher engagement scores (average 4.21 vs. 3.92, p = 0.004), although average assessment scores were slightly lower for VR participants than for PP participants (6.2 vs. 6.5, p = 0.1). In-depth textual analysis highlighted themes of enhanced engagement and interactivity, although some students reported challenges with VR navigation. Conclusions The integration of 360° VR tours into the clinical pathology curriculum enhances interactivity and learner engagement, presenting a scalable solution for remote learning. This modality is especially suited for educational activities where the location and environment are critical experiential components. While VR tours did not substantially improve short-term knowledge retention compared to traditional methods, they significantly increased student engagement, an essential component for effective learning. Limitations such as navigation difficulties and technological barriers underscore the need for iterative improvements in VR experiences. These findings support the continued use of VR tours as a supplementary educational tool, complementing traditional curricula to provide a more immersive and interactive educational experience.

Abstract: This study used the gaze-cueing effect and split-attention principle to study the impact of gaze guidance and lecture recording format on attention, knowledge retention and instructor social presence. The authors analysed data from 250 participants in a mixed factorial experiment with eye-tracking, self-reported instructor social presence and a delayed knowledge measure as dependent variables. Results showed that when the instructor looked at the slide content, participants spent more time looking at it (η 2 p  = 0.044), but instructor social presence decreased (η 2 p  = .040). The strongest decrease occurred when the content and instructor’s image were separated in a picture-in-picture video (η 2 p  = .107). In contrast, there was better knowledge retention when they were seamlessly integrated in a composite video (η 2 p  = .017). The findings show that gaze cueing effects may depend on the video format, and instructors should use them strategically to balance attention and social presence.

Abstract: Continual learning empowers models to learn from a continuous stream of data while preserving previously acquired knowledge, effectively addressing the challenge of catastrophic forgetting and preserving original abilities. In this study, we propose a new approach that integrates adapters within the self-attention mechanisms of Vision Transformers to enhance knowledge retention when sequentially adding datasets from different domains. Unlike previous methods, which continue learning with only one dataset, our approach introduces domain-specific output heads and features gating, allowing the model to maintain high accuracy on previously learned tasks while seamlessly incorporating only the essential information of more than one domain. The proposed method is compared to the prominent parameter-efficient-fine-tuning methods in the current state-of-the-art. The result provide further evidence that our method can effectively alleviate the limitation of previous works. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis using three datasets: CIFAR-100, Flowers102, and DTD, each representing a distinct domain, to investigate the impact of task order on model performance. Our findings underscore the critical role of dataset sequencing in shaping learning outcomes, demonstrating that strategic ordering can significantly improve the model’s ability to adapt to evolving data distributions over time while preserving the integrity of previously learned knowledge.

Abstract: GPT is among the most powerful large language models (LLMs), known for its versatility and strong performance across a wide range of tasks. However, its substantial computational demands and limited cross-domain generalization present challenges, particularly in resource-sensitive applications like Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). Existing ABSA models are typically domain-specific and suffer from catastrophic forgetting—losing previously acquired knowledge when sequentially trained on new domains—resulting in poor scalability and knowledge retention. To address these issues, we proposed a novel framework that integrates GPT-2 with a replay-based lifelong learning mechanism to support incremental, multi-domain ABSA while mitigating forgetting. The model is sequentially fine-tuned using real-data replay across four diverse ABSA domains: Laptops, Restaurants, Tweets, and Finance. Experimental results show that proposed model achieves an average accuracy of 0.85 and a Backward Transfer (BWT) score of -0.09, significantly outperforming the baseline model without lifelong learning (accuracy of 0.70, BWT of -0.64). We further conducted a t-test to validate the statistical significance of the improvements. we design an ANFIS-based model trained on experimental results to predict the proper memory ratio for new datasets, enabling more effective and adaptive lifelong learning in GPT-based architectures. In addition, we applied a multi-level data augmentation pipeline, which significantly improved performance across domains ( p  = 0.0049), enhancing both retention and generalization under constrained memory. Additionally, we introduced a domain sequence permutation study to test robustness against task-order sensitivity, while another part evaluates generalization under a simulated fifth domain constructed from a mixture of all original domains. These components validate the model’s scalability and ability to generalize beyond trained distributions. An ablation study was conducted to isolate the contributions of each module, including replay, ANFIS prediction, and data augmentation. The results demonstrate that removing any single component leads to a measurable drop in performance, confirming that each part of the framework contributes meaningfully to overall effectiveness. A post-hoc comparison with a distillation-based lifelong learning baseline was conducted, showing improved performance of our replay + ANFIS approach. We acknowledge that additional comparisons with advanced baselines such as GEM or A-GEM are needed to further strengthen this claim, which we leave for future work. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining GPT-2 with replay-based lifelong learning and adaptive memory control, offering a scalable and robust solution for continuous, multi-domain sentiment analysis. Our proposed model provides a practical foundation for future research in dynamic, cross-domain ABSA systems.

Abstract: Serious games combine education and entertainment to create engaging and effective learning experiences, potentially contributing to science literacy and environmental awareness. This research aims to investigate the effectiveness of a particular serious game, H2OeduK, in educating children aged 10 to 11 years on the urban water cycle. Specifically, a study was conducted in four schools, where 140 students played the game and completed pre‐ and post‐game surveys to assess knowledge acquisition and the influence of specific socio‐demographic and gaming contextual factors. The relationship between the serious game evaluation and the knowledge acquisition scores was also explored. Results indicate that playing H2OeduK significantly enhanced children's understanding of the urban water cycle, establishing it as an effective tool for promoting water literacy and encouraging the protection of water resources. Neither gender nor play mode (individual or pair play) appeared to affect the game's effectiveness, while engaging in video gameplay positively impacted knowledge acquisition. Participants' evaluation of the game in terms of gamer experience (engagement, playfulness and self‐reported learning) did not seem to correlate with the level of learning achieved. Overall, this study underscores the potential of serious games like H2OeduK to effectively educate young learners on key sustainability challenges. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic - Educating children about the urban water cycle raises awareness and promotes responsible water usage. - Serious games provide interactive and engaging ways to teach children about the urban water cycle and other environmental issues. - Studies suggest that serious games can be effective in enhancing learning outcomes and promoting environmental education. What this paper adds - The study provides empirical evidence on the effectiveness of H2OeduK serious game in teaching children about environmental & management concepts related to the urban water cycle. - Gender does not significantly influence the acquisition of environmental knowledge through this serious game. - Individual gameplay with H2OeduK is as effective as collaborative gameplay for teaching children about the urban water cycle. Implications for practice and/or policy - Incorporating serious games into educational practices can be a valuable tool for teaching complex sustainability challenges to children, such as urban water cycle problems. - Objective measures, like knowledge acquisition surveys, are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of serious games in fostering learning outcomes. - Further research is needed to explore the long‐term impact of serious games on knowledge retention and behavioural change and to understand their effectiveness in promoting sustainable development.

Abstract: Promoting public health is challenging owing to its abstract nature, and individuals may be apprehensive about confronting it. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using the metaverse and gamification as novel educational techniques to improve learning experiences related to the immune system. Thus, we present MetaRoundWorm, an immersive virtual reality (VR) escape room game designed to enhance the understanding of parasitic infections and host immune responses through interactive, gamified learning. The application simulates the lifecycle of Ascaris lumbricoides and corresponding immunological mechanisms across anatomically accurate environments within the human body. Integrating serious game mechanics with embodied learning principles, MetaRoundWorm offers players a task-driven experience combining exploration, puzzle-solving, and immune system simulation. To evaluate the educational efficacy and user engagement, we conducted a controlled study comparing MetaRoundWorm against a traditional approach, i.e., interactive slides. Results indicate that MetaRoundWorm significantly improves immediate learning outcomes, cognitive engagement, and emotional experience, while maintaining knowledge retention over time. Our findings suggest that immersive VR gamification holds promise as an effective pedagogical tool for communicating complex biomedical concepts and advancing digital health education.Promoting public health is challenging owing to its abstract nature, and individuals may be apprehensive about confronting it.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool for science education, offering interactive environments to explore intangible concepts. Traditional teaching methods often struggle to convey abstract concepts in science, where many phenomena are not directly observable. VR can address this issue by modeling and visualizing complex and unobservable entities and processes, allowing learners to dynamically interact with what would otherwise not be directly perceptible. However, relatively few controlled studies have compared immersive VR learning with equivalent hands-on laboratory learning in physics education, particularly for more abstract topics. In this work, we designed a VR-based physics lab that is capable of visualizing electrons and electromagnetic fields to teach fundamental concepts of electronics and magnetism, closely replicating a traditional electronics learning kit used as a baseline for comparison. We evaluated the impact of the two conditions (VR versus traditional) on students' learning outcomes, motivation, engagement, and cognitive load. Our results show significantly higher knowledge retention in the VR group compared to the traditional group. Also, while there were no significant differences in immediate comprehension between the two groups, participants in the VR group spent substantially more time engaged with the learning content. These findings highlight the potential of visually enriched virtual environments to enhance the learning experience and improve knowledge retention of intangible scientific concepts.Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool for science education, offering interactive environments to explore intangible concepts.

Abstract: To investigate the effectiveness of Virtual Reality (VR) simulations in improving learning outcomes in dental radiology in panoramic radiography. Thirty-two volunteer dental students (first and second year of study) had the same theoretical lecture about panoramic imaging. For practical training, students were randomly divided into 2 groups: G1: traditional educational method and G2: VR (Qbion AB software). Panoramic images of 2 anthropomorphic phantoms using a VistaVoxS 3D device were acquired. The type and number of positioning errors and the need for a retake were evaluated by 1 Oral Radiology teacher and 1 senior radiographer in consensus. To test the retention of knowledge, students from both groups had to identify the absence or presence of positioning errors. Data obtained were evaluated by a descriptive analysis and it considered the frequency of the categorical variables. The positioning error rate was higher for G1 (62.50%). Type error 3 (Patient's chin raised too high) was the most prevalent (47.06%) among the groups. The retake rate among all students was similar (25%). G2 was more able to detect patient's positioning errors (68.8%) than G1. The semi-immersive VR software demonstrated potential benefits for dental students. VR tools could be integrated into Oral Radiology preclinical simulations as an additional educational tool to help reduce patient positioning errors in panoramic radiography. This study highlights the effectiveness of semi-immersive VR in improving dental students' ability to detect and prevent positioning errors in panoramic radiography. VR training enhances knowledge retention and supports its integration into preclinical education as an additional educational tool to optimize radiographic training.To investigate the effectiveness of Virtual Reality (VR) simulations in improving learning outcomes in dental radiology in panoramic radiography.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant risks to software systems, leading to security breaches, data loss, operational disruptions, and substantial financial damage. Therefore, accurately detecting these vulnerabilities is of paramount importance. In recent years, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in code representation and understanding, emerging as a promising method for vulnerability detection. However, integrating code structure knowledge while fine-tuning PLMs remains a significant challenge. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel vulnerability detection approach called SIFT. SIFT extracts the code property graph (CPG) to serve as the source of graph structural information. It constructs a code structure matrix from this information and measures the difference between the code structure matrix and the attention matrix using Sinkhorn Divergence to obtain the structural knowledge loss. This structural knowledge loss is then used alongside the cross-entropy loss for vulnerability detection in a multi-task learning framework to enhance overall detection performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of SIFT, we conducted experiments on three vulnerability detection datasets: FFmpeg+Qemu, Chrome+Debian, and Big-Vul. The results demonstrate that SIFT outperforms nine state-of-the-art vulnerability detection baselines, achieving performance improvements of 1.74%, 10.19%, and 2.87% in terms of F1 score, respectively. Our study shows the effectiveness of incorporating structural knowledge and multi-task learning in enhancing the performance of PLMs for vulnerability detection.

Abstract: This study evaluates an AI-guided atomization sensing system designed to integrate adaptive health education into vocational physical education. A quasi-experimental design was conducted with 356 participants allocated to either an intervention group (n = 178) or a control group (n = 178). The system used wearable atomization sensors (monitoring respiratory patterns, ambient temperature, and motion) connected to an AI engine that applied rule-based and machine-learning logic to adjust instructional content in real time-for example, reducing complexity or switching to audiovisual demonstrations when signs of fatigue were detected. Sessions were delivered in classroom settings twice per week for six weeks, with surveys administered immediately before and after the intervention. Five outcomes were assessed using validated instruments: knowledge retention, engagement, behavioral intention, self-efficacy, and technology acceptance. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, paired-sample t-tests, Pearson correlations, and χ 2  tests, with results reported as F(df1, df2), p, η 2 , and 95% confidence intervals where applicable. The intervention group achieved significantly greater improvements than the control group in knowledge retention (Δ = +21.7 vs. +10.6; F(1, 354) = 46.21, p < 0.001, η 2  = 0.21), engagement (F(1, 354) = 39.87, p < 0.001, η 2  = 0.18), behavioral intention (F(1, 354) = 42.55, p < 0.001, η 2  = 0.19), self-efficacy (F(1, 354) = 27.63, p < 0.001, η 2  = 0.13), and technology acceptance (F(1, 354) = 35.12, p < 0.001, η 2  = 0.17). These findings demonstrate that combining real-time sensing with AI-guided decision support provides a reproducible, adaptive framework for enhancing health education outcomes in vocational PE settings.This study evaluates an AI-guided atomization sensing system designed to integrate adaptive health education into vocational physical education.

Indonesia, located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, faces frequent seismic events, highlighting the need for effective disaster preparedness. Traditional training methods often fall short in practical application, prompting the exploration of innovative tools like virtual reality (VR) simulations. VR offers immersive, scenario-based training, improving knowledge retention and response skills. Background Natural disasters, including earthquakes, threaten global sustainable development, causing significant loss of life, displacement, and economic damage. Indonesia, located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, faces frequent seismic events, highlighting the need for effective disaster preparedness. Traditional training methods often fall short in practical application, prompting the exploration of innovative tools like virtual reality (VR) simulations. VR offers immersive, scenario-based training, improving knowledge retention and response skills.This study evaluated the effectiveness of VR simulation training in improving earthquake preparedness knowledge and practical response skills among rural volunteers in Indonesia. Objective This study evaluated the effectiveness of VR simulation training in improving earthquake preparedness knowledge and practical response skills among rural volunteers in Indonesia.This quasi-experimental research involved 400 rural volunteers who were evenly divided into 2 groups: an intervention group (n=200) trained using VR simulations and a control group (n=200) that received standard training. The VR training modules covered earthquake awareness, search and rescue operations, first aid procedures, and evacuation practices. Participants' knowledge and practical skills were evaluated using the Earthquake Preparedness Knowledge Questionnaire and Earthquake Response Practical Skills Assessment at baseline, immediately after training, and at a 3-month follow-up. Data analysis used repeated-measures ANOVA and multiple regression.

Participants' knowledge and practical skills were evaluated using the Earthquake Preparedness Knowledge Questionnaire and Earthquake Response Practical Skills Assessment at baseline, immediately after training, and at a 3-month follow-up. Data analysis used repeated-measures ANOVA and multiple regression.Volunteers trained with VR demonstrated substantial improvements in both knowledge (F2396=45.32; P<.001) and practical skills (F2396=38.76; P<.001) compared with the conventional training group. Post hoc tests confirmed that these improvements remained consistent even after 3 months. Regression analysis indicated education level (β=0.32; P<.001) and age (β=-0.18; P=.02) significantly influenced VR training outcomes. After controlling for demographic factors, the VR intervention still significantly enhanced earthquake preparedness knowledge (β=6.23; P<.001) and practical response abilities (β=5.45; P<.001). Results Volunteers trained with VR demonstrated substantial improvements in both knowledge (F2396=45.32; P<.001) and practical skills (F2396=38.76; P<.001) compared with the conventional training group.

Abstract: To explore the experiences and perceptions of children who underwent minimally invasive dentistry interventions and invasive dental interventions for caries prevention and management. PURPOSE To explore the experiences and perceptions of children who underwent minimally invasive dentistry interventions and invasive dental interventions for caries prevention and management.Electronic searches were conducted to identify studies that used qualitative data to assess the phenomenon of interest up to October 2024. Two reviewers conducted the selection of studies independently and in duplicate. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated, and the final synthesised findings were graded. Data were analysed using a meta-aggregative approach. METHODS Electronic searches were conducted to identify studies that used qualitative data to assess the phenomenon of interest up to October 2024. Two reviewers conducted the selection of studies independently and in duplicate. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated, and the final synthesised findings were graded. Data were analysed using a meta-aggregative approach.The search strategy identified 2503 studies, of which eight were included. The methodological quality of the included studies was rated as good. Five categories were developed, leading to two synthesised key findings: dental fear and anxiety in children, and impressions of the guidance provided. Confidence in the synthesised findings was rated as high. RESULTS The search strategy identified 2503 studies, of which eight were included. The methodological quality of the included studies was rated as good. Five categories were developed, leading to two synthesised key findings: dental fear and anxiety in children, and impressions of the guidance provided. Confidence in the synthesised findings was rated as high.Children's views, as the end users of interventions, reveal factors that influence their acceptance, knowledge retention, coping strategies, and behavioural responses to dental interventions, regardless of the intervention's level of invasiveness. Findings assist paediatric dentists in tailoring communication and care, considering children's emotional self-regulation. Dentists and parents are crucial in fostering positive experiences. Interactive and repetitive methods improve oral health knowledge retention and promote lasting behavioural changes.

Abstract: Effective preoperative digital health education (DHE) is critical for patients undergoing knee arthroplasty (KA), particularly older adults who face age-related cognitive vulnerabilities. Cognitive Load Theory suggests that presentation modality and learning motivation strongly influence cognitive processing, yet their combined effects in clinical education remain underexplored. Background Effective preoperative digital health education (DHE) is critical for patients undergoing knee arthroplasty (KA), particularly older adults who face age-related cognitive vulnerabilities. Cognitive Load Theory suggests that presentation modality and learning motivation strongly influence cognitive processing, yet their combined effects in clinical education remain underexplored.This study investigated how learning motivation and presentation modality (text-only, text-graphic composite, and video-based) affect cognitive load and learning performance in older adult patients preparing for KA. Objective This study investigated how learning motivation and presentation modality (text-only, text-graphic composite, and video-based) affect cognitive load and learning performance in older adult patients preparing for KA.A 2×3 factorial psychobehavioral experiment was conducted with 62 patients (≥60 y) stratified by learning motivation (high vs low). Each participant completed 6 DHE modules delivered across the 3 modalities. Cognitive load was measured using subjective ratings (Chinese National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index) and objective eye-tracking indicators (average fixation duration, number of fixations, and time to first fixation). Learning performance was assessed through knowledge retention and transfer tests (30 items). Data were analyzed using general linear models, analysis of covariance, and correlation analyses, with covariates including knee function, prior knowledge, eHealth literacy, and psychological distress. Methods A 2×3 factorial psychobehavioral experiment was conducted with 62 patients (≥60 y) stratified by learning motivation (high vs low). Each participant completed 6 DHE modules delivered across the 3 modalities. Cognitive load was measured using subjective ratings (Chinese National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index) and objective eye-tracking indicators (average fixation duration, number of fixations, and time to first fixation). Learning performance was assessed through knowledge retention and transfer tests (30 items). Data were analyzed using general linear models, analysis of covariance, and correlation analyses, with covariates including knee function, prior knowledge, eHealth literacy, and psychological distress.High-motivation learners demonstrated significantly lower cognitive load (National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index; large effect size) and superior learning performance (medium effect size) compared to low-motivation learners. Video-based materials consistently yielded the lowest extraneous load and supported efficient knowledge acquisition (medium effect size). Text-graphic composites elicited higher cognitive load but facilitated deeper processing and schema construction, particularly for highly motivated learners (medium-to-large effect sizes). Eye tracking confirmed these dynamics: high-motivation participants showed shorter fixation durations and more efficient allocation of attention across modalities, whereas low-motivation learners displayed scattered fixation patterns, especially in text-graphic conditions. Across the sample, cognitive load was negatively correlated with learning performance (large effect size), reinforcing its role as a key mediator of digital learning outcomes. Results High-motivation learners demonstrated significantly lower cognitive load (National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index; large effect size) and superior learning performance (medium effect size) compared to low-motivation learners.

Video-based content enhances cognitive efficiency, while text-graphic formats may promote germane load among motivated learners. These findings highlight the importance of motivational scaffolding, adaptive modality selection, and the integration of real-time cognitive monitoring in DHE design. Beyond informing digital education for KA, the study demonstrates the feasibility of applying psychobehavioral experimental methods with older surgical patients, offering a framework for optimizing cognitive alignment in clinical education.

Abstract: Medical virology requires students to master complex concepts in a limited timeframe, yet traditional lectures often struggle to sustain engagement and ensure long-term retention. Serious games have emerged as promising tools to promote active learning. Building on the success of BacteriaGame, ViroGame was developed to reinforce virology knowledge through gamification. This study evaluated its effectiveness in enhancing student engagement, knowledge mobilization, and supervisor-perceived feasibility for curricular integration. INTRODUCTION Medical virology requires students to master complex concepts in a limited timeframe, yet traditional lectures often struggle to sustain engagement and ensure long-term retention. Serious games have emerged as promising tools to promote active learning. Building on the success of BacteriaGame, ViroGame was developed to reinforce virology knowledge through gamification. This study evaluated its effectiveness in enhancing student engagement, knowledge mobilization, and supervisor-perceived feasibility for curricular integration.A total of 318 learners participated in ViroGame sessions during the 2023-2024 academic year. Of these, 266 students/residents completed a structured questionnaire assessing with likert scale [1-5] gameplay fluidity, knowledge consolidation, perceived difficulty and potential integration with BacteriaGame. Nine supervisors also provided evaluations on rule clarity, session management and educational value. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests, with qualitative feedback examined thematically. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 318 learners participated in ViroGame sessions during the 2023-2024 academic year. Of these, 266 students/residents completed a structured questionnaire assessing with likert scale [1-5] gameplay fluidity, knowledge consolidation, perceived difficulty and potential integration with BacteriaGame. Nine supervisors also provided evaluations on rule clarity, session management and educational value. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests, with qualitative feedback examined thematically.Residents rated gameplay fluidity significantly higher than students (4.4/5 vs. 4.1/5; p = 0.039). Both groups reported high knowledge mobilization scores (students 4.5/5; residents 4.3/5; p = 0.378). Nearly half perceived some content as exceeding expected knowledge, despite alignment with national standards (47.4% vs. 41.8%; p = 0.482). A greater proportion of students than residents reported difficulties with virological concepts (78.9% vs. 60.3%; p = 0.021), particularly regarding diagnostic methods and viral structures. Supervisors rated the game positively, endorsing its use primarily as a revision tool. RESULTS Residents rated gameplay fluidity significantly higher than students (4.4/5 vs. 4.1/5; p = 0.039). Both groups reported high knowledge mobilization scores (students 4.5/5; residents 4.3/5; p = 0.378).

It promotes active learning, collaboration and knowledge retention while addressing the inherent complexity of virology. Further controlled studies are planned to evaluate its long-term impact on learning outcomes and exam performance.

Abstract: To evaluate the impact of different teaching interventions on musculoskeletal (MSK) anatomy knowledge among first-year medical students. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of different teaching interventions on musculoskeletal (MSK) anatomy knowledge among first-year medical students.Three sequential cohorts of first-year medical students received different MSK anatomy teaching interventions: a pre-examination review session by the anatomy department (Cohort A), a clinical skills session taught by a physiatrist (Cohort B), or both (Cohort C). Outcome measures included (1) scores from a 30-question multiple-choice anatomy final examination, and (2) scores from 10 of the 30 questions relevant to the anatomy concepts covered in the clinical teaching session. DESIGN Three sequential cohorts of first-year medical students received different MSK anatomy teaching interventions: a pre-examination review session by the anatomy department (Cohort A), a clinical skills session taught by a physiatrist (Cohort B), or both (Cohort C). Outcome measures included (1) scores from a 30-question multiple-choice anatomy final examination, and (2) scores from 10 of the 30 questions relevant to the anatomy concepts covered in the clinical teaching session.Data were collected from all students in each cohort (n = 231); outliers were removed using the 1.5× IQR method prior to all analyses. Cohort C scored significantly higher than Cohort B on the full examination (p < 0.05). On the 10-question subset, Cohort C outperformed both Cohorts A and B (p < 0.05). No other comparisons reached statistical significance. RESULTS Data were collected from all students in each cohort (n = 231); outliers were removed using the 1.5× IQR method prior to all analyses. Cohort C scored significantly higher than Cohort B on the full examination (p < 0.05). On the 10-question subset, Cohort C outperformed both Cohorts A and B (p < 0.05). No other comparisons reached statistical significance.A combined approach using both pre-examination review by the anatomy department and clinical teaching led by a physiatrist (Intervention C) significantly improved MSK anatomy examination performance. These findings support synchronized, multimodal teaching to enhance anatomy knowledge. Future studies should assess long-term effects on clinical skills and knowledge retention. CONCLUSION A combined approach using both pre-examination review by the anatomy department and clinical teaching led by a physiatrist (Intervention C) significantly improved MSK anatomy examination performance. These findings support synchronized, multimodal teaching to enhance anatomy knowledge. Future studies should assess long-term effects on clinical skills and knowledge retention.

Abstract: The use of electronic or digital resources has been shown to be effective in improving knowledge retention and skills development through many fields of medical education. Few systematic reviews have studied the effects of electronic learning ('e-learning') compared to traditional learning methods in anaesthesia education. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies assessing learning outcomes from e-learning modalities compared to 'traditional', face-to-face or didactic teaching methods. BACKGROUND The use of electronic or digital resources has been shown to be effective in improving knowledge retention and skills development through many fields of medical education. Few systematic reviews have studied the effects of electronic learning ('e-learning') compared to traditional learning methods in anaesthesia education. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies assessing learning outcomes from e-learning modalities compared to 'traditional', face-to-face or didactic teaching methods.Medical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC, Scopus, CENTRAL, Google Scholar) were searched for applicable studies from January 2002 to January 2023 on the 12th of February 2023. Studies comparing an 'e-learning arm' against a 'traditional learning' arm including anaesthetic doctors of any level within the study population were considered and assessed for inclusion. The systematic review tool Covidence™ was utilised to track studies for inclusion, results were synthesised be each reviewer prior to independent assessment for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool 'RoB-2'. METHODS Medical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC, Scopus, CENTRAL, Google Scholar) were searched for applicable studies from January 2002 to January 2023 on the 12th of February 2023. Studies comparing an 'e-learning arm' against a 'traditional learning' arm including anaesthetic doctors of any level within the study population were considered and assessed for inclusion. The systematic review tool Covidence™ was utilised to track studies for inclusion, results were synthesised be each reviewer prior to independent assessment for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool 'RoB-2'.Our search strategy identified 1681 papers for review. Thirteen studies were deemed eligible for inclusion, assessing 572 health practitioners at varying stages of their clinical careers. Four eligible studies showed a statistically significant difference in their primary outcomes favouring e-learning, while one study found e-learning non-inferior to traditional learning. Three studies found a statistically significant change in favour of traditional learning and the remaining five studies did not find a significant difference when comparing e-learning and traditional learning. Qualitative analysis of various secondary outcomes (where applicable) found considerable variation regarding participant preference in favour of both traditional and e-learning models.

However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the research and shows no consistent benefit to either e-learning or traditional learning. Further research is required to explore the most effective teaching contexts and the efficient implementation of different e-learning modalities in anaesthesia.

Abstract: Objective: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA), a key technology that integrates computer vision and natural language processing to assist in clinical diagnosis, possesses significant potential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. However, its development is constrained by two major bottlenecks: weak few-shot generalization capability stemming from the scarcity of high-quality annotated data and the problem of catastrophic forgetting when continually learning new knowledge. Existing research has largely addressed these two challenges in isolation, lacking a unified framework. Methods: To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel Evolvable Clinical-Semantic Alignment (ECSA) framework, designed to synergistically solve these two challenges within a single architecture. ECSA is built upon powerful pre-trained vision (BiomedCLIP) and language (Flan-T5) models, with two innovative modules at its core. First, we design a Clinical-Semantic Disambiguation Module (CSDM), which employs a novel debiased hard negative mining strategy for contrastive learning. This enables the precise discrimination of "hard negatives" that are visually similar but clinically distinct, thereby significantly enhancing the model's representation ability in few-shot and long-tail scenarios. Second, we introduce a Prompt-based Knowledge Consolidation Module (PKC), which acts as a rehearsal-free non-parametric knowledge store. It consolidates historical knowledge by dynamically accumulating and retrieving task-specific "soft prompts," thus effectively circumventing catastrophic forgetting without relying on past data. Results: Extensive experimental results on four public benchmark datasets, VQA-RAD, SLAKE, PathVQA, and VQA-Med-2019, demonstrate ECSA's state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance. Specifically, ECSA achieves excellent overall accuracies of 80.15% on VQA-RAD and 85.10% on SLAKE, while also showing strong generalization with 64.57% on PathVQA and 82.23% on VQA-Med-2019. More critically, in continual learning scenarios, the framework achieves a low forgetting rate of just 13.50%, showcasing its significant advantages in knowledge retention. Conclusions: These findings validate the framework's substantial potential for building robust and evolvable clinical decision support systems.Objective: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA), a key technology that integrates computer vision and natural language processing to assist in clinical diagnosis, possesses significant potential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Over the past decade, the CAIRO Journal Club (CJC) has evolved into a cornerstone of oncology education and multidisciplinary collaboration across Egypt and the broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. This narrative review charts CJC's formative journey, analyzes its educational impact, and outlines forward-looking strategies to further democratize high-quality cancer care. Since 2013, CJC has convened more than 120 interactive events under the Egyptian Foundation of Medical Sciences (EFMS) umbrella, supplemented by masterclasses, simulation-based forums, and hands-on workshops that prioritize breast, thoracic, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary malignancies. A deliberate emphasis on evidence-based, resource-adapted protocols underpins these activities, fostering context-appropriate decision-making through case-linked learning and live audience polling. Independent assessments and post-event surveys demonstrate significant gains in participants' knowledge retention, clinical confidence, and treatment-planning skills, particularly among practitioners in peripheral or resource-constrained settings. Moreover, CJC's digital extensions (including livestreamed symposia and moderated social-media discussion boards) have expanded its national footprint, yielding > 30,000 cumulative virtual attendances (unique live logins and on-demand viewers from 2019-2024) and markedly lowering geographic access barriers. Building on this momentum, CJC will launch international virtual tumor boards with partners in Egypt, North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, and globally; establish structured mentoring for early-career oncologists and allied professionals across the region; introduce AI-enabled adaptive learning modules; and develop accredited postgraduate certificate programs aligned with WHO competency frameworks. Future evaluation will also examine educational and practice impact, with a focus on expanding training, mentoring, and scholarly outputs. CJC's experience illustrates how a regional, volunteer-driven initiative can bridge oncology-education disparities through blended, scalable learning models. Its planned innovations offer a replicable blueprint for other LMIC contexts seeking to strengthen cancer-care capacity through sustained professional development and digital inclusion.Over the past decade, the CAIRO Journal Club (CJC) has evolved into a cornerstone of oncology education and multidisciplinary collaboration across Egypt and the broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as chatbots for patient education, including applications in urooncology. Since only 12% of adults have proficient health literacy and most patient information materials exceed recommended reading levels, improving readability is crucial. Although LLMs could potentially increase the readability of medical information, evidence is mixed, underscoring the need to assess chatbot outputs in clinical settings. Therefore, this study evaluates the measured and perceived readability of chatbot responses in speech-based interactions with urological patients. Urological patients engaged in unscripted conversations with a GPT-4-based chatbot. Transcripts were analyzed using three readability indices: Flesch-Reading-Ease (FRE), Lesbarkeitsindex (LIX) and Wiener-Sachtextformel (WSF). Perceived readability was assessed using a survey covering technical language, clarity and explainability. Associations between measured and perceived readability were analyzed. Knowledge retention was not assessed in this study. A total of 231 conversations were evaluated. The most frequently addressed topics were prostate cancer (22.5%), robotic-assisted prostatectomy (19.9%) and follow-up (18.6%). Objectively, responses were classified as difficult to read (FRE 43.1 ± 9.1; LIX 52.8 ± 6.2; WSF 11.2 ± 1.6). In contrast, perceived readability was rated highly for technical language, clarity and explainability (83-90%). Correlation analyses revealed no association between objective and perceived readability. Chatbot responses were objectively written at a difficult reading level, exceeding recommendations for optimized health literacy. Nevertheless, most patients perceived the information as clear and understandable. This discrepancy suggests that perceived comprehensibility is influenced by factors beyond measurable linguistic complexity.Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as chatbots for patient education, including applications in urooncology.

Abstract: Children with Down syndrome (DS) often experience cognitive and adaptive challenges that affect their ability to acquire and retain critical life skills, including those needed for effective response during emergencies. Traditional training methods used to prepare children for crises are frequently static, noninteractive, and insufficiently tailored to the unique learning profiles of children with DS. These limitations contribute to reduced engagement, poor knowledge retention, and inadequate real-world preparedness. Recent advancements in game-based learning, particularly serious games, have demonstrated potential for enhancing education and skill development among individuals with cognitive impairments. BACKGROUND Children with Down syndrome (DS) often experience cognitive and adaptive challenges that affect their ability to acquire and retain critical life skills, including those needed for effective response during emergencies. Traditional training methods used to prepare children for crises are frequently static, noninteractive, and insufficiently tailored to the unique learning profiles of children with DS. These limitations contribute to reduced engagement, poor knowledge retention, and inadequate real-world preparedness. Recent advancements in game-based learning, particularly serious games, have demonstrated potential for enhancing education and skill development among individuals with cognitive impairments.This study aimed to design, implement, and evaluate Risk Resist, an adaptive serious game developed to improve emergency preparedness in children with DS. The game incorporates a dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm that personalizes the learning experience by dynamically modifying game difficulty based on real-time behavioral performance metrics. The study also assessed whether this adaptive game-based learning approach leads to superior learning gains and engagement compared to conventional teacher-led training. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to design, implement, and evaluate Risk Resist, an adaptive serious game developed to improve emergency preparedness in children with DS. The game incorporates a dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm that personalizes the learning experience by dynamically modifying game difficulty based on real-time behavioral performance metrics. The study also assessed whether this adaptive game-based learning approach leads to superior learning gains and engagement compared to conventional teacher-led training.A quasi-experimental, between-group design was used with 18 children diagnosed with DS, aged 8 to 12 years. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n=9), which played Risk Resist, or a control group (n=9), which received traditional instruction on emergency scenarios. Learning outcomes were assessed using pre- and postintervention knowledge tests composed of 5 emergency-related questions. Engagement levels were measured through a structured 5-point Likert scale questionnaire completed by observing teachers. The game used a machine learning-driven dynamic difficulty adjustment model, specifically a Random Forest Regressor, which adjusted difficulty in response to individual performance indicators such as success rate, response time, and behavioral patterns during gameplay. METHODS A quasi-experimental, between-group design was used with 18 children diagnosed with DS, aged 8 to 12 years. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n=9), which played Risk Resist, or a control group (n=9), which received traditional instruction on emergency scenarios.

The game used a machine learning-driven dynamic difficulty adjustment model, specifically a Random Forest Regressor, which adjusted difficulty in response to individual performance indicators such as success rate, response time, and behavioral patterns during gameplay.The experimental group achieved significantly higher learning gains (mean 3.6, SD 0.5) than the control group (mean 2.0, SD 0.5; P<.001). Engagement levels were also significantly greater in the game-based group (mean 4.54, SD 0.4) compared to the control group (mean 4.01, SD 0.32; P=.002). A strong positive correlation was identified between engagement and learning gain (r=0.85; P<.001), indicating that higher engagement contributed directly to improved knowledge acquisition. RESULTS The experimental group achieved significantly higher learning gains (mean 3.6, SD 0.5) than the control group (mean 2.0, SD 0.5; P<.001). Engagement levels were also significantly greater in the game-based group (mean 4.54, SD 0.4) compared to the control group (mean 4.01, SD 0.32; P=.002). A strong positive correlation was identified between engagement and learning gain (r=0.85; P<.001), indicating that higher engagement contributed directly to improved knowledge acquisition.The results support the effectiveness of Risk Resist in enhancing both engagement and learning outcomes for children with DS. The integration of adaptive difficulty algorithms provides a personalized, responsive learning experience, positioning serious games as a viable and impactful tool for emergency preparedness training in special education settings. CONCLUSIONS The results support the effectiveness of Risk Resist in enhancing both engagement and learning outcomes for children with DS.

Abstract: This study delves into the transformative potential of Augmented Reality (AR) in elevating the teaching and learning experiences of history subjects in secondary schools. Specifically, it aims to assess how AR, as an instructional material (Alat Bantu Mengajar, ABM), can enhance the engagement and knowledge retention of Form 2 students regarding the historical relationship between the Malacca Malay Sultanate and the China Government. The research draws on existing literature on AR’s educational potential, highlighting the need for focused exploration of specific historical themes within Malaysia’s secondary education landscape. Using a design and developmental research approach, this study employed two types of testing, alpha and beta, to refine the AR application’s usability and effectiveness. Additionally, a post-test was conducted with a sample population to gauge students’ historical knowledge and interest in using AR as a learning tool. Form 2 students were selected and organized into small groups, guided by a facilitator to navigate the SejarahAR. This application, aligned with the Form 2 history syllabus, integrates 2D models, simulations, and interactive maps to visually represent the Malacca-China relationship, enhancing students’ understanding and engagement. Data collection included a comprehensive survey to assess students’ knowledge retention and interest following their interaction with the SejarahAR. The research aims to contribute significantly to the AR landscape in history education by providing detailed insights into its efficacy in teaching historical relationships within a specific educational context. The findings from this study can inform the development of future AR-based ABMs and guide further research on AR’s impact on targeted learning outcomes and enriching the educational experience for students and educators alike.

Abstract: Educational virtual environments (EVEs), constructed through virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), serve as digital learning spaces that provide crucial support for applying human-machine collaborative learning in science education. In science education, knowledge retention is the foundation for students to understand complex scientific concepts and to conduct further inquiry-based practices, directly influencing the long-term development of scientific literacy. However, there remains academic debate regarding whether EVE-based human-machine collaborative learning can effectively enhance knowledge retention, and its core mechanisms have yet to be systematically clarified. This study employs a meta-analysis approach to synthesize 80 experimental and quasi-experimental studies (including 88 effect sizes) conducted between 2014 and 2024, examining the impact of EVEs-based human-machine collaborative learning on science learners' knowledge retention. The results indicate that compared with traditional learning methods, EVEs-based human-machine collaborative learning has significant potential to improve knowledge retention. Although no statistically significant differences were found across moderating variables such as educational level and technology type, environments built with VR technology, high school contexts, operational learning, and presentation-based instructional approaches demonstrated more pronounced effects on knowledge retention. Subgroup analysis of instructional methods further revealed that their effectiveness is moderated by factors such as testing formats and educational levels. Accordingly, researchers and educational practitioners are encouraged to adopt systematic thinking in designing instructional practices, explore effective teaching methods, and apply diversified assessments to continuously monitor long-term impacts. This study aims to provide both theoretical insights and practical guidance for science educators to optimize EVEs-based instructional strategies and enhance knowledge retention.

Abstract: Purpose This study examined the role of a learning culture in sustaining library operations and enhancing knowledge retention. Design/methodology/approach The study employed an exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach, beginning with qualitative interviews of three university librarians to inform a questionnaire for quantitative data collection from 62 professional librarians. Data were meticulously analyzed using ATLAS.ti 24 for qualitative insights and SPSS for quantitative statistics, ensuring rigorous examination and coding of responses to facilitate effective analysis. Findings The results showed that learning culture strategies like job shadowing, job rotation, communities of practice, mentoring and storytelling are crucial for encouraging skill development, collaboration, creativity and knowledge retention. Despite their advantages, implementation issues persist because of insufficient institutional support and policy frameworks. The study stresses the significance of encouraging professional growth and establishing an environment at work that values ongoing learning, collaboration and flexibility. It is suggested to formalize workplace learning opportunities, offer financial and non-financial incentives and bolster policy support in order to preserve library services and stop knowledge loss. Practical implications This study contributes to the research on knowledge retention by providing empirical support for the establishment of a strong learning culture as a strategic approach to sustaining public university libraries amid rapid social and technological change. Originality/value The study represents a substantial advancement in efficient knowledge management within library practices by creatively examining the integration of learning strategies into library operations with the goal of improving knowledge retention and library sustainability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into health professions education, but evidence regarding their application in physiotherapy remains limited. This study aims to investigate the impact of AI-assisted problem-based learning (AI-PBL) on theoretical knowledge, clinical competence, AI self-efficacy, internet addiction, and reading motivation compared with traditional PBL. BACKGROUND Artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into health professions education, but evidence regarding their application in physiotherapy remains limited. This study aims to investigate the impact of AI-assisted problem-based learning (AI-PBL) on theoretical knowledge, clinical competence, AI self-efficacy, internet addiction, and reading motivation compared with traditional PBL.A randomized controlled trial was conducted with undergraduate physiotherapy students assigned to AI-PBL or PBL groups. Participants completed assessments before, immediately after, and two weeks after the group intervention. Outcome measures included a theoretical knowledge test, the Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise (Mini-CEX), the AI ​​Self-Efficacy Scale (AI-SES), the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), and the Adult Reading Motivation Scale (ARMS). METHODS A randomized controlled trial was conducted with undergraduate physiotherapy students assigned to AI-PBL or PBL groups. Participants completed assessments before, immediately after, and two weeks after the group intervention. Outcome measures included a theoretical knowledge test, the Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise (Mini-CEX), the AI ​​Self-Efficacy Scale (AI-SES), the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), and the Adult Reading Motivation Scale (ARMS).Forty students were randomized equally into two groups: AI-PBL (n = 20) and traditional PBL (n = 20). Both groups showed significant improvements in knowledge and reading motivation. The AI-PBL group showed significantly greater improvement in knowledge retention at 2 weeks (Cohen's d = 3.14) and greater gains in AI self-efficacy. Although Mini-CEX scores were higher in the AI-PBL group, the differences between groups were not statistically significant. No significant increase in internet addiction was observed in the AI-PBL group. RESULTS Forty students were randomized equally into two groups: AI-PBL (n = 20) and traditional PBL (n = 20). Both groups showed significant improvements in knowledge and reading motivation. The AI-PBL group showed significantly greater improvement in knowledge retention at 2 weeks (Cohen's d = 3.14) and greater gains in AI self-efficacy. Although Mini-CEX scores were higher in the AI-PBL group, the differences between groups were not statistically significant. No significant increase in internet addiction was observed in the AI-PBL group.These findings emphasize that supervised, structured use of generative AI in education can enhance sustained learning and digital self-efficacy without posing behavioral risks. The AI-PBL approach appears to foster active reflection, self-directed learning, and deeper academic engagement offering a promising direction for digital innovation in physiotherapy education. Future studies should explore long-term outcomes, track behavioral engagement, and further validate the benefits of AI-enhanced instructional strategies.

Abstract: In Oral Pathology, traditional slide-based teaching methods often focus on passive observation which may not completely ignite the pathology resident's critical thinking and diagnostic capabilities. Hence we designed and evaluated a modified teaching method which was integrating Problem-Based Learning (PBL) with Six Thinking Hats (STH) methodology in enhancing diagnostic skills in the assessment of diagnostically challenging cases. BACKGROUND In Oral Pathology, traditional slide-based teaching methods often focus on passive observation which may not completely ignite the pathology resident's critical thinking and diagnostic capabilities. Hence we designed and evaluated a modified teaching method which was integrating Problem-Based Learning (PBL) with Six Thinking Hats (STH) methodology in enhancing diagnostic skills in the assessment of diagnostically challenging cases.A cohort of n = 15 Oral Pathology residents were included for the study. Their diagnostic accuracy, critical thinking, and knowledge retention were assessed through traditional slide-based teaching and a PBL integrated with STH approach. The PBL-STH framework engaged residents in a multi-perspective analysis of clinical data, histopathological features, and immunohistochemical markers (e.g., CD20, CD138), using structured group discussions based on the six thinking hats to foster collaborative decision-making. METHODS A cohort of n = 15 Oral Pathology residents were included for the study. Their diagnostic accuracy, critical thinking, and knowledge retention were assessed through traditional slide-based teaching and a PBL integrated with STH approach. The PBL-STH framework engaged residents in a multi-perspective analysis of clinical data, histopathological features, and immunohistochemical markers (e.g., CD20, CD138), using structured group discussions based on the six thinking hats to foster collaborative decision-making.Diagnostic accuracy significantly improved with the PBL-STH method, with 86.6% of residents accurately diagnosing DLBCL compared to 40% in traditional teaching. Critical thinking and risk analysis were markedly higher with PBL-STH (93.3% vs. 30%), and peer collaboration was observed in all PBL-STH sessions. Additionally, knowledge retention after two weeks was better among residents trained with the PBL-STH approach (90% vs. 55%), and overall satisfaction was significantly higher (93% vs. 50%). RESULTS Diagnostic accuracy significantly improved with the PBL-STH method, with 86.6% of residents accurately diagnosing DLBCL compared to 40% in traditional teaching. Critical thinking and risk analysis were markedly higher with PBL-STH (93.3% vs. 30%), and peer collaboration was observed in all PBL-STH sessions. Additionally, knowledge retention after two weeks was better among residents trained with the PBL-STH approach (90% vs. 55%), and overall satisfaction was significantly higher (93% vs. 50%).The PBL integrated with STH approach offers substantial benefits over traditional teaching methods, improving diagnostic accuracy, critical thinking, engagement, and knowledge retention in Oral Pathology. This innovative methodology encourages deeper analysis and collaboration, proving to be a highly effective educational tool for complex diagnostic cases especially in oral pathology which is the backbone for treatment, follow up, prognosis and quality of life of patients Also, implementation of PBL-STH in medical and dental curricula could enhance clinical reasoning and diagnostic skills across specialties.

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for transferring expert tacit knowledge to construction students through a cross-modal deep learning supported mixed reality training system. Traditional construction training faces challenges in effectively capturing and transmitting the implicit expertise of experienced practitioners. We developed a framework that integrates multimodal data collection from construction experts with cross-modal deep learning algorithms to identify critical knowledge patterns and represent them in an immersive mixed reality environment. Experimental validation with 80 participants demonstrated that students trained using this system achieved 32.4% faster skill acquisition, 22.4% higher accuracy in construction tasks, and significantly better knowledge retention compared to traditional methods. The system particularly excelled in transferring situational awareness and adaptive problem-solving capabilities. Results indicate that cross-modal deep learning approaches can successfully formalize expert tacit knowledge into learnable representations, providing a scalable solution for construction education that addresses industry challenges of workforce development and knowledge preservation. Despite these promising results, the study acknowledges limitations including computational latency challenges during complex interactions and hardware ergonomic constraints during extended training sessions.This study presents a novel approach for transferring expert tacit knowledge to construction students through a cross-modal deep learning supported mixed reality training system.

Abstract: Gesture-based interactions in a virtual reality (VR) setting can enhance our experience of traditional practices as part of preserving and communicating heritage. Cultural experiences embodied within VR environments are suggested to be an effective approach for experiencing intangible cultural heritage. Ceremonies, rituals, and related ancestral enactments are important for preserving cultural heritage. Kāi Bǐ Lǐ, also known as the First Writing Ceremony, is traditionally held for Chinese children before their first year of elementary school. However, gesture-based immersive VR for learning this tradition is new, and have not been developed within the community. This study focused on how users experienced learning cultural practices using gesture-based interactive VR across different age groups and hardware platforms. We first conducted an experiment with 60 participants (30 young adults and 30 children) using the First Writing Ceremony as a case study in which gestural interactions were elicited, designed, implemented, and evaluated. The study showed significant differences in play time and presence between the head-mounted display VR and desktop VR. In addition, children were less likely to experience fatigue than young adults. Following this, we conducted another study after eight months to investigate the VR systems' long-term learning effectiveness. This showed that children outperformed young adults in demonstrating greater knowledge retention. Our results and findings contribute to the design of gesture-based VR for different age groups across different platforms for experiencing, learning, and practicing cultural activities.Gesture-based interactions in a virtual reality (VR) setting can enhance our experience of traditional practices as part of preserving and communicating heritage.

We first conducted an experiment with 60 participants (30 young adults and 30 children) using the First Writing Ceremony as a case study in which gestural interactions were elicited, designed, implemented, and evaluated. The study showed significant differences in play time and presence between the head-mounted display VR and desktop VR. In addition, children were less likely to experience fatigue than young adults. Following this, we conducted another study after eight months to investigate the VR systems' long-term learning effectiveness. This showed that children outperformed young adults in demonstrating greater knowledge retention. Our results and findings contribute to the design of gesture-based VR for different age groups across different platforms for experiencing, learning, and practicing cultural activities.

Abstract: With the adoption of competency-based medical education (CBME) by the National Medical Commission of India in 2019, assessment methods such as objective structured clinical/practical examination (OSCE/OSPE) have gained importance for objectively evaluating clinical and practical competencies. However, the success of such methods largely depends on effective faculty training and subsequent transfer of training (TOT) to the workplace. Background With the adoption of competency-based medical education (CBME) by the National Medical Commission of India in 2019, assessment methods such as objective structured clinical/practical examination (OSCE/OSPE) have gained importance for objectively evaluating clinical and practical competencies. However, the success of such methods largely depends on effective faculty training and subsequent transfer of training (TOT) to the workplace.This study aimed to evaluate the immediate and long-term TOT among medical faculty following a structured OSCE/OSPE workshop and subsequent implementation in respective departments. The objectives included to design and conduct the training workshop on OSCE/OSPE and to assess knowledge retention, skill application, and impact on student learning using Kirkpatrick's four-level evaluation model. Aim and Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the immediate and long-term TOT among medical faculty following a structured OSCE/OSPE workshop and subsequent implementation in respective departments. The objectives included to design and conduct the training workshop on OSCE/OSPE and to assess knowledge retention, skill application, and impact on student learning using Kirkpatrick's four-level evaluation model.A prospective, interventional study was conducted over 3 years at a medical college with an annual intake of 150 MBBS students. The first phase involved training 29 faculty members across 16 departments through a 1-day OSCE/OSPE workshop. The second phase involved implementation in respective departments. Data were collected from trained faculty, peer faculty and students using reflective writing, self-efficacy questionnaires, Likert-scale feedback, and open-ended responses. Quantitative data were analyzed in terms of medians, percentages and satisfaction indices and represented in graphs, whereas qualitative data were transcribed and thematic analysis was conducted. Materials and Methods A prospective, interventional study was conducted over 3 years at a medical college with an annual intake of 150 MBBS students. The first phase involved training 29 faculty members across 16 departments through a 1-day OSCE/OSPE workshop. The second phase involved implementation in respective departments. Data were collected from trained faculty, peer faculty and students using reflective writing, self-efficacy questionnaires, Likert-scale feedback, and open-ended responses. Quantitative data were analyzed in terms of medians, percentages and satisfaction indices and represented in graphs, whereas qualitative data were transcribed and thematic analysis was conducted.A total of 29 trained faculty, 53 peer faculty, and 410 students participated in the study. Following the OSCE/OSPE workshop, 94% of departments implemented it in their workplace. Faculty showed significant improvement in knowledge, confidence, and self-efficacy, with satisfaction indices ranging from 80% to 90%. Peer faculty validated the effective application and teamwork of trained faculty. Students found OSCE/OSPE more structured, equitable, and less stressful, with improved confidence and skill retention. The study demonstrated successful TOT at all levels of Kirkpatrick's model, with sustained implementation across 3 years and regular practice thereafter, indicating strong institutional integration and impact.

Abstract: ABSTRACT Alternate abstract: Purpose: Public awareness of fluoride, particularly regarding its presence and effects in cultural heritage and broader contexts, remains low. Digital communication is an increasingly vital approach for preserving, disseminating, and providing access to cultural heritage. Alternate abstract: Methods: This study develops an intangible cultural heritage visual narrative framework based on the digital communication of cultural heritage. Through the integration of multimodal technologies and immersive interactive design, it achieves accurate communication of fluoride knowledge. Alternate abstract: Results: The technical approach centered on 3D laser scanning, hyperspectral imaging, and multispectral analysis, models intangible cultural heritage items involving fluoride craftsmanship. Combining this with a database of material composition spectra, a digital correlation model is developed. This study significantly improves users' depth of process understanding (mean score of 4.26/5), average health risk identification accuracy (90.2%), and average knowledge retention (77.2%), while also promoting long-term health behavior change. Alternate abstract: Conclusions: Digital communication of cultural heritage can serve as an innovative tool for public health education, enhancing the comprehensibility of scientific knowledge and its effectiveness in behavioral transformation through cultural context.

Abstract: Multimedia learning effectiveness varies widely across cultural contexts and individual learner characteristics, yet existing educational technologies lack computational frameworks that predict and optimize these interactions. This study introduces the Multimedia Integration Impact Assessment Model (MIIAM), a machine learning framework integrating cognitive style detection, cultural background inference, multimedia complexity optimization, and ensemble prediction into a unified architecture. MIIAM was validated with 493 software engineering students from Zimbabwe and South Africa through the analysis of 4.1 million learning interactions. The framework applied Random Forests for automated cognitive style classification, hierarchical clustering for cultural inference, and a complexity optimization engine for content analysis, while predictive performance was enhanced by an ensemble of Random Forests, XGBoost, and Neural Networks. The results demonstrated that MIIAM achieved 87% prediction accuracy, representing a 14% improvement over demographic-only baselines ( p < 0.001). Cross-cultural validation confirmed strong generalization, with only a 2% accuracy drop compared to 11–15% for traditional models, while fairness analysis indicated substantially reduced bias (Statistical Parity Difference = 0.08). Real-time testing confirmed deployment feasibility with an average 156 ms processing time. MIIAM also optimized multimedia content, improving knowledge retention by 15%, reducing cognitive overload by 28%, and increasing completion rates by 22%. These findings establish MIIAM as a robust, culturally responsive framework for adaptive multimedia learning environments.

Abstract: This study explores the evolving landscape of microlearning by synthesizing peer-reviewed literature and real-world insights from instructors and learners affiliated with the online learning platform GoSkills. Using a qualitative, exploratory design, it examines how microlearning is defined, delivered, and experienced across corporate and educational settings. A review of 13 academic sources highlights key dimensions such as brevity, adaptability, targeted instructional design, and emerging digital formats. Semi-structured interviews with three instructors and three learners complement this review, offering a grounded perspective on how these concepts take shape in practice. While microlearning offers clear advantages in flexibility, motivation, and knowledge retention, its conciseness may limit deeper learning unless supported by thoughtful scaffolding or contextual aids. By drawing on recent literature and practitioner experiences, this study contributes to a better understanding of microlearning's current strengths and challenges and outlines future research directions, including its integration into broader learning ecosystems and the evolving role of AI-powered learning technologies.

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed, privacy-preserving paradigm that enables multiple decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared model using only their own local data. However, conventional FL methods often suffer from client drift induced by non-IID data across participants, resulting in slower convergence and degraded overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose FedLMA, a fully decentralized framework that combines local knowledge distillation with an LLM-driven multi-agent reasoning mechanism over a blockchain-enabled knowledge-sharing layer. Specifically, FedLMA first extracts and regularizes soft labels from each client’s local model to generate robust distilled knowledge. Then, a large language model driven multi-agent system evaluates class-wise learning difficulty and knowledge retention to form a personalized demand vector, which is used to adaptively filter and weight relevant knowledge fragments. Finally, the selected knowledge guides student model updates via a hybrid cross-entropy and KL-divergence loss. Comprehensive experiments on heterogeneous benchmarks demonstrate that FedLMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalized FL methods in both accuracy and convergence speed under highly non-IID data distributions, effectively mitigating client drift and enhancing overall model performance in decentralized, heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: Games based on gamification have become increasingly popular and effective in improving the training of occupational safety in various industries. Gamified interventions enhance worker engagement, knowledge retention, and safetyrelated behaviors due to the compatibility of games with other game-based elements, including rewards, challenges, and immersion, as well as technologies such as virtual reality (VR). This systematic review synthesizes existing evidence on the design, implementation, and effects of gamification as part of safety training, with a particular focus on its psychological consequences, including enhanced resilience and a decrease in burnout. Another area where the review highlights barriers to implementation is cognitive overload, as well as the varying contexts across workers' demographics and industries. The most prominent gaps identified are: long-term studies are needed; gamification approaches must be tailored on a case-by-case basis; and the scope of gamification itself must expand beyond serving established manufacturers to venture into other areas of popularized production, such as agriculture and small-scale manufacturing, which have yielded minimal study results so far. These gaps will allow organizations to optimize gamification and create healthier, more enjoyable, and efficient work environments.

Abstract: Medical students often turn to external resources to optimize their learning efficiency due to vast amounts of information. A popular resource is Anki (Ankitects Pty Ltd., New South Wales, Australia) a free, open-source flashcard program that leverages spaced repetition to enhance learning and retention. Studies have shown that spaced education enhances knowledge retention in medical education; however, few have specifically examined Anki's usage patterns and perceptions to identify potential interventions that could help enhance learning outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine usage patterns and student perceptions of how they utilize Anki. Furthermore, this study looked at a deeper level of how students incorporated it into their lives outside of school.  Methods: First-year medical students at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine were recruited to participate in a survey. Deidentified demographic data were gathered, and the survey was open to both Anki and non-Anki users and incorporated question responses using the Likert scale. For Anki users, the survey examined their Anki usage structure, perceptions of Anki, and Anki in relation to life activities. Survey questions were created based on prior Anki experience and adapted from various topics on validated burnout surveys. Seventy-four percent of the first-year class participated in the survey. Quantitative analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and correlation tests on SPSS.

For Anki users, the survey examined their Anki usage structure, perceptions of Anki, and Anki in relation to life activities. Survey questions were created based on prior Anki experience and adapted from various topics on validated burnout surveys. Seventy-four percent of the first-year class participated in the survey. Quantitative analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and correlation tests on SPSS.Most students identified as Anki users (94%), emphasizing its role in medical education, and most users relied on pre-made cards (97.6%) and considered Anki as a key study strategy (62.6%). Most students preferred fill-in-the-blank cards (78%), 59% believed Anki boosted productivity compared to other study tools, and a substantial majority (87.8%) believed that Anki significantly contributes to their success in modules. Anki also affected "everyday" life activities. A majority (56.6%) reported multitasking with Anki during activities like exercising or eating. In addition, a Pearson correlation test revealed that the higher the percent study strategy of Anki, the stronger the perception of success (r= 0.621, p<0.001).  Conclusion: Most medical students use Anki as part of their study strategy. Faculty may be able to utilize these insights to optimize the implementation of Anki in medical education by helping students understand how to best utilize Anki's best practices. Future research could further explore students' reasons for how they use this resource.

Abstract: The study aims to examine female leadership and intersectionality in educational settings. The gatekeepers, who include male leadership, institutional cultures, and other women's advancement facilitators, must recognise that ignoring the value and embodiment of women in educational leadership roles could result in loss of knowledge, a low level of awareness of how systems are changing, and a risk of educational institutions being forced to support antiquated practices. The methodology employed in this study is based on a qualitative and phenomenological approach that critically investigates the experiences and leadership challenges of women in leadership spaces. Fifteen women were interviewed from various education spheres and departments to understand their resilience, determination, and innovative practices comprehensively. Female leadership is crucial for educational success, especially when it challenges social justice. Social justice in schools is rooted in privilege and power, recognising and accepting differences for inclusion and equitable power distribution for empowerment. Firstly, understanding the foundation of social justice is essential to addressing women's issues in educational spaces. There should be an emphasis on access for women, creating awareness of the causes of inequality, the capacity to direct interests, and taking control and action to reduce structural inequality. Secondly, opportunities for empowerment should be created amongst women and for women. The last recommendation pertains to challenging indigenous institutional cultures to increase the number of women in educational leadership spaces and give them the power to be decision-makers, leading to responsibilities and rights curtailing the right gatekeepers to stop women's freedoms in educational spaces. So, empowerment moves between empowerment and development outcomes for women, ultimately leading to unintended results that will also be realised in women's empowerment in educational leadership spaces. This paper is underpinned by critical theory to challenge the social justice idea of women's empowerment in educational spaces in relation to women and their advancement in leadership positions. Our contribution focuses on women challenging the power and control over decisions and resources in educational leadership spaces, with particular focus on how women may use empowerment as a tool to encourage one another in oppressive spaces, while also developing themselves from an empowerment perspective in order to bring value to their embodiment in the aforementioned spaces.

Abstract: Purpose The proliferation of online learning and digital media has both expanded opportunities for violence prevention programming and presented challenges for replicating the benefits of in-person learning environments. The advent of learning management systems (LMS) and online data collection tools has advanced scientific inquiry and reach, while also requiring mastery of an ever-changing digital landscape. Methods This paper provides a framework for developing effective online violence prevention trainings, using tenets of bystander intervention, andragogical learning principles, learning taxonomies, and eLearning instructional design. Results Our application of online violence prevention training was selected because evidence-based in-person bystander training models exist and can serve as a content model for online adaptation. Specifically, we review how to design interventions that appeal to adult learners’ needs and motivations (andragogical learning principles), organize learning outcomes according to a range of cognitive processes (learning taxonomies), and create engaging digital learning products (eLearning instructional design). Further, we discuss how to promote knowledge retention and skills acquisition through cognitive and behavioral interactivity, role play demonstrations, real-time assessment, and simulation-based learning. We describe practical components of online training development, including technological considerations, creative elements, and evaluative measures. Lastly, we provide direction on vendor selection; ensuring web content accessibility compliance; and optimizing data capture. Conclusions By exploring new directions in online interventions for violence research, we seek to bridge existing gaps in training delivered in-person and in digital settings.

Abstract: High-fidelity simulators (HFS) have become integral to undergraduate medical education (UME), offering realistic clinical training and skill development opportunities. Despite their growing use, the comparative effectiveness of HFS versus low-fidelity simulators (LFS) and traditional teaching methods remains unclear. This review evaluates the impact of HFS in UME, focusing on skill acquisition, knowledge retention, student confidence, and cost-effectiveness. A systematic review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PUBMED, Ovid, and LibSearch for studies from 2000 to 2025 comparing HFS with LFS or traditional teaching methods in UME. Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria and were critically appraised. HFS significantly improved procedural skills, particularly in high-stakes scenarios such as emergency medicine. They also enhanced student confidence in complex clinical situations. However, evidence on the impact of HFS on knowledge retention was mixed, and LFS were found to offer similar outcomes for basic skills training at a lower cost. HFS play a valuable role in UME, especially for complex skills, but a tiered approach utilizing LFS for basic training may offer cost-effective alternatives. Future research should evaluate the long-term effects of HFS on clinical practice.High-fidelity simulators (HFS) have become integral to undergraduate medical education (UME), offering realistic clinical training and skill development opportunities.

Abstract: Introduction The emergency department (ED) is the first point of care for critically ill patients who require rapid stabilization and treatment, which frequently involves obtaining informed consent. The environment of the ED is challenging due to the complex interaction between staff and patients and their families, with numerous tasks needing to be performed within a limited time window. That is why consent-taking in the ED by healthcare professionals and nurses is sometimes inconsistent with best practices, leading to ethical and legal concerns. Informed consent-taking in the ED is critical yet challenging, with traditional lecture-based training often failing to equip healthcare professionals with practical skills. This study compares the Four-Component Instructional Design (4C/ID) model, a task-driven, interactive approach with lecture-based learning (traditional methods) for enhancing consent-taking skills. Methods A quasi-experimental study was conducted with 21 emergency care professionals, randomized into two groups: the control group underwent traditional lecture-based training, and the intervention group received 4C/ID-based training (simulations and role-playing). Outcomes were assessed via pre- and post-tests (knowledge retention), Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs; practical skills), and focus group discussions (qualitative feedback on comfort/confidence). Results Both the control and intervention groups showed similar knowledge retention, but the 4C/ID group demonstrated better skill performance in OSCEs than traditional training. Qualitative analysis revealed that the 4C/ID participants reported greater confidence, understanding, and satisfaction with the training. Conclusion The 4C/ID model was shown to be promising in teaching consent-taking skills in the ED and increasing the healthcare professional's confidence, compared to traditional lectures. This evidence supports adopting interactive, task-based training for ethical communication in high-pressure clinical settings like the ED.Introduction The emergency department (ED) is the first point of care for critically ill patients who require rapid stabilization and treatment, which frequently involves obtaining informed consent.

Abstract: Aim The paper examined the current evidence on the impact of virtual simulation compared with mannequin-based simulation learning on undergraduate nursing students’ ability to recognise and manage clinical deterioration. Background Simulation-based learning is widely used in nursing education to enhance clinical decision-making. Mannequin-based simulation has been the standard, as emerging virtual simulation technologies offer new opportunities for experiential learning. However, the comparative effectiveness of these approaches in preparing students for clinical deterioration remains unclear. Design Systematic review and narrative synthesis on the outcomes of using mannequin-based and virtual simulation among undergraduate nursing students in the context of clinical deterioration were conducted. Methods A comprehensive search was performed following PRISMA guidelines across multiple databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Series and ProQuest. The focus included quantitative studies, such as randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental trials from 2013 to 2023, that compared virtual simulation to other simulation methods. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool and a narrative synthesis was conducted. Results Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The notable advantages of using virtual simulation include improved clinical performance, enhanced assessment, increased adaptability for larger group practice and knowledge retention. However, limitations included the absence of immediate debriefing, reduced realism and technological challenges that impacted virtual simulation. Conclusion This review highlights the strengths of mannequin-based and virtual simulation methods in clinical deterioration management, with marked differential outcomes in realism and anxiety among undergraduate nursing students.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and development of an educational game centred on the solar system, aiming to combine scientific accuracy with engaging gameplay. With the advancement of technology, Game-Based Learning (GBL) has gained increasing traction as an effective supplement to traditional education. Digital games set in virtual environments have demonstrated their ability to boost learner engagement and enhance knowledge retention. However, topics like the solar system often remain abstract and challenging for students, due to complex concepts such as planetary motion, gravitational forces, and spatial scales. To address these challenges, this project leverages GBL principles and scientific simulation techniques to create an immersive learning experience. Players engage in exploratory missions where they defend the solar system's resources while learning core astronomical concepts. The game environment is designed to promote active learning through interaction, strategy, and problem-solving, fostering a deeper understanding of planetary science. This paper explores the theoretical foundations behind game-based learning and its application to science education. It further details the design methodology, including scientific modelling, gameplay mechanics, and narrative elements that support learning outcomes. The game integrates interactive features such as dynamic simulations, visual storytelling, and progressive challenges that align with key educational goals. Special emphasis is placed on ensuring that educational content is seamlessly embedded within the game experience, avoiding didactic interruptions that may hinder player immersion. The research is guided by four key questions: How can complex astronomical knowledge be effectively conveyed through a game? How can developers maintain a balance between scientific accuracy and engaging gameplay? Can this game improve players' comprehension and interest in solar system science? What methods can be used to assess the game's impact on learning outcomes? The findings aim to contribute to the growing field of educational technology by providing insights into the integration of accurate scientific content within interactive digital games, ultimately enhancing science education through innovative and immersive methods.

Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of The XSS Game (TXG), an enhanced multi-opposing-roleplaying educational game designed to teach Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks to second-year undergraduate computer science students. TXG enables players to assume three distinct roles: Attacker, Defender (Developer), and User, each offering unique perspectives on cybersecurity challenges. Building upon feedback from the evaluation of TXG Version 1, this study focuses on incorporating various types of in-game feedback (affirming, reflective, explanatory, and personalised) and introducing a player statboard to enhance student engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention. TXG Version 2 incorporates a variety of feedback types aimed at reinforcing learning and promoting self-reflection. Confirmatory feedback helps players quickly assess the correctness of their answers, while explanatory feedback provides in-depth reasoning to enhance understanding. Affirming feedback is used to motivate players, particularly when they succeed in completing roles, and personalised feedback offers tailored guidance based on players' individual progress. The player statboard is introduced as a central feature, displaying player achievements, skills, and progression throughout the game, offering real-time feedback to sustain engagement and foster continued learning. Expert evaluations of TXG Version 2 indicated that the diverse feedback mechanisms, especially personalised feedback and the statboard, were effective in promoting learner engagement and self-reflection. However, the evaluations also identified areas for improvement, particularly regarding the clarity and readability of the feedback and statboard, while suggesting potential UI/UX enhancements. The study posits that with the suggested improvements, TXG Version 2 offers significant potential for improving cybersecurity education through a dynamic, engaging, and interactive gameplay experience. This study contributes to existing research on game-based learning by showcasing how game mechanics such as multi-opposing roles, simulations, in-game feedback and player statboards, can be integrated to enhance the learning of complex cybersecurity concepts. Furthermore, it provides a development framework for creating educational games in cybersecurity and beyond, demonstrating the effectiveness of a flexible, interactive, and immersive approach to teaching critical security concepts.

Abstract: Reflective learning enhances critical thinking, metacognition, and knowledge retention by encouraging learners to analyse their experiences. Digital games provide a rich environment for reflection through interactivity, feedback, and iterative exploration. While many games incorporate elements that support reflective learning, such as prompts, feedback displays, and decision-making mechanics, there has been limited systematic integration of reflective principles into digital Game-Based Learning (GBL) design. This study provides a structured Reflective Game Design (RGD) approach to embed reflective learning into digital GBL environments. Conducted in three phases, the research: (1) reviewed literature to identify core reflective strategies and game mechanics; (2) co-designed and developed two game prototypes, one with RGD features and one without; and (3) used a mixed-methods evaluation to compare usability, engagement, and learning outcomes across the two versions. Findings indicate that games designed with RGD features significantly enhance learners' critical engagement, emotional awareness, and knowledge retention. Features such as journaling, prompts, feedback systems, and emotional tracking, were particularly effective in deepening player connection and learning. This research offers actionable design recommendations and a flexible RGD framework to support the integration of reflective practices into educational games. It will be of particular value to GBL researchers, instructional designers, serious game developers, and educators seeking to create more meaningful, learner-centred digital experiences.

Abstract: Game-based learning (GBL) has emerged as a transformative educational approach, using interactive game elements to enhance student engagement and knowledge retention. Although research underscores the potential of GBL, challenges persist in aligning game elements with learning theories to optimise learner engagement and knowledge retention. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a comprehensive framework that integrates game elements through the lens of established learning theories, such as Cognitive Load Theory. The framework emphasises the interplay of game elements to foster engagement and retention, offering actionable insights for educators and serious game designers. Obtaining learner engagement and knowledge retention, key recommendations from this study include embedding adaptive challenges to balance skill and difficulty and personalising feedback through serious game mechanics. The study also highlights the critical role of real-world relevance in the design of GBL. Although the framework provides a solid foundation, future research should explore long-term efficacy across diverse educational contexts, age groups, and emerging technologies such as augmented reality. By bridging theoretical rigour with practical application, this work advances GBL as a tool for fostering meaningful, adaptive, and inclusive learning experiences.

Abstract: Gamification is an educational methodology using game aesthetics, dynamics, and mechanics to enhance motivation and learning. In special education, this strategy has been shown to improve motivation, engagement, and knowledge retention, as it allows content to be adapted into a more interactive and playful format while promoting experiential learning. Additionally, gamification fosters autonomy and collaboration among students, which can be key in acquiring and reinforcing social skills and inclusion. This study is based on a gamified didactic proposal inspired by the Netflix series Carmen Sandiego, combined with a game-based learning methodology. A research-based design was implemented alongside a pilot experience in a Spanish public high school involving three adolescents with intellectual disabilities. The intervention consisted of five one-hour sessions using game mechanics, interactive storytelling, problem-solving challenges, and achievement-based rewards. Two data collection methods were employed: participant observation and a semistructured interview with their teacher to assess the methodology's effectiveness after its implementation. The results indicated a high acceptance of gamification among the students. A firm initial and sustained motivation throughout the sessions was observed, along with a progressive increase in participation in the proposed activities. These positive results suggest that this approach can enhance student engagement and provide positive reinforcement for learning in students with intellectual disabilities. Moreover, the flexibility of the gamified approach was highlighted, allowing for the customization of content and its adaptation to the students' abilities, facilitating greater accessibility and comprehension of the topics covered. In conclusion, gamification based on the Carmen Sandiego narrative proved to be a practical methodology for motivating and improving the learning process of adolescents with intellectual disabilities. The promising results of this pilot study underscore the need for further research in this area. More extensive studies are recommended to confirm these findings and evaluate the long-term impact of gamification in special education, highlighting the importance of ongoing research in this field.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of Virtual Reality (VR) as a pedagogical tool for teaching Food Science and Technology to junior secondary students in Hong Kong. Traditional cooking education faces significant challenges including safety risks, resource constraints, and limited hands-on practice opportunities, issues particularly acute in Hong Kong where teacher shortages and lack of standardized textbooks compound these difficulties. The VR game was designed specifically for entry-level junior secondary students, incorporating scaffolded learning of both theoretical food science concepts and practical cookery skills aligned with Hong Kong's Technology and Living curriculum. Unlike traditional digital games, the VR environment enables three-dimensional spatial visualization of cooking processes, hand-tracking for motor skill development, and immersive procedural learning that closely mimics real kitchen experiences. This teaching experiment compared learning outcomes between students using a custom-developed VR cooking game ("Food Science Academy VR") and those watching video recordings of the same content. Four Secondary 1 (Grade 7 / K7) students participated in the experiment, with two engaging in VR gameplay and two viewing recorded gameplay videos. Assessment included both written tests and practical cooking tasks. Preliminary results indicated that VR users demonstrated superior knowledge retention and practical performance, though the study acknowledges significant limitations including the small sample size and the artificial nature of the video control condition, which does not represent actual traditional teaching practices in Hong Kong schools. While findings are preliminary, they suggest VR's unique affordances-particularly spatial visualization and embodied interaction, may offer advantages over both passive video instruction and potentially traditional methods for teaching procedural cooking skills. However, questions remain about the resource feasibility of implementing such technology in Hong Kong's educational context.

Abstract: Global waste generation continues to rise, with current estimates ranging between 7 and 10 billion tons annually (Alvarez-Risco et al., 2022). Although Germany operates one of the most advanced recycling systems worldwide, its complexity - characterized by strict multi-bin separation rules, regional sorting variations, and the growing use of mixed-material packaging - presents significant challenges for residents. Additionally, public motivation to sort waste correctly is declining. The Transformers project addresses these challenges by developing a gamified, web-based application designed to promote correct recycling behaviour through interactive, educational, and motivational elements. This digital tool is part of a broader initiative to boost material recycling through digital innovation and encouraging active public involvement. By combining proven learning strategies with immersive gamification elements, the application significantly improves knowledge retention and fosters deeper user engagement in recycling activities. The gamification strategy and learning modules were developed based on interviews with experts from the recycling industry. A mixed methods approach also encompassed a design sprint with citizens and representatives of public authorities. Key features of the application include sorting simulations, knowledge quizzes, challenge-based activities, a personalised dashboard, weekly leaderboards, and progress summaries. Educational content is delivered through structured modules, gamified tasks, interactive games, and an integrated Recycling News Hub. A point-based rewards system further incentivises participation, enabling users to redeem their points for sustainable rewards. Future developments will integrate artificial intelligence to offer personalised recommendations, adaptive learning pathways, real-time chatbot assistance, and natural language processing-based summaries of recycling news.

Abstract: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is not systematically taught during most training programs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and clinical utility of a 1-day didactic and simulation-based EMR curriculum for practicing endoscopists without prior formal training in advanced endoscopic tissue resection. Background and Aims Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is not systematically taught during most training programs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and clinical utility of a 1-day didactic and simulation-based EMR curriculum for practicing endoscopists without prior formal training in advanced endoscopic tissue resection.We designed a 1-day lecture and simulation-based EMR course. Twelve participants completed the course. Effectiveness and clinical utility were evaluated using sequential explanatory mixed methods. All participants completed a pre-course multiple choice question (MCQ) examination followed by a separate, post-course MCQ examination with a similar blueprint. A survey was also conducted to assess cognitive fatigue, perceived benefit, and potential for change in EMR practice. Finally, a delayed MCQ examination was administered 10-14 weeks later to assess knowledge retention and qualitative data were sequentially collected from 3 candidates via semi-structured interviews. Methods We designed a 1-day lecture and simulation-based EMR course. Twelve participants completed the course. Effectiveness and clinical utility were evaluated using sequential explanatory mixed methods. All participants completed a pre-course multiple choice question (MCQ) examination followed by a separate, post-course MCQ examination with a similar blueprint. A survey was also conducted to assess cognitive fatigue, perceived benefit, and potential for change in EMR practice. Finally, a delayed MCQ examination was administered 10-14 weeks later to assess knowledge retention and qualitative data were sequentially collected from 3 candidates via semi-structured interviews.The mean pre-course score was 47.8% (SD 12.4%). The mean post-course score was 75% (9.9%) and the mean delayed score was 70.8% (13.6%), both significantly higher than the mean pre-course score ( P < .001; Cohen's d = 1.86 and P < .001; Cohen's d = 1.47, respectively). There was no significant difference between the mean post- and delayed-course test scores ( P = .2). Three themes emerged from the interviews: (1) a need for EMR training, (2) improved knowledge evaluating polyps, and (3) changed or refined EMR technique after the course. Results The mean pre-course score was 47.8% (SD 12.4%). The mean post-course score was 75% (9.9%) and the mean delayed score was 70.8% (13.6%), both significantly higher than the mean pre-course score (P < .001; Cohen's d = 1.86 and P < .001; Cohen's d = 1.47, respectively).

Abstract: Background Health crises have intensified globally due to disease outbreaks and disasters. Sub-national governments serve as critical first responders with essential information on community demographics, vulnerabilities, and resources. They must adapt national guidelines while maintaining transparency in decentralized health systems. Establishing a system that can seamlessly respond to the transition between normal times and crises is imperative, but evidence of effective and sustainable communication systems is lacking. This research aimed to examine communication systems and practices of local governments during health crises, explicitly focusing on COVID-19 response experiences in Japan. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with COVID-19 response personnel from five Japanese local governments between December 2024-March 2025. Thirty-two participants included medical supervisors, health department directors, and staff from various divisions. Interviews focused on information sharing methods, systems, and communication structures. Data was analyzed by categorizing into internal and external communication dimensions. Results Social media platforms became vital communication tools. Local governments established consultation centers, provided multilingual support, and maintained regular meetings with medical associations. Regional collaboration enhanced resource sharing while specialized information tools facilitated internal data management. Challenges included excessive administrative notices, difficult ICT systems, initial response delays, and departmental silos that impeded coordination. Conclusions For sustainable communication systems, priorities should include: developing pre-crisis community engagement, utilizing diverse media, analyzing community feedback, implementing cross-organizational information sharing, considering regional characteristics, and establishing response systems that address staff continuity and knowledge retention. Key messages • Sub-national governments used diverse communication during COVID-19, but sustaining this requires pre-crisis engagement and preserving knowledge despite staff changes. • Successful crisis communication balances digital innovation with traditional media, prioritizes cross-organizational information flow, and adapts strategies to regional characteristics.

Abstract: Studying for final exams is often regarded as difficult for nursing students, therefore, activities using game-based learning methods may increase student satisfaction. Therefore, this study aimed to understand the feasibility of a game-based learning activity on nursing students' learning and revision processes. A one-group pre and post-questionnaire design was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of a game-based learning activity. All nursing students found the game-based learning activity valuable when preparing for written exams. The learning activity increased the levels of knowledge retention and the final grades. Although two students found the activity somewhat distracting, most students believed that game-based learning should be embedded into the nursing curriculum. The game-based learning activity was well-accepted when revising for written exams in nursing. However, research at a larger scale is required to confirm the effectiveness of the activity on students' knowledge, grades and long-term retention.Studying for final exams is often regarded as difficult for nursing students, therefore, activities using game-based learning methods may increase student satisfaction.

Abstract: A deeper understanding of how multimedia-based instruction interacts with the cognitive processes of EFL learners during listening tasks is needed to maximize its effectiveness. By employing a grounded theory approach, this study aimed to develop a theoretical framework that explains how multimedia-based instruction influences EFL learners' cognitive processes during listening tasks. Two higher education institutions were chosen based on the consideration that they have experienced the use of multimedia in teaching and learning EFL listening skills. Twenty-four students were selected for a theoretical sampling with an open sampling pattern to help researchers form the best theory. To enhance the understanding of the phenomenon, participant observation and semi-structured interviews served as the primary data collection techniques in this study. The researchers directly observed the process of teaching listening and then proceeded with a semi-structured interview. This study had three stages of the data analysis process: open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. The results indicated the cognitive effects of multimedia-based instruction on students' listening skills include improved comprehension and enhanced knowledge retention. It also developed a theory that links educational technology, cognitive psychology, and language acquisition through data analysis using the grounded theory method. This hypothesis implies that multimedia facilitates complex mental processes and enables students to process information effectively, understand it better, and retain it in their long-term memory.

Abstract: Background and Aims Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is not systematically taught during most training programs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and clinical utility of a 1-day didactic and simulation-based EMR curriculum for practicing endoscopists without prior formal training in advanced endoscopic tissue resection. Methods We designed a 1-day lecture and simulation-based EMR course. Twelve participants completed the course. Effectiveness and clinical utility were evaluated using sequential explanatory mixed methods. All participants completed a pre-course multiple choice question (MCQ) examination followed by a separate, post-course MCQ examination with a similar blueprint. A survey was also conducted to assess cognitive fatigue, perceived benefit, and potential for change in EMR practice. Finally, a delayed MCQ examination was administered 10-14 weeks later to assess knowledge retention and qualitative data were sequentially collected from 3 candidates via semi-structured interviews. Results The mean pre-course score was 47.8% (SD 12.4%). The mean post-course score was 75% (9.9%) and the mean delayed score was 70.8% (13.6%), both significantly higher than the mean pre-course score ( P < .001; Cohen’s d = 1.86 and P < .001; Cohen’s d = 1.47, respectively). There was no significant difference between the mean post- and delayed-course test scores ( P = .2). Three themes emerged from the interviews: (1) a need for EMR training, (2) improved knowledge evaluating polyps, and (3) changed or refined EMR technique after the course. Conclusions This study demonstrates significant knowledge acquisition and retention of cognitive skills and suggests a change in practice following a 1-day focused didactic and simulation-based EMR course. Lay Summary Doctors often do a test called a colonoscopy to check the colon for problems. If they find abnormal growths called polyps, they can remove them safely during the test. There is a way to remove bigger polyps called EMR (Endoscopic Mucosal Resection). However, many doctors who do colonoscopies have not been trained to do EMR. There are not many courses to teach EMR, and we do not know if the courses work well or how doctors perform after taking them. In our study, we found that doctors who took a 1-day course on EMR learned and remembered what they were taught. Also, these doctors changed the way they work and felt better-handling polyps. They learned when to remove these polyps, or when to send them for surgery or to a doctor with more experience in EMR.

Abstract: This paper develops an endogenous growth model that incorporates information carrier technology, highlighting that knowledge loss during storage and low communication efficiency hinder innovation. The model identifies a turning point: prior to it, economic stagnation prevails with unchanging production technology; afterward, research and development activity drives technological progress and economic growth. On the asymptotic balanced growth path, the growth rates of information carrier technology and population act as substitutes in determining the growth rate of per capita output and the fraction of labor allocated to research and development. This model offers novel insights into unified growth theory and the mechanisms underpinning the digital economy.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) conversational agents in Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) environments has received attention for its potential to enhance language learning outcomes. This study investigates the effects of AI conversational agents on EFL learners' self-regulated learning (SRL) and retention in CALL environments. A pretest–posttest experiment involving 203 EFL students was conducted, using pretest–posttest measures of SRL (goal-setting, monitoring, reflection) and retention (vocabulary/grammar recall). A mixed-methods approach evaluated the effectiveness of AI agents with adaptive feedback—defined here as real-time, error-specific corrections and scaffolded guidance tailored to individual learner performance. Quantitative results revealed that SRL pretest scores ranged from 2.98 to 3.10 (SD = 0.589–0.678), while posttest scores increased to 6.00–6.96 (SD = 0.194–0.808), reflecting a 133% improvement in SRL strategies. Retention pretest scores (3.00–3.24, SD = 1.355–1.366) also improved significantly. The adaptive feedback group outperformed other interventions, with posttest SRL scores 16% higher than non-adaptive groups (ΔM = 0.96, p < 0.001), indicating stronger metacognitive strategy use and long-term knowledge retention. Qualitative analysis highlighted learners’ perceptions of adaptive feedback as critical for personalized goal-setting and error correction. The study underscores the need to integrate operationalized adaptive feedback strategies—such as dynamic error prioritization and scaffolded explanations—into AI agents to optimize SRL and retention in EFL contexts.

Abstract: Continual graph learning addresses the challenges of temporal evolution in dynamic graph structures, enhancing a model’s ability to adapt to new information while retaining long-term knowledge. Although existing methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting, they often neglect latent semantic correlations and knowledge transfer across time, limiting forward transfer and long-term learning. To address these issues, we propose a prompt learning-based continual graph learning framework, PromptGNN, built upon Graph Neural Network architectures. It introduces learnable prompts to explicitly model global temporal context, guiding the model to better capture semantic relationships over time. We design a temporal-adaptive prompt mechanism to dynamically extract structural patterns at each time point, improving node representation expressiveness and generalization. Additionally, a cross-temporal shared prompt mechanism enables efficient reuse of critical knowledge across time, further reducing forgetting and enhancing adaptation to new data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PromptGNN. It achieves leading classification accuracy on five benchmark datasets and significantly lower forgetting rates compared to prior methods, highlighting its advantages in knowledge retention and transfer.

Abstract: Neuroanatomy is a crucial component of the physiotherapy curriculum, but its complexity can lead to “neurophobia” among students. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) offers an innovative alternative to traditional methods by providing interactive and realistic three‐dimensional images of neurological structures. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of IVR for learning neuroanatomy and to assess student satisfaction and motivation. We conducted a single‐blind randomized controlled trial with 67 second‐year physiotherapy students. Besides didactic lectures, students were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first was an IVR group ( n  = 34), in which students studied autonomously using the MetaQuest 2 IVR device with the SharecareYOU VR application (60 min), after having received instructions on how to use it (30 min). The second group ( n  = 33) followed a traditional learning approach using anatomical atlases and textbooks (90 min). Knowledge retention was assessed through an 18‐item questionnaire, while satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and usability of the IVR headset were evaluated using other questionnaires. Evaluations were carried out immediately after the intervention, and four weeks later. The IVR group demonstrated significantly higher knowledge retention overall ( p  < 0.001) as well as in specific areas, such as theoretical understanding, spatial location, and labeling of brain areas ( p  < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were maintained 4 weeks after the intervention ( p  = 0.37). Additionally, IVR students reported greater satisfaction ( p  < 0.001) and found it useful for learning ( p  < 0.001) without adverse events. Our findings show that IVR is a safe supplementary tool that is more effective for enhancing neuroanatomical education in physiotherapy than textbooks and atlases.

Abstract: Objective To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of traditional teaching methods versus simulation‐based learning in clinical ultrasound internships in obstetrics and gynecology. Design A randomized controlled study was conducted to compare three teaching methods: simulation‐based teaching, traditional + simulation‐based teaching, and traditional teaching. Setting The study was conducted at Longgang District Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital of Shenzhen City (Affiliated Shenzhen Women and Children's Hospital (Longgang) of Shantou University Medical College) from January 2023 to December 2024. Population or Sample A total of 120 clinical interns were selected and randomly divided into 3 groups (40 in each): Experimental Group 1 Simulation Teaching Group; Experimental Group 2 Traditional + Simulation Teaching Group; Control Group Traditional Teaching Group. Methods All groups received theoretical and practical ultrasound training, followed by assessment. Teaching performance was evaluated based on teaching time, daily practice opportunities, content mastery, stress levels, error rates in clinical assessments, and long‐term knowledge retention. Main Outcome Measures Teaching time, number of daily practice opportunities, stress levels, content mastery, error rates during practical exams, and long‐term knowledge retention. Results Simulation‐based teaching significantly improved teaching efficiency, reduced anxiety, and lowered error rates during clinical operations. Long‐term knowledge retention was highest in the traditional + simulation group, and combining both teaching methods enhanced skills and knowledge retention. Conclusions Simulation‐based teaching, especially when combined with traditional methods, enhances ultrasound training by improving operational skills, reducing stress, and increasing long‐term knowledge retention.

Abstract: To determine the feasibility of developing and implementing a multidisciplinary bootcamp for early-career Paediatric Cardiac Critical Care practitioners. OBJECTIVE To determine the feasibility of developing and implementing a multidisciplinary bootcamp for early-career Paediatric Cardiac Critical Care practitioners.A one-day pre-conference bootcamp at the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society Annual Meeting in December 2022. SETTING A one-day pre-conference bootcamp at the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society Annual Meeting in December 2022.Physicians, fellows, nurses, advanced practice registered nurses, and respiratory therapists who work primarily in paediatric cardiac critical care units. SUBJECTS Physicians, fellows, nurses, advanced practice registered nurses, and respiratory therapists who work primarily in paediatric cardiac critical care units.A modified Delphi needs assessment with interprofessional content experts for the development of a mixed didactic and simulation-based bootcamp at the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society Annual Meeting in December 2022, with pre- and post-testing to evaluate knowledge gain and additional surveys to assess perceived value. METHODS A modified Delphi needs assessment with interprofessional content experts for the development of a mixed didactic and simulation-based bootcamp at the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society Annual Meeting in December 2022, with pre- and post-testing to evaluate knowledge gain and additional surveys to assess perceived value.Eighty-three course participants came from a variety of professions and represented institutions nationally and internationally. Most participants (77%) had two or more years of professional experience, aligning with the bootcamp's focus on advanced learners. The bootcamp received strong participant evaluations: 84.1% (37/44) strongly agreed that the bootcamp improved their clinical knowledge. Ninety-seven percent (43/44) reported increased confidence in the ability to care for paediatric cardiac critical care patients. The bootcamp demonstrated a significant improvement in participant knowledge, with pre-test scores averaging 54.9% (95% CI: 49.9-59.9) compared to post-test scores of 64.5% (95% CI: 59.7-69.2), achieving statistical significance ( p < 0.05). RESULTS Eighty-three course participants came from a variety of professions and represented institutions nationally and internationally.

Abstract: The paper examined the current evidence on the impact of virtual simulation compared with mannequin-based simulation learning on undergraduate nursing students' ability to recognise and manage clinical deterioration. AIM The paper examined the current evidence on the impact of virtual simulation compared with mannequin-based simulation learning on undergraduate nursing students' ability to recognise and manage clinical deterioration.Simulation-based learning is widely used in nursing education to enhance clinical decision-making. Mannequin-based simulation has been the standard, as emerging virtual simulation technologies offer new opportunities for experiential learning. However, the comparative effectiveness of these approaches in preparing students for clinical deterioration remains unclear. BACKGROUND Simulation-based learning is widely used in nursing education to enhance clinical decision-making. Mannequin-based simulation has been the standard, as emerging virtual simulation technologies offer new opportunities for experiential learning. However, the comparative effectiveness of these approaches in preparing students for clinical deterioration remains unclear.Systematic review and narrative synthesis on the outcomes of using mannequin-based and virtual simulation among undergraduate nursing students in the context of clinical deterioration were conducted. DESIGN Systematic review and narrative synthesis on the outcomes of using mannequin-based and virtual simulation among undergraduate nursing students in the context of clinical deterioration were conducted.A comprehensive search was performed following PRISMA guidelines across multiple databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Series and ProQuest. The focus included quantitative studies, such as randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental trials from 2013 to 2023, that compared virtual simulation to other simulation methods. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool and a narrative synthesis was conducted.

Abstract: Research reports that interesting but irrelevant information, seductive details, in teaching material can impede learning. In science education, the inclusion of historical narratives in lessons to promote interest has been recommended but may hinder learning. This study examines the impact of seductive details on UK high school students' knowledge retention from video explanations. The research adopted a mixed methods approach. In the first study, an online survey ( N  = 101) randomized participants to watch video explanations of two physics topics (dark matter and tracers), with seductive details or without, and compared pre‐, post‐, and delayed knowledge test scores. Six participants were interviewed. In the second study, nine participants took part in a think‐aloud protocol while watching videos to examine perceptions of the videos. In the first study, the seductive details in one topic (dark matter) harmed learning ( p  > 0.01, η 2  = 0.114), but not in the second (tracer, p  = 0.166). Data from the think‐aloud task indicate an explanation for the mixed effect. Seductive details may both impede learning but also promote attention to core content, chunk material, and provide structure into which new content can be anchored when prior knowledge is low. Seductive details should be used with caution. They have the potential to impede learning, but, in some contexts, their negative impact on learning may be limited. Their effects depend on the context. The inclusion of seductive details in video explanations should not be ruled out, and we present guidance for reducing the impediment that interesting but inessential details can cause.

Abstract: This pre-post trial investigates whether ergonomic education using the STEPS model (Screen, Table, Equipment, Posture, Stance) can improve laparoscopic surgeons’ ergonomic risk. Intraoperative photographs taken at 1-min intervals were used to calculate risk through the objective Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) scale. Surgeons were reobserved immediately after an educational video, then again 4–6 weeks later. Cognitive strain (modified NASA-TLX), subjective outcomes, and knowledge retention were also assessed. Ten surgeons were recruited from colorectal, general, and gynaecology. There was no difference in REBA between baseline (REBA ​= ​5.0) and early reobservation (REBA ​= ​4.5) [0 ​= ​0.058], but between baseline and late reobservation (REBA ​= ​4.5) there was a significant reduction [p ​= ​0.028]. The overall scores for each day remained in the “medium risk” category. Knowledge retention was good (90 ​% correct answers). All found the education worthwhile and subsequently made changes to their practice. Ergonomic education is desired and deemed very important by surgeons, and reduces both their ergonomic risk and subjective experience of pain, but laparoscopic surgery remains ergonomically “medium risk” overall. Further solutions must be found to reduce risk.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) provides an immersive, interactive 3D learning environment with increasing use in medical education. It benefits surgical training and, increasingly more so in anatomy education, particularly where access to human body dissection is limited. Although VR can enhance engagement and knowledge retention, concerns remain regarding usability, feasibility and cybersickness. This study explores the acceptability of VR for anatomy learning among medical students with ongoing access to traditional anatomy laboratories. BACKGROUND Virtual reality (VR) provides an immersive, interactive 3D learning environment with increasing use in medical education. It benefits surgical training and, increasingly more so in anatomy education, particularly where access to human body dissection is limited. Although VR can enhance engagement and knowledge retention, concerns remain regarding usability, feasibility and cybersickness. This study explores the acceptability of VR for anatomy learning among medical students with ongoing access to traditional anatomy laboratories.A qualitative cross-sectional pilot study was conducted with 38 medical students at the ASSERT Simulation Centre, University College Cork. Participants took part in a guided VR session using human anatomy software. Afterwards, they completed an online survey assessing ease of use, enjoyment, immersion, educational usefulness, interaction, understanding, intention for future use and cybersickness. The survey was adapted from two validated questionnaires. Feature engineering combined related items into eight dimensions for streamlined analysis and visualisation. APPROACH A qualitative cross-sectional pilot study was conducted with 38 medical students at the ASSERT Simulation Centre, University College Cork. Participants took part in a guided VR session using human anatomy software. Afterwards, they completed an online survey assessing ease of use, enjoyment, immersion, educational usefulness, interaction, understanding, intention for future use and cybersickness. The survey was adapted from two validated questionnaires. Feature engineering combined related items into eight dimensions for streamlined analysis and visualisation.Results showed high acceptance and enthusiasm for VR. All participants reported enjoying the experience, finding it educationally useful, and that it enhanced their understanding. Between 95% and 98% found VR easy to use, immersive and reported ease in interacting with 3D objects. Although 8% experienced cybersickness, all expressed interest in future VR-based education. Potential novelty bias must also be considered. VR is a feasible and well-accepted tool for anatomy education, even among students with ongoing access to anatomy dissection facilities. With minimal cybersickness and high enjoyment, engagement and immersion, VR shows strong potential as a complementary educational method. Further research should explore long-term learning outcomes in terms of knowledge retention and clinical implementation strategies within educational institutions. EVALUATION Results showed high acceptance and enthusiasm for VR. All participants reported enjoying the experience, finding it educationally useful, and that it enhanced their understanding. Between 95% and 98% found VR easy to use, immersive and reported ease in interacting with 3D objects. Although 8% experienced cybersickness, all expressed interest in future VR-based education. Potential novelty bias must also be considered. VR is a feasible and well-accepted tool for anatomy education, even among students with ongoing access to anatomy dissection facilities. With minimal cybersickness and high enjoyment, engagement and immersion, VR shows strong potential as a complementary educational method. Further research should explore long-term learning outcomes in terms of knowledge retention and clinical implementation strategies within educational institutions.

Abstract: Indigenous people across the globe possess extensive knowledge of nature, which is acquired through direct interaction with the environment, enabling them to identify and utilize wild plants and other organisms in diverse ways. Unfortunately, this traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of indigenous people is dwindling at a rapid pace. Therefore, exploring and documenting this TEK can help preserve it for future generations. A key aspect of TEK is the knowledge of natural food resources, whose inclusion in diets can improve nutritional quality and enhance resilience to environmental change. This study aimed to document the wild tuber and other ethnic foods of the Mavilan community residing in Kannur and Kasaragod districts of North Malabar region in Kerala, India. Data on ethnic foods were collected from 20 panchayats in both Kannur and Kasaragod districts. A structured questionnaire was used to gather information on ethnic foods, their collection, preparation, and consumption patterns. A total of 219 people participated in the study, and prior informed consent was obtained from each of them. Independent t-tests revealed significant gender-based differences in knowledge of traditional foods, highlighting a gendered dimension to TEK. No statistically significant knowledge differences were found between Kasaragod and Kannur districts. Age-wise comparison showed that individuals aged 61–75 were the most knowledgeable, indicating generational shifts in knowledge retention. The highest relative frequency of citation (RFC) was recorded for Dioscorea wallichii (0.89), and Pila globosa showed the lowest RFC (0.20). This study also reports that the Mavilan tribe’s sustainable and low-input aquaculture method for cultivating P. globosa in homestead ponds represents an innovative example of indigenous organic aquaculture practice. The Mavilan’s knowledge of wild edible plants and unique food preparation and consumption patterns offers valuable insights into sustainable diets, biodiversity conservation, and food security.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Generation Z (GenZ) into medical education has highlighted the need for a transformative shift in teaching methodologies, particularly in specialized fields like orthopedics. As digital natives, GenZ learners-born between 1995 and 2010-exhibit distinct preferences for interactive, technology-driven, and self-directed learning, rendering traditional lecture-based models increasingly obsolete. This scoping review explores the pedagogical implications of GenZ's learning traits and advocates for a generational shift in orthopedic education to align with their cognitive styles and career aspirations. GenZ students thrive in environments that use digital tools such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and gamified platforms, which provide immersive, risk-free surgical simulations and improve procedural mastery. Microlearning techniques, including bite-sized videos and infographics support their shorter attention spans and improve retention of complex topics like fracture classifications and biomechanics. Collaborative learning strategies, such as team-based problem-solving and peer-teaching models, resonate with their preference for social interaction and teamwork. Additionally, adaptive learning systems powered by artificial intelligence offer personalized study plans, addressing individual strengths and weaknesses. The review demonstrates the importance of early clinical exposure and simulation-based training to bridge theory and practice, encouraging pragmatic, career-ready professionals. Educators, particularly millennials, must embrace digital fluency and mentorship to create learner-centered environments. By integrating these innovations-flipped classrooms, gamification, and on-demand resources-orthopedic education can lead to engagement, knowledge retention, and clinical preparedness. Ultimately, this generational shift is imperative to equip future orthopedic surgeons with the skills demanded by modern healthcare. Embracing technology, interactivity, and personalized learning will redefine training approaches, ensuring optimal educational outcomes and patient care for the next generation of medical professionals.The rapid integration of Generation Z (GenZ) into medical education has highlighted the need for a transformative shift in teaching methodologies, particularly in specialized fields like orthopedics.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) allows clients to collaboratively train their personalized models to handle situations where data from different clients are not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). Previous PFL research implicitly assumes that clients benefit most from those with similar data distributions. Correspondingly, methods such as personalized weight aggregation assign higher weights to similar clients during aggregation. We pose a question: can a client benefit from other clients with dissimilar data distributions, and if so, how? This question is particularly relevant in scenarios with a high degree of non-IID, where clients have widely different distributions, and learning from only similar clients will result in a loss of knowledge from many other clients. We note that when dealing with clients with similar distributions, current methods tend to enforce their models to be close in the parameter space. It is reasonable to conjecture that a client can benefit from dissimilar clients if we allow their models to depart from each other. Based on this idea, we propose DiversiFed, which allows each client to learn from clients with diversified distribution. DiversiFed pushes personalized models of clients with dissimilar distributions apart in the parameter space while pulling together those with similar distributions. In addition, to achieve the above effect without using prior knowledge of distribution, we design a loss function that leverages model similarity to determine the degree of attraction and repulsion between any two models. Experiments on benchmark and medical datasets show that DiversiFed can outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by up to 3.19%.Personalized federated learning (PFL) allows clients to collaboratively train their personalized models to handle situations where data from different clients are not independent and identically distributed (non-IID).

Abstract: Although virtual reality (VR) technology has been used for training in various aspects of construction, the evidence of its effectiveness in construction quality training has yet to be examined. The current study develops a novel high-fidelity VR-based defect identification training module using minute details of construction defects to assess participants’ learning experience for construction quality-related training vis-à-vis conventional classroom training. Actual quality-related defect data from two construction projects was classified, and selected defects were modeled to create three-dimensional (3D) objects in an interactive VR environment. A robust sample of 121 Indian civil engineering students were recruited and categorized into three cohorts: No Training, Classroom Training, and VR Training. The data from these participants—data from questionnaires on perceptions and conceptual knowledge and scores in an innovative VR-based defect identification testing module—were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. In a context with no previous empirical examination of VR-based education in construction quality, this study reveals that high-fidelity VR training improves participants’ conceptual knowledge of construction defects. However, VR does not show a specific advantage compared to classroom training for conceptual knowledge retention, a finding that is attributable to the similarity in training materials between VR and conventional methods. Based on a robust methodology in the current study, these results amplify a somewhat limited perspective in the literature on the effectiveness of VR-based training and cautions against the potential overestimation of the effectiveness of VR for improvements in conceptual knowledge among study participants. The most significant contributions of this study lie in advancing the VR training literature, of which only a handful of studies have focused on assessing the practical knowledge gained by training recipients. Notably, this study reveals a 32.8% improvement in VR-based practical learning outcomes for the VR cohort compared to the no-training cohort, suggesting that VR could provide hands-on skills for navigating quality-related challenges in the construction industry.

Abstract: Neuroanatomy is a crucial component of the physiotherapy curriculum, but its complexity can lead to "neurophobia" among students. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) offers an innovative alternative to traditional methods by providing interactive and realistic three-dimensional images of neurological structures. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of IVR for learning neuroanatomy and to assess student satisfaction and motivation. We conducted a single-blind randomized controlled trial with 67 second-year physiotherapy students. Besides didactic lectures, students were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first was an IVR group (n = 34), in which students studied autonomously using the MetaQuest 2 IVR device with the SharecareYOU VR application (60 min), after having received instructions on how to use it (30 min). The second group (n = 33) followed a traditional learning approach using anatomical atlases and textbooks (90 min). Knowledge retention was assessed through an 18-item questionnaire, while satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and usability of the IVR headset were evaluated using other questionnaires. Evaluations were carried out immediately after the intervention, and four weeks later. The IVR group demonstrated significantly higher knowledge retention overall (p < 0.001) as well as in specific areas, such as theoretical understanding, spatial location, and labeling of brain areas (p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were maintained 4 weeks after the intervention (p = 0.37). Additionally, IVR students reported greater satisfaction (p < 0.001) and found it useful for learning (p < 0.001) without adverse events. Our findings show that IVR is a safe supplementary tool that is more effective for enhancing neuroanatomical education in physiotherapy than textbooks and atlases.Neuroanatomy is a crucial component of the physiotherapy curriculum, but its complexity can lead to "neurophobia" among students.

Abstract: To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of traditional teaching methods versus simulation-based learning in clinical ultrasound internships in obstetrics and gynecology. OBJECTIVE To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of traditional teaching methods versus simulation-based learning in clinical ultrasound internships in obstetrics and gynecology.A randomized controlled study was conducted to compare three teaching methods: simulation-based teaching, traditional + simulation-based teaching, and traditional teaching. DESIGN A randomized controlled study was conducted to compare three teaching methods: simulation-based teaching, traditional + simulation-based teaching, and traditional teaching.The study was conducted at Longgang District Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital of Shenzhen City (Affiliated Shenzhen Women and Children's Hospital (Longgang) of Shantou University Medical College) from January 2023 to December 2024. SETTING The study was conducted at Longgang District Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital of Shenzhen City (Affiliated Shenzhen Women and Children's Hospital (Longgang) of Shantou University Medical College) from January 2023 to December 2024.A total of 120 clinical interns were selected and randomly divided into 3 groups (40 in each): Experimental Group 1 Simulation Teaching Group; Experimental Group 2 Traditional + Simulation Teaching Group; Control Group Traditional Teaching Group. POPULATION OR SAMPLE A total of 120 clinical interns were selected and randomly divided into 3 groups (40 in each): Experimental Group 1 Simulation Teaching Group; Experimental Group 2 Traditional + Simulation Teaching Group; Control Group Traditional Teaching Group.All groups received theoretical and practical ultrasound training, followed by assessment. Teaching performance was evaluated based on teaching time, daily practice opportunities, content mastery, stress levels, error rates in clinical assessments, and long-term knowledge retention. METHODS All groups received theoretical and practical ultrasound training, followed by assessment. Teaching performance was evaluated based on teaching time, daily practice opportunities, content mastery, stress levels, error rates in clinical assessments, and long-term knowledge retention.Teaching time, number of daily practice opportunities, stress levels, content mastery, error rates during practical exams, and long-term knowledge retention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Teaching time, number of daily practice opportunities, stress levels, content mastery, error rates during practical exams, and long-term knowledge retention.Simulation-based teaching significantly improved teaching efficiency, reduced anxiety, and lowered error rates during clinical operations. Long-term knowledge retention was highest in the traditional + simulation group, and combining both teaching methods enhanced skills and knowledge retention. RESULTS Simulation-based teaching significantly improved teaching efficiency, reduced anxiety, and lowered error rates during clinical operations. Long-term knowledge retention was highest in the traditional + simulation group, and combining both teaching methods enhanced skills and knowledge retention.Simulation-based teaching, especially when combined with traditional methods, enhances ultrasound training by improving operational skills, reducing stress, and increasing long-term knowledge retention. CONCLUSIONS Simulation-based teaching, especially when combined with traditional methods, enhances ultrasound training by improving operational skills, reducing stress, and increasing long-term knowledge retention.

Abstract: This pre-post trial investigates whether ergonomic education using the STEPS model (Screen, Table, Equipment, Posture, Stance) can improve laparoscopic surgeons' ergonomic risk. Intraoperative photographs taken at 1-min intervals were used to calculate risk through the objective Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) scale. Surgeons were reobserved immediately after an educational video, then again 4-6 weeks later. Cognitive strain (modified NASA-TLX), subjective outcomes, and knowledge retention were also assessed. Ten surgeons were recruited from colorectal, general, and gynaecology. There was no difference in REBA between baseline (REBA ​= ​5.0) and early reobservation (REBA ​= ​4.5) [0 ​= ​0.058], but between baseline and late reobservation (REBA ​= ​4.5) there was a significant reduction [p ​= ​0.028]. The overall scores for each day remained in the "medium risk" category. Knowledge retention was good (90 ​% correct answers). All found the education worthwhile and subsequently made changes to their practice. Ergonomic education is desired and deemed very important by surgeons, and reduces both their ergonomic risk and subjective experience of pain, but laparoscopic surgery remains ergonomically "medium risk" overall. Further solutions must be found to reduce risk.This pre-post trial investigates whether ergonomic education using the STEPS model (Screen, Table, Equipment, Posture, Stance) can improve laparoscopic surgeons' ergonomic risk.

Abstract: The Family Medicine Certification Longitudinal Assessment (FMCLA) is an open book spaced alternative to the traditional 1-day Family Medicine Certification Examination (FMCE). We studied whether FMCLA improves test scores beyond predicted scores. INTRODUCTION The Family Medicine Certification Longitudinal Assessment (FMCLA) is an open book spaced alternative to the traditional 1-day Family Medicine Certification Examination (FMCE). We studied whether FMCLA improves test scores beyond predicted scores.We used American Board of Family Medicine data from 2008 to 2023, with scores reported on a scale from 200 to 800. We built a predictive model of FMCE performance using linear regression with the 2008 exam cohort. We then applied that model to the 2009 to 2011 cohorts, who could opt for FMCLA beginning in 2019, controlling for choice of exam mode using an inverse probability weight for selecting FMCE. METHODS We used American Board of Family Medicine data from 2008 to 2023, with scores reported on a scale from 200 to 800. We built a predictive model of FMCE performance using linear regression with the 2008 exam cohort. We then applied that model to the 2009 to 2011 cohorts, who could opt for FMCLA beginning in 2019, controlling for choice of exam mode using an inverse probability weight for selecting FMCE.Our final sample sizes were 9699 for the FMCE predictive model and 12,851 for the FMCLA versus FMCE analysis. Physicians who opted for FMCLA were more likely to be younger, female, US medical graduates, and have lower prior FMCE scores. Adjusted analyses controlling for propensity to select FMCE revealed that FMCLA was associated with an increase of 39 points (95% CI 36.2-42.0) over predicted score with physicians on the high end scoring 100 more points than predicted, while physicians predicted to fail did worse. Modality of exam had no impact near the passing score. RESULTS Our final sample sizes were 9699 for the FMCE predictive model and 12,851 for the FMCLA versus FMCE analysis.

Modality of exam had no impact near the passing score.FMCLA was associated with gains in scores over a 1-day exam. This supports cognitive psychology principles such as spaced repetition and immediate feedback that can strengthen long-term knowledge retention. There was little impact of exam delivery method on scores near the passing score, which suggests that important functions of assessing knowledge can be retained in longitudinal assessment.

Abstract: This study aimed to assess undergraduate dental students' performance, perception, and preference when applying space analysis using digital dental models (DDM) compared to plaster dental models (PDM). OBJECTIVES This study aimed to assess undergraduate dental students' performance, perception, and preference when applying space analysis using digital dental models (DDM) compared to plaster dental models (PDM).A prospective cohort observational study at our institution evaluated student performance by measuring the time taken and the frequency of assistance requests for accurate results (n = 34). After completing both methods, students' perceptions of each method were assessed via a questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale (n = 69). METHODS A prospective cohort observational study at our institution evaluated student performance by measuring the time taken and the frequency of assistance requests for accurate results (n = 34). After completing both methods, students' perceptions of each method were assessed via a questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale (n = 69).Overall, the students using the DDM had significantly lower durations to achieve accurate space analysis results p = 0.003 when compared to the students using the PDM. On day one, the DDM group showed significantly lower duration and significantly less need for assistance than the PDM group p = 0.025 and p = 0.015, respectively. However, on day two, there was no significant difference between the two groups p = 0.058 and p = 0.622, respectively. The feedback showed that a higher percentage of students thought using DDM for space analysis is easier, especially with measuring space available (43.5% against 31%). Still, most prefer PDM for learning and understanding (89.8% vs. 68%), and most prefer to use DDM for space analysis in the future (59.4% compared to 21.7%). RESULTS Overall, the students using the DDM had significantly lower durations to achieve accurate space analysis results p = 0.003 when compared to the students using the PDM. On day one, the DDM group showed significantly lower duration and significantly less need for assistance than the PDM group p = 0.025 and p = 0.015, respectively. However, on day two, there was no significant difference between the two groups p = 0.058 and p = 0.622, respectively. The feedback showed that a higher percentage of students thought using DDM for space analysis is easier, especially with measuring space available (43.5% against 31%). Still, most prefer PDM for learning and understanding (89.8% vs. 68%), and most prefer to use DDM for space analysis in the future (59.4% compared to 21.7%).Undergraduate dental students perform better in orthodontic space analysis using DDM than PDM, achieving accurate results faster and with less assistance. Most students preferred PDM for learning and knowledge retention, but most preferred DDM for future use. CONCLUSIONS Undergraduate dental students perform better in orthodontic space analysis using DDM than PDM, achieving accurate results faster and with less assistance. Most students preferred PDM for learning and knowledge retention, but most preferred DDM for future use.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of a comprehensive pain science framework that includes integrated content, a standalone course, and training of core faculty in a physical therapist (PT) education program. The aim is to determine if this approach leads to significant changes in students' knowledge, beliefs, and confidence. INTRODUCTION This study investigates the impact of a comprehensive pain science framework that includes integrated content, a standalone course, and training of core faculty in a physical therapist (PT) education program. The aim is to determine if this approach leads to significant changes in students' knowledge, beliefs, and confidence.Recent studies have examined various implementation strategies for pain education in entry-level PT education programs, yielding mixed results in knowledge retention and changes in attitudes and beliefs. REVIEW OF LITERATURE Recent studies have examined various implementation strategies for pain education in entry-level PT education programs, yielding mixed results in knowledge retention and changes in attitudes and beliefs.Physical therapist students enrolled in a hybrid, accelerated program (n = 99). SUBJECTS Physical therapist students enrolled in a hybrid, accelerated program (n = 99).Before the program's start, core faculty members completed a pain science continuing education (CE) course. Pain science content was integrated throughout the curriculum, coupled with a standalone 2-credit-hour course. Data were collected using the revised Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire, the Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists, and the 5-question Pain Care Confidence Scale. A repeated-measure ANOVA was used to examine knowledge and beliefs, and a repeated t-test was used to examine confidence. METHODS Before the program's start, core faculty members completed a pain science continuing education (CE) course. Pain science content was integrated throughout the curriculum, coupled with a standalone 2-credit-hour course. Data were collected using the revised Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire, the Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists, and the 5-question Pain Care Confidence Scale. A repeated-measure ANOVA was used to examine knowledge and beliefs, and a repeated t-test was used to examine confidence.Students' pain knowledge fluctuated over time but showed an overall significant increase, with the largest increases occurring in the first 6 months of the integrated course curriculum (54-75%) and during the standalone pain science course (70-90%). The biomedical belief scores significantly decreased over time, while psychosocial belief scores fluctuated over time, with a significant overall increase by the end of the pain science course. Confidence scores significantly increased during the standalone pain science course, t(84) = -14.309, P < .001, d = -1.552. RESULTS Students' pain knowledge fluctuated over time but showed an overall significant increase, with the largest increases occurring in the first 6 months of the integrated course curriculum (54-75%) and during the standalone pain science course (70-90%). The biomedical belief scores significantly decreased over time, while psychosocial belief scores fluctuated over time, with a significant overall increase by the end of the pain science course. Confidence scores significantly increased during the standalone pain science course, t(84) = -14.309, P < .001, d = -1.552.This study examined the implementation of a pain science framework in 1 cohort and found significant changes in students' knowledge, beliefs, and confidence. This framework uniquely combined CE for core faculty, integrated pain education information throughout the curriculum, and culminated with a standalone pain science course. This study provides insight into effective comprehensive pain science education curriculum changes, which may help other PT programs model and analyze their pain science curriculum. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION This study examined the implementation of a pain science framework in 1 cohort and found significant changes in students' knowledge, beliefs, and confidence. This framework uniquely combined CE for core faculty, integrated pain education information throughout the curriculum, and culminated with a standalone pain science course. This study provides insight into effective comprehensive pain science education curriculum changes, which may help other PT programs model and analyze their pain science curriculum.

Abstract: The Kazakh people of Altay, Xinjiang, possess rich traditional knowledge associated with medicinal food plants (MFPs), shaped by their nomadic pastoralist heritage and the unique mountain-grassland ecosystems of the region. However, this biocultural heritage remains insufficiently documented and is increasingly threatened by human's economic activities, rapid globalization, climate change, and generational knowledge loss. This study aimed to record MFPs, evaluate their cultural and ecological relevance, and assess their conservation challenges. BACKGROUND The Kazakh people of Altay, Xinjiang, possess rich traditional knowledge associated with medicinal food plants (MFPs), shaped by their nomadic pastoralist heritage and the unique mountain-grassland ecosystems of the region. However, this biocultural heritage remains insufficiently documented and is increasingly threatened by human's economic activities, rapid globalization, climate change, and generational knowledge loss. This study aimed to record MFPs, evaluate their cultural and ecological relevance, and assess their conservation challenges.Ethnobotanical fieldwork was conducted in 2012 and 2017 across Altay Prefecture. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews with 100 key informants, including traditional healers, herders, and merchants, complemented by focal group discussions, field observations, and voucher specimen collection. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Herbarium of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ethnomedicine (XJNM). Use-value (UV) index was calculated to assess the relative importance of each species. Traditional knowledge, edible applications, and sustainability concerns were systematically documented. METHODS Ethnobotanical fieldwork was conducted in 2012 and 2017 across Altay Prefecture. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews with 100 key informants, including traditional healers, herders, and merchants, complemented by focal group discussions, field observations, and voucher specimen collection. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Herbarium of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ethnomedicine (XJNM). Use-value (UV) index was calculated to assess the relative importance of each species. Traditional knowledge, edible applications, and sustainability concerns were systematically documented.A total of 118 MFP species were identified, belonging to 37 families and 85 genera. Rosaceae (12.7%), Asteraceae (7.6%), Polygonaceae (7.6%) and Fabaceae (7.6%) were the most represented families. Herbaceous plants dominated (69.5%), with fruits (33.9%) and roots (20.3%) being the primary edible parts. Species with the highest medicinal UV included Glycyrrhiza uralensis (UV = 0.56), Taraxacum officinale (UV = 0.41), and Codonopsis pilosula (UV = 0.34). MFPs were primarily used to treat digestive (26.1%) and respiratory (17.7%) ailments, reflecting the health challenges associated with a nomadic lifestyle. These plants are also deeply embedded in cultural practices, including seasonal dietary customs (e.g., sea buckthorn jam), spiritual rituals, and ecological taboos such as phenology-based harvest timing. Key threats to MFPs sustainability include overharvesting (30.5% of species are now cultivated to mitigate pressure), climate change impacts on alpine habitats, and the erosion of traditional knowledge, as only 9% of informants with rich knowledge of MFPs were under the age of 30. RESULTS A total of 118 MFP species were identified, belonging to 37 families and 85 genera.

Sustainable utilization requires the incorporation of traditional knowledge-such as phenology-informed harvesting practices-into conservation strategies, the promotion of community-led cultivation of vulnerable species, and the documentation of associated cultural practices. Given accelerating environmental and sociocultural shifts, urgent efforts are needed to preserve this fragile biocultural heritage.

Abstract: The National Health Service Long-Term Workforce Plan calls for improving clinical pathways for surgery. Four wrist and hand surgeries, including carpal tunnel syndrome release, Dupuytren's contracture release, ganglion excision and trigger finger release, are described as procedures of limited clinical value and are included in the 2018 Evidence-based Interventions programme, as well as local guidance in Greater Manchester (GM). BACKGROUND The National Health Service Long-Term Workforce Plan calls for improving clinical pathways for surgery. Four wrist and hand surgeries, including carpal tunnel syndrome release, Dupuytren's contracture release, ganglion excision and trigger finger release, are described as procedures of limited clinical value and are included in the 2018 Evidence-based Interventions programme, as well as local guidance in Greater Manchester (GM).A pre-scoping exercise audit at a single musculoskeletal service in GM conducted from May 2021 to June 2023 highlighted that clinician compliance rates for these referrals were 15% below the service provider's internal national average and 25% below the service provider's internal national target, demonstrating the need for a quality improvement project. LOCAL PROBLEM A pre-scoping exercise audit at a single musculoskeletal service in GM conducted from May 2021 to June 2023 highlighted that clinician compliance rates for these referrals were 15% below the service provider's internal national average and 25% below the service provider's internal national target, demonstrating the need for a quality improvement project.The Model for Improvement was implemented using four Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. These cycles were executed over 14 weeks and aimed to improve compliance through educational sessions, clinical resources, interactive learning and practical tools. METHODS The Model for Improvement was implemented using four Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. These cycles were executed over 14 weeks and aimed to improve compliance through educational sessions, clinical resources, interactive learning and practical tools.The project comprised four PDSA cycles: PDSA 1 introduced educational sessions and case discussions, PDSA 2 implemented a clinical flowchart to guide decision-making, PDSA 3 included a knowledge retention quiz and PDSA 4 involved a repeat quiz and further discussions to consolidate learning. The target was to increase compliance rates from 70% to 85% or more. INTERVENTION The project comprised four PDSA cycles: PDSA 1 introduced educational sessions and case discussions, PDSA 2 implemented a clinical flowchart to guide decision-making, PDSA 3 included a knowledge retention quiz and PDSA 4 involved a repeat quiz and further discussions to consolidate learning. The target was to increase compliance rates from 70% to 85% or more.The project successfully improved compliance rates by 30%, with the final compliance rate reaching 100%, surpassing the service provider's internal national average and target, respectively. 100% compliance was achieved and sustained during PDSA 4 until the end of the project. Clinician confidence and quiz scores also increased during the intervention. RESULTS The project successfully improved compliance rates by 30%, with the final compliance rate reaching 100%, surpassing the service provider's internal national average and target, respectively. 100% compliance was achieved and sustained during PDSA 4 until the end of the project. Clinician confidence and quiz scores also increased during the intervention.Educational initiatives, combined with practical tools like clinical flowcharts and quizzes, significantly improved compliance rates. The project provides a scalable model that can be adapted by other community healthcare services to enhance compliance with orthopaedic referrals. CONCLUSIONS Educational initiatives, combined with practical tools like clinical flowcharts and quizzes, significantly improved compliance rates. The project provides a scalable model that can be adapted by other community healthcare services to enhance compliance with orthopaedic referrals.

Abstract: We examined whether practice testing enhances learning from persuasive texts and influences attitude change. In two online experiments, participants read texts on biodiversity loss (Study 1, n = 454) or wolf recolonization (Study 2, n = 400) and were assigned to one of three conditions: pretesting (guessing before reading), posttesting (retrieving after reading), or no-testing. Both testing conditions improved knowledge retention compared to no-testing, with no consistent differences between pre- and posttesting. Across all conditions, attitudes shifted in the expected direction-biodiversity loss was perceived as more severe, and wolf recolonization more positively after reading. However, neither testing condition led to greater attitude change than no-testing. A systematic association between final knowledge and attitude emerged only in the pretesting group, suggesting that generating responses before learning may have promoted attitude change in some individuals. These findings demonstrate that practice testing enhances knowledge acquisition from persuasive texts but does not reliably amplify attitude change. This suggests that while retrieval-based learning strengthens memory for persuasive content, additional factors may be required to translate knowledge gains into belief revision. Our results highlight the complex relationship between knowledge and attitudes and contribute to understanding the role of test-enhanced learning in persuasion.We examined whether practice testing enhances learning from persuasive texts and influences attitude change.

Abstract: Owing to a restricted network and limited time on the computer course, medical undergraduates in the curricula offered by our university demanded timely and high-quality feedback. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, intelligent tutoring systems can provide a solution. This article explored the main factors of AI feedback on teaching outcomes by employing a fine-tuned local language model. First-year medical students ( n  = 200) communicated with an AI tutor before and after the computer course this semester. After communicating with an AI tutor fine-tuned by specialized course learning content and five-year feedback dialogue, these students marked the AI tutor by filling in a structured questionnaire. Once the data were recorded, the PLS-SEM model explored the relations among these features. The results presented an apparent gap between AI and human tutor ( W  = 17.894, p  < 0.005). The model in PLS-SEM illustrated learning outcome was not highly consistent with AI tutor performance and student features (HTMT 0.314, 0.228, respectively), while AI tutor was rated higher in accuracy at 3.40 ( p  < 0.001). In conclusion, the AI tutor demonstrated potential to answer questions once the knowledge can be trained well. In the short learning term, an AI tutor can present much clearer feedback in a special course, and can be used as a quick intelligent notebook.Owing to a restricted network and limited time on the computer course, medical undergraduates in the curricula offered by our university demanded timely and high-quality feedback.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: In recent years, the use of gamification has been growing in health education. In undergraduate nursing programs, it aims to enhance motivation, engagement, knowledge retention, and professional competencies. However, the evidence often combining nursing students with other disciplines or focusing on specific tools rather than the broader concept. This systematic review will synthesize the impact of gamification strategies on educational outcomes in undergraduate nursing education. Methods: This protocol was written according to PRISMA-P guidelines and is registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251117719). Eligible studies will include randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, and observational designs involving undergraduate nursing students exposed to gamification interventions in classroom, online, or clinical training settings. Comparators may include traditional lecture-based instruction or other non-gamified methods. We will search the PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, covering January 2010 to July 2025, without language restrictions. Two reviewers will independently screen studies, extract data, and assess risk of bias using Cochrane RoB-2, ROBINS-I, and JBI Critical Appraisal Tools. Where possible, a meta-analysis will be conducted; otherwise, findings will be synthesized narratively. Results: Not applicable; this is a protocol. Findings will be synthesized as specified in the Methods. Conclusions: This review will provide a comprehensive synthesis of gamification's effectiveness in undergraduate nursing education, identifying the most effective strategies and the contexts in which they perform best.Background/Objectives: In recent years, the use of gamification has been growing in health education.

Abstract: The Instrumental Analytical Chemistry course, taught in the fifth semester across several programs at the Faculty of Exact Sciences of the National University of La Plata, places a significant emphasis on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This versatile analytical technique is essential for the separation, identification, and quantification of compounds in various matrices with widespread applications spanning analytical chemistry, biochemistry, pharmaceuticals, forensics, environmental science, and the food industry. Despite its importance, practical HPLC training faces challenges related to the expense of instrumentation and consumables, the significant time investment required for experiments, and the technical expertise needed for operation. To address these limitations, simulation software offers an effective approach to teaching the fundamental concepts of HPLC and demonstrating the influence of different variables on chromatographic separations. This study explores the use of the freely available Practical HPLC simulator v1.0 as a supplementary tool for hands-on HPLC activities in the regular curriculum. The pedagogical framework for the designed activities is Kolb's experiential learning theory, which guides a sequence involving an introductory session on the simulator's features and capabilities, followed by teacher-led group simulations and an evaluation of learning through individual and group problem-solving tasks. Initial findings from the implementation of the HPLC simulator indicate a notable enhancement in students' comprehension of the foundational principles of the technique. Furthermore, the simulator enriches practical HPLC exercises by providing clearer explanations, improving knowledge retention via practical engagement and increasing student motivation and interest, thereby fostering greater participation. In conclusion, this innovation offers a valuable and flexible tool for the comprehensive training of students by integrating theoretical knowledge, practical application, and problem-solving skills. Consequently, this initiative presents a significant opportunity to optimize student education in liquid chromatography, more effectively equipping students for future academic and professional endeavors.

Abstract: Histology requires visual literacy, which encompasses the ability to interpret, analyze, and create meaningful representations of microscopic structures. Learning by drawing enhances histological knowledge retention by reinforcing spatial awareness and pattern recognition. This study examines whether incorporating HistoSketch, a drawing game similar to Pictionary, increased drawing-based study behaviors among post-baccalaureate students enrolled in a graduate-level histology course. HistoSketch adapts the traditional board game's format by having participants draw histological structures, cellular processes, or clinical correlations while teammates attempt to identify them. The serious game was offered as an optional review session before two exams. Participants completed pre- and post-game questionnaires assessing study behaviors, attitudes toward drawing, and perceptions of the game's effectiveness. Scalar responses were analyzed quantitatively using paired t-tests, and free-text responses were analyzed using content analysis. Pre-game questionnaires indicated that most participants did not initially favor drawing as a study strategy. Post-game questionnaires revealed that participants perceived HistoSketch as helpful for identifying knowledge gaps (100%) and enhancing histology understanding (92%). While some participants planned to integrate drawing into their study strategies, others remained hesitant despite recognizing its utility. Our findings suggest that drawing-based games can enhance engagement and motivation in histology education and reinforce the importance of visual literacy skills.Histology requires visual literacy, which encompasses the ability to interpret, analyze, and create meaningful representations of microscopic structures.

Abstract: Written examinations are commonly used to assess learning. Different resources made available during testing (closed-note, open-note, and cheat-sheet) may influence student learning. The effect of resource availability on long-term knowledge application is unknown. Understanding the effects of exam resource availability on long-term knowledge application is needed, as application is essential in applied fields such as Occupational Therapy. To explore differences in short-term knowledge retention (course one overall score, midterm exam, and final exam) and long-term knowledge application (course two summative assessment) among occupational therapy students who had different types of exam resource availability during course one (closed-note, open-note, cheat-sheet). Data were extracted from four consecutive cohorts (n = 73) as they completed two sequential occupational therapy courses. Exam resource availability was the independent variable (k = 3), with course one midterm and final exams and overall course grade, and course two summative assessment grade as dependent variables. Kruskal-Wallis tests compared differences across conditions. Concerning short-term retention, no significant differences were observed between groups for course one midterm exam grade or overall course one grade. Course one final exam grades were significantly higher in the cheat sheet condition compared to closed note (3.9%, p = .009). Concerning long-term application as measured by the course two summative assessment grade, the closed note condition scored significantly higher than open note (6.25%, p = .01). No other comparisons were significantly different. In this sample we observed a small difference in short-term knowledge retention in favor of a cheat sheet condition and moderate difference in long-term application in favor of a closed note condition. While results suggest possible differences in performance across exam conditions, findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small, convenience-based sample. This exploratory analysis offers preliminary insights and identifies directions for future research on the pedagogical impact of exam design.Written examinations are commonly used to assess learning.

Abstract: Introduction Cancer remains a leading global health issue and has been the leading cause of death in Taiwan for over four decades. In recent years, ethnomedicines have gained growing attention as complementary therapies in cancer treatment. However, systematic investigations linking traditional medicinal practices with cancer remain limited. This study aims to explore the types, preparation methods, and parts used of anticancer ethnomedicines and cancer types across different regions in Taiwan through ethnobotanical surveys, and to preserve and transmit traditional knowledge. Methods Data were collected through questionnaire-based interviews with 210 participants, sampled proportionally by region, age, gender, and education based on national demographics. Results Chi-squared tests showed that only education level significantly influenced the number of anticancer ethnomedicines mentioned ( p < 0.001), suggesting that Taiwan’s policies promoting traditional medicine education may enhance knowledge retention. A total of 159 ethnomedicines were mentioned, with 146 plant species classified into 66 families, predominantly Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, and Fabaceae. The most commonly used plant parts were whole herba for herbaceous species, herba and radix for lianas, and leaves for trees and shrubs. Water decoction was the most frequently reported preparation method. The top ten mentioned ethnomedicines were traditionally used for a broader range of cancers than reported in the PubMed literature, especially for breast, lung, liver, and colorectal cancers, showing high consistency between traditional usage and modern scientific findings. Consensus factor analysis revealed high agreement among respondents regarding remedies for the ten most common cancers in Taiwan, except for prostate and oral cancers, possibly due to clinical treatment limitations or low questionnaire response rate. Taiwan’s cultural diversity, linguistic unity, and unique geographical environment facilitate the accurate and comprehensive collection of ethnomedicinal data, leading to more valuable research outcomes. Discussion In summary, the results of this study provide a valuable foundation for future anticancer research, serving as a priority focus for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms of anticancer activity. Moreover, this research supports the scientific development and potential drug discovery of ethnomedicines in modern cancer treatment, contributing to the integration of traditional knowledge with contemporary biomedical approaches.

Abstract: Background & objectives Hypertension, traditionally a significant health issue among adults, is now increasingly being observed in the paediatric population posing long-term cardiovascular risks. This study evaluated a school-based hypertension education intervention for adolescents and its impact on their hypertensive family members. Objectives included assessing adolescents' knowledge retention, knowledge transfer to adults, and the effects of child-led monitoring on adult compliance. Methods The study was conducted in two phases. In Phase 1, the study involved adolescents from classes 6-10 (n=423). Phase 1 assessed hypertension knowledge changes post-intervention from baseline scores across 6 interval points through 91 days using hypertension knowledge test (HKT). In Phase 2, adolescents and their hypertensive family members (n=181) were recruited in pairs. Changes in HKT, hypertension compliance (hypertension compliance scale: HyCompS), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were analysed pre- and post-intervention using paired t-tests. Adolescents tracked adult adherence via daily monitoring diaries, analysed descriptively. Results In Phase 1, adolescents showed significant and sustained improvements in hypertension knowledge despite minor dips on the 35th and 63rd days. In Phase 2, adults' knowledge improved significantly in overall and general awareness domains. Compliance increased, particularly for medication and lifestyle monitoring, with significant reduction in MAP. Children recorded high monitoring adherence-medication (77.6%), exercise (72%), and diet (66%). Interpretation & conclusions Adolescents can effectively serve as health advocates, promoting hypertension awareness and compliance within families. Structured school interventions may improve both adolescent and adult health outcomes. Longitudinal studies with larger samples are recommended.Background & objectives Hypertension, traditionally a significant health issue among adults, is now increasingly being observed in the paediatric population posing long-term cardiovascular risks.

Abstract: The growing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially Generative AI (GenAI), is revolutionising the way knowledge is handled and opening up enormous potential for corporate knowledge management (KM). The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLM) and complementary technologies such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) or knowledge graphs opens up new opportunities for corporate KM, but also presents companies with complex challenges and barriers. This study examines the integration of genAI into corporate KM, taking into account a holistic sociotechnical approach. A AI4KM survey was designed to capture the current state of AI use by asking companies about their use of AI technologies. The survey aims to gain insights into the practical implementation of AI solutions, particularly in relation to KM challenges. Based on the results of the AI4KM survey, a socio-technical TOP approach (Technology - Organisation - People) for the introduction of AI-based KM will be developed, which takes into account not only technical, but also organisational and people-related aspects. By addressing these three factors, the study aims to provide a comprehensive framework that ensures the successful adoption of AI technologies in diverse business environments. Specific recommendations for the development of an effective, holistic AI strategy in KM are developed for the various barriers. Among other things, the importance of human-machine interaction will be emphasised in order to create a seamless link between human expertise and machine intelligence. The results of these studies should help companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), to effectively use genAI technologies for their KM, to counteract the loss of knowledge due to demographic change and to increase their competitiveness. The combination of theoretical findings and practical recommendations will build a bridge between research and business practice, contributing to the successful integration of AI into corporate KM and equipping companies for the challenges of the future.

A Resource-Based View Framework for Knowledge Risk Management in SMEs

Author: Mamorobela, Stevens Phaphadi1; Phaladi, Malefetjane Phineas21 University of South Africa, Gauteng, South Africa2 Durban University of Technology, South Africa

Abstract: Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) face a significant challenge of knowledge loss due to their inability to implement Knowledge Risk Management (KRM) strategies effectively, which ultimately negatively affects their competitiveness and sustainability. The modern nature of work causes an over-reliance on technology to perform remote work, conduct organisational collaboration and exchange knowledge assets, which poses risks associated with knowledge exposure and loss for SMEs. Given that SMEs are resource constrained, they put little effort into risk management strategies that can potentially save them from losing their most critical knowledge. This study proposes a Resource-Based View framework (RBV) for SMEs to leverage internal resources and capabilities to mitigate the risks related to knowledge loss. A systematic literature review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) to analyse academic publications from the past ten years (2014-2024) in order to identify key trends, challenges and strategies related to KRM, RBV and SMEs. Thematic analysis was applied to analyse the selected articles, with three themes emerging, namely the role of intellectual capital in mitigating knowledge risks; technological interventions for knowledge protection; and organizational culture's impact on knowledge-sharing and security. SMEs struggle with managing intellectual capital, implementing technological interventions for knowledge retention, protection and sharing due to limited resources. Their approach to knowledge-sharing is unstructured and formal processes are less frequently implemented. However, organizations that integrate KRM effectively demonstrate greater resilience, sustainability and competitive advantage. The results underscore the need for SMEs to develop structured KRM frameworks aligned with their resource capabilities. This research bridges the gap between RBV and KRM, providing insights for SME managers to manage knowledge loss risks and enhance long-term sustainability. Future research should explore empirical case studies to validate the findings and proposed framework of this paper.

Abstract: Organizations often have several generations working with them at the same time. Without an effective strategy experienced workers of older generations will leave the organizations taking with them a precious amount of relevant knowledge and skills. What do organizations currently do to support tacit knowledge transfer from Seniors to Juniors? Which formats have been proven to be especially successful? What Key Performance Indicators (KPI) could be used to evaluate cost and benefit of Tacit Knowledge Transfer across generations? Decision-makers faced with a potentially critical amount of tacit knowledge loss due to retiring senior experts are applying different solutions and strategies to overcome this problem, while encountering the challenge to measure and quantify the outcomes. Our research revealed that a gap exists regarding the balancing of the investment and compelling business cases for transferring tacit knowledge from senior to junior employees. We offer Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) with financial and social perspectives that may be applied to guide the enterprise. To achieve this, we conducted a thorough analysis and literature review to evaluate the business cases behind different formats of intergenerational knowledge transfer. Various studies have looked at the methodology behind intergenerational knowledge transfer: we analyzed publications that approach this matter from an organizational perspective including the start-up and Business Angel environment and a further stream of publications that look at the perspective of the individuals involved. Even though organizations are increasingly creative and willing to keep senior experts on board beyond legal retirement age the cost/benefit question is difficult to answer. The analyzed literature regarding Serious Games as one format for intergenerational tacit knowledge transfer was often based on small sample groups or specific needs of an organization or industry. The authors writing about Serious Games agreed that transferability was limited. Their contributions are nonetheless significant as the data collected in pilot projects is invaluable in any decision-taking process for potentially larger scale operations. Based on the current need to balance spending and ensure knowledge continuity our study contributes with novel KPIs and success factors for intergenerational knowledge transfer that can help decision makers in building a business case and steering their investments. The KPIs depend on desired outcomes such as Interpersonal Trust and Increased Efficiency - and therefore we see KPIs such as Quality of Relationships and Skill Improvement Score. KPIs also depend on Expected Investments such as Buying Lost Knowledge (e.g., involving rehiring retirees, or external consultants).

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to propose and test a new measuring scale for the concept of "knowledge vulnerabilities". With this research, we are continuing our work on a research project concerning knowledge risks and knowledge vulnerabilities that can manifest in organizations, alongside knowledge processes. In the context of a scarce literature concerning knowledge vulnerabilities, this research adds value by understanding and measuring knowledge vulnerabilities, as weak points of the knowledge system and of the knowledge management routines that could trigger or facilitate the appearance of risks, exposing the organization to threats. In this paper, we present an instrument for measuring knowledge vulnerabilities related to the knowledge processes within an organization, in the form of a questionnaire. This instrument is developed starting from a previously tested instrument, with 21 items, proposed by Neștian and Guță (2023). The new instrument contains 42 items, with newly developed items reflecting a deeper understanding of knowledge vulnerabilities. The taxonomy for knowledge vulnerabilities is based on a recent perspective of organizational knowledge dynamics (Bratianu, Neștian and Guță, 2022). In this research, seven knowledge processes are considered and vulnerabilities related to them are proposed: vulnerabilities related to knowledge creation, vulnerabilities related to knowledge acquisition, vulnerabilities related to knowledge loss, vulnerabilities related to knowledge sharing, vulnerabilities related to knowledge use, vulnerabilities related to emotional knowledge dynamics and vulnerabilities related to spiritual knowledge dynamics. The questionnaire has been applied in private companies, on both managers and non-managers. Principal components analysis was undertaken to highlight the components forming the construct of vulnerabilities related to knowledge processes. The factors resulting from applying the statistical method of principal components analysis on the data collected with this improved questionnaire are composed starting from a larger number of items and are better aligned with the theoretical perspective used, compared with the questionnaire developed in 2023 by Neștian and Guță. The items of the questionnaire loaded in the principal components can be used for relevant future studies on knowledge vulnerabilities. The resulting components offer a better picture regarding the conceptualization of the notion of vulnerabilities associated with knowledge processes.

Abstract: The study investigated the role of Human Resource Management (HRM) in building Knowledge Management (KM) capacity in South African public sector enterprises. Research shows that HRM divisions' role in building knowledge management capacity in Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) is underdeveloped and they face common challenges such as tacit knowledge loss risks, leading to criticism of HRM for not effectively fostering knowledge-driven organisational practices and cultures. In order to address this gap, this paper explored the perception of HRM's role in building knowledge management capabilities; the extent to which HRM supports Knowledge Management in PSEs; the close collaboration between HR managers and knowledge management practitioners; and key practices that enhance knowledge management capabilities in these enterprises. The study utilised a qualitative research design, conducting in-depth interviews with 20 human resource (HR) managers from 9 public sector enterprises in South Africa. The interview data was analysed for its thematic content using Atlas.ti. Human Resource Management plays a crucial role in knowledge management, particularly in public sector enterprises in the South African economy, albeit with some serious shortcomings. However, it is often considered last in the process due to a lack of understanding of the philosophy behind knowledge management, as well as a lack of synergy between HRM and KM functions. Nevertheless, on a positive note, HR managers believe that their practices can enhance knowledge management capability in public sector enterprises by facilitating critical processes like knowledge acquisition, application, sharing, and retention, regardless of whether they have a Knowledge Management function. The researcher recommends implementing knowledge-oriented HRM methods in South African public sector enterprises to improve knowledge management efficiency and capacity development. This paper may pave the way for future research in the field of knowledge management on a more thorough examination of the connections between HRM and KM in PSEs in South Africa and, more generally, in developing economies, since the impact or function of HRM on KM capacity has not been extensively empirically studied in the South African public sector.

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between the adoption of algorithmic recommendation tools and experiential learning. We argue that the adoption of an algorithmic recommendation tool will harm experiential learning in organizations by limiting knowledge retention and retrieval. We further argue that the adverse relationship between algorithmic tool adoption and experiential learning will be stronger in organizations operating in low-task-difficulty environments than those in high-task-difficulty ones because organizational members in such organizations are likely to rely more on algorithmic recommendations, experiencing higher skill erosion. In addition, the relationship will be stronger in organizations facing low task variety than in those with high task variety, as these organizations are likely to have more rigid routines and in turn experience higher routine disruption after adopting an algorithmic tool. We utilize data on the adoption of an algorithmic tool called a clinical decision support system (CDSS) in a sample of emergency departments in California and utilize a fixed-effects panel regression with control function to test our arguments. We find that the relationship between cumulative experience and mortality becomes significantly weaker after CDSS adoption, suggesting flatter learning curves. We also find evidence that the effect is moderated by task difficulty and task variety.

Abstract: The use of an escape room format for teaching podiatric surgery principles in residency programs offers a unique and engaging approach to surgical education. The escape room format of immersing residents in a simulated environment encourages active participation and problem-solving skills. BACKGROUND The use of an escape room format for teaching podiatric surgery principles in residency programs offers a unique and engaging approach to surgical education. The escape room format of immersing residents in a simulated environment encourages active participation and problem-solving skills.Through carefully designed scenarios, residents are challenged to apply their knowledge of podiatric surgery principles, critical-thinking abilities, and decision-making skills to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles within a time-constrained setting. The collaborative nature of escape rooms promotes teamwork and effective communication among residents, simulating the interprofessional dynamics often encountered in surgical settings. Furthermore, the realistic simulation provided by the escape room format allows residents to practice surgical techniques, enhance their intraoperative skills, and develop a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in podiatric surgery. METHODS Through carefully designed scenarios, residents are challenged to apply their knowledge of podiatric surgery principles, critical-thinking abilities, and decision-making skills to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles within a time-constrained setting.

Furthermore, the realistic simulation provided by the escape room format allows residents to practice surgical techniques, enhance their intraoperative skills, and develop a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in podiatric surgery.This innovative approach has the potential to enhance resident engagement, knowledge retention, and overall surgical competency, ultimately contributing to the delivery of high-quality patient care in the field of podiatry. RESULTS This innovative approach has the potential to enhance resident engagement, knowledge retention, and overall surgical competency, ultimately contributing to the delivery of high-quality patient care in the field of podiatry.The purpose of our study was to highlight the benefits of combining the escape room format with the use of cadavers for teaching podiatric surgery principles to residents and students in a residency setting. CONCLUSIONS The purpose of our study was to highlight the benefits of combining the escape room format with the use of cadavers for teaching podiatric surgery principles to residents and students in a residency setting.

Abstract: The England Football Association's (The FA) Safeguarding Strategy outlines steps to build an ever‐safer culture at every level of football. Critical to this is the safeguarding children training The FA provides to people working or volunteering in football. Safeguarding training is part of a safety management system that is influential in creating a safeguarding culture in sport. Hence, evaluation is needed to ascertain if the training is serving its purpose and contributing to building the ever‐safe culture in football. The aim of this study was to evaluate learners' perspectives who completed this safeguarding training and its impact on broader safeguarding culture. Data were collected through a survey ( n  = 1573) and semistructured interviews ( n  = 20) based on Kirkpatrick's Model of Training Evaluation. On average, learners were satisfied with online delivery where learners gained confidence and knowledge retention. However, additional factors beyond training contributed to learners' confidence and the application of safeguarding within their role (e.g., football and work experience), showing how safeguarding culture is a multifaceted collaboration where safeguarding training is an important component. Recommendations are provided to optimise and promote continued safeguarding learning and creating ever‐safer football.

Abstract: Board games and gamification - the application of game-like elements to non-game contexts - have emerged as promising strategies in healthcare for enhancing education, promoting behavioral change, and fostering social interaction. While traditionally used for entertainment, these tools are increasingly being investigated as therapeutic and diagnostic interventions across the lifespan. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the use of board games in patient education, diagnosis, and treatment among pediatric, adult, elderly, and mixed-age populations. Literature was examined across preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic domains. The results reveal that in elderly populations, board games have demonstrated potential in maintaining cognitive health, aiding early diagnosis of cognitive impairment, and supporting individuals with mild cognitive decline, as well as increasing physical activity in nursing home residents. In adults, evidence supports benefits in preventive health education (e.g., osteoporosis, palliative care), chronic disease management, psychiatric symptom reduction, and post-surgical rehabilitation. In pediatric populations, board games have been used to improve knowledge and behaviors related to viral disease prevention, nutrition, chronic disease self-management, emotional competency, and pre-operative anxiety, with emerging evidence for attention-deficit hyperactivity disease (ADHD) symptom management. Mixed-age group interventions include risk factor modification for sexually transmitted infections, alcohol and tobacco use reduction. Across studies, board games often enhanced engagement, knowledge retention, motivation, and psychosocial well-being, though effects on long-term clinical outcomes were less consistent. In conclusion. board games represent safe, versatile, and culturally adaptable tools for health promotion, diagnosis, and therapy. While short-term benefits in knowledge, engagement, and psychosocial outcomes are well documented, evidence for sustained clinical impact is limited. Further large-scale, methodologically rigorous studies are warranted to optimize game design for specific health objectives and evaluate long-term efficacy.Board games and gamification - the application of game-like elements to non-game contexts - have emerged as promising strategies in healthcare for enhancing education, promoting behavioral change, and fostering social interaction.

Abstract: Background The A-E (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure) assessment is a systematic approach used for the primary assessment of critically injured patients, and is often taught through simulation-based learning methods. The introduction of new educational methods, such as escape rooms, may be used to enhance engagement, teamwork, and educational value.  Objectives The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the conventional A-E simulation format with an escape room-style A-E simulation format in enhancing medical students' engagement, teamwork, and educational value. Methods We conducted a qualitative study involving 19 undergraduate medical students, with nine allocated to the traditional simulation group and 10 to the escape room simulation group. The participants from the traditional simulation group and the escape room simulation group were further divided into three subgroups, with each group being assigned one of the following clinical scenarios: opioid overdose, sepsis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Pre- and post-session questionnaires were used to assess engagement, teamwork, and educational value. Results Thematic analysis revealed four key themes: engagement and realism, teamwork and communication, clinical reasoning, and knowledge retention and enhanced learning. Escape room participants found the escape-style clinical scenarios to be more immersive and enjoyable in comparison to the traditional simulation group. The escape room-style simulation showed overall favourable reviews across the four key themes identified. Conclusion Escape room-style simulation is a highly engaging and interactive alternative to traditional A-E simulation in undergraduate medical education. It promotes learner engagement, teamwork, and clinical reasoning while maintaining educational rigour. Though more resource-intensive to develop, it holds promise as an effective adjunct for teaching A-E assessments.Background The A-E (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure) assessment is a systematic approach used for the primary assessment of critically injured patients, and is often taught through simulation-based learning methods.

Abstract:  Traditional mannequin-based simulation has been previously demonstrated to be a versatile and effective modality for the education of trainees in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). Unfortunately, creating and maintaining high-fidelity mannequin simulations is resource-intensive. Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging alternative to traditional high-fidelity mannequin simulation for medical education. A previous pilot study by these authors delineated the feasibility of VR in the CICU for the diagnosis and management of patients with hemodynamic compromise. This study sought to compare VR to classic mannequin simulations. BACKGROUND  Traditional mannequin-based simulation has been previously demonstrated to be a versatile and effective modality for the education of trainees in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). Unfortunately, creating and maintaining high-fidelity mannequin simulations is resource-intensive. Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging alternative to traditional high-fidelity mannequin simulation for medical education. A previous pilot study by these authors delineated the feasibility of VR in the CICU for the diagnosis and management of patients with hemodynamic compromise. This study sought to compare VR to classic mannequin simulations. This prospective, single-center study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of a quaternary pediatric center and conducted from September to December of 2021. Four common CICU patient scenarios were developed for both VR and mannequins, including supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), postoperative hypotension after a Norwood procedure, pulmonary hypertensive crisis, and apnea with bradycardia. The VR logic was created by the authors, and the programming was completed by SimX (Mountain View, California, USA). Pediatric cardiology and advanced cardiac critical care fellows completed the first two simulations using either VR or mannequins and then crossed over to complete the last two simulations on the other modality. Fellows were assessed on their completion of a critical action checklist for each scenario as well as by an eight-question post-simulation knowledge test. The average number of checklist items completed was calculated for both mannequin and VR-based scenarios, stratified by type of simulation and year of fellowship.

Overall, the average number of checklist items completed and post-test score increased with each postgraduate year. When comparing the overall number of checklist items completed for all of the simulations between mannequin and VR, there was no significant difference in the means ( p = 0.463). On average, fellows completed two to three out of five critical actions, and the average post-test score was 87%. Fellow questionnaires reflected an interest in VR, a lack of previous VR experience, and a general feeling that VR was more immersive than mannequin simulation. The most common complaint by participants was mild nausea. RESULTS  A total of 14 fellows completed the study.

Abstract: Gamification and serious gaming have emerged as alternative approaches in learning and decision-making across various domains. In maritime education and the inland waterways sector, where traditional methods may fall short in engaging learners effectively, the development of tailored serious games presents a unique opportunity. This research assesses the educational value of a serious game designed for the maritime industry and inland waterways. The game was developed through a systematic process involving a literature review, stakeholder consultations, and expert input. The methodology included iterative design, user testing, and feedback collection from participants across various sectors. The game features tasks simulating port operations, equipment handling, and inland navigation, followed by quizzes to reinforce learning. Data analysis was performed to evaluate user engagement, knowledge retention, and satisfaction levels. Evaluation results indicate high user engagement, improved knowledge retention, and participant satisfaction. This research underlines the potential of serious games in maritime education, offering innovative solutions to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, thereby maximizing learning outcomes and preparing individuals comprehensively for the challenges of the maritime industry and inland waterways sector.

Enhancing Criminology and Criminal Justice Education Through Experiential Learning: Insights and Implications: JCJE

Author: Kakar, Suman11 Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA

Publication info: Kakar, Suman. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/enhancing-criminology-criminal-justice-education/docview/3257976934/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Criminology and Criminal Justice (CCJ) education is evolving to meet the changing landscape of crime, criminal justice policies, and workforce needs. While traditional teaching methods effectively provide foundational knowledge, they may not fully prepare students with the practical skills needed to tackle real-world challenges leading to concerns about career readiness and declining enrollments. To address this gap, experiential learning has gained traction, emphasizing hands-on approaches such as internships, field trips, and service-learning. However, these methods face challenges related to accessibility and scalability. This study examines innovative and scalable experiential learning techniques—such as professional opinion surveys on crime theories, reflective response analysis, crime vignette analysis, and evaluations—within CCJ courses. Data collected from 150 students over four semesters reveal that these strategies expand student engagement, knowledge retention, and workforce preparedness. Although preliminary, the findings underscore the value of implementing creative experiential learning strategies to ensure CCJ education remains responsive to the evolving needs of the field and better prepares students for the profession.

Abstract: Introduction Clinical teachers are vital to the quality of the trainee learning environment. However, many of them undertake teaching roles without formal training. Time constraints and geographic distance of preceptors from central academic campuses may be barriers to such training. The University of North Carolina (UNC) School of Medicine (SOM)'s Academy of Educators (AOE) aimed to address these gaps through the development of AOE Essentials online training modules.  Methods AOE Essentials consists of three asynchronous, self-paced modules designed for clinical preceptors across six clinical sites in North Carolina. A diverse group of 22 faculty members developed the modules, which cover topics such as setting expectations, completing evaluations, and providing effective feedback. Each module includes embedded videos, diagnostic quizzes, and pre- and post-tests of satisfaction and knowledge gain for assessment. Knowledge gain in each module is assessed by four to five multiple-choice, one-best-answer questions for each quiz that were initially designed by each module's faculty and subsequently reviewed by study authors with expertise in medical education scholarship generally and survey methodology specifically. Three separate questions assessing the quality/quantity of information and clarity of visual information were adapted from the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS).  Results To date, 254 modules have been completed by faculty. The Expectations module (n = 104) was completed at higher rates than Evaluations (n = 71) or Feedback (n = 79) models. Analysis revealed significant improvements in pre-post knowledge scores for the Expectations (p<0.001) and Evaluation (p<0.001) modules. The Feedback module showed no significant change (p = 0.398), though this may have been limited by the ceiling effect and potential prior knowledge in this area. Participant feedback indicated high satisfaction, with average ratings ranging from 4.47 to 4.7 for content relevance and clarity. Additionally, 97% of participants would recommend the modules to colleagues.  Conclusions AOE Essentials represents a novel asynchronous, multi-site faculty development program specifically designed for geographically dispersed clinical preceptors, demonstrating measurable knowledge gains and high participant satisfaction. Limitations of this study include completion of the evaluation immediately after completion of the modules, thus only assessing immediate knowledge gains, as well as concerns about a possible ceiling effect for some participants, limiting the ability to determine knowledge acquisition during the module. Future initiatives will explore knowledge retention of participants at three to six months, creation of additional training modules, and the potential for mandatory training for preceptors. Despite its limitations, this program may serve as a template for other institutions facing similar challenges in faculty development.Introduction Clinical teachers are vital to the quality of the trainee learning environment.

Abstract: The England Football Association's (The FA) Safeguarding Strategy outlines steps to build an ever‐safer culture at every level of football. Critical to this is the safeguarding children training The FA provides to people working or volunteering in football. Safeguarding training is part of a safety management system that is influential in creating a safeguarding culture in sport. Hence, evaluation is needed to ascertain if the training is serving its purpose and contributing to building the ever‐safe culture in football. The aim of this study was to evaluate learners' perspectives who completed this safeguarding training and its impact on broader safeguarding culture. Data were collected through a survey ( n = 1573) and semistructured interviews ( n = 20) based on Kirkpatrick's Model of Training Evaluation. On average, learners were satisfied with online delivery where learners gained confidence and knowledge retention. However, additional factors beyond training contributed to learners' confidence and the application of safeguarding within their role (e.g., football and work experience), showing how safeguarding culture is a multifaceted collaboration where safeguarding training is an important component. Recommendations are provided to optimise and promote continued safeguarding learning and creating ever‐safer football.

Abstract: Improving student engagement in engineering education is crucial for better learning outcomes. Engineering education integrates the latest technologies with gamification that fosters student engagement in innovative learning. Gamification involves incorporating game design elements, making learning more interactive and motivating. This paper explores gamification to transform engineering education, improving students' participation, understanding, and overall learning outcomes. Combining Edge computing with artificial intelligence will enhance the gamification of education by addressing two primary challenges: real‐time interaction and personalized service. An Edge‐AI‐driven gamification framework is proposed for improving student engagement through interactive tools like educational games, quizzes, and competitive learning environments. An algorithm related to the Edge‐AI Gamification Optimizer is proposed to improve the overall performance. Results show that the proposed framework improves student engagement by nearly 51%, performance by 30.7% and reduces cognitive load by 57%. A comparative study with traditional learning approaches shows that AI‐based gamification significantly enhances knowledge retention, boosts collaborative learning, increases student motivation, and, through statistical analysis, demonstrates a validated increase in student engagement over conventional methods. Future studies will investigate the extendability of this framework to different fields of engineering and learning environments. The proposed framework has the potential to transform educational practices by providing personalized, interactive, and motivating learning experiences, leading to better educational outcomes. Future research could explore broader applications and long‐term impacts of Edge‐AI‐driven gamification.

Abstract: Intelligent manufacturing training rooms are pivotal for translating theoretical knowledge into practical applications and enhancing operational skills. To address the limitations of traditional teaching models—specifically their inability to facilitate large‐scale, complex, or high‐risk professional experiments, which result in insufficient comprehensive practical training for students—this study introduces an augmented reality (AR)‐based intelligent manufacturing comprehensive teaching and training system (AR‐IMCTTS). The system establishes an integrated framework for teaching, hands‐on practice, and assessment, enabling students to master the knowledge and production processes of intelligent manufacturing equipment comprehensively. Three aspects of experimental verification were conducted. First, questionnaire results indicate that students widely acknowledge the system's effectiveness in deepening their understanding of IM equipment operations and improving practical skills. Second, quantitative data reveal that students using AR‐IMCTTS achieved an average score increase of 10.82% compared to traditional teaching methods. Third, results demonstrate that the hybrid approach of traditional education and AR‐IMCTTS significantly enhances participants' learning motivation and practical knowledge retention. Through interactive engagement with virtual objects in AR environments, students develop a profound grasp of experimental equipment. Simultaneously, the experimental group's increased practice opportunities boost learning confidence and reduce cognitive load.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes is a growing concern among young adults, including college students, due to rates of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and limited disease awareness. Despite the risk, few studies have examined the effectiveness of targeted educational interventions among this population. To determine whether a pharmacy student-led educational session improves knowledge, retention, and motivation for behavior change related to type 2 diabetes prevention among undergraduate students. A group of third-year pharmacy students conducted 30-minute interactive educational sessions on a college campus in North Carolina. The sessions covered risk factors, prevention strategies, and healthy behaviors using slides, interactive questions, and video clips. Participants completed a presurvey, immediate postsurvey, and a 2- to 3-month follow-up survey assessing knowledge and self-reported behaviors. A paired t test and ANOVA with post hoc analysis evaluated changes in knowledge over time. Sixty-four students completed both the pre- and postsurveys. Knowledge scores significantly improved from pre- to postsurvey (7.0 ± 1.6 to 9.7 ± 1.4; P < 0.001). Of the 17 students completing the follow-up survey, knowledge remained significantly higher than baseline (pre: 6.4 ± 1.27; post: 8.7 ± 1.31; follow-up: 9.9 ± 2.28; P < 0.001). Participants reported increased motivation to adopt healthier behaviors, such as physical activity, improved nutrition using the Plate Method, and adequate sleep. An interactive, pharmacy student-led educational session significantly improved college students' knowledge and motivation to reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Tailored, engaging outreach may be an effective strategy to address early prevention in at-risk college populations.

Abstract: Background and Aims Regional anaesthesia is crucial for modern healthcare, offering significant benefits when performed safely and effectively. A comprehensive understanding and proficiency in various techniques, risks, and recognition of complications is essential for ensuring patient safety. However, conventional teacher-centered education of clinicians has been proven inefficient in securing long-term knowledge retention. The aim of this study is to determine whether scenario-based learning improves long-term knowledge retention of regional anaesthesia. Methods Anaesthesia residents were invited to a one-day workshop on regional anaesthesia. Before the workshop, participants completed a multiple-choice exam on regional anaesthesia. They then engaged in six scenario-based learning cases, each following a structured format and concluding with a debriefing session led by an ESRA-certified instructor. To assess knowledge retention, participants completed the same exam immediately after the workshop and again three months later. Results A total of 36 students were included in the study. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a statistically significant improvement immediately after the simulation (median 63% vs. 70% of correct answers, p < 0.001), indicating a strong learning effect. However, no significant difference was observed between the post-workshop and three-month follow-up scores (p = 0.503), suggesting that the knowledge gains were retained over time. Conclusions Scenario-based training appears to be an effective pedagogical approach for enhancing and sustaining residents’ knowledge retention over time; however, further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/teacher-perceptions-gamifications-influence-on/docview/3243266691/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: This study investigated teachers' perceptions on the impact of gamification on student engagement and learning outcomes in Nigerian primary schools, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional teaching methods and contemporary learner needs. A mixed‐methods approach was utilised, involving quantitative and qualitative data collection through an online survey distributed to 82 primary school teachers. The results revealed that most of the respondents incorporated gamification techniques weekly, with badges and points being the most frequently used elements. Gamification was most commonly applied in Maths, followed by English, Science and other subjects. Teachers perceived significant positive impacts on academic achievement, student participation and knowledge retention, though challenges such as lack of technological resources, curriculum alignment, scepticism from stakeholders, and insufficient teacher training were highlighted. Thematic analysis of qualitative data identified themes related to enhancing problem‐solving abilities, catering to diverse learning styles and fostering healthy competition. Despite challenges, the study found unanimous support for gamification, with teachers willing to undergo further professional development. The findings suggest that gamification holds promise for transforming educational environments in Nigerian primary schools by promoting active engagement, motivation, and improved academic performance, although addressing technological and training barriers remains crucial.

Abstract: To assess the longitudinal impact of using mnemonics in a pharmacology course for second-year pharmacy PharmD students on their exam performance and perceptions of mnemonics' helpfulness in knowledge retention and application in clinical settings. OBJECTIVE To assess the longitudinal impact of using mnemonics in a pharmacology course for second-year pharmacy PharmD students on their exam performance and perceptions of mnemonics' helpfulness in knowledge retention and application in clinical settings.Thirteen mnemonics were taught in a pharmacology course covering endocrine and autonomic pharmacology topics in the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 academic years. A nonanonymous survey was administered after exams to gather students' self-reported use of mnemonics to answer exam questions. On the end-of-semester anonymous course evaluation, students rated the impact of using mnemonics on their knowledge retention, application, critical thinking, learning anxiety, and confidence when answering exam questions. To longitudinally evaluate students' perceptions of mnemonics' effectiveness, an anonymous follow-up survey was administered to the same student cohort at the end of a Therapeutics course, 5 months later. METHODS Thirteen mnemonics were taught in a pharmacology course covering endocrine and autonomic pharmacology topics in the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 academic years. A nonanonymous survey was administered after exams to gather students' self-reported use of mnemonics to answer exam questions. On the end-of-semester anonymous course evaluation, students rated the impact of using mnemonics on their knowledge retention, application, critical thinking, learning anxiety, and confidence when answering exam questions. To longitudinally evaluate students' perceptions of mnemonics' effectiveness, an anonymous follow-up survey was administered to the same student cohort at the end of a Therapeutics course, 5 months later.Mnemonics use significantly improved students' exam performance on 6 of 14 exam questions based on mnemonics-linked concepts. Students reported that using mnemonics improved their knowledge retention and clinical application (98.21% in 2020-2021; 97.56% in 2021-2022), enhanced critical thinking (89.29% in 2020-2021; 87.80% in 2021-2022), increased confidence during test-taking (96.43% in 2020-2021; 90.24% in 2021-2022), and reduced learning anxiety (80.36% in 2020-2021; 60.97% in 2021-2022). The longitudinal survey validated initial perceptions survey findings and reaffirmed that students find mnemonics memorable when they aid in comprehending and organizing concepts. RESULTS Mnemonics use significantly improved students' exam performance on 6 of 14 exam questions based on mnemonics-linked concepts. Students reported that using mnemonics improved their knowledge retention and clinical application (98.21% in 2020-2021; 97.56% in 2021-2022), enhanced critical thinking (89.29% in 2020-2021; 87.80% in 2021-2022), increased confidence during test-taking (96.43% in 2020-2021; 90.24% in 2021-2022), and reduced learning anxiety (80.36% in 2020-2021; 60.97% in 2021-2022). The longitudinal survey validated initial perceptions survey findings and reaffirmed that students find mnemonics memorable when they aid in comprehending and organizing concepts.Mnemonic use enhances students' exam performance, and students perceive mnemonics as promoting knowledge retention, application, critical thinking, confidence during test-taking, and reduced learning anxiety. CONCLUSION Mnemonic use enhances students' exam performance, and students perceive mnemonics as promoting knowledge retention, application, critical thinking, confidence during test-taking, and reduced learning anxiety.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes is a growing concern among young adults, including college students, due to rates of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and limited disease awareness. Despite the risk, few studies have examined the effectiveness of targeted educational interventions among this population. To determine whether a pharmacy student-led educational session improves knowledge, retention, and motivation for behavior change related to type 2 diabetes prevention among undergraduate students. A group of third-year pharmacy students conducted 30-minute interactive educational sessions on a college campus in North Carolina. The sessions covered risk factors, prevention strategies, and healthy behaviors using slides, interactive questions, and video clips. Participants completed a presurvey, immediate postsurvey, and a 2- to 3-month follow-up survey assessing knowledge and self-reported behaviors. A paired t test and ANOVA with post hoc analysis evaluated changes in knowledge over time. Sixty-four students completed both the pre- and postsurveys. Knowledge scores significantly improved from pre- to postsurvey (7.0 ± 1.6 to 9.7 ± 1.4; P < 0.001). Of the 17 students completing the follow-up survey, knowledge remained significantly higher than baseline (pre: 6.4 ± 1.27; post: 8.7 ± 1.31; follow-up: 9.9 ± 2.28; P < 0.001). Participants reported increased motivation to adopt healthier behaviors, such as physical activity, improved nutrition using the Plate Method, and adequate sleep. An interactive, pharmacy student-led educational session significantly improved college students' knowledge and motivation to reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Tailored, engaging outreach may be an effective strategy to address early prevention in at-risk college populations. NEW & NOTEWORTHY A pharmacy student-led educational initiative improved college students' knowledge and motivation related to type 2 diabetes prevention. Through interactive 30-minute sessions covering risk factors and healthy behaviors, participants showed marked gains in knowledge immediately and sustained at 2-3 months. Students also reported lifestyle changes, including improved diet, increased physical activity, and better sleep. This peer-delivered approach highlights the potential of tailored, engaging outreach to promote early prevention in at-risk young adult populations.Type 2 diabetes is a growing concern among young adults, including college students, due to rates of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and limited disease awareness.

Abstract: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a powerful diagnostic tool that combines image acquisition with bedside interpretation, enabling physicians to make rapid diagnoses at the bedside (1). Over the last decade, the popularity of POCUS has surged because of its versatility and the immediate insights it provides in clinical decision making (1). However, basic POCUS does not provide important hemodynamic information, such as intracardiac pressures, stroke volume, or valvular regurgitation assessment. Critical care echocardiography (CCE) becomes indispensable as a specialized application of POCUS focused on using Doppler techniques to provide detailed hemodynamic assessments in critically ill patients (2). Teaching hemodynamic evaluation in CCE, such as estimating right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), is a challenging yet essential aspect of modern critical care education. RVSP is used to assess the presence of pathologic elevation in right ventricular afterload, which has significant clinical implications for critically ill patients. Deriving RVSP requires understanding ultrasound physics, fluid mechanics, and Doppler techniques and mastery of cardiac image acquisition (3-4). These complex skills are not just important but crucial for effectively managing critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). In this edition of "How I Teach," we introduce our methodology for instructing learners in our ICU on RVSP estimation using CCE. We use hands-on ultrasound training and e-learning strategies to optimize knowledge retention, ensure accurate interpretation, and promote practical application.Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a powerful diagnostic tool that combines image acquisition with bedside interpretation, enabling physicians to make rapid diagnoses at the bedside (1).

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to learn from streaming data sources step by step, which suffers from the catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, we investigate the exemplar-free LReID setting where no previous exemplar is available during the new step training. Existing exemplar-free LReID methods primarily adopt knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from an old model to a new one without selection, inevitably introducing erroneous and detrimental information that hinders new knowledge learning. Furthermore, not all critical knowledge can be transferred due to the absence of old data, leading to the permanent loss of undistilled knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a novel exemplar-free LReID method named Long Short-Term Knowledge Decomposition and Consolidation (LSTKC++). Specifically, an old knowledge rectification mechanism is developed to rectify the old model predictions based on new data annotations, ensuring correct knowledge transfer. Besides, a long-term knowledge consolidation strategy is designed, which first estimates the degree of old knowledge forgetting by leveraging the output difference between the old and new models. Then, a knowledge-guided parameter fusion strategy is developed to balance new and old knowledge, improving long-term knowledge retention. Upon these designs, considering LReID models tend to be biased on the latest seen domains, the fusion weights generated by this process often lead to sub-optimal knowledge balancing. To settle this, we further propose to decompose a single old model into two parts: a long-term old model containing multi-domain knowledge and a short-term model focusing on the latest short-term old knowledge. Then, the incoming new data are explored as an unbiased reference to adjust the old models' fusion weight to achieve backward optimization. Furthermore, an extended complementary knowledge rectification mechanism is developed to mine and retain the correct knowledge in the decomposed models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LSTKC++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins.Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to learn from streaming data sources step by step, which suffers from the catastrophic forgetting problem.

Abstract: All member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties have continuing certification (ie, maintenance of certification) programs. The efficacy of these programs has been questioned and, therefore, warrants study. CONTEXT.— All member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties have continuing certification (ie, maintenance of certification) programs. The efficacy of these programs has been questioned and, therefore, warrants study.To determine if the American Board of Pathology CertLink program, as structured, is associated with an improvement in the performance of participants on the assessment of content that was previously missed (ie, inaccurately answered). OBJECTIVE.— To determine if the American Board of Pathology CertLink program, as structured, is associated with an improvement in the performance of participants on the assessment of content that was previously missed (ie, inaccurately answered).We reviewed the performance of American Board of Pathology CertLink participants from January 2022 through December 2023 on the readministration of the content from 110 036 multiple-choice items that were previously missed by the participants in a program with enhanced learning strategies and incentives. DESIGN.— We reviewed the performance of American Board of Pathology CertLink participants from January 2022 through December 2023 on the readministration of the content from 110 036 multiple-choice items that were previously missed by the participants in a program with enhanced learning strategies and incentives.The correct response rate upon the assessment of readministered content that was previously missed increased from 0% to 62.2% (68 394 of 110 036), which exceeds that which would be achieved by guessing (P < .001). RESULTS.— The correct response rate upon the assessment of readministered content that was previously missed increased from 0% to 62.2% (68 394 of 110 036), which exceeds that which would be achieved by guessing (P < .001).The American Board of Pathology CertLink program, which incentivizes learning and was constructed from adult learning principles and modern educational precepts to improve knowledge retention, interrupt forgetting, and introduce practice-relevant content, is associated with an improvement in the performance of diplomates on continuing certification knowledge assessments. CONCLUSIONS.— The American Board of Pathology CertLink program, which incentivizes learning and was constructed from adult learning principles and modern educational precepts to improve knowledge retention, interrupt forgetting, and introduce practice-relevant content, is associated with an improvement in the performance of diplomates on continuing certification knowledge assessments.

Abstract: As health information systems (HIS) become a critical part of patient care, it is crucial to build an effective education strategy that facilitates the adoption and sustained use of these systems. The COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2023) has contributed to the rapid shift in virtual education and training for healthcare staff. INTRODUCTION As health information systems (HIS) become a critical part of patient care, it is crucial to build an effective education strategy that facilitates the adoption and sustained use of these systems. The COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2023) has contributed to the rapid shift in virtual education and training for healthcare staff.We sought to evaluate the efficacy and long-term sustainability of virtual training for using a HIS by examining opportunities and challenges. OBJECTIVE We sought to evaluate the efficacy and long-term sustainability of virtual training for using a HIS by examining opportunities and challenges.An exploratory, multimethods study was conducted with staff who had taken part in a virtual HIS training program as part of the clinical transformation journey at a large academic health science center in Canada. The study was guided by the Accelerating the Learning Cycle framework. Data were collected through pre- and post-training surveys, as well as semi-structured interviews. An iterative, inductive, constant comparative analysis approach, outlined by Braun and Clarke, was taken to thematically analyse the data. METHOD An exploratory, multimethods study was conducted with staff who had taken part in a virtual HIS training program as part of the clinical transformation journey at a large academic health science center in Canada. The study was guided by the Accelerating the Learning Cycle framework. Data were collected through pre- and post-training surveys, as well as semi-structured interviews. An iterative, inductive, constant comparative analysis approach, outlined by Braun and Clarke, was taken to thematically analyse the data.Of the 33 participants in this study, 13 were educational champions, and 20 were end-users. The pre- and post-training surveys yielded a total of 1479 responses in both groups. Three prominent themes emerged from this study: (1) fostering dynamic facilitation techniques to cultivate an inclusive culture and adapt to diverse learning needs; (2) integrating practical learning activities that contribute to knowledge retention; and (3) ensuring training resources are accessible and consistent for an optimal training experience. RESULTS Of the 33 participants in this study, 13 were educational champions, and 20 were end-users. The pre- and post-training surveys yielded a total of 1479 responses in both groups. Three prominent themes emerged from this study: (1) fostering dynamic facilitation techniques to cultivate an inclusive culture and adapt to diverse learning needs; (2) integrating practical learning activities that contribute to knowledge retention; and (3) ensuring training resources are accessible and consistent for an optimal training experience.As HIS continue to be part of the transformation of the healthcare ecosystem, education is vital in preparing healthcare providers to perform their clinical tasks and effectively use these technologies. Findings from this study can be used to inform the development of virtual training that is inclusive and addresses the needs of care providers. CONCLUSION As HIS continue to be part of the transformation of the healthcare ecosystem, education is vital in preparing healthcare providers to perform their clinical tasks and effectively use these technologies. Findings from this study can be used to inform the development of virtual training that is inclusive and addresses the needs of care providers.

Abstract: The use of clickers to encourage active learning strategies has become widespread. Much research has been aimed at assessing the efficacy of clickers for promoting classroom outcomes, such as student engagement, knowledge retention, knowledge transfer, student self-efficacy, and student interest. Although two meta-analyses suggest that, on average, clickers have a positive effect on most outcomes of interest, there is considerable heterogeneity in the literature, leaving open questions about what specific clicker practices promote optimal learning success. This naturalistic experiment tested whether clicker question complexity would influence retention of course material in a large, lecture-based social psychology course in 2017 and 2018. Question complexity was manipulated independently of course content to control for possible confounding factors. Retention was operationalized as student scores on unit exams. Contrary to expectations, no effects of question complexity were observed. Possible interpretations of this pattern are discussed. The large sample, characteristic of student populations at many regional U.S. universities, provides strong grounds for generalizing the results to other similar populations.

Abstract: Infectious diseases disproportionately affect rural and ethnic communities in Colombia, where structural inequalities such as limited access to health care, poor sanitation, and scarce health education worsen their effects. Education is essential for preventing and controlling infectious diseases, fostering awareness of healthy behaviors, and empowering communities with the knowledge and skills to manage their health. Participatory and co-design methods strengthen educational programs by ensuring cultural relevance, enhancing knowledge retention, and promoting sustainable community interventions. BACKGROUND Infectious diseases disproportionately affect rural and ethnic communities in Colombia, where structural inequalities such as limited access to health care, poor sanitation, and scarce health education worsen their effects. Education is essential for preventing and controlling infectious diseases, fostering awareness of healthy behaviors, and empowering communities with the knowledge and skills to manage their health. Participatory and co-design methods strengthen educational programs by ensuring cultural relevance, enhancing knowledge retention, and promoting sustainable community interventions.This study aims to describe the co-design process and evaluate the capacity building of an education program for the prevention and control of infectious diseases using participatory audiovisual methods culturally adapted to ethnic communities and rural contexts in Colombia. OBJECTIVE This study aims to describe the co-design process and evaluate the capacity building of an education program for the prevention and control of infectious diseases using participatory audiovisual methods culturally adapted to ethnic communities and rural contexts in Colombia.A qualitative case study approach was used. 15 community leaders contributed to the program's design, implementation, and evaluation. Nominal groups and a participatory social diagnosis identified key topics, while theoretical-practical sessions with visual methods guided the cocreation of workshops and audiovisual materials. Evaluation combined qualitative analysis of participants' perceptions and quantitative assessment of knowledge acquisition. Qualitative data were coded through content analysis, while multiple-choice questionnaires (initial and final) categorized knowledge acquisition into 3 levels (low, medium, and high), with percentage distributions used for comparative analysis. METHODS A qualitative case study approach was used. 15 community leaders contributed to the program's design, implementation, and evaluation. Nominal groups and a participatory social diagnosis identified key topics, while theoretical-practical sessions with visual methods guided the cocreation of workshops and audiovisual materials. Evaluation combined qualitative analysis of participants' perceptions and quantitative assessment of knowledge acquisition. Qualitative data were coded through content analysis, while multiple-choice questionnaires (initial and final) categorized knowledge acquisition into 3 levels (low, medium, and high), with percentage distributions used for comparative analysis.The co-design process resulted in 12 theoretical and practical workshops in infectious diseases and 3 audiovisual products: an animation about malaria, a comic book about cutaneous leishmaniasis, and a puppet show about tuberculosis. The quantitative evaluation applied to the 15 participants revealed substantial improvements, with the proportion that achieved excellent scores in pedagogy increasing from 40% (6/15) to 93% (14/15), in leadership from 13% (2/15) to 27% (4/15). In terms of health knowledge, excellent scores increased from 40% for leishmaniasis, 60% for malaria, and 13% for tuberculosis, reaching 80% for all three diseases. The qualitative evaluation showed positive results in terms of the participants' perceptions of both the methodology and the co-design process outcomes.

The qualitative evaluation showed positive results in terms of the participants' perceptions of both the methodology and the co-design process outcomes.The co-design process was driven by 3 key factors: (1) active community participation at every stage; (2) knowledge exchange between multidisciplinary technical expertise and practical local knowledge; and (3) the use of innovative, culturally adapted pedagogical tools tailored to the rural context and population. This co-design process proved to be an effective method for meaningful capacity building among populations experiencing vulnerability in complex settings, and has the potential to contribute significantly to the improvement of infectious disease prevention and control. CONCLUSIONS The co-design process was driven by 3 key factors: (1) active community participation at every stage; (2) knowledge exchange between multidisciplinary technical expertise and practical local knowledge; and (3) the use of innovative, culturally adapted pedagogical tools tailored to the rural context and population.

Abstract: The integration of gamification in educational settings has emerged as an innovative strategy to enhance student engagement and knowledge retention, particularly in complex fields like dentistry. This descriptive, survey-based study investigates the impact of gamified lectures on the learning experiences of undergraduate dental students in endodontic instrument education. BACKGROUND The integration of gamification in educational settings has emerged as an innovative strategy to enhance student engagement and knowledge retention, particularly in complex fields like dentistry. This descriptive, survey-based study investigates the impact of gamified lectures on the learning experiences of undergraduate dental students in endodontic instrument education.By incorporating interactive elements such as real-time quizzes, live polls, and immediate feedback, the research explores how gamification can transform traditional passive learning environments. The study involved undergraduate dental students and employed a structured survey questionnaire to assess engagement, knowledge retention, and student perceptions. METHODS By incorporating interactive elements such as real-time quizzes, live polls, and immediate feedback, the research explores how gamification can transform traditional passive learning environments. The study involved undergraduate dental students and employed a structured survey questionnaire to assess engagement, knowledge retention, and student perceptions.Quantitative analysis using SPSS revealed significant findings: 56.6% of students rated the lectures as "very engaging" or "extremely engaging", and 66% reported that gamification significantly contributed to their understanding of the subject matter. Correlation analyses demonstrated positive relationships between engagement, retention, and satisfaction, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.535 (p = 0.003) to 0.621 (p < 0.01). The results underscore the potential of gamification in dental education, particularly in enhancing student engagement and perceived understanding. However, the findings reflect short-term, self-reported outcomes and do not yet confirm long-term knowledge retention, which warrants further investigation.

By providing empirical evidence of gamification's benefits, this study contributes valuable insights for curriculum development and innovative pedagogical approaches in health professions education. CONCLUSION The results underscore the potential of gamification in dental education, highlighting its effectiveness in motivating active participation and improving learning outcomes. By providing empirical evidence of gamification's benefits, this study contributes valuable insights for curriculum development and innovative pedagogical approaches in health professions education.

Abstract: Infection prevention and control (IPC) competencies are essential to safe patient care across practice settings. This cross-sectional survey study aimed to describe the ability of an escape room to reinforce IPC concepts and knowledge retention rates for third-year student pharmacists. BACKGROUND Infection prevention and control (IPC) competencies are essential to safe patient care across practice settings. This cross-sectional survey study aimed to describe the ability of an escape room to reinforce IPC concepts and knowledge retention rates for third-year student pharmacists.An IPC-themed escape room using a mixture of online and physical puzzles was incorporated into a third-year student pharmacist course. Students in the course took knowledge assessment and perception surveys before the escape room (T1), after the escape room (T2), and for retention at the end of the semester (T3). METHODS An IPC-themed escape room using a mixture of online and physical puzzles was incorporated into a third-year student pharmacist course. Students in the course took knowledge assessment and perception surveys before the escape room (T1), after the escape room (T2), and for retention at the end of the semester (T3).Statistically significant ( p < 0.05) increases in knowledge occurred on four out of five of the knowledge assessment questions between the pre- and post-assessments (T1, T2) as well as between the pre- and retention assessments (T1, T3). Student confidence in their ability to provide patient care compliant with IPC practices also demonstrated statistically significant improvement between pre, post, and retention assessments (T1, T2, T3). RESULTS Statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in knowledge occurred on four out of five of the knowledge assessment questions between the pre- and post-assessments (T1, T2) as well as between the pre- and retention assessments (T1, T3). Student confidence in their ability to provide patient care compliant with IPC practices also demonstrated statistically significant improvement between pre, post, and retention assessments (T1, T2, T3).An IPC escape room is an effective tool to reinforce IPC concepts and increases student pharmacist knowledge and confidence in patient safety practices. Future study iterations should evaluate the role of an IPC IPE event for utility across multiple health professions curricula. CONCLUSIONS An IPC escape room is an effective tool to reinforce IPC concepts and increases student pharmacist knowledge and confidence in patient safety practices. Future study iterations should evaluate the role of an IPC IPE event for utility across multiple health professions curricula.

Abstract: E-cigarette use among youth in the United States has become a public health epidemic. Adults who regularly interact with youth-such as coaches, mentors, counselors, trainers, and caregivers-can significantly influence youth perceptions and behaviors related to e-cigarette use, either positively or negatively. BACKGROUND E-cigarette use among youth in the United States has become a public health epidemic. Adults who regularly interact with youth-such as coaches, mentors, counselors, trainers, and caregivers-can significantly influence youth perceptions and behaviors related to e-cigarette use, either positively or negatively.The study purpose was to examine the effectiveness of a nurse-led educational presentation among youth-serving adults about e-cigarette products and their negative health effects through knowledge assessment. PURPOSE The study purpose was to examine the effectiveness of a nurse-led educational presentation among youth-serving adults about e-cigarette products and their negative health effects through knowledge assessment.A 30-minute educational session was delivered using adapted materials from the Stanford REACH Lab's You & Me, Together Vape-Free curriculum within their Tobacco Prevention Toolkit. Participants (N = 24) completed a 20-question knowledge assessment before and after the presentation. METHODS A 30-minute educational session was delivered using adapted materials from the Stanford REACH Lab's You & Me, Together Vape-Free curriculum within their Tobacco Prevention Toolkit. Participants (N = 24) completed a 20-question knowledge assessment before and after the presentation.A paired t test revealed a statistically significant improvement in knowledge scores from preintervention (mean = 13.9, SD = 1.8) to postintervention (mean = 17.1, SD = 1), t(22) = 7.9, p < .001. Participants demonstrated an average increase of 3.21 correct responses (16.1%). RESULTS A paired t test revealed a statistically significant improvement in knowledge scores from preintervention (mean = 13.9, SD = 1.8) to postintervention (mean = 17.1, SD = 1), t(22) = 7.9, p < .001. Participants demonstrated an average increase of 3.21 correct responses (16.1%).The nurse-led educational presentation significantly improved participants' understanding of e-cigarettes and their harmful effects. By equipping youth-serving adults with accurate information, this approach supports informed conversations that may prevent youth e-cigarette use. School nurses are well positioned to lead such efforts, with national organizations endorsing their role in tobacco prevention. Further research is needed to assess long-term knowledge retention and behavioral outcomes.

Abstract: Despite cancer's significant impact on global health and its prevalence in clinical settings, oncology education in medical schools often remains fragmented and unstandardized, leaving many students feeling underprepared to care for patients with cancer. This study evaluates the implementation and impact of a 3-month oncology enrichment elective designed to address these educational gaps. From 2021 to 2024, we offered an oncology enrichment elective to medical students at a single institution. The curriculum included multidisciplinary didactic sessions and facility tours covering various oncology specialties. Data were collected through immediate post-course surveys and a 2025 longitudinal survey to assess both short and long-term impacts on students' oncology exposure and career interests. Students reported high satisfaction with the curriculum and its clinical relevance. The elective significantly enhanced exposure to underrepresented areas in oncology education, particularly radiation oncology and palliative care. Over two-thirds of respondents indicated the elective influenced their residency choice, with a similar proportion expressing interest in oncology careers. Thematic analysis revealed that students valued personalized faculty insights and requested more interactive learning experiences. An oncology enrichment elective effectively addresses gaps in cancer education during medical school, particularly during condensed pre-clerkship curricula. The model demonstrates potential for improving student comfort with oncology concepts and enhancing multidisciplinary understanding of cancer care. Larger longitudinal studies are needed to assess long-term impacts on knowledge retention and career trajectories.Despite cancer's significant impact on global health and its prevalence in clinical settings, oncology education in medical schools often remains fragmented and unstandardized, leaving many students feeling underprepared to care for patients with cancer.

Abstract: Effective science education relies on innovative and engaging teaching tools that enhance student learning and retention. This need is particularly important in agricultural science outreach, where understanding the role of microbiology in animal health and disease is essential for both livestock producers and the public. However, traditional teaching methods often fail to adequately convey complex concepts in an accessible, applicable, and memorable way. To address this gap, a memory-based card game was developed utilizing game-based learning (GBL) principles to improve comprehension of microbiology's impact on animal health and disease within agricultural systems. This interactive tool balances educational content with gameplay, fostering an engaging learning experience that encourages knowledge retention and real-world application. Through the use of the game, pre- and post-self-assessments indicated learners perceived they were improved in their understanding of microbes in agriculture and noted their greater likelihood to use this information in real-world situations ( P < 0.001). By integrating this game into extension and outreach programs, we aim to enhance public understanding of agricultural systems and microbiology's role in animal health, ultimately improving informed decision-making and agricultural literacy. This approach not only advances microbiology education but also exemplifies the pedagogical benefits of incorporating GBL into agricultural science communication.Effective science education relies on innovative and engaging teaching tools that enhance student learning and retention.

INTRODUCTION Anatomy is an important basic science that lays the foundation for clinical courses in MBBS curriculum. To make it interesting and clinically useful, several innovative teaching-learning methods are introduced in competency based medical education, where the students take the responsibility for their learning. In health care professional studies, self-directed learning (SDL) is considered an indispensable learning parameter.(1) To compare the effectiveness of SDL with didactic lectures in learning clinical anatomy among 1st year medical students. (2) To assess the retention of knowledge by students through SDL. OBJECTIVES (1) To compare the effectiveness of SDL with didactic lectures in learning clinical anatomy among 1st year medical students. (2) To assess the retention of knowledge by students through SDL.This was a comparative cross-sectional comparative observational study conducted on 124 Phase I MBBS between the ages of 18 and 25 years of both sex students of Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Medical College and Hospital, Rohini, Delhi. They were divided into 2 batches (Batch A and B) of 62 each. On the 1st day, Batch A was given a didactic lecture, while Batch B underwent an SDL session with all the study materials provided. A multiple-choice questionnaire (MCQ) was administered through a Google form after a didactic lecture and SDL session to each group. On the 2nd day, the batches were reversed, and another similar topic was dealt with, and assessment was done through the MCQ test. Knowledge retention was assessed by another MCQ test of the same topics, conducted 4 weeks after the SDL session. A paired t-test score comparing both methods reported that the after SDL was more compared than didactic lectures.

This review explores the impact of e-learning platforms on dementia knowledge acquisition among the general public, including informal caregivers.A systematic review was conducted using four databases: PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Science Direct. Eligible studies encompassed peer-reviewed publications in English-language journals, with no specific restrictions imposed on publication dates. Following rigorous application of the predetermined selection criteria, eight studies fulfilled the eligibility requirements for inclusion in this systematic review. METHODS A systematic review was conducted using four databases: PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Science Direct. Eligible studies encompassed peer-reviewed publications in English-language journals, with no specific restrictions imposed on publication dates. Following rigorous application of the predetermined selection criteria, eight studies fulfilled the eligibility requirements for inclusion in this systematic review.Eight studies were included in the analysis, three quasi-experimental studies, three descriptive studies, and two mixed-methods studies. Findings indicate that digital learning modalities including MOOCs, Tele-Savvy, and Web-based seminars, significantly improve dementia knowledge acquisition, with post-intervention assessments showing notable increases in Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS) scores. Key features such as structured content, interactivity, and multimodal delivery improve engagement and accessibility, contributing to high user satisfaction. Findings from a descriptive study, which included participants ranging from primary school age to 100 years in a mixed-method study, highlight the broad age spectrum of dementia e-learning platforms. Notably, seven out of eight studies demonstrated elevated participant engagement metrics and satisfaction indices among e-learning platform users, with MOOCs demonstrating particularly robust completion rates. Four studies indicated that the platforms' effectiveness is predominantly attributed to their user-friendliness, while linguistic adaptability further augments engagement and knowledge retention.

Abstract: This paper presents Gesture-Enhanced Adaptive Learning and Personalization (GEALP), an educational platform that integrates cognitive bulking and AI technologies to address key challenges in inclusive education, such as gesture recognition deficiencies, modal conversion barriers, and personalization gaps. Existing educational systems often fail to accommodate users relying on gestures, lack seamless integration across learning modalities, and provide limited adaptability to individual learning preferences. GEALP introduces a three-tier architecture combining 3D-CNN-based gesture recognition with attention-augmented temporal processing, bi-directional multi-modal content conversion, and dynamic learning adaptation supported by real-time feedback loops. Experiments with 1,000 users, 5,000 learning sessions, and 10,000 gestures demonstrate GEALP's superior performance. Results show improved gesture recognition accuracy (95.5%), user interaction (92.8%), and learning effectiveness (89.2%) compared to existing systems. The system also achieves 13.2% higher processing efficiency compared than benchmark systems such as MALS (8.1%) and PELS IRT (6.0%). The system presents an innovative bi-directional conversion framework enables seamlessly transformation across textual, auditory, visual, and gestural modalities while leveraging temporal attention mechanisms for low-latency gesture interpretation (average response time of 150 ms). Platform accessibility scores (9.2/10), personalization accuracy (94.2%), and knowledge retention rates (87.5%) further confirm the robustness of GEALP, indicating its potential for shaping future personalized learning environments.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate early childhood nutrition knowledge and practices in Gicumbi District, Rwanda, and assess the potential of parents' evening forums as platforms for community-based nutrition education. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate early childhood nutrition knowledge and practices in Gicumbi District, Rwanda, and assess the potential of parents' evening forums as platforms for community-based nutrition education.This study employed a mixed-methods design incorporating structured questionnaires (quantitative) and focus group discussions and interviews (qualitative). Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Spearman's rank correlation to explore associations among participation, knowledge application and access barriers. Thematic analysis was applied to qualitative data to capture contextual insights and educational preferences. DESIGN This study employed a mixed-methods design incorporating structured questionnaires (quantitative) and focus group discussions and interviews (qualitative). Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Spearman's rank correlation to explore associations among participation, knowledge application and access barriers. Thematic analysis was applied to qualitative data to capture contextual insights and educational preferences.The study was conducted in Gicumbi District, a rural region in northern Rwanda, characterised by high malnutrition rates. SETTING The study was conducted in Gicumbi District, a rural region in northern Rwanda, characterised by high malnutrition rates.523 participants: 471 household heads completed questionnaires; 52 took part in focus group discussions and interviews. PARTICIPANTS 523 participants: 471 household heads completed questionnaires; 52 took part in focus group discussions and interviews.The study revealed substantial knowledge gaps, with only 46 % of participants aware of the symptoms of malnutrition and just 32 % identifying nutrient-rich complementary foods. Despite 68 % of participants reporting social connection as a key motivator for joining parents' evening forums, logistical challenges such as time and travel barriers were cited by 41 % as constraints. Lectures were the most preferred teaching method (78 %), followed by cooking demonstrations (56 %). Qualitative findings emphasised the importance of local relevance, peer support and interactive learning for fostering participation and knowledge retention. RESULTS The study revealed substantial knowledge gaps, with only 46 % of participants aware of the symptoms of malnutrition and just 32 % identifying nutrient-rich complementary foods.

Qualitative findings emphasised the importance of local relevance, peer support and interactive learning for fostering participation and knowledge retention.Parents' evening forums represent a viable and contextually appropriate platform for delivering early childhood nutrition education. Their expansion, alongside the integration of digital tools and tailored, experiential teaching approaches, could strengthen community engagement and address persistent malnutrition challenges in Rwanda and comparable settings. CONCLUSIONS Parents' evening forums represent a viable and contextually appropriate platform for delivering early childhood nutrition education. Their expansion, alongside the integration of digital tools and tailored, experiential teaching approaches, could strengthen community engagement and address persistent malnutrition challenges in Rwanda and comparable settings.

Abstract: Simulation-based education (SBE) is an essential teaching modality in healthcare; learner engagement in SBE is critical for knowledge retention. Numerous scales are validated to measure engagement, but none are specific for use in SBE. We present development and initial validation evidence for the Engagement Scale for Simulation-Based Education (ESSBE), a self-report tool measuring behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions of the engagement construct within scenario-based SBE. BACKGROUND Simulation-based education (SBE) is an essential teaching modality in healthcare; learner engagement in SBE is critical for knowledge retention. Numerous scales are validated to measure engagement, but none are specific for use in SBE. We present development and initial validation evidence for the Engagement Scale for Simulation-Based Education (ESSBE), a self-report tool measuring behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions of the engagement construct within scenario-based SBE.A mixed methods approach included item generation, expert review, and cognitive pretesting. Learners already attending undergraduate and graduate healthcare education programs at a southeastern simulation center voluntarily completed an 18-item, 7-point frequency response questionnaire immediately after a simulation session (n = 402). Reliability was tested using Cronbach's alpha and Spearman's Rank (rho). Dimensionality was assessed via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and metric invariance testing. METHODS A mixed methods approach included item generation, expert review, and cognitive pretesting. Learners already attending undergraduate and graduate healthcare education programs at a southeastern simulation center voluntarily completed an 18-item, 7-point frequency response questionnaire immediately after a simulation session (n = 402). Reliability was tested using Cronbach's alpha and Spearman's Rank (rho). Dimensionality was assessed via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and metric invariance testing.From several structural models tested, best-fit was obtained using a 2nd order/4-dimensional model with 11 retained items (CMIN/3.3, CFI/0.945, TLI/0.91, SRMR/0.055, RMSEA/0.075). Additional empirical evidence supported scale reliability (alphas ≥ 0.610; rho r(401) ≥ 0.434, P < 0.01) and metric invariance (held for Δ SRMR and Δ RMSEA). RESULTS From several structural models tested, best-fit was obtained using a 2nd order/4-dimensional model with 11 retained items (CMIN/3.3, CFI/0.945, TLI/0.91, SRMR/0.055, RMSEA/0.075). Additional empirical evidence supported scale reliability (alphas ≥ 0.610; rho r(401) ≥ 0.434, P < 0.01) and metric invariance (held for Δ SRMR and Δ RMSEA).Future studies are needed to strengthen the validation evidence for the ESSBE before the tool is ready for general use. For example, we have not yet tested convergent/divergent validity with existing metrics or whether ESSBE responses are associated with learner outcomes. We provide initial evidence supporting the 11-item, 4-dimension ESSBE as a potentially reliable and valid measurement of engagement in SBE. CONCLUSION Future studies are needed to strengthen the validation evidence for the ESSBE before the tool is ready for general use. For example, we have not yet tested convergent/divergent validity with existing metrics or whether ESSBE responses are associated with learner outcomes. We provide initial evidence supporting the 11-item, 4-dimension ESSBE as a potentially reliable and valid measurement of engagement in SBE.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Health education plays a vital role in training health professionals and caregivers, supporting both prevention and the promotion of self-care. In this context, technology serves as a valuable ally by enabling continuous and flexible learning. Among the various domains of health education, nutrition stands out as a key element in the management of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), helping to prevent malnutrition and enhance patient well-being. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching and learning processes within a learning pathway focused on food and nutrition in the context of ALS. Methods: This study adopted a longitudinal, quantitative design. The learning pathway, titled "Food and Nutrition in ALS," consisted of four self-paced and self-instructional Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), offered through the Virtual Learning Environment of the Brazilian Health System (AVASUS). Participants included health professionals, caregivers, and patients from all five regions of Brazil. Participants had the autonomy to complete the courses in any order, with no prerequisites for enrollment. Results: Out of 14,263 participants enrolled nationwide, 182 were included in this study after signing the Informed Consent Form. Of these, 142 (78%) completed at least one course and participated in the educational intervention. A significant increase in knowledge was observed, with mean pre-test scores rising from 7.3 (SD = 1.8) to 9.6 (SD = 0.9) on the post-test across all courses ( p < 0.001). Conclusions: The self-instructional, technology-mediated continuing education model proved effective in improving participants' knowledge about nutrition in ALS. Future studies should explore knowledge retention, behavior change, and the impact of such interventions on clinical outcomes, especially in multidisciplinary care settings.Background/Objectives: Health education plays a vital role in training health professionals and caregivers, supporting both prevention and the promotion of self-care.

Abstract: Gamification and serious gaming have emerged as alternative approaches in learning and decision-making across various domains. In maritime education and the inland waterways sector, where traditional methods may fall short in engaging learners effectively, the development of tailored serious games presents a unique opportunity. This research assesses the educational value of a serious game designed for the maritime industry and inland waterways. The game was developed through a systematic process involving a literature review, stakeholder consultations, and expert input. The methodology included iterative design, user testing, and feedback collection from participants across various sectors. The game features tasks simulating port operations, equipment handling, and inland navigation, followed by quizzes to reinforce learning. Data analysis was performed to evaluate user engagement, knowledge retention, and satisfaction levels. Evaluation results indicate high user engagement, improved knowledge retention, and participant satisfaction. This research underlines the potential of serious games in maritime education, offering innovative solutions to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, thereby maximizing learning outcomes and preparing individuals comprehensively for the challenges of the maritime industry and inland waterways sector.

Abstract: A majority of youth with mental health concerns lack access to psychiatric care, often relying on general practitioners who may feel unprepared. Enhancing medical education in child psychiatry is crucial. This study evaluated changes in medical students' perspectives after participating in an interactive Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (CAP) elective. Significant improvements were found in students' comfort assessing suicidal thoughts, evaluating mental health diagnoses, and understanding biopsychosocial factors. The findings suggest that participation in CAP electives may boost student confidence in handling youth mental health issues, highlighting the need for further studies on knowledge retention and career impact.A majority of youth with mental health concerns lack access to psychiatric care, often relying on general practitioners who may feel unprepared.

Abstract: Surface anatomy plays a crucial role in medical education, providing a foundation for the safe acquisition of physical examination and clinical skills among medical students. Despite its importance, surface anatomy education often receives insufficient emphasis in medical curricula, lacking robust empirical support for its effectiveness in higher education. This study addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive Work-based Surface Anatomy Teaching (WSAT) model, shaped by insights from two scoping review findings. Rigorous expert ratings were employed to establish the model's content, response process, and internal validity. A small-scale randomized controlled trial involving 27 participants compared the WSAT instruction to routine surface anatomy instruction in a control group. Through pre- and post-teaching assessments, and follow-up sessions, the study measured knowledge retention, cognitive loads, learning engagement, and changes in learning competencies. Results revealed that the intervention group, receiving WSAT instruction, demonstrated significantly lower extraneous load, heightened self-perceived learning, and increased cognitive and physical engagement compared to the control group. Despite similar baseline surface competencies, the intervention group outperformed the control in acquiring cognitive, psychomotor, and affective competencies, as well as in retaining psychomotor skills and displaying professional behavior. While these findings are promising, future studies are necessary to assess the impact of WSAT instruction on student learning behaviors and organizational dynamics. A larger trial across multiple institutions will contribute valuable insights into the feasibility and applicability of the WSAT model in diverse demographic settings, ultimately enhancing medical education practices.Surface anatomy plays a crucial role in medical education, providing a foundation for the safe acquisition of physical examination and clinical skills among medical students.

Abstract: In this mixed‑methods study, 73 preschoolers from three schools participated in pre‑test/post‑test assessments and user satisfaction surveys to evaluate the "Play and Learn" mobile e‑learning application for foundational learning of alphabets, numbers, and shapes in children aged 3–6 years. The app’s multimedia elements—animations, music, and interactive quizzes—were tailored to young learners’ cognitive abilities to ensure smooth navigation and sustained attention. Results showed significant gains across all three schools, with perfect-score rates rising from 79% pre‑test to 93% post‑test, and a 93% satisfaction rate for engagement and design effectiveness. These findings demonstrate how educational technology, multimedia learning, and adaptive design can bridge gaps in early childhood education by enhancing knowledge retention and holistic development. In conclusion, "Play and Learn" offers an innovative, accessible, and enjoyable mobile learning solution for preschoolers and provides valuable insights for future e‑learning technologies.

Abstract: A majority of youth with mental health concerns lack access to psychiatric care, often relying on general practitioners who may feel unprepared. Enhancing medical education in child psychiatry is crucial. This study evaluated changes in medical students’ perspectives after participating in an interactive Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (CAP) elective. Significant improvements were found in students’ comfort assessing suicidal thoughts, evaluating mental health diagnoses, and understanding biopsychosocial factors. The findings suggest that participation in CAP electives may boost student confidence in handling youth mental health issues, highlighting the need for further studies on knowledge retention and career impact.

Abstract: Background: COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted urgent need for effective training in pandemic and outbreak management among healthcare professionals. Traditional teaching methods often lack the engagement required to prepare learners for real-world challenges. This systematic review evaluates effectiveness of gamification-based teaching methods in enhancing knowledge, skills, and engagement in pandemic preparedness education for healthcare professionals and students. Methods: Systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases, identifying studies that employed gamification-based learning for pandemic management training. Studies were screened and selected based on predefined eligibility criteria, focusing on interventions targeting healthcare professionals or students. 12 studies were included, and narrative synthesis was conducted due to the heterogeneity in study designs, participant groups, and outcome measures. Results: Review found that gamification-based methods, such as serious games, e-learning modules, and simulations, improved knowledge retention, practical skills, and learner engagement compared to traditional teaching approaches. Participants reported high satisfaction and perceived usefulness of gamified interventions, with several studies demonstrating significant improvements in long-term knowledge retention and willingness to change behaviours related to infection control. However, variability in intervention design and outcome measures posed challenges for drawing generalized conclusions. Conclusion: Gamification-based teaching methods show promise in enhancing pandemic preparedness training among healthcare professionals. While these methods improve engagement and learning outcomes, further research is needed to explore long-term impacts, cost-effectiveness, and applicability in diverse educational settings. In addition, heterogeneity and methodological limitations of included studies underscore the need for more rigorous, high-quality research to validate these findings.

Abstract: The education process for newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) patients and their families, primarily led by diabetes specialist nurses, is essential for gaining knowledge about the disease and its management. However, few assessment tools have been employed to evaluate long-term knowledge retention among T1D patients years after diagnosis. BACKGROUND The education process for newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) patients and their families, primarily led by diabetes specialist nurses, is essential for gaining knowledge about the disease and its management. However, few assessment tools have been employed to evaluate long-term knowledge retention among T1D patients years after diagnosis.We developed a 20-question test to assess the knowledge of patients and their families at the conclusion of the initial education process and again 6-12 months later. Demographic and clinical data were also collected. Statistical analyses included comparisons between the first and second test results, as well as evaluation of potential contributing factors. The internal consistency and construct validity of the questionnaire were evaluated. METHODS We developed a 20-question test to assess the knowledge of patients and their families at the conclusion of the initial education process and again 6-12 months later. Demographic and clinical data were also collected. Statistical analyses included comparisons between the first and second test results, as well as evaluation of potential contributing factors. The internal consistency and construct validity of the questionnaire were evaluated.Forty-four patients completed both assessments, with a median interval of 11.5 months between them. The average score on the first test was 88.6, which declined to 82.7 on the second assessment ( p < 0.001). In univariate analysis, factors positively associated with higher scores included Jewish ethnicity, lower HbA1c levels, and shorter hospitalization duration. Multivariate analysis revealed that parents had lower odds of experiencing a significant score decline compared to patients. Cronbach's alpha was 0.69, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) identified eight components accounting for 67.1% of the total variance.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Puzzle-solving has been recognized as an effective game-based educational strategy for active learning and can be used to learn complex topics such as psychiatric disorders. This research was designed to investigate the benefits of this technique on the learning, memorization, and satisfaction of general medical students in the clinical rotation of the psychiatry department and the role of related demographic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-three medical students participated in this quasi-experimental study from January 2022 to February 2023. After completing a pre-test, the students engaged in three puzzle sets related to panic attacks, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety disorders based on the DSM-5 criteria. Following the completion of the puzzles, the students took a post-test and filled out a satisfaction questionnaire. Twenty days later, a follow-up test was conducted to assess knowledge retention. The data were then analyzed using SPSS-19 at a significance level of 0.05. Results: The post-test and follow-up test average scores were significantly higher than the pre-test ( P < 0.05), with a non-significant decrease in the follow-up ( P = 0.13). Additionally, the participants reported a high level of satisfaction. Conclusions: The puzzle-solving technique as an active strategy can have a very important role in the efficacy of the teaching-learning process, especially in complex subjects like psychiatry. The present study provides evidence that puzzle-solving training significantly improves the learning and memorization of psychiatric DSM criteria in medical students. The results of this study can be used to design a more active learning environment to improve learning outcomes in medical education.

Abstract: Background Diabetes mellitus is a growing global health concern, with a high prevalence in Egypt. Type 2 diabetes imposes substantial health and economic challenges. Diabetes Self‐Management Education and Support (DSMES) programs, such as the Diabetes Conversation Map, have demonstrated promise in enhancing patient knowledge, self‐management, and self‐efficacy. However, evidence regarding their direct impact remains scarce, necessitating further investigation. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Diabetes Conversation Map program in improving knowledge retention, self‐management, and self‐efficacy among type 2 diabetes patients in Egypt. Methods A prospective, parallel, two‐arm randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Damanhour Health Insurance Outpatient Diabetic Clinic in Egypt. A total of 120 adult patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized into a control group ( n  = 60), receiving standard diabetes education, and an intervention group ( n  = 60), attending 8 weekly interactive sessions using the Diabetes Conversation Map. Primary outcomes were assessed using validated questionnaires at baseline, post‐intervention, and 3 months later. Results The intervention group exhibited significant improvements in knowledge, self‐management, and self‐efficacy compared to the control group ( p  < 0.001). Additionally, positive correlations between these outcomes were observed post‐intervention, replacing negative correlations observed at baseline. Linking Evidence to Action The Diabetes Conversation Map program effectively enhances patient knowledge, self‐management, and self‐efficacy, supporting its integration into routine diabetes education. Healthcare providers should implement structured, interactive educational interventions to empower patients in managing their condition. Regular follow‐ups and reinforcement strategies are necessary to sustain long‐term self‐efficacy improvements. Policymakers should consider incorporating evidence‐based diabetes education into national healthcare programs. Future research should explore digital adaptations of the program to enhance accessibility and engagement. Trial Registration Registration No: R000061691, Trial ID: UMIN000054044

Abstract: This narrative review examines the implications of longitudinal assessment (LA) for certified registered nurse anesthetists, proposing it as an innovative method to enhance continuous professional development and maintain certification. Grounded in theoretical frameworks such as Miller's Pyramid of Clinical Competence and Moore's Expanded Outcomes Framework, this review explores how LA fosters lifelong learning in healthcare and synthesizes current evidence, detailing the integration of frequent, low-stakes assessments and targeted feedback to support knowledge retention and application. The principles of LA-flexibility, rigor, and relevance-are discussed with its potential to address the evolving demands of clinical practice, ensuring patient safety and competence. Key findings highlight the role of LA in reducing stress associated with traditional high-stakes testing while promoting engagement and critical thinking. This review highlights that LA represents a paradigm shift in healthcare education, aligning assessment methods with modern clinical and educational needs. By fostering continuous learning and adaptability, LA enhances clinician growth and improves patient outcomes. Further research is recommended to optimize LA implementation across diverse healthcare specialties.

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a growing global health concern, with a high prevalence in Egypt. Type 2 diabetes imposes substantial health and economic challenges. Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES) programs, such as the Diabetes Conversation Map, have demonstrated promise in enhancing patient knowledge, self-management, and self-efficacy. However, evidence regarding their direct impact remains scarce, necessitating further investigation. BACKGROUND Diabetes mellitus is a growing global health concern, with a high prevalence in Egypt. Type 2 diabetes imposes substantial health and economic challenges. Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES) programs, such as the Diabetes Conversation Map, have demonstrated promise in enhancing patient knowledge, self-management, and self-efficacy. However, evidence regarding their direct impact remains scarce, necessitating further investigation.This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Diabetes Conversation Map program in improving knowledge retention, self-management, and self-efficacy among type 2 diabetes patients in Egypt. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Diabetes Conversation Map program in improving knowledge retention, self-management, and self-efficacy among type 2 diabetes patients in Egypt.A prospective, parallel, two-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Damanhour Health Insurance Outpatient Diabetic Clinic in Egypt. A total of 120 adult patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized into a control group (n = 60), receiving standard diabetes education, and an intervention group (n = 60), attending 8 weekly interactive sessions using the Diabetes Conversation Map. Primary outcomes were assessed using validated questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 months later. METHODS A prospective, parallel, two-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Damanhour Health Insurance Outpatient Diabetic Clinic in Egypt. A total of 120 adult patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized into a control group (n = 60), receiving standard diabetes education, and an intervention group (n = 60), attending 8 weekly interactive sessions using the Diabetes Conversation Map. Primary outcomes were assessed using validated questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 months later.The intervention group exhibited significant improvements in knowledge, self-management, and self-efficacy compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Additionally, positive correlations between these outcomes were observed post-intervention, replacing negative correlations observed at baseline. RESULTS The intervention group exhibited significant improvements in knowledge, self-management, and self-efficacy compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Additionally, positive correlations between these outcomes were observed post-intervention, replacing negative correlations observed at baseline.The Diabetes Conversation Map program effectively enhances patient knowledge, self-management, and self-efficacy, supporting its integration into routine diabetes education. Healthcare providers should implement structured, interactive educational interventions to empower patients in managing their condition. Regular follow-ups and reinforcement strategies are necessary to sustain long-term self-efficacy improvements. Policymakers should consider incorporating evidence-based diabetes education into national healthcare programs. Future research should explore digital adaptations of the program to enhance accessibility and engagement.

Abstract: This study explores the impact of secondary traumatic stress (STS) on first‐year teachers (FYTs) and the potential of trauma‐informed practices (TIP) as a mitigating strategy. STS, which results from exposure to students' trauma, is a significant but underexplored issue in education. By examining the first year of teaching, this mixed‐methods study investigates whether TIP reduces STS symptoms and improves knowledge retention in FYTs. Quantitative findings suggest that TIP can enhance TIP content knowledge and confidence and reduce STS, offering valuable insights for teacher well‐being and retention, particularly in high‐needs schools. This study contributes to the emerging literature on STS in education and highlights the importance of targeted support for first‐year teachers.

Abstract: Background COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted urgent need for effective training in pandemic and outbreak management among healthcare professionals. Traditional teaching methods often lack the engagement required to prepare learners for real-world challenges. This systematic review evaluates effectiveness of gamification-based teaching methods in enhancing knowledge, skills, and engagement in pandemic preparedness education for healthcare professionals and students. Methods Systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases, identifying studies that employed gamification-based learning for pandemic management training. Studies were screened and selected based on predefined eligibility criteria, focusing on interventions targeting healthcare professionals or students. 12 studies were included, and narrative synthesis was conducted due to the heterogeneity in study designs, participant groups, and outcome measures. Results Review found that gamification-based methods, such as serious games, e-learning modules, and simulations, improved knowledge retention, practical skills, and learner engagement compared to traditional teaching approaches. Participants reported high satisfaction and perceived usefulness of gamified interventions, with several studies demonstrating significant improvements in long-term knowledge retention and willingness to change behaviours related to infection control. However, variability in intervention design and outcome measures posed challenges for drawing generalized conclusions. Conclusion Gamification-based teaching methods show promise in enhancing pandemic preparedness training among healthcare professionals. While these methods improve engagement and learning outcomes, further research is needed to explore long-term impacts, cost-effectiveness, and applicability in diverse educational settings. In addition, heterogeneity and methodological limitations of included studies underscore the need for more rigorous, high-quality research to validate these findings.

Abstract: Hemorrhage causes 40 % of deaths from trauma. Low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) claim the majority of these deaths, in part due to lack of resources and organization in the prehospital and hospital arenas. Guatemala experiences a high burden of trauma-related injuries but does not have the resources nor the emergency response system to deal with it. In Guatemala, firefighters (bomberos) lead trauma responses, yet do not receive medical training. Recognizing these gaps in LMICs, we developed "CrashSavers", a low cost, openly accessible, self-training mobile phone-based platform to teach hemorrhage control techniques to first responders in Guatemala City. In this manuscript, we present the evaluation and outcomes of the bomberos who were trained with CrashSavers. INTRODUCTION Hemorrhage causes 40 % of deaths from trauma.

In this manuscript, we present the evaluation and outcomes of the bomberos who were trained with CrashSavers.Our self-administered educational program teaches first responders to train themselves in the decision making and psychomotor skills of tourniquet placement. This free platform, accessible via mobile phone, provides didactic material, virtual reality cases and instructions to construct a bleeding extremity simulator. Sixty-four bomberos were trained from July-August 2022. Eighteen months later they were retested to assess knowledge retention. Interviews were conducted with all bomberos to elicit feedback, which were then analyzed with narrative synthesis. We assessed medical knowledge, confidence, and surgical skills pre and post training.

Abstract: The evolution of orthopaedic medical education has been significantly influenced by the integration of innovative teaching methods aimed at addressing the challenges of traditional learning models. Emerging pedagogical strategies such as simulation-based learning, flipped classrooms, problem-based learning (PBL), and peer teaching have demonstrated improved student engagement, knowledge retention, and clinical competency. However, the global adoption of these innovations faces barriers, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Emerging pedagogical strategies such as simulation-based learning, flipped classrooms, problem-based learning (PBL), and peer teaching have demonstrated improved student engagement, knowledge retention, and clinical competency. However, the global adoption of these innovations faces barriers, particularly in resource-limited settings.This study explores the impact of novel teaching strategies in orthopaedic education through an extensive literature review and evaluation of current trends. The study methodology follows systematic analysis guidelines registered under PROSPERO (ID: CRD420251007591). Key parameters assessed include student engagement, knowledge retention, and clinical skill development. Methods This study explores the impact of novel teaching strategies in orthopaedic education through an extensive literature review and evaluation of current trends. The study methodology follows systematic analysis guidelines registered under PROSPERO (ID: CRD420251007591). Key parameters assessed include student engagement, knowledge retention, and clinical skill development.Findings indicate that simulation-based learning enhances surgical skill acquisition by offering repetitive practice opportunities in a controlled environment. The flipped classroom model improves conceptual understanding by allowing pre-class learning and interactive in-class application. PBL and peer teaching foster critical thinking, collaborative learning, and problem-solving skills. Despite financial and logistical challenges, institutions implementing these strategies report significant improvements in training outcomes.

Abstract: This study explores the impact of secondary traumatic stress (STS) on first‐year teachers (FYTs) and the potential of trauma‐informed practices (TIP) as a mitigating strategy. STS, which results from exposure to students' trauma, is a significant but underexplored issue in education. By examining the first year of teaching, this mixed‐methods study investigates whether TIP reduces STS symptoms and improves knowledge retention in FYTs. Quantitative findings suggest that TIP can enhance TIP content knowledge and confidence and reduce STS, offering valuable insights for teacher well‐being and retention, particularly in high‐needs schools. This study contributes to the emerging literature on STS in education and highlights the importance of targeted support for first‐year teachers.

Abstract: Blood transfusion is increasingly utilised to manage haemorrhagic shock in prehospital environments. This practice is particularly relevant in settings where delays to definitive treatment are common due to extended evacuation timelines, limited resupply, and challenging environmental conditions. Safe and effective transfusion in these contexts depends on competent, well-prepared providers. Non-physician personnel may be required to perform transfusions independently in high-stakes situations without direct physician supervision. This scoping review synthesizes current literature on blood transfusion training for prehospital providers, with a focus on instructional design, simulation modalities, knowledge retention, and outcome evaluation.

Safe and effective transfusion in these contexts depends on competent, well-prepared providers. Non-physician personnel may be required to perform transfusions independently in high-stakes situations without direct physician supervision. This scoping review synthesizes current literature on blood transfusion training for prehospital providers, with a focus on instructional design, simulation modalities, knowledge retention, and outcome evaluation.We conducted a scoping review following Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and reported in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR framework. Seven databases were systematically searched through 20 February 2025. Eligible studies described transfusion training for non-physician healthcare providers in prehospital or austere environments. Data were extracted on instructional strategies, simulation modalities, and outcome measures. Outcomes were categorised using the Kirkpatrick Model, and instructional design features mapped to simulation-based education frameworks.

Outcomes were categorised using the Kirkpatrick Model, and instructional design features mapped to simulation-based education frameworks.Six studies involving 475 participants were included. Participants included combat medics, paramedics, registered nurses, physician assistants, and medical students. Training was delivered across environments including simulation centres, field-based exercises, and in-theatre deployments. All studies featured face-to-face instruction and hands-on skills training. Simulation modalities included part-task trainers in four studies, high-fidelity mannequins in two, live human models in two, and real-world transfusions in one. Instructional design features such as team-based learning, repeated practice, and structured feedback were reported in most studies. Outcomes were reported across all four Kirkpatrick levels. Four studies assessed learner satisfaction and confidence (Level 1), five evaluated knowledge and procedural skill acquisition (Level 2), three assessed behavioural change in practice (Level 3), and one reported patient-level outcomes during operational missions (Level 4). None assessed long-term retention. Variability in instructional methods and limited evaluation at higher outcome levels constrained generalizability.

However, inconsistent instructional design and limited evaluation of long-term or clinical outcomes indicate important gaps. Structured, simulation-informed programs aligned with operational needs may improve training consistency and effectiveness.

Abstract: This paper details the reason for the decline in medical knowledge after initial certification of physician assistants/associates (PAs) and suggests improvement in competency assessment after initial certification. We hypothesized that the decline was caused by less frequency of use; in other words, knowledge retention was impacted by the active use of knowledge. If so, the likelihood of a decline in knowledge is mediated by the closeness of the test content to the practitioners' daily practice. Data from Physician Assistants (PA) initial certification (PANCE) and re-certification (PANRE-LA, after 6 years) were used for the current study. To quantify the level of active usage, knowledge subdomains were classified into three categories for each medical specialty: dominant, relevant and distant, ranging from the most frequently used to the least used knowledge, which was verified by four independent board-certified PAs with clinical and educational experience. To test the hypothesis, Latent transition analysis (LTA) is used to measure the probability of transitions among behavioral patterns over time, in particular how various levels of transition probabilities (e.g., probability from proficient switching to non-proficient) are related to the frequency of use. We found that the trends of knowledge decline are influenced by practice profile (medical specialty), mainly, knowledge active in daily use (i.e., dominant knowledge) over time- the less frequent the knowledge is used, the more likely the knowledge decline will take place. In particular, compared to dominant knowledge (i.e., most frequently used knowledge), relevant knowledge (i.e., mediumly frequent used knowledge) and distant knowledge (i.e., rarely used knowledge) are more likely to decline (OR = 2.31, CI = [1.82, 2.94], p < 0.001; OR = 2.26, CI = [1.84, 2.78], p < 0.001). Moreover, dominant system knowledge has a better chance to improve over the years as compared to relevant and distant system knowledge (OR = 2.19, CI = [1.71, 2.81], p < 0.001; OR = 2.12, CI = [1.72, 2.65], p < 0.001). Instead of a uniform knowledge decay, medical practitioners suffer from a differential likelihood of knowledge decay over different systems knowledge. Implications for re-certification exams are discussed.This paper details the reason for the decline in medical knowledge after initial certification of physician assistants/associates (PAs) and suggests improvement in competency assessment after initial certification.

Abstract: Pediatric hematology and oncology manage complex pathophysiology that is not otherwise seen during general pediatric residency. Therefore, this was a unique opportunity for a robust educational experience essential for future clinical practice. This project aimed to improve pediatric residents' education experience and knowledge retention during their hematology and oncology rotations. This was achieved by implementing structured resources and a pre-rotation orientation over 15 months. Outcomes were measured via two questionnaires to assess the participants' knowledge (objective questionnaire based on board-style questions) and perceived improvements in comfort levels (subjective questionnaire based on a 5-point Likert scale). Participants were given surveys on the first day of the rotation and again on the last day to evaluate improvement in medical knowledge and comfort levels. The project ran from July 2022 to September 2023. The data was analyzed using the IBM® SPSS® statistical software. Out of 56 eligible participants, 51 completed all objective and subjective questionnaire questions. A significant difference when comparing the pre- and post-rotation Likert scale for an overall comfort level with the field of hematology (p < 0.001) and oncology (p < 0.001) was observed. Additionally, the objective questionnaire significantly improved correct answers pre- and post-rotation (p = 0.006). There was a statistically significant increase in both the subjective and objective questionnaires obtained between the pre- and post-data, which supported our hypothesis that through the creation of easily accessible hem/onc resources and a more streamlined and equal educational experience, residents' comfort level and underlying medical knowledge of common hem/onc disorders improved.Pediatric hematology and oncology manage complex pathophysiology that is not otherwise seen during general pediatric residency.

Abstract: To improve the effectiveness of English-Chinese bilingual learning, this study introduces an optimization model that combines semantic analysis with neural machine translation (NMT). A series of comprehensive experiments were conducted to evaluate its performance. The results demonstrated that the proposed model outperformed existing approaches across multiple key metrics, including reading comprehension, translation accuracy, and learning efficiency. Specifically, the optimized model achieved a reading comprehension score of 85.0, a grammar accuracy rate of 82.5%, and a vocabulary score of 80.1. For translation performance, it attained a sentence-level accuracy of 84.3%, paragraph coherence of 81.5%, and a cultural understanding score of 78.9. In terms of learning efficiency, the model reduced average learning time to 45.3 min, reached a knowledge retention rate of 80.2%, and improved autonomous learning ability to 78.5%. Learner satisfaction also improved, with an interest level score of 4.3, a teaching method satisfaction score of 4.0, and an overall satisfaction score of 4.2 (on a 5-point scale). Compared with rule-based translation systems and models using word embeddings or basic neural networks, the proposed model demonstrated clear advantages in all areas of evaluation. Overall, this study offers a valuable contribution to the advancement of computer-assisted language learning technologies.To improve the effectiveness of English-Chinese bilingual learning, this study introduces an optimization model that combines semantic analysis with neural machine translation (NMT).

Abstract: Standardized training for orthopedic and traumatology residents is a crucial component of postgraduate medical education. Traditional teaching methods, such as Lecture-Based Learning (LBL), often fail to stimulate student initiative and clinical thinking. To address this, our study aimed to explore the effectiveness of a combined Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Standardized Patients (SP) teaching method in enhancing the clinical skills and self-learning abilities of orthopedic residents. BACKGROUND Standardized training for orthopedic and traumatology residents is a crucial component of postgraduate medical education. Traditional teaching methods, such as Lecture-Based Learning (LBL), often fail to stimulate student initiative and clinical thinking. To address this, our study aimed to explore the effectiveness of a combined Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Standardized Patients (SP) teaching method in enhancing the clinical skills and self-learning abilities of orthopedic residents.A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 59 orthopedic residents from three medical institutions in China. The participants were randomly divided into a control group (n = 29) receiving traditional LBL combined with SP and a study group (n = 30) receiving PBL combined with SP. Both groups were instructed on common orthopedic diseases for 21 h. Teaching effectiveness was assessed through self-designed electronic questionnaires, classroom performance metrics, and final exams. METHODS A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 59 orthopedic residents from three medical institutions in China. The participants were randomly divided into a control group (n = 29) receiving traditional LBL combined with SP and a study group (n = 30) receiving PBL combined with SP. Both groups were instructed on common orthopedic diseases for 21 h. Teaching effectiveness was assessed through self-designed electronic questionnaires, classroom performance metrics, and final exams.Compared with the control group, the study group demonstrated significantly greater levels of self-study initiative, teamwork ability, classroom learning efficiency, learning interest, and clinical processing ability (P < 0.05). The study group also showed greater improvement in their ability to handle clinical problems and had higher postclass knowledge retention and learning interest scores (P < 0.05). Practical exam scores and overall scores were significantly higher in the study group (P < 0.05), although written exam scores did not differ significantly. RESULTS Compared with the control group, the study group demonstrated significantly greater levels of self-study initiative, teamwork ability, classroom learning efficiency, learning interest, and clinical processing ability (P < 0.05). The study group also showed greater improvement in their ability to handle clinical problems and had higher postclass knowledge retention and learning interest scores (P < 0.05). Practical exam scores and overall scores were significantly higher in the study group (P < 0.05), although written exam scores did not differ significantly.The combined PBL and SP teaching method was found to be superior to traditional LBL in improving the clinical skills and self-learning abilities of orthopedic residents. This approach enhances student engagement, clinical thinking, and overall educational outcomes, suggesting that it is a valuable addition to orthopedic resident training programs. CONCLUSIONS The combined PBL and SP teaching method was found to be superior to traditional LBL in improving the clinical skills and self-learning abilities of orthopedic residents. This approach enhances student engagement, clinical thinking, and overall educational outcomes, suggesting that it is a valuable addition to orthopedic resident training programs.

Abstract: Many national medical governing bodies encourage physicians to engage in continuing professional development (CPD) activities to cultivate their knowledge and skills to ensure their clinical practice reflects the current standards and evidence base. However, physicians often encounter various barriers that hinder their participation in CPD programs, such as time constraints, a lack of centralized coordination, and limited opportunities for self-assessment. The literature has highlighted the strength of using question-based learning interventions to augment physician learning and further enable change in practice. CPD By the Minute (CPD-Min) is a smartphone-enabled web-based app that was developed to address self-assessment gaps and barriers to engagement in CPD activities. BACKGROUND Many national medical governing bodies encourage physicians to engage in continuing professional development (CPD) activities to cultivate their knowledge and skills to ensure their clinical practice reflects the current standards and evidence base.

The literature has highlighted the strength of using question-based learning interventions to augment physician learning and further enable change in practice. CPD By the Minute (CPD-Min) is a smartphone-enabled web-based app that was developed to address self-assessment gaps and barriers to engagement in CPD activities.This study aimed to assess the app using four objectives: (1) engagement and use of the app throughout the study, (2) effectiveness of this tool as a CPD activity, (3) relevance of the disseminated information to physicians' practice, and (4) acceptability to physicians of this novel tool as an educational initiative. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the app using four objectives: (1) engagement and use of the app throughout the study, (2) effectiveness of this tool as a CPD activity, (3) relevance of the disseminated information to physicians' practice, and (4) acceptability to physicians of this novel tool as an educational initiative.The CPD-Min app disseminated 2 multiple-choice questions (1-min each) each week with feedback and references. Participants included licensed staff physicians, fellows, and residents across Canada. A concurrent multimethods study was conducted, consisting of preintervention and postintervention surveys, semistructured interviews, and app analytics. Guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework, the qualitative data were analyzed deductively and inductively. METHODS The CPD-Min app disseminated 2 multiple-choice questions (1-min each) each week with feedback and references. Participants included licensed staff physicians, fellows, and residents across Canada. A concurrent multimethods study was conducted, consisting of preintervention and postintervention surveys, semistructured interviews, and app analytics. Guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework, the qualitative data were analyzed deductively and inductively.Of the 105 Canadian anesthesiologists participating in the study, 89 (84.8%) were staff physicians, 12 (11.4%) were fellows, and 4 (3.8%) were residents. Participants completed 110 questions each over the course of 52 weeks, with an average completion rate of 75% (SD 33%). In total, 40.9% (43/105) of participants answered >90% of the questions, including 15.2% (16/105) who completed all questions. Moreover, 69% (52/75) of participants reported the app to be an effective and valuable resource for their practice and to enhance continuous learning. Most participants (63/75, 84%) who completed the postsurveys reported that they would likely continue using the app as a CPD tool. These findings were further supported by the interview data. Three key themes were identified: the practical design of the novel educational app facilitates its adoption by clinicians, the app was perceived as a useful knowledge tool for continuous learning, and the app's low-stakes testing environment cultivated independent learning attitudes.

The positive feedback and increased acceptance of the app supports it as an innovative tool for knowledge retention and CPD. Future research efforts should prioritize evaluating the app's long-term sustainability and its impact on physicians' practice, as well as exploring alternative approaches (such as artificial intelligence-based tools) for generating questions.

Abstract: Emergency medical service (EMS) professionals are increasingly using point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) into the prehospital management and triage of critically ill patients. However, few institutions offer organized POCUS training for this community. Our goal was to offer and evaluate the effectiveness of a simulation-based POCUS course for EMS professionals. OBJECTIVE Emergency medical service (EMS) professionals are increasingly using point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) into the prehospital management and triage of critically ill patients. However, few institutions offer organized POCUS training for this community. Our goal was to offer and evaluate the effectiveness of a simulation-based POCUS course for EMS professionals.We developed and implemented an eight-hour course to train EMS providers in the fundamentals of POCUS for blunt trauma patients. The course design included lectures, standardized patients hands-on scanning, simulation-based ultrasound cases, clinical cases based on real patients, and an end-of-course review game. Before the day of the course, participants were assigned e-learning modules on the fundamentals of POCUS and on the Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma Exam (eFAST). The effectiveness of the course was evaluated using Kirkpatrick's methodology for Level 1 (course evaluation by participants) and Level 2 (pre- and post-course knowledge assessments including image interpretation). Pre- and post-knowledge scores were presented using means and ranges. Percent improvements and a paired sample t-test with the effect size (Cohen's d) were used to compare pre-post improvements. For course evaluation ratings, the mean Likert scale rating was calculated.

For course evaluation ratings, the mean Likert scale rating was calculated.A total of 128 learners (103 paramedics, 22 flight nurses, and one EMS physician from 32 EMS agencies, as well as two United States Army medics, completed the course. The average age of participants was 39.0 years, and 98 (76.6%) were male. The pre-course assessment mean knowledge score was 67.6% (95% CI 64.7-70.5). The post-course mean knowledge score was 89.0% (95% CI 87.3-97.0), resulting in a 21.4% point increase (p <.001; Cohen's d = 1.52). We received 122 course evaluations. Participants expressed nearly unanimous strong agreement across all measures, with a mean rating ranging from 4.8 to 4.9 on a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire.

Participants expressed nearly unanimous strong agreement across all measures, with a mean rating ranging from 4.8 to 4.9 on a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire.Our data suggests that an 8-hour POCUS course, incorporating e-learning and simulation, can significantly improve EMS providers' knowledge of the fundamentals of POCUS and image interpretation of eFAST examination in trauma patients. Course evaluation results are highly supportive of this course's benefits. As EMS agencies increasingly incorporate POCUS for patient care, effective and efficient training methodologies will be critical for successful implementation. Our course offers one approach as part of a comprehensive training program. Further studies should assess POCUS utilization and sustained knowledge retention.

Abstract: Background: Traditional methods of anatomy instruction often fall short in promoting clinically relevant, long-term understanding, particularly in surgical domains such as otorhinolaryngology (ENT), which require high-level spatial reasoning and procedural competence. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative, multimodal Fusion Teaching-Learning Method (TLM), conceptualised as “From Pixels to Scalpels,” that integrates digital visualisation, hands-on engagement, and collaborative case-based tasks in enhancing the comprehension, retention, and clinical application of ENT surgical anatomy among MBBS students. Methods: A prospective, crossover observational study was conducted involving 60 Phase III Part I MBBS students at a tertiary teaching institution. Participants experienced both traditional and Fusion TLM interventions across two ENT topics, with outcomes assessed through pre-, post-, and two-week retention multiple-choice question (MCQ) tests, rubric-based team assessments, and structured perception surveys. Statistical analysis included paired and unpaired t-tests for knowledge comparisons and descriptive analysis for student feedback. Results: The Fusion TLM significantly improved post-test scores (p = 0.007 and 0.004), rubric-based application scores (p = 0.003 and 0.002), and knowledge retention (p = 0.003 and 0.001) compared to traditional methods. Over 90% of students reported enhanced engagement, conceptual clarity, and confidence, with 75% affirming improved self-efficacy and clinical reasoning abilities. Conclusion: The “From Pixels to Scalpels” model demonstrated clear pedagogical superiority, combining cognitive, psychomotor, and affective domains to foster deeper learning and clinical relevance. Its scalability, learner-centred design, and alignment with Competency-Based Medical Education (CBME) make it a promising strategy for anatomical education in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Introduction: Cardiovascular disease is frequently addressed in primary care, and professional association guidelines dictating the standard of care frequently change. Teaching clinical practice guidelines to residents remains important to promote knowledge retention and subsequent implementation in patient care. Gamification utilizes social elements and technology to promote accessible and active learning that enhances learner confidence, engagement, and knowledge. Data assessing gamification in teaching guideline-based care remains limited. We evaluated a gamified cardiometabolic health curriculum utilizing a student response system (SRS) to assess the benefits of gamification in teaching guidelines to internal medicine residents.  Methods: We developed a gamified cardiometabolic health curriculum for categorical residents in internal medicine utilizing KAHOOT!® (Oslo, Norway). KAHOOT!® is an SRS where learners utilize their mobile devices to answer questions. Speed and accuracy contributed to placement on a digital leaderboard. Our curriculum consisted of one academic half-day with five 45-minute virtual didactics reviewing guideline-based management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic-associated fatty liver dysfunction (MAFLD), and weight management. KAHOOT!® was selected to promote ease of participation. The gamified format was compared to a traditional slide-based format. Residents are randomly assigned one of five clinic groups. Three groups received the gamified format, and two received the traditional format, without crossover. Residents were invited to complete anonymous pre- and post-surveys, which collected quantitative data such as Likert scale ratings of confidence and satisfaction with learning and test performance. Results: All residents (108 of 108) received the curriculum. Around 59% (64) received the gamified format, and 44 (41%) received the traditional format. Pre-post surveys were compared via a matched analysis. Anonymous surveys were matched via a code provided by each resident, and residents who completed only one of the two surveys were excluded. Likert scale ratings of confidence in management increased for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, MAFLD, and weight management, but not for T2DM, likely as T2DM had the lowest number of matched resident pairs analyzed. Comparing gamified and traditional formats, there was no difference in the post-curricular change in absolute score on board-style questions or increase in Likert scale ratings of confidence. A majority of residents (90.9%) who received the gamified format found it engaging, while a minority (14.2%) of residents who received the traditional format found it engaging. Analysis was limited by a low response rate of 21.6%. Anonymous pre-post surveys limited the assessment of non-response bias and whether respondent characteristics differed from those of non-respondents. Discussion: A gamified format was similar to a traditional format in increasing resident confidence in managing cardiometabolic health conditions and knowledge of guidelines. A gamified format was felt to be more engaging. Although the low response rate limits generalizability, we present initial data supporting the efficacy of a virtual gamified curriculum utilizing an SRS to teach clinical practice guidelines. Future avenues for study include assessments of long-term knowledge retention and whether engagement translates to increased learner participation.

Abstract: Exsanguinating hemorrhage is the most common cause of preventable trauma death at the injury scene, and it is often due to the inability to control bleeding immediately. Training layperson first responders (LFR) in trauma care, particularly hemorrhage control, has been recommended to address this trauma care gap. We conducted a systematic review (SR) to analyze the effect of hemorrhage control training courses for LFRs on knowledge, skill, and attitude to intervene in trauma patients. BACKGROUND Exsanguinating hemorrhage is the most common cause of preventable trauma death at the injury scene, and it is often due to the inability to control bleeding immediately. Training layperson first responders (LFR) in trauma care, particularly hemorrhage control, has been recommended to address this trauma care gap. We conducted a systematic review (SR) to analyze the effect of hemorrhage control training courses for LFRs on knowledge, skill, and attitude to intervene in trauma patients.PubMed and Google Scholar databases were used to identify relevant peer-reviewed research articles describing evaluations of hemorrhage control courses for LFR between 2013 and 2024. Studies examined whether the training course was implemented in low- and middle-income countries (LMICS); trainees were LFR and had outcome measures, including knowledge, skills, attitudes (confidence gained, willingness, comfort, and likelihood to intervene) toward care utilization for trauma patients, as well as outcomes. METHODS PubMed and Google Scholar databases were used to identify relevant peer-reviewed research articles describing evaluations of hemorrhage control courses for LFR between 2013 and 2024. Studies examined whether the training course was implemented in low- and middle-income countries (LMICS); trainees were LFR and had outcome measures, including knowledge, skills, attitudes (confidence gained, willingness, comfort, and likelihood to intervene) toward care utilization for trauma patients, as well as outcomes.The SR included 12 articles. The quality of the selected studies was generally high. Five studies (42%) reported improved willingness, confidence, comfort, and the likelihood of responding safely to trauma. Nine studies (75%) used pre-and post-tests to document knowledge acquired, and five studies (42%) used knowledge retention evaluation at different intervals and reported substantial knowledge and skill reductions after a few months (1-3 months, 3-6 months, or both 6 and 9 months or up to 3 years). A few studies followed incident reports to document the utilization of knowledge and skills acquired during training. None reported patient outcomes. RESULTS The SR included 12 articles.

Abstract: Learning about neurological syndromes is an essential component of medical education, but traditional teaching methods often lack interactivity and practical engagement. This study investigates the impact of an innovative teaching approach using the Neurological Syndrome Card Game (NSCG) on students' learning outcomes. BACKGROUND Learning about neurological syndromes is an essential component of medical education, but traditional teaching methods often lack interactivity and practical engagement. This study investigates the impact of an innovative teaching approach using the Neurological Syndrome Card Game (NSCG) on students' learning outcomes.A randomized controlled trial design was implemented, with participants divided into an experimental group and a control group. The control group received traditional lecture-based instruction (e.g., PowerPoint presentations and case analyses), whereas the experimental group engaged in NSCG-based learning. The game involved card-matching competitions and anatomical injury location tasks to enhance students' recognition, understanding, and memory of neurological syndromes. Learning outcomes were evaluated through assessments of learning effectiveness, knowledge retention rates, cognitive load, and learning experience. METHODS A randomized controlled trial design was implemented, with participants divided into an experimental group and a control group. The control group received traditional lecture-based instruction (e.g., PowerPoint presentations and case analyses), whereas the experimental group engaged in NSCG-based learning. The game involved card-matching competitions and anatomical injury location tasks to enhance students' recognition, understanding, and memory of neurological syndromes. Learning outcomes were evaluated through assessments of learning effectiveness, knowledge retention rates, cognitive load, and learning experience.A total of 48 students participated in the study. No significant differences were found in baseline characteristics between the groups. Following the intervention, the experimental group showed significantly better immediate learning effects at 1 week (13.33 ± 2.12 vs. 11.92 ± 1.44, t = 3.344, P = 0.002), 3 weeks (12.83 ± 2.04 vs. 10.63 ± 1.86, t = 3.923, P = 0.000), and 6 weeks (10.04 ± 1.20 vs. 7.79 ± 1.61, t = 5.484, P = 0.000). In terms of long-term memory retention, the experimental group demonstrated superior knowledge retention rates at all time points: 22.53% at week 1, 29.49% at week 3, and 31.12% at week 6. Regarding cognitive load, the experimental group exhibited significantly lower total scores (46.96 ± 1.65 vs. 69.08 ± 4.06) and scores across all dimensions (P < 0.05). Evaluations of the learning experience indicated that students in the experimental group rated their interest and memory outcomes more positively. RESULTS A total of 48 students participated in the study. No significant differences were found in baseline characteristics between the groups. Following the intervention, the experimental group showed significantly better immediate learning effects at 1 week (13.33 ± 2.12 vs. 11.92 ± 1.44, t = 3.344, P = 0.002), 3 weeks (12.83 ± 2.04 vs. 10.63 ± 1.86, t = 3.923, P = 0.000), and 6 weeks (10.04 ± 1.20 vs. 7.79 ± 1.61, t = 5.484, P = 0.000).

Evaluations of the learning experience indicated that students in the experimental group rated their interest and memory outcomes more positively.The NSCG-based teaching method significantly enhances students' learning and memory retention of neurological syndromes, reduces cognitive load, and increases learning interest. This method may be a useful approach for enhancing clinical syndrome teaching in medical education. CONCLUSION The NSCG-based teaching method significantly enhances students' learning and memory retention of neurological syndromes, reduces cognitive load, and increases learning interest. This method may be a useful approach for enhancing clinical syndrome teaching in medical education.

Abstract: As of 2021, there were 47 million immigrants in the United States. Immigrant populations are uninsured at higher rates than US citizens, leading many to rely on emergency departments (ED) for their healthcare needs. However, emergency physicians (EP) often lack training on the unique challenges faced by this population, necessitating educational interventions. BACKGROUND As of 2021, there were 47 million immigrants in the United States. Immigrant populations are uninsured at higher rates than US citizens, leading many to rely on emergency departments (ED) for their healthcare needs. However, emergency physicians (EP) often lack training on the unique challenges faced by this population, necessitating educational interventions.We implemented educational interventions for an urban emergency medicine residency program using Kern's six-step approach for curriculum development to inform EPs of existing immigration-specific patient resources; teach social-medical-legal best practices with regard to asking, documenting, and sharing immigration-specific health information; and increase awareness of ED-relevant local policies. We developed three educational interventions.in collaboration with legal organizations, and community experts. To evaluate the success of these interventions we administered a pre- and post-survey to 64 EPs (36% of 178 targeted learners) RESULTS: We found a significant increase in confidence and knowledge, with an average 5-point Likert scale score improvement of 1.47 (P < .001) in all responses and 1.40 (P < .001) in paired responses, and an improvement in test scores on the three knowledge-based questions of 30.66% (P < .001) in all responses and 33% (P = .02) in paired responses.

The curriculum offers a framework for other EDs aiming to address healthcare inequities for this population. Future research can explore long-term knowledge retention, detailed educational tool utilization, and the impact on patients.

Abstract: Pyomo is an open-source optimization modeling software that has undergone significant evolution since its inception in 2008. Pyomo has evolved to enhance flexibility, solver integration, and community engagement. Modern collaborative tools for open-source software have facilitated the development of new Pyomo functionality and improved our development process through automated testing and performance-tracking pipelines. However, Pyomo faces challenges typical of research software, including resource limitations and knowledge retention. The Pyomo team's commitment to better development practices and community engagement reflects a proactive approach to these issues. We describe Pyomo's development journey, highlighting both successes and failures, in the hopes that other open-source research software packages may benefit from our experiences.Pyomo is an open-source optimization modeling software that has undergone significant evolution since its inception in 2008.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) in healthcare education offers innovative ways to enhance collaborative learning and improve patient safety. This narrative review examines the synergistic impact of AI-powered virtual reality (VR) simulations, such as those used in surgical training and patient communication, on knowledge acquisition, clinical skill development, and collaborative competencies among healthcare students. It also explores long-term knowledge retention, ethical considerations within virtual scenarios, and the psychological impact of high-stakes simulations on learner resilience. INTRODUCTION The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) in healthcare education offers innovative ways to enhance collaborative learning and improve patient safety. This narrative review examines the synergistic impact of AI-powered virtual reality (VR) simulations, such as those used in surgical training and patient communication, on knowledge acquisition, clinical skill development, and collaborative competencies among healthcare students. It also explores long-term knowledge retention, ethical considerations within virtual scenarios, and the psychological impact of high-stakes simulations on learner resilience.This review is distinguished by its exhaustive literature search, which spanned PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, and other pertinent databases, to identify studies published between 2005 and 2024. The distinct focus on AI and VR interventions in healthcare education, particularly those with outcomes related to interdisciplinary learning or patient safety, distinguishes this review. Data were thematically analyzed across domains, including adaptive learning, technical skill development, teamwork, patient safety, and ethics. METHODS This review is distinguished by its exhaustive literature search, which spanned PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, and other pertinent databases, to identify studies published between 2005 and 2024. The distinct focus on AI and VR interventions in healthcare education, particularly those with outcomes related to interdisciplinary learning or patient safety, distinguishes this review. Data were thematically analyzed across domains, including adaptive learning, technical skill development, teamwork, patient safety, and ethics.The findings of this review carry significant practical implications. Five key themes emerged: adaptive learning (n = 17), immersive skill development (n = 10), teamwork enhancement (n = 10), patient safety (n = 18), and ethical considerations (n = 21). These themes underscore the potential of AI and VR in healthcare education. AI-driven adaptive systems enabled personalized VR training, enhancing engagement and knowledge retention. Real-time AI feedback during simulations improved decision-making in safe, controlled environments. Interdisciplinary team simulations enhanced communication and collaboration, which are crucial for effective clinical care. Ethical modules embedded in VR scenarios promoted moral reasoning. Several studies also reported increased learner confidence in performing clinical procedures following VR training, suggesting enhanced preparedness for practice.

Abstract: The construction management (CM) discipline presents a unique opportunity for gamification, as it thrives on creating immersive experiences that replicate real-world scenarios, aligning well with the practical and applied nature of CM education. Thus, this study through a bibliometric analysis and a narrative review, explored the application of gamified approaches in CM education by examining studies published and indexed in Scopus in the last fourteen years. Network visualization and science mapping were done using Biblioshiny™ software in R Studio and Visualization of Similarities viewer. Findings revealed four crucial applications of gamification in CM vis; (1) game theory for effective decision-making, (2) construction project management and education, (3) design and information management in construction projects and (4) intelligent and sustainable construction. Additionally, prominent gamified approaches in CM education can be categorized into tabletop games, digital games and computer-assisted games. Practically, the submissions of this study offer educators the ability to create more engaging and interactive learning environments that foster a deeper understanding of CM principles, improve knowledge retention and ultimately prepare students for successful careers in the construction industry.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for personalized learning path generation by integrating deep knowledge tracing and cognitive load estimation within a unified framework. We propose a dual-stream neural network architecture that simultaneously models students' knowledge states and cognitive load levels to optimize learning trajectories. The knowledge state tracking module employs a bidirectional Transformer with graph attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between knowledge components, while the cognitive load estimation module utilizes multimodal data analysis to dynamically assess mental effort during learning activities. A dual-objective optimization algorithm balances knowledge acquisition with cognitive load management to generate paths that maintain optimal challenge levels. Experimental evaluations across multiple educational domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy (87.5%), path quality (4.4/5), and learning efficiency (24.6% improvement). The implemented system supports real-time adaptation based on performance and cognitive state, resulting in reduced frustration, higher engagement, and improved knowledge retention. This research contributes to both theoretical understanding of learning processes and practical implementation of next-generation adaptive educational technologies.This paper presents a novel approach for personalized learning path generation by integrating deep knowledge tracing and cognitive load estimation within a unified framework.

Abstract: With the continuous advancement of medical technology and the frequent occurrence of disaster events, the training of health care workers in disaster nursing has become increasingly significant. However, traditional training methods often struggle to engage learners' interest and enthusiasm, making it challenging to simulate emergencies in real-life scenarios effectively. Gamification, as an innovative pedagogical approach that enhances the enjoyment and practicality of learning through the incorporation of game elements, has garnered considerable attention in the realm of disaster nursing education for health care workers in recent years. This review systematically evaluates its effectiveness and explores its advantages in improving training outcomes. Background With the continuous advancement of medical technology and the frequent occurrence of disaster events, the training of health care workers in disaster nursing has become increasingly significant. However, traditional training methods often struggle to engage learners' interest and enthusiasm, making it challenging to simulate emergencies in real-life scenarios effectively. Gamification, as an innovative pedagogical approach that enhances the enjoyment and practicality of learning through the incorporation of game elements, has garnered considerable attention in the realm of disaster nursing education for health care workers in recent years. This review systematically evaluates its effectiveness and explores its advantages in improving training outcomes.This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of gamified teaching methodologies in disaster nursing education and to identify the outcome of 16 indicators used in existing studies. Objective This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of gamified teaching methodologies in disaster nursing education and to identify the outcome of 16 indicators used in existing studies.This study was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, using the PICO-SD framework (Population, Intervention, Control, Outcome, Study Design) to establish the inclusion criteria. The researchers systematically searched 8 databases on February 10, 2025, including the Cochrane Library, PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and SCOPUS. Ultimately, 16 quasi-experimental studies investigating the application of gamified teaching in disaster nursing education were included in the analysis. For randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (RoB 2.0) was used for quality assessment; for quasi-experimental studies, the Joanna Briggs Institute Risk of Bias Tool for Non-Randomized Intervention Studies was used for methodological quality evaluation. Given the heterogeneity of study designs and the diversity of study indicators, this study used a narrative synthesis to integrate the findings.

Given the heterogeneity of study designs and the diversity of study indicators, this study used a narrative synthesis to integrate the findings.The studies included in this review comprised 1 RCT and 15 quasi-experimental designs. Six gamified formats exhibited positive outcomes. The effectiveness of these formats was assessed through various metrics, including theoretical knowledge (14 studies), practical skills (11 studies), learner satisfaction (9 studies), knowledge retention (4 studies), and self-efficacy (2 studies). All formats demonstrated improvements in knowledge and skills, with high levels of satisfaction reported. However, data on long-term retention were limited.

The effectiveness of these formats was assessed through various metrics, including theoretical knowledge (14 studies), practical skills (11 studies), learner satisfaction (9 studies), knowledge retention (4 studies), and self-efficacy (2 studies). All formats demonstrated improvements in knowledge and skills, with high levels of satisfaction reported. However, data on long-term retention were limited.Gamification teaching methods have shown significant potential to enhance core competencies such as emergency response, decision-making, and teamwork in disaster nursing education and have been effective in reinforcing learning engagement through elements such as cooperation, competition, scoring, and scenario simulation. However, there is a lack of standardized assessment frameworks for skill acquisition, longitudinal studies tracking behavior in real-life scenarios, and rigorous RCTs comparing it with traditional instruction. Although the existing evidence has not systematically confirmed its full effectiveness, based on the findings, this paper provides practical recommendations for developing and implementing gamified teaching strategies in disaster nursing education to enhance students' knowledge acquisition and practice.

Abstract: Education has continuously evolved to keep pace with advancements in information technology. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an innovative and effective learning approach that enhances student engagement, particularly in developing problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Since its introduction in the early 1980s, VR has gained increasing attention in nursing education due to its potential to improve learning outcomes and skill acquisition. However, there is a need for further research to explore its impact on critical thinking disposition among nursing students. BACKGROUND Education has continuously evolved to keep pace with advancements in information technology. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an innovative and effective learning approach that enhances student engagement, particularly in developing problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Since its introduction in the early 1980s, VR has gained increasing attention in nursing education due to its potential to improve learning outcomes and skill acquisition. However, there is a need for further research to explore its impact on critical thinking disposition among nursing students.This quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study was conducted with a convenience sample of 190 nursing students from Damietta University's Faculty of Nursing. Participants were assessed on their critical thinking disposition and VR-related knowledge at three time points: before the intervention, immediately after, and two months post-intervention. METHODS This quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study was conducted with a convenience sample of 190 nursing students from Damietta University's Faculty of Nursing. Participants were assessed on their critical thinking disposition and VR-related knowledge at three time points: before the intervention, immediately after, and two months post-intervention.The VR-based educational program aimed to improve students' critical thinking disposition and assess their knowledge of virtual reality before, during, and after the program. AIM The VR-based educational program aimed to improve students' critical thinking disposition and assess their knowledge of virtual reality before, during, and after the program.A statistically significant improvement in students' mean scores for critical thinking disposition was observed across all evaluations (p < 0.001). The effect size (η²p ≥ 0.14) indicated a substantial impact, reinforcing the effectiveness of the VR-based educational program in fostering higher-order cognitive skills. Additionally, students demonstrated increased retention of VR-related knowledge when assessed immediately after the program and again after two months. RESULTS A statistically significant improvement in students' mean scores for critical thinking disposition was observed across all evaluations (p < 0.001). The effect size (η²p ≥ 0.14) indicated a substantial impact, reinforcing the effectiveness of the VR-based educational program in fostering higher-order cognitive skills. Additionally, students demonstrated increased retention of VR-related knowledge when assessed immediately after the program and again after two months.This study highlights the transformative potential of VR as an educational tool in nursing. VR-based learning promotes active engagement, knowledge retention, and skill development in a safe and controlled environment. By integrating VR programs into nursing education, institutions can enhance students' critical thinking, collaboration, and communication skills, ultimately preparing them for real-world clinical practice. Given these findings, educational institutions should consider incorporating VR technology to support the continuous development of essential nursing competencies. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the transformative potential of VR as an educational tool in nursing. VR-based learning promotes active engagement, knowledge retention, and skill development in a safe and controlled environment.

Abstract: Traditional teaching methods in Aircraft Maintenance Technology (AMT) often struggle to maintain student engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention. While gamification has been recognised as a potential solution, its application in AMT education remains underexplored, particularly in bridging theoretical knowledge with practical skill acquisition. This study investigates the effectiveness of Kahoot-based gamification in enhancing student engagement, motivation, knowledge retention, and practical skills development. A mixed-methods approach was employed, integrating quantitative surveys, pre- and post-assessments, and qualitative interviews with students and instructors. The study assessed 120 participants, revealing statistically significant improvements: engagement increased by 43.8%, motivation by 55.2%, knowledge retention by 41.2%, and practical skills by 51.6%. Qualitative findings supported these results, with students reporting higher participation, improved concept recall, and greater enthusiasm. Instructors observed enhanced confidence in applying theoretical knowledge. Despite these benefits, challenges such as internet connectivity issues, time constraints, and question format limitations were identified. The study recommends a blended learning approach integrating gamification with hands-on training, scenario-based exercises, and emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Beyond AMT, these findings highlight gamification’s potential in technical and vocational education, emphasising the need for future research on adaptive gamification models and AI-driven learning platforms.

Abstract: Purpose Despite ongoing safety efforts, construction sites remain some of the most hazardous workplaces. This study introduces an innovative occupational safety and health administration (OSHA) training approach by creating a realistic virtual construction environment using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery and a game engine. Integrating OSHA regulations makes safety instructions more effective than traditional training. Design/methodology/approach The research employs UAV-derived photogrammetry to generate a 3D textured mesh model of an active construction site. This model is integrated into a game engine to develop an interactive, first-person simulation where users explore the site and receive safety instructions at hazard points. Validation was conducted through questionnaire surveys of 13 construction professionals and 25 undergraduate students. Findings The study shows that interactive game-based learning significantly improves trainees’ ability to identify and understand site-specific hazards. Survey responses from students and construction professionals indicated that the game is more effective in teaching safety protocols than traditional OSHA 30 training. Practical implications The study demonstrates that integrating UAV photogrammetry with game engines enhances construction safety training by improving hazard recognition and knowledge retention. Survey results show higher effectiveness than traditional training. This approach enables realistic, site-specific safety instruction, supporting OSHA compliance and reducing accidents through interactive, immersive learning. Originality/value This research enhances safety training by integrating high-fidelity 3D models from UAV photogrammetry with a game engine to develop an interactive learning platform. Unlike traditional methods with generic simulations, this approach reflects the specific conditions and hazards of active construction sites, offering tailored safety instructions.

Abstract: Background Knowledge retention is crucial in medical education, yet traditional study methods often fail to ensure long-term recall. Spaced repetition, a cognitive learning strategy that reinforces information at increasing intervals, has shown promise in enhancing retention and engagement. While widely used in self-directed learning, its role in structured medical education remains underexplored. This study evaluates the effectiveness of spaced repetition in improving knowledge retention and student engagement in undergraduate paediatric education, offering insights into its potential for enhancing learning outcomes. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of spaced-repetition in improving knowledge retention and student engagement in undergraduate paediatric education. Method A quasi-experimental study was conducted over 6 months at the Department of Paediatrics, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi (Meghe). Ninety final-year medical students were divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention group used digital flashcards following spaced-repetition intervals of 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days. The control group followed traditional study methods. Knowledge retention was assessed using pre-tests and post-tests, each containing 20 multiple-choice questions. Data were analysed using paired and independent t -tests. Qualitative feedback from the intervention group was thematically analysed to assess engagement and motivation. Results Pre-test scores were similar between groups (intervention: 11.42; control: 11.58, p = 0.0573). Post-test scores showed significant improvement in the intervention group (16.24) compared to the control group (11.89, p < 0.0001). The intervention group showed a significant increase in scores ( p < 0.0001), while no significant change was seen in the control group ( p = 0.1138). Over 90% of students in the intervention group reported improved retention, engagement, and confidence. Conclusion Spaced repetition significantly enhanced knowledge retention and engagement in undergraduate paediatric education. This method offers a promising approach to improve long-term learning outcomes in medical education.

Abstract: Introduction The inclusion of active learning in veterinary medical education has received significant focus in recent years. Game-based learning is an unconventional form of active learning and its use in education within the health sciences has been investigated. Methods This study evaluated the use of a card game to teach antimicrobial use in dogs and cats with bacterial diseases as a supplement to traditional methods of teaching. Results This study found that third- and fourth-year veterinary students’ comfort in antimicrobial decision-making increased for four infectious diseases following the inclusion of a card game during rounds. No similar improvement was noted for a disease that was not included in the card game. Students perceived that the game improved their understanding of antimicrobials in dogs and cats and students universally enjoyed playing the game. Discussion The role of games in veterinary medical education should be further explored, especially studies that evaluate knowledge retention throughout the duration of their educational experience.

Abstract: Insomnia is a common and debilitating disorder that is often undiagnosed and untreated. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is the first-line treatment for insomnia, though the lack of trained providers is a major barrier to accessibility. To address this issue, an online provider training platform, CBTI web , was launched in April 2020. The objective of this study was to determine the knowledge and implementation practices of providers 1 year after their successful completion of CBTI web . An online survey was sent to 569 providers who completed CBTI web training within 3 months of launch. Providers were asked about knowledge retention, use of CBTI with patients, barriers, and facilitators to the use of CBTI and acceptability, feasibility, and intervention appropriateness of CBTI. Two hundred and thirty-three providers completed the survey. Results revealed that most of the providers retained knowledge gained during CBTI web and that self-efficacy for CBTI was positively associated with CBTI use with their patients. Common barriers endorsed by providers were primarily related to difficulty promoting patient-buy-in for CBTI and difficulty finding CBTI supervision and consultation.

Abstract: Conventional deep neural network-based methods for fusing thermal infrared and visible images often incur knowledge loss, negatively impacting fused image quality. To address this limitation, this paper presents a novel method named KDS-RADFNet, employing knowledge distillation to fuse these modalities. The approach features a specifically designed knowledge distillation network architecture. A teacher network, utilizing a dual-branch structure, separately extracts thermal radiation features from thermal infrared images and gradient texture features from visible images. Complementary knowledge, formed after cross-modal feature alignment, serves as supervisory signals. A student network learns and integrates this information. A distillation loss function facilitates the transfer of the teacher’s feature representations to the student network, establishing a balance between thermal radiation sensitivity and textural-structural fidelity. This process effectively suppresses feature interference during the fusion of multimodal source images. Furthermore, an unsupervised semantic segmentation network is cascaded with the fusion network. Joint supervision using semantic loss and fusion loss guides the training, enhancing the utility of the fused images for downstream high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the fusion network enhanced by the knowledge distillation method encodes knowledge more effectively, leading to improved fusion performance.

Abstract: Traditional methods of anatomy instruction often fall short in promoting clinically relevant, long-term understanding, particularly in surgical domains such as otorhinolaryngology (ENT), which require high-level spatial reasoning and procedural competence. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative, multimodal Fusion Teaching-Learning Method (TLM), conceptualised as "From Pixels to Scalpels," that integrates digital visualisation, hands-on engagement, and collaborative case-based tasks in enhancing the comprehension, retention, and clinical application of ENT surgical anatomy among MBBS students. BACKGROUND Traditional methods of anatomy instruction often fall short in promoting clinically relevant, long-term understanding, particularly in surgical domains such as otorhinolaryngology (ENT), which require high-level spatial reasoning and procedural competence. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative, multimodal Fusion Teaching-Learning Method (TLM), conceptualised as "From Pixels to Scalpels," that integrates digital visualisation, hands-on engagement, and collaborative case-based tasks in enhancing the comprehension, retention, and clinical application of ENT surgical anatomy among MBBS students.A prospective, crossover observational study was conducted involving 60 Phase III Part I MBBS students at a tertiary teaching institution. Participants experienced both traditional and Fusion TLM interventions across two ENT topics, with outcomes assessed through pre-, post-, and two-week retention multiple-choice question (MCQ) tests, rubric-based team assessments, and structured perception surveys. Statistical analysis included paired and unpaired t-tests for knowledge comparisons and descriptive analysis for student feedback. METHODS A prospective, crossover observational study was conducted involving 60 Phase III Part I MBBS students at a tertiary teaching institution. Participants experienced both traditional and Fusion TLM interventions across two ENT topics, with outcomes assessed through pre-, post-, and two-week retention multiple-choice question (MCQ) tests, rubric-based team assessments, and structured perception surveys. Statistical analysis included paired and unpaired t-tests for knowledge comparisons and descriptive analysis for student feedback.The Fusion TLM significantly improved post-test scores (p = 0.007 and 0.004), rubric-based application scores (p = 0.003 and 0.002), and knowledge retention (p = 0.003 and 0.001) compared to traditional methods. Over 90% of students reported enhanced engagement, conceptual clarity, and confidence, with 75% affirming improved self-efficacy and clinical reasoning abilities. RESULTS The Fusion TLM significantly improved post-test scores (p = 0.007 and 0.004), rubric-based application scores (p = 0.003 and 0.002), and knowledge retention (p = 0.003 and 0.001) compared to traditional methods. Over 90% of students reported enhanced engagement, conceptual clarity, and confidence, with 75% affirming improved self-efficacy and clinical reasoning abilities.The "From Pixels to Scalpels" model demonstrated clear pedagogical superiority, combining cognitive, psychomotor, and affective domains to foster deeper learning and clinical relevance. Its scalability, learner-centred design, and alignment with Competency-Based Medical Education (CBME) make it a promising strategy for anatomical education in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is frequently addressed in primary care, and professional association guidelines dictating the standard of care frequently change. Teaching clinical practice guidelines to residents remains important to promote knowledge retention and subsequent implementation in patient care. Gamification utilizes social elements and technology to promote accessible and active learning that enhances learner confidence, engagement, and knowledge. Data assessing gamification in teaching guideline-based care remains limited. We evaluated a gamified cardiometabolic health curriculum utilizing a student response system (SRS) to assess the benefits of gamification in teaching guidelines to internal medicine residents.  Methods: We developed a gamified cardiometabolic health curriculum for categorical residents in internal medicine utilizing KAHOOT!® (Oslo, Norway). KAHOOT!® is an SRS where learners utilize their mobile devices to answer questions. Speed and accuracy contributed to placement on a digital leaderboard. Our curriculum consisted of one academic half-day with five 45-minute virtual didactics reviewing guideline-based management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic-associated fatty liver dysfunction (MAFLD), and weight management. KAHOOT!® was selected to promote ease of participation. The gamified format was compared to a traditional slide-based format. Residents are randomly assigned one of five clinic groups. Three groups received the gamified format, and two received the traditional format, without crossover. Residents were invited to complete anonymous pre- and post-surveys, which collected quantitative data such as Likert scale ratings of confidence and satisfaction with learning and test performance.

Three groups received the gamified format, and two received the traditional format, without crossover. Residents were invited to complete anonymous pre- and post-surveys, which collected quantitative data such as Likert scale ratings of confidence and satisfaction with learning and test performance.All residents (108 of 108) received the curriculum. Around 59% (64) received the gamified format, and 44 (41%) received the traditional format. Pre-post surveys were compared via a matched analysis. Anonymous surveys were matched via a code provided by each resident, and residents who completed only one of the two surveys were excluded. Likert scale ratings of confidence in management increased for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, MAFLD, and weight management, but not for T2DM, likely as T2DM had the lowest number of matched resident pairs analyzed. Comparing gamified and traditional formats, there was no difference in the post-curricular change in absolute score on board-style questions or increase in Likert scale ratings of confidence. A majority of residents (90.9%) who received the gamified format found it engaging, while a minority (14.2%) of residents who received the traditional format found it engaging. Analysis was limited by a low response rate of 21.6%. Anonymous pre-post surveys limited the assessment of non-response bias and whether respondent characteristics differed from those of non-respondents.

Abstract: An off-campus practical course is one in which students receive practical training in a vocational workplace outside of their educational institution. These courses focus on practical skills rather than academic knowledge and are essential for students to gain real-world experience and develop skills needed in the modern workforce. The research objective is to explore the continuous development of off-campus practical courses using the Outcome-Based Education (OBE) framework. The study used both qualitative and quantitative research methods, with 900 structured questionnaires distributed and 847 valid responses collected from students and teachers. The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS software, and the qualitative data were analyzed using NVivo software. The findings highlight that off-campus practical courses improve students’ problem-solving skills, practical application abilities, industry-relevant performance, and engagement compared to traditional classroom-based education. Theoretically, this study contributes to the growing body of research on OBE by demonstrating how off-campus practical courses, when aligned with OBE principles, can better equip students with the skills required by modern industries. The study enriches the OBE framework by providing evidence of how it enhances not only technical knowledge retention but also fosters critical competencies such as problem-solving, industry-specific performance, and engagement. Practically, the study provides insights for educators and industry stakeholders to design off-campus programs that align with both academic and vocational outcomes. The novelty of this study lies in its exploration of how off-campus practical courses can be continuously improved to better prepare students for the challenges of the contemporary workplace.

Abstract: Education 4.0 represents a visionary approach to the future of education, aiming to enhance teaching and learning through advanced technologies. The aim of this research is to determine student attitudes toward the use of Education 4.0 tools in the 7th-grade Science course Electrical Circuits unit. To achieve this, an attitude test was developed to evaluate the integration of Education 4.0 tools into the Science curriculum, and student attitudes were assessed using this test. A "quasi-experimental design with pre-test and post-test control group," one of the quantitative research methods, was used in the study. The research involved 41 seventh-grade students from one public secondary schools in Turkey, with 21 students in the experimental group and 20 in the control group. The "Attitude Scale toward the Use of Education 4.0 Tools in Science Teaching," developed by the researchers, was used as the data collection instrument. The experimental phase lasted four weeks (16 lesson hours), during which the experimental group engaged in activities involving Education 4.0 tools, while the control group followed the curriculum-prescribed activities. The t-test results of the collected data revealed a statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of the experimental and control groups, with the experimental group showing more favorable outcomes. The research findings reveal that students exhibit a positive attitude toward the use of Education 4.0 tools in science education. These results suggest that the integration of Education 4.0 into science education enhances students’ understanding of abstract electrical concepts such as electric current, potential difference, resistance, and Ohm’s Law, improves knowledge retention, and transforms the learning process into an interactive and discovery-oriented experience. Furthermore, Education 4.0 tools have contributed to the improvement of learning outcomes by promoting student engagement and make learning processes more efficient by improving students’ ability to use technology effectively.

Abstract: This study originates from the observation during teaching and student interactions that students in industry-academic cooperative programs have very limited time to dedicate to coursework. The target group for this research consists of third-year students in the Mechanical Engineering industry-academia collaborative training program, and sessions are conducted in the shared computer lab, Room 312. All 40 students were informed of the study details and signed consent forms. This research was initiated based on observations from teaching sessions and internship evaluations, which revealed that these students face challenges such as heavy workloads, condensed class schedules, and limited familiarity with programming. With limited classroom time, designing content that captures students' attention and enhances learning efficiency is a primary objective of this study. This research introduces a topic-based teaching approach, which was pilot-tested in the 2021 academic year and fully implemented in the 2022 academic year. The topic-based approach comprises three stages: topic explanation and programming implementation, problem-based exercises with peer learning, and results presentation with in-depth discussion. After completing each topic, both qualitative and quantitative questionnaires are administered to facilitate rapid instructional feedback, thereby scientifically refining the teaching and learning process. The study findings show high effectiveness in quantitative metrics, with student evaluations consistently above 4 out of 5 and a gradual increase in satisfaction with the teaching team as topic difficulty rose (from 4.48 to 4.70). In qualitative feedback, students expressed strong agreement that the topic-based approach enhanced their understanding of programming applications and techniques, peer interactions deepened knowledge retention, and team presentations fostered greater engagement. Course evaluation scores improved from 4.03 to 4.49, and final grades increased significantly from 70.23 to 87.26 (with a 12.7% improvement in teaching effectiveness and a 24.2% increase in overall semester grades.). These results indicate that, compared to conventional teaching methods, the topic-based approach effectively ignites students' enthusiasm for learning and improves learning outcomes.

Musculoskeletal Anatomy Education: A Survey of North American Medical Programs

Author: Orchard, Taylor1    ; Peeler, Jason11 Max Rady College of Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/musculoskeletal-anatomy-education-survey-north/docview/3228972652/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Postgraduate data reveal that most physicians lack adequate anatomical knowledge and clinical confidence when practicing musculoskeletal (MSK) medicine. Curricular data from nationally accredited medical programs clearly indicate that the total time dedicated to gross anatomy instruction has decreased over recent decades. However, little information is available regarding the MSK anatomy learning environment across accredited medical programs in North America. The purpose of this study was to document the current state of preclinical MSK anatomy education across North American medical programs. A survey was sent to all 14 English‐speaking Canadian and 135 of the 158 American accredited medical programs. The survey had a 100% response rate from Canadian programs and 43% from American programs. The results indicated that the mean time spent learning preclinical MSK anatomy varied widely across both Canadian (29.8 h ± 13.7, range 12–60, median 29, mode 12) and American (50.8 h ± 46.2, range 2–280, median 35, mode 30) programs, most of them integrating anatomy learning into the clinical learning environment (56%). All but one program reported using cadaveric‐based instruction (99%) and the majority taught radiological correlates (94%) and surface anatomy (71%) within their curriculum. Diverse modes of instruction were used by all programs, but didactic lectures remained the most frequent form (89%). While a variety of learning resources were used to support student learning, the type of resource varied significantly, Canadian programs most commonly providing a “curriculum‐specific” notes package (86%) and American programs most commonly requiring an anatomy atlas (84%). Summative and formative methods of evaluation were used by most programs (96%), final written examinations (79%) and ongoing in‐course evaluation (81%) being most popular. The results serve to document the current state of preclinical MSK anatomy education within nationally accredited allopathic medical programs and to illustrate the wide variability of the learning environment. Future research should be directed at establishing consistent standards for preclinical MSK anatomy education and investigating the long‐term effects on knowledge retention and clinical confidence.

Abstract: With increasing cost and time constraints, anatomy education has shifted away from classic dissection in favor of more effective teaching modalities. Here we investigated different teaching modalities on test performance and student satisfaction in the human gross anatomy laboratory at the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine (NYITCOM). The anatomy laboratory for first‐year osteopathic students at NYITCOM was divided into stations including radiology, case‐based learning, prosection, and dissection. Content covered at those stations was tested via anatomy laboratory examinations, comprised of computer‐based identification and multiple‐choice questions. Our data encompassed 459 first‐year medical students taking anatomy in 2022 at both NYITCOM campus sites (Arkansas and New York). We coded 355 exam questions by teaching modality used in the anatomy laboratory. Questions covered in multiple modalities were classified as ‘mixed’. Performance among modalities was analyzed using a three‐way ANOVA. Prosection‐based questions (mean = 75.6) performed significantly worse than dissection (mean = 83.4, p  < 0.01) and mixed‐modality (mean = 80.7, p  < 0.01). There was no significant difference in performance on material taught through dissection, radiology, case‐based activity and mixed modalities. In addition, we investigated the effect of an instructor at the case‐based activity station using repeated measures ANOVA. Our results indicate that case‐based activity stations performed better without an instructor present (mean = 77.4 v. 72.7; p  < 0.05). This study showed that teaching via prosection results in poorer performance than other teaching modalities and that dissection or hybrid models appear more effective in knowledge retention. Contrary to actual performance, students rated prosection as the most effective teaching modality. These results come at a critical time when COVID‐19 has accelerated the shift away from dissection in favor of virtual methods.

Abstract: This randomized controlled study examined the effects of peer education on nursing students' patient safety competence and attitudes toward medical errors. BACKGROUND This randomized controlled study examined the effects of peer education on nursing students' patient safety competence and attitudes toward medical errors.Sixty-two third-year nursing students were randomly assigned to two groups. The control group received patient safety education through the standard curriculum, and the intervention group participated in a peer education model. METHOD Sixty-two third-year nursing students were randomly assigned to two groups. The control group received patient safety education through the standard curriculum, and the intervention group participated in a peer education model.A weak negative correlation was found between follow-up scores on the Scale of Attitudes Toward Medical Errors (SATME) and the Patient Safety Competency Self-Evaluation Tool (PSCSE) (r = -0.279; p < .05). A moderate negative correlation emerged between SATME and PSCSE attitude subscale scores (r = -0.501; p < .01). RESULTS A weak negative correlation was found between follow-up scores on the Scale of Attitudes Toward Medical Errors (SATME) and the Patient Safety Competency Self-Evaluation Tool (PSCSE) (r = -0.279; p < .05). A moderate negative correlation emerged between SATME and PSCSE attitude subscale scores (r = -0.501; p < .01).Peer education improved sensitivity to medical errors but was less effective in ensuring knowledge retention. A discrepancy was identified between attitudes and practical application of patient safety knowledge, with students expressing low confidence in applying theoretical knowledge in practice. [ J Nurs Educ . 2025;64(7):407-414.] . CONCLUSION Peer education improved sensitivity to medical errors but was less effective in ensuring knowledge retention. A discrepancy was identified between attitudes and practical application of patient safety knowledge, with students expressing low confidence in applying theoretical knowledge in practice.

Abstract: Aim To evaluate the effectiveness of virtual simulation experiments for early intervention in psychiatric violence among nursing undergraduates, compared with offline scenario simulation in terms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, cognitive load, learning satisfaction and confidence. Background Early intervention in psychiatric violence is complex and differs from general hospital violence intervention. Existing virtual experiments and games for general hospital violence prevention are not easily adaptable for psychiatric violence prevention training. Offline scenario simulation learning is impractical for large-scale education due to high demands on time, space and manpower. Design A repeated measures randomized controlled trial. Method Fifty-eight third-year nursing undergraduates participated (intervention group = 29, control group = 29). Theoretical knowledge tests, violence management ability questionnaires and attitude scales were administered before and end of the intervention, one week after and one month after. Post-intervention measurements included objective structured clinical examination, workload profile self-assessment scale and student satisfaction and self-confidence scale. Results The intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in knowledge, skills and attitudes ( p    0.05). Conclusion The virtual simulation experiment for early intervention in psychiatric violence outperformed offline scenario simulation in enhancing nursing undergraduates' early intervention skills and knowledge retention, with lower cognitive load.

Abstract: Health-related podcasts have gained popularity as a digital medium for health promotion, particularly among young people; however, their remains uncertain. This scoping review synthesizes existing evidence on the role of podcasts in shaping young people's health engagement, focusing on four key dimensions of effectiveness: awareness, knowledge, behaviour change, and health outcomes. The review followed the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews framework, including a systematic search to identify peer-reviewed studies examining podcast interventions targeting individuals aged 14-26 years. Findings indicate that health-related podcasts are an engaging and accessible tool for young audiences, with strong evidence supporting their role in increasing health awareness and knowledge. However, evidence regarding their influence on behaviour change and long-term health outcomes is inconsistent. Podcasts that incorporated interactive elements, expert-driven content, or relatable narratives appeared more effective in sustaining engagement and facilitating knowledge retention. Additionally, variations in podcast length, content style, and delivery format may influence their effectiveness, though these factors remain underexplored. Despite methodological differences across studies, the findings highlight podcasts as a promising avenue for youth-centred health communication. By synthesizing current evidence, this review provides insights into the characteristics that contribute to effective health-related podcasts for young people and underscores their potential as an innovative tool for digital health promotion.Health-related podcasts have gained popularity as a digital medium for health promotion, particularly among young people; however, their remains uncertain.

Abstract: Medical educationists are concerned that the retention of basic science concepts weakens beyond the early years of medical programs, with clinicians rarely using basic sciences in clinical practice. This study was conducted to evaluate the knowledge retention of physiology courses in medical students at Kerman University of Medical Sciences. BACKGROUND Medical educationists are concerned that the retention of basic science concepts weakens beyond the early years of medical programs, with clinicians rarely using basic sciences in clinical practice. This study was conducted to evaluate the knowledge retention of physiology courses in medical students at Kerman University of Medical Sciences.This is a cross-sectional study at Kerman University of Medical Sciences. A retention test was conducted in physiology courses using multiple-choice questions. This study included 104 medical students who had completed their basic science courses. The students were in physiopathology, internship, and clerkship were selected. The mean and standard deviation were applied to analyze the data, and a two-sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, was performed with a significance level of P-value < 0.05. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study at Kerman University of Medical Sciences. A retention test was conducted in physiology courses using multiple-choice questions. This study included 104 medical students who had completed their basic science courses. The students were in physiopathology, internship, and clerkship were selected. The mean and standard deviation were applied to analyze the data, and a two-sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, was performed with a significance level of P-value < 0.05.The results of this study in retention test scores showed that lost knowledge was revealed throughout the years. Additionally, the results showed that in three subjects-gastrointestinal, nervous system, and respiratory-the scores of students in Y1 were higher than those of students in other years. In the course of endocrinology, the highest mean score belonged to the students who entered medical school in Y4, and the difference in mean scores among the different groups was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The mean scores in the urinary system course achieved by the medical students are presented, with students who entered medical school in Y3 having the highest mean scores compared to those in other years. RESULTS The results of this study in retention test scores showed that lost knowledge was revealed throughout the years. Additionally, the results showed that in three subjects-gastrointestinal, nervous system, and respiratory-the scores of students in Y1 were higher than those of students in other years. In the course of endocrinology, the highest mean score belonged to the students who entered medical school in Y4, and the difference in mean scores among the different groups was statistically significant (P < 0.001).

By prioritizing active learning, integrating clinical relevance, and leveraging strategies like retrieval practice and spaced learning, medical educators can enhance long-term retention and better prepare students for clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS The key takeaway is that knowledge retention is not passive; it requires active reinforcement through educational strategies.

Abstract: Active learning approaches that promote participation, critical thinking, and practical competency are becoming more and more necessary in medical and nursing education. Virtual reality (VR) and gamification, especially in the context of escape rooms, have become popular instructional technology in response to these issues. The interactive, scenario-based learning environments provided by these tools encourage motivation, teamwork, and decision-making. The impact and transformative possibilities of incorporating virtual reality and gamified escape rooms into medical and nursing education are examined in this paper. BACKGROUND Active learning approaches that promote participation, critical thinking, and practical competency are becoming more and more necessary in medical and nursing education. Virtual reality (VR) and gamification, especially in the context of escape rooms, have become popular instructional technology in response to these issues. The interactive, scenario-based learning environments provided by these tools encourage motivation, teamwork, and decision-making. The impact and transformative possibilities of incorporating virtual reality and gamified escape rooms into medical and nursing education are examined in this paper.The use of virtual reality (VR), gamification, and escape rooms in medical and nursing education was investigated using a thorough narrative literature review. In order to give a comprehensive and holistic overview of new subjects, this method was selected. Keywords like "escape room," "digital escape room," "online escape room," "gamification," "game-based education," "virtual reality in medical education," "medical student," "nursing education," "nursing student," and "nursing staff" were used in the January 10, 2025, search across Web of Science, PubMed, ERIC, and Scopus. English-language publications from the past ten years that addressed virtual reality, gamification, or escape rooms in medical or nursing education were included in the inclusion criteria. Non-relevant papers, non-peer-reviewed literature, and research with unclear methodology or no empirical data were among the exclusion criteria. 25 studies were chosen for a thorough assessment after a rigorous screening process based on methodological rigor and relevance.

Abstract: Clostridium difficile is a cause of hospital acquired infection. Nurses require a sound understanding of infection prevention and control regardless of practice setting and competing infection control demands and priorities. This study aimed to identify nurses' knowledge and perceptions about Clostridium difficile infection following education. BACKGROUND Clostridium difficile is a cause of hospital acquired infection. Nurses require a sound understanding of infection prevention and control regardless of practice setting and competing infection control demands and priorities. This study aimed to identify nurses' knowledge and perceptions about Clostridium difficile infection following education.A cross-sectional anonymous survey was distributed to nurses across a regional Northern Australia health service. Descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to analyse, summarise, and report the findings. METHODS A cross-sectional anonymous survey was distributed to nurses across a regional Northern Australia health service. Descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to analyse, summarise, and report the findings.A total of 167 completed surveys were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in correct responses to the knowledge and practice survey statements compared to responses prior to the educational intervention. Additionally, there were no differences in total correct responses between nurses who received education about Clostridium difficile infection and those who did not, nor between nurses who worked in the tertiary hospital compared to nurses who worked in smaller rural facilities. Nurses who completed surveys prior to and following the educational intervention showed improved knowledge. RESULTS A total of 167 completed surveys were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in correct responses to the knowledge and practice survey statements compared to responses prior to the educational intervention. Additionally, there were no differences in total correct responses between nurses who received education about Clostridium difficile infection and those who did not, nor between nurses who worked in the tertiary hospital compared to nurses who worked in smaller rural facilities. Nurses who completed surveys prior to and following the educational intervention showed improved knowledge.Nurses continue to demonstrate significant knowledge gaps about the management of CDI, underscoring the need for sustained, targeted education. Although pandemic-related restrictions limited in-person learning, face-to-face formats remained the preferred mode, possibly due to the benefits of immediate feedback and practical relevance to the clinical settings. Addressing the knowledge gaps through interactive, scenario-based training may enhance both engagement and knowledge retention of nurses and should be the explored in future research. CONCLUSIONS Nurses continue to demonstrate significant knowledge gaps about the management of CDI, underscoring the need for sustained, targeted education.

Abstract: To evaluate the effectiveness of virtual simulation experiments for early intervention in psychiatric violence among nursing undergraduates, compared with offline scenario simulation in terms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, cognitive load, learning satisfaction and confidence. AIM To evaluate the effectiveness of virtual simulation experiments for early intervention in psychiatric violence among nursing undergraduates, compared with offline scenario simulation in terms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, cognitive load, learning satisfaction and confidence.Early intervention in psychiatric violence is complex and differs from general hospital violence intervention. Existing virtual experiments and games for general hospital violence prevention are not easily adaptable for psychiatric violence prevention training. Offline scenario simulation learning is impractical for large-scale education due to high demands on time, space and manpower. BACKGROUND Early intervention in psychiatric violence is complex and differs from general hospital violence intervention. Existing virtual experiments and games for general hospital violence prevention are not easily adaptable for psychiatric violence prevention training. Offline scenario simulation learning is impractical for large-scale education due to high demands on time, space and manpower.A repeated measures randomized controlled trial. DESIGN A repeated measures randomized controlled trial.Fifty-eight third-year nursing undergraduates participated (intervention group = 29, control group = 29). Theoretical knowledge tests, violence management ability questionnaires and attitude scales were administered before and end of the intervention, one week after and one month after. Post-intervention measurements included objective structured clinical examination, workload profile self-assessment scale and student satisfaction and self-confidence scale. METHOD Fifty-eight third-year nursing undergraduates participated (intervention group = 29, control group = 29). Theoretical knowledge tests, violence management ability questionnaires and attitude scales were administered before and end of the intervention, one week after and one month after. Post-intervention measurements included objective structured clinical examination, workload profile self-assessment scale and student satisfaction and self-confidence scale.The intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in knowledge, skills and attitudes (p   0.05). RESULTS The intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in knowledge, skills and attitudes (p   0.05).The virtual simulation experiment for early intervention in psychiatric violence outperformed offline scenario simulation in enhancing nursing undergraduates' early intervention skills and knowledge retention, with lower cognitive load. CONCLUSION The virtual simulation experiment for early intervention in psychiatric violence outperformed offline scenario simulation in enhancing nursing undergraduates' early intervention skills and knowledge retention, with lower cognitive load.

Abstract: With increasing cost and time constraints, anatomy education has shifted away from classic dissection in favor of more effective teaching modalities. Here we investigated different teaching modalities on test performance and student satisfaction in the human gross anatomy laboratory at the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine (NYITCOM). The anatomy laboratory for first-year osteopathic students at NYITCOM was divided into stations including radiology, case-based learning, prosection, and dissection. Content covered at those stations was tested via anatomy laboratory examinations, comprised of computer-based identification and multiple-choice questions. Our data encompassed 459 first-year medical students taking anatomy in 2022 at both NYITCOM campus sites (Arkansas and New York). We coded 355 exam questions by teaching modality used in the anatomy laboratory. Questions covered in multiple modalities were classified as 'mixed'. Performance among modalities was analyzed using a three-way ANOVA. Prosection-based questions (mean = 75.6) performed significantly worse than dissection (mean = 83.4, p < 0.01) and mixed-modality (mean = 80.7, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in performance on material taught through dissection, radiology, case-based activity and mixed modalities. In addition, we investigated the effect of an instructor at the case-based activity station using repeated measures ANOVA. Our results indicate that case-based activity stations performed better without an instructor present (mean = 77.4 v. 72.7; p < 0.05). This study showed that teaching via prosection results in poorer performance than other teaching modalities and that dissection or hybrid models appear more effective in knowledge retention. Contrary to actual performance, students rated prosection as the most effective teaching modality. These results come at a critical time when COVID-19 has accelerated the shift away from dissection in favor of virtual methods.With increasing cost and time constraints, anatomy education has shifted away from classic dissection in favor of more effective teaching modalities.

Abstract: Postgraduate data reveal that most physicians lack adequate anatomical knowledge and clinical confidence when practicing musculoskeletal (MSK) medicine. Curricular data from nationally accredited medical programs clearly indicate that the total time dedicated to gross anatomy instruction has decreased over recent decades. However, little information is available regarding the MSK anatomy learning environment across accredited medical programs in North America. The purpose of this study was to document the current state of preclinical MSK anatomy education across North American medical programs. A survey was sent to all 14 English-speaking Canadian and 135 of the 158 American accredited medical programs. The survey had a 100% response rate from Canadian programs and 43% from American programs. The results indicated that the mean time spent learning preclinical MSK anatomy varied widely across both Canadian (29.8 h ± 13.7, range 12-60, median 29, mode 12) and American (50.8 h ± 46.2, range 2-280, median 35, mode 30) programs, most of them integrating anatomy learning into the clinical learning environment (56%). All but one program reported using cadaveric-based instruction (99%) and the majority taught radiological correlates (94%) and surface anatomy (71%) within their curriculum. Diverse modes of instruction were used by all programs, but didactic lectures remained the most frequent form (89%). While a variety of learning resources were used to support student learning, the type of resource varied significantly, Canadian programs most commonly providing a "curriculum-specific" notes package (86%) and American programs most commonly requiring an anatomy atlas (84%). Summative and formative methods of evaluation were used by most programs (96%), final written examinations (79%) and ongoing in-course evaluation (81%) being most popular. The results serve to document the current state of preclinical MSK anatomy education within nationally accredited allopathic medical programs and to illustrate the wide variability of the learning environment. Future research should be directed at establishing consistent standards for preclinical MSK anatomy education and investigating the long-term effects on knowledge retention and clinical confidence.Postgraduate data reveal that most physicians lack adequate anatomical knowledge and clinical confidence when practicing musculoskeletal (MSK) medicine.

Abstract: Continuing Medical Education (CME) is essential for enhancing professional performance. Modern CME approaches should prioritize adaptability and engagement through interactive and experiential learning, fostering better knowledge retention, skill application, and innovation to meet evolving healthcare challenges. This study aims to assess knowledge and perceptions of perceived role of engagement and active learning techniques in CME in the Italian population. Background Continuing Medical Education (CME) is essential for enhancing professional performance. Modern CME approaches should prioritize adaptability and engagement through interactive and experiential learning, fostering better knowledge retention, skill application, and innovation to meet evolving healthcare challenges. This study aims to assess knowledge and perceptions of perceived role of engagement and active learning techniques in CME in the Italian population.We conducted a pilot study with cross-sectional design among graduate and post-graduate students from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in 2023, by administering a 17-item questionnaire about knowledge, and perceptions of CME. Methods We conducted a pilot study with cross-sectional design among graduate and post-graduate students from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in 2023, by administering a 17-item questionnaire about knowledge, and perceptions of CME.We included 43 participants (median age 25, 72% females). Role of CME was recognized by 72.1%, and 53.5% were aware of its benefits. Likert responses showed high perceived importance of CME and engagement (mean scores 3.79 and 4.40). Active approaches like simulation (68.3%) and role-playing (65.9%) were familiar, but gamification (36.6%) was far less known. Results We included 43 participants (median age 25, 72% females).

Abstract: Background: Bedside ultrasound is widely utilized for critically ill patients, yet there is no standardized approach for teaching lung ultrasound to medical staff, particularly respiratory therapists (RTs), in the United States. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a lung ultrasound training program designed for RTs. Methods: With approval from the ethics committee, we recruited RTs with over 3 months of experience at Rush University Medical Center to participate in our lung ultrasound training program. The program comprised of a 1-h didactic lecture followed by hands-on practice on a healthy volunteer. A refresher training session was provided 6-9 months later for those who remained interested in lung ultrasound and were still employed at Rush University Medical Center. Pre- and post-training assessments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the training and identify areas requiring further knowledge development. Results: Between October 2022 and April 2023, 23 RTs completed the initial training, and 7 attended both the initial and the refresher training sessions. Following the initial session, total scores significantly improved (post-training 11.0 [9.0-14.0] versus pre-training 1.0 [0-2.0], P < .001), with the subgroup focusing on "identification of patterns" achieving the highest percentage of correct answers. Among the 7 RTs who attended the refresher training, total scores significantly decreased over 6-9 months (12.9 ± 2.3 vs 4.4 ± 1.8, P = .001). However, scores significantly rebounded after the refresher training (post-training 11.3 ± 3.1 vs pre-training 4.4 ± 1.8, P = .008), with no significant difference in post-training total scores between the initial and the refresher sessions. Conclusions: Both the initial and refresher training sessions of our lung ultrasound training programs effectively improved participants' knowledge. The observed decline in knowledge retention over 6-9 months highlights the necessity for periodic refresher courses and ongoing use of lung ultrasound in clinical practice to maintain skills. Incorporating a visual format may be beneficial for acquiring and retaining knowledge.Background: Bedside ultrasound is widely utilized for critically ill patients, yet there is no standardized approach for teaching lung ultrasound to medical staff, particularly respiratory therapists (RTs), in the United States.

Abstract: Guatemala has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in Central America. A total of 60% of births in Guatemala are attended by traditional Mayan birth attendants, or comadronas. Their prevalence in these communities makes them a valuable resource to bridge home births with safe prenatal care. The objective of this study was to evaluate a low-cost prenatal care training program for Guatemalan comadronas with the goal of improving maternal health outcomes in the region. OBJECTIVE Guatemala has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in Central America. A total of 60% of births in Guatemala are attended by traditional Mayan birth attendants, or comadronas. Their prevalence in these communities makes them a valuable resource to bridge home births with safe prenatal care. The objective of this study was to evaluate a low-cost prenatal care training program for Guatemalan comadronas with the goal of improving maternal health outcomes in the region.In this retrospective longitudinal cohort study, we examined the knowledge retention of comadronas enrolled in a 12-month prenatal care training program known as the School of PowHER (SOP). Recruited from the Lake Atitlán region of Guatemala by Saving Mothers, 501(c)(3) and the Guatemalan Ministry of Health, comadronas participated in a four-month didactic curriculum followed by a nine-month clinical curriculum. Pre- and post-tests were administered to assess learning outcomes over the study's duration (2014-2022), and test results were evaluated to assess the effectiveness of the SOP. METHODS In this retrospective longitudinal cohort study, we examined the knowledge retention of comadronas enrolled in a 12-month prenatal care training program known as the School of PowHER (SOP). Recruited from the Lake Atitlán region of Guatemala by Saving Mothers, 501(c)(3) and the Guatemalan Ministry of Health, comadronas participated in a four-month didactic curriculum followed by a nine-month clinical curriculum. Pre- and post-tests were administered to assess learning outcomes over the study's duration (2014-2022), and test results were evaluated to assess the effectiveness of the SOP.A total of 123 women were recruited and enrolled in all eight graduating classes of the SOP from 2014, 2016-2019, and 2021-2022. An average, statistically significant improvement in didactic and clinical pre- and post-test scores was found across all years analyzed. RESULTS A total of 123 women were recruited and enrolled in all eight graduating classes of the SOP from 2014, 2016-2019, and 2021-2022. An average, statistically significant improvement in didactic and clinical pre- and post-test scores was found across all years analyzed.The SOP is a low-cost, culturally appropriate, community-based model that empowers comadronas through knowledge and skill acquisition to improve local maternal health outcomes. This program proves effective at not only teaching comadronas prenatal health information and clinical skills, but also at promoting long-term retention of these skills. CONCLUSION The SOP is a low-cost, culturally appropriate, community-based model that empowers comadronas through knowledge and skill acquisition to improve local maternal health outcomes. This program proves effective at not only teaching comadronas prenatal health information and clinical skills, but also at promoting long-term retention of these skills.

Abstract: Insomnia is a common and debilitating disorder that is often undiagnosed and untreated. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is the first-line treatment for insomnia, though the lack of trained providers is a major barrier to accessibility. To address this issue, an online provider training platform, CBTI web , was launched in April 2020. The objective of this study was to determine the knowledge and implementation practices of providers 1 year after their successful completion of CBTI web . An online survey was sent to 569 providers who completed CBTI web training within 3 months of launch. Providers were asked about knowledge retention, use of CBTI with patients, barriers, and facilitators to the use of CBTI and acceptability, feasibility, and intervention appropriateness of CBTI. Two hundred and thirty-three providers completed the survey. Results revealed that most of the providers retained knowledge gained during CBTI web and that self-efficacy for CBTI was positively associated with CBTI use with their patients. Common barriers endorsed by providers were primarily related to difficulty promoting patient-buy-in for CBTI and difficulty finding CBTI supervision and consultation. Helpful facilitators included access to patient and therapist materials. Results also indicate very high acceptability (93.1%), agreeableness (94.3%), and feasibility (88.1%) of CBTI.Insomnia is a common and debilitating disorder that is often undiagnosed and untreated.

Abstract: Online and hybrid pediatric oncology training programs, such as the St. Jude Global Academy's Neuro-Oncology Training Seminar (NOTS), aim to address gaps in educational opportunities. This study examined the online components of the 2022 and 2023 NOTS, using mixed methods to assess strengths, limitations, and areas for improvement specific to the distance learning components. NOTS participants are required to complete 9 weeks of online modules. Participants were invited to evaluate their online learning experience which included both quantitative and qualitative measures related to participant perceptions of the course. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze quantitative results, and qualitative responses underwent thematic analysis. A total of 153 participants from 30 institutions participated in the online modules of the 2022 and 2023 NOTS. Among all participants, 106 (69.1%) completed the online course with a passing score of 70% or higher, and 83 completed the online evaluation. Pre-recorded lectures, rated highly by 73.5% of respondents, were appreciated for their content quality and flexibility. Live meetings were also of importance, with many participants requesting an expansion of interactive online sessions in future iterations of NOTS. Participants also felt the online learning activities (e.g., research projects and case discussions) were important and recommended more frequent knowledge assessments throughout the online modules and long-term follow-up. While most participants found the course duration of online components appropriate, some suggested adjustments to pacing and improved access to content. This study expands on the potential of technology-facilitated pediatric hematology-oncology education in LMICs by offering flexible and accessible learning formats. The findings suggest that blended learning models, interactive content, and incorporating peer and expert feedback can enhance knowledge retention and learner satisfaction among online participants.Online and hybrid pediatric oncology training programs, such as the St. Jude Global Academy's Neuro-Oncology Training Seminar (NOTS), aim to address gaps in educational opportunities.

Abstract: In domain continual medical image segmentation, distillation-based methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by continuously reviewing old knowledge. However, these approaches often exhibit biases towards both new and old knowledge simultaneously due to confounding factors, which can undermine segmentation performance. To address these biases, we propose the Causality-Adjusted Data Augmentation (CauAug) framework, introducing a novel causal intervention strategy called the Texture-Domain Adjustment Hybrid-Scheme (TDAHS) alongside two causality-targeted data augmentation approaches: the Cross Kernel Network (CKNet) and the Fourier Transformer Generator (FTGen). (1) TDAHS establishes a domain-continual causal model that accounts for two types of knowledge biases by identifying irrelevant local textures (L) and domain-specific features (D) as confounders. It introduces a hybrid causal intervention that combines traditional confounder elimination with a proposed replacement approach to better adapt to domain shifts, thereby promoting causal segmentation. (2) CKNet eliminates confounder L to reduce biases in new knowledge absorption. It decreases reliance on local textures in input images, forcing the model to focus on relevant anatomical structures and thus improving generalization. (3) FTGen causally intervenes on confounder D by selectively replacing it to alleviate biases that impact old knowledge retention. It restores domain-specific features in images, aiding in the comprehensive distillation of old knowledge. Our experiments show that CauAug significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and surpasses existing methods in various medical image segmentation tasks. The implementation code is publicly available at: https://github.com/PerceptionComputingLab/CauAug_DCMIS.In domain continual medical image segmentation, distillation-based methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by continuously reviewing old knowledge.

Abstract: This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of mind maps and Concept Maps on academic performance among undergraduate medical students in the preclinical stage. PURPOSE This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of mind maps and Concept Maps on academic performance among undergraduate medical students in the preclinical stage.Our protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024529458). We followed PRISMA guidelines in conducting our systematic review. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library from inception to June 2024. We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that involved undergraduate medical students in the preclinical stage, evaluated mind mapping and Concept Maps as the intervention, and compared it to traditional methods or no intervention, with academic performance as the primary outcome. A qualitative synthesis of the results was conducted, and where possible, effect sizes (e.g., Cohen's d) were calculated to quantify the impact of mind maps and concept maps on academic performance. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Bystander first aid in paediatric choking is crucial. It ought to be universally comprehensible and backed up by evidence-based guidelines. However, there still are inconsistencies in guidelines worldwide. The objective of this research was to assess the knowledge of medical students on paediatric choking rescue manoeuvres and their educational backgrounds in order to evaluate the impact of differences in educational curricula. Methods: Medical students from a total of 12 universities across Canada, Libya, and Poland were surveyed online. The questionnaire assessed the respondents' experience, training, and knowledge in first aid regarding foreign body airway obstruction in infants and children. Results: Out of 324 responses, 290 were evaluated. Although the students studied in only 3 countries, they represented 37 countries of origin. A total of 7 new reference groups were created based on guideline identification. A comparison of 4 clinical scenario questions revealed that certain training providers communicate recommendations more effectively to medical students, as their guidelines seem to have better knowledge retention. Conclusions: There are important differences in medical student knowledge, possibly due to discrepancies in training programs and guidelines. Variability was found in body position, anti-choking suction devices, blind finger sweeps, and medical follow-ups. More research is needed to standardize training and improve worldwide choking management outcomes.Background/Objectives: Bystander first aid in paediatric choking is crucial.

Abstract: Background: The flipped classroom (FC) model has gained increasing recognition as an innovative teaching strategy in medical education, addressing the limitations of passive learning in traditional methods. It takes learning outside the classroom and allows students to preview new material, while leaving classroom time for content-related discussions and joint tasks. However, limited studies have evaluated its impact in Eastern India, particularly in pediatric teaching. The study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the FC model versus the traditional method of teaching in improving knowledge retention and engagement among undergraduate medical students studying pediatric respiratory illnesses. Materials and methods: A prospective quasi-experimental study was conducted over six months (November 2021 to April 2022) among 130 eighth-semester medical students at Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Bhubaneswar. Participants were divided into two groups: one receiving traditional lectures and the other exposed to FC sessions covering pediatric respiratory competencies. Pre- and post-test scores were compared using SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) with a significance threshold of P < 0.05. The scores were compared, and their perception toward the teaching tool was assessed by a questionnaire-based survey. Results: A total of 130 students, 67 in the control group and 63 in the intervention group, were analyzed for their knowledge score at baseline by a pretested questionnaire. The mean score of knowledge among the control and intervention groups was not different at baseline (P = 0.519). Students in the FC group demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in knowledge scores (mean increase: 2.0 points) compared to the traditional group (mean increase: 0.925 points; P < 0.01). Additionally, 77.8% of participants reported increased engagement in the flipped sessions. Conclusions: The greater mean scores after the teaching sessions represent the improved perception of the FC teaching-learning approach for repeatability and better memory retention. The FC method was found to be more effective than the traditional method of teaching. The students’ feedback was positive toward the FC method. With careful preparation and faculty training, it can address the issue of medical students' lack of competency in pediatrics.

Abstract: Introduction: Access to sideline medical care is limited in many public-school athletic programs, especially in underserved urban areas. The Detroit Public School Health Corps (DPSHC) was founded in response to the tragic death of a Detroit public school basketball player who suffered a cardiac arrest during a game, underscoring the critical need for timely and effective sideline emergency care. DPSHC is a student-led inreach initiative targeting local healthcare gaps by providing equity-driven medical training in nearby schools. This study tests the hypothesis that simulation-based training will be more effective than traditional didactic training in improving a student volunteer’s clinical preparedness, knowledge retention, and confidence in sideline medical roles. The primary objectives are to compare confidence and knowledge gains between the two training methods, while a secondary objective evaluates the perceived impact of resident physician involvement during simulation. Methods: Forty-seven medical student volunteers completed either lecture-based (n=16) or simulation-based (n=31) training. Both groups completed identical pre- and post-training surveys assessing confidence in managing sports injuries and clinical knowledge. Paired t-tests analyzed the data to evaluate within-group improvements from before to after a training session, while independent t-tests compared the degree of improvement between training formats. Results: Both groups showed a significant improvement in confidence (p < 0.001). The simulation group showed greater confidence gains than the lecture group (33.06% vs. 24.53%, p = 0.02). Knowledge scores improved more in the simulation group (62.1% vs. 31.25%), though not significantly (p = 0.153). Resident physician involvement was rated invaluable by 25 (80.6%) of the simulation participants. Conclusion: Simulation-based training enhanced medical student volunteers’ confidence more than lecture-based methods in sideline care roles within an inreach program addressing healthcare disparities. These findings support the expansion of simulation-based learning as a core component of equity-driven, community-embedded medical education.

Abstract: Background Active teaching-learning approaches involve students in the learning process, promoting critical thinking, problem-solving, and knowledge retention. These methods contrast with traditional didactic lectures, which focus on passive listening. This study aims to evaluate the perceptions and effectiveness of active teaching-learning methods among first-year medical students. Methodology A cross-sectional survey of 113 first-year medical students was conducted using a validated questionnaire (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.873). Active teaching-learning methods, viz., small group discussions, case-based learning, flipped classroom, and early clinical exposure sessions, were implemented to enhance engagement among first-year MBBS students. The survey collected data on engagement, retention, and critical thinking through Likert-scale questions and open-ended feedback. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results Overall, 79.7% of students agreed that active teaching methods enhanced engagement, while 75.2% reported improved retention. Further, 83.2% felt their clinical reasoning skills benefited. Students emphasized the importance of interactive sessions and real-life clinical case discussions.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) shows promising results in clinical practice. This study compared a GPT-4-turbo virtual assistant with physicians from Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal on medical knowledge derived from national exams while analysing knowledge retention over time and domain-specific performance. Via a digital platform, 17,144 physicians provided 221,574 answers to 600 exam questions between December 2022 and February 2024. Physicians were stratified by years since graduation and specialty, and the assistant answered the same questions in each native language. Differences in proportions of correct answers were tested with binomial logistic regression (odds ratios, 95% CI) or Fisher's exact test (α = 0.05). The assistant outperformed physicians in all countries (72-96% vs. 46-62%; logistic regression, p < 0.001). Physicians also trailed the assistant across most knowledge domains ( p < 0.001), except paediatrics (45% vs. 52%; Fisher, p = 0.60). Accuracy declined with seniority, falling 4-10% between the youngest and oldest cohorts (logistic regression, p < 0.001). Overall, genAI exceeds practising doctors on broad medical knowledge and may help counter knowledge attrition, though paediatrics remains a domain requiring targeted refinement.Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) shows promising results in clinical practice.

Abstract: Dementia is a growing global public health concern, particularly in LMICs like Bangladesh. With population aging, there is an increasing prevalence of dementia; care facilities are limited. This scarcity of services places a significant responsibility on untrained family caregivers, impacting the health of persons with dementia and their caregivers. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving dementia care, especially in resource-constrained settings. Recognizing the urgency, the WHO developed an online self-training manual, iSupport, emphasizing education, skill development, and support for caregivers. This study aims to test feasibility of iSupport i) in improving knowledge about dementia and dementia care among family and formal caregivers, and ii) reducing family caregivers’ stress and improving their caregiving skills, mental health, quality of life and relationship with the person with dementia cared for. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of SAJIDA Foundation (2024–005-SFIRB). This non-randomized feasibility study aims to recruit 44 family caregivers and 132 formal caregivers from Dhaka, Bangladesh, using a purposive sampling technique. Participants will be provided access to iSupport for two months. Pre- and post-intervention surveys will be conducted to assess changes in knowledge about dementia care among both family and formal caregivers, as well as changes in psychological well-being among family caregivers. To assess knowledge retention, a follow-up survey will be conducted. Any differences in the outcomes from the pre-intervention period will be tested against the null hypothesis of zero mean difference using a two-sample paired t-test. Additionally, multivariable regression techniques will also be used to control for possible confounders. To understand the facilitators and barriers of implementing iSupport, a qualitative approach will be used to interview 15 family caregivers and conduct four FGDs with formal caregivers. Qualitative data will be analysed using an inductive content analysis approach. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: Background and Objective: Delirium, a prevalent neurocognitive disorder, frequently affects critically ill patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs), leading to increased mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and higher healthcare costs. This quasi-experimental study assessed the effect of an educational program relating to ICU nurses' knowledge of delirium in a university hospital in Nablus, Palestinian Authority. Methods: A pre-test-post-test design was employed, utilizing a 25-item questionnaire for 114 ICU nurses. The educational intervention included a presentation on delirium, the distribution of educational materials, and follow-up video sessions. Our study aim was to evaluate nurses' understanding of ICU delirium and the impact of the educational program on their ability to identify and evaluate the delirium. Results : Pre-intervention assessments indicated limited awareness among nurses regarding delirium diagnosis and management tools, i.e., the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. Post-intervention results showed a significant improvement in knowledge; median scores increased from 6 (range: 3-13) to 15 (range: 12-20) ( p < 0.001). Nurses also reported greater confidence in identifying and managing delirium, and 50% found CAM-ICU easy to use. However, knowledge gaps remained concerning mixed delirium types and modifiable risk factors. Conclusions: Continuous educational programs are essential for ensuring long-term knowledge retention. We recommend integrating routine delirium education with hospital policies and emphasizing the use of delirium assessment tools during each shift. Findings show that targeted education can enhance ICU nurses' competencies and thereby improve patient outcomes through more effective delirium management.Background and Objective: Delirium, a prevalent neurocognitive disorder, frequently affects critically ill patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs), leading to increased mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and higher healthcare costs.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/enhancing-pedagogical-practice-through-immersive/docview/3216195968/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: The use of immersive technology, especially Augmented Reality (AR), is transforming teaching methods by establishing dynamic and interactive learning spaces. This study investigates how augmented reality (AR) improves instruction by fusing virtual and actual classroom environments, providing students with a more personalised and engaging learning environment. Teachers can convert standard instruction into immersive, multi-sensory lessons that promote greater learning and recall of difficult subjects by incorporating augmented reality (AR) into their curricula. The study looks at different AR applications in education and shows how they affect knowledge retention, collaborative learning, and student engagement. There is also discussion of difficulties like affordability, accessibility, and the requirement for teacher training. According to the research, augmented reality (AR) has the power to completely transform classrooms by increasing student engagement, personalisation, and adaptability to their unique needs. This will eventually boost pedagogical efficacy and spur innovation in the field of education.

Abstract: Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition encountered by all physicians and healthcare providers. Data indicate that physicians often fail to recognize this syndrome, leading to misdiagnosis, mismanagement, and adverse outcomes. This educational program aimed to assess knowledge about anaphylaxis in a cohort of internal medicine residents and develop and test the efficacy of an educational intervention in addressing gaps in understanding of this critical condition. INTRODUCTION Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition encountered by all physicians and healthcare providers. Data indicate that physicians often fail to recognize this syndrome, leading to misdiagnosis, mismanagement, and adverse outcomes. This educational program aimed to assess knowledge about anaphylaxis in a cohort of internal medicine residents and develop and test the efficacy of an educational intervention in addressing gaps in understanding of this critical condition.An in-person educational intervention, including a lecture and case-based open discussion, was delivered to 44 internal medicine residents at an academic medical center with pre- and post-intervention self- assessments. Our primary outcome was the change in the rate of residents being able to correctly identify critical features of anaphylaxis and appropriate treatment. Longer-term follow-up was completed in a subset of residents to assess knowledge retention. METHODS An in-person educational intervention, including a lecture and case-based open discussion, was delivered to 44 internal medicine residents at an academic medical center with pre- and post-intervention self- assessments. Our primary outcome was the change in the rate of residents being able to correctly identify critical features of anaphylaxis and appropriate treatment. Longer-term follow-up was completed in a subset of residents to assess knowledge retention.Immediately following the educational intervention, there was increased likelihood of diagnosing anaphylaxis in a written case scenario from 69% to 91% (RR: 1.30; 95% CI 1.09,1.56) and reporting the correct dose and route of administration of epinephrine from 19% to 95% (RR:4.96; 95% CI: 2.26, 10.88). Residents also demonstrated increased identification of cardiovascular compromise in anaphylaxis, as well as often underrecognized gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms after the intervention. In an assessment evaluating longitudinal retention up to 15 months after the intervention, approximately 50% of those who responded to the longitudinal survey correctly recalled the dosing and route of administration of epinephrine for treating anaphylaxis. RESULTS Immediately following the educational intervention, there was increased likelihood of diagnosing anaphylaxis in a written case scenario from 69% to 91% (RR: 1.30; 95% CI 1.09,1.56) and reporting the correct dose and route of administration of epinephrine from 19% to 95% (RR:4.96; 95% CI: 2.26, 10.88).

In an assessment evaluating longitudinal retention up to 15 months after the intervention, approximately 50% of those who responded to the longitudinal survey correctly recalled the dosing and route of administration of epinephrine for treating anaphylaxis.A brief educational session on anaphylaxis was successful in improving residents' short-term knowledge about diagnosis and treatment of anaphylaxis and may also impact long-term retention. DISCUSSION A brief educational session on anaphylaxis was successful in improving residents' short-term knowledge about diagnosis and treatment of anaphylaxis and may also impact long-term retention.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a game-based mobile application on nursing students’ skills in administering subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) injections. Nursing education traditionally involves both theoretical and practical components. With the advent of digital technologies, innovative methods such as game-based learning have been introduced to enhance practical skills and knowledge retention in nursing education. This study explores the use of a mobile application designed to improve students’ competence in SC and IM drug administration. This was an experimental study conducted during the 2021–2022 academic year. It involved a study group of 64 students who received training through a simulation game system and a control group of 65 students who underwent traditional training methods. Data were collected using the Self-Demonstration Form, the Study Process Questionnaire, and the Skills Performance List for Subcutaneous and Intramuscular Administration. The study focused on assessing the impact of game-based learning on students’ performance and learning approaches. The study group showed significantly greater improvements in learning approaches and medication administration skills compared to the control group. Deep learning scores increased from 31.39 ± 6.23 to 45.05 ± 5.46 in the study group, versus 31.78 ± 5.68 to 37.02 ± 4.17 in the control group ( p  < 0.01). SC and IM administration scores improved significantly in the study group (SC: 22.50 ± 15.46 to 42.45 ± 11.66, p  = 0.015; IM: 27.75 ± 15.98 to 59.45 ± 12.95, p  < 0.001) compared to the control group. Scenario-based analyses also showed significant performance gains in the study group across all scenarios ( p  < 0.05). The HEM-SC-IM game-based mobile application proved effective in improving nursing students’ skills in administering SC and IM injections. The interactive and engaging nature of game-based learning provides a valuable educational experience, promoting deeper understanding and practical skills development. This study supports the integration of educational technology in nursing curricula to enhance learning outcomes.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of medical education requires innovative tools to help students manage cognitive overload. Concept mapping (CM) enhances knowledge retention and integration by visually organizing information, and has received positive feedback in various educational contexts. However, the use of CM combined with interactive 3D courseware to teach the cellular mechanisms of bacterial sepsis is underexplored. This study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating a 3D computer simulation with CM to improve understanding of sepsis. Fifty-two second-year medical students were randomized into three groups (A, B, and C). Each group completed five tasks: a pre-simulation self-assessment, a scaffolded pre-simulation CM, a computer simulation, a post-simulation CM, and a post-simulation self-assessment. Group A completed the tasks at the start of the sepsis case in the medical curriculum, Group B in the middle, and Group C at the end. A control group completed only the pre-simulation CM, and third-year students who had previously participated repeated the CM. Pre-simulation CM scores showed significant improvement in all three groups compared to the control group ( p  < 0.05). Post-simulation, Group C significantly outperformed Groups A and B ( p  < 0.05). Third-year students scored 15 points higher than Groups A and B ( p  < 0.001), but their scores were similar to Group C’s. CM scores improved across all intervention groups, with Group C showing more than double the increase seen in Groups A and B. This study suggests that combining 3D simulations with CM is an effective strategy for teaching complex medical concepts and warrants further exploration of its long-term impact.

Abstract: Why did you do this work? Kawasaki disease (KD) is the leading cause of acquired childhood cardiac disease, increasing four-fold over the past decade in the UK. 1 It remains perceivably rare, contributing to delayed diagnosis: 7.8 days from symptom onset on average, where best cardiac outcomes necessitate treatment <7 days. Non-specific symptoms and lack of definitive biomarkers further compounds diagnostic delay. 2 Only 30% present <1 year old, yet this group carries nearly double the risk of aneurysms. 3 Our programme aimed to raise awareness of KD among the paediatric resident workforce. What did you do? A regional training programme on KD was developed, using real case examples provided by Societi, the UK foundation for KD, and the literature aiming to create interactive, case-based sessions which would raise awareness amongst clinicians about KD. 4 The cases were chosen as they identified important knowledge gaps or learning from patient morbidity aiming to improve clinician knowledge so that KD is considered earlier and more seriously in the patient journey. The programme was piloted at one Trust in a face-to-face format, with participants ranging from Foundation doctors to Consultants. Feedback was elicited from all participants via LearnLoop and free-text feedback was analysed thematically. Following feedback, the session was refined and expanded regionally via video-link to multiple hospitals. Feedback was used to understand what participants learned with a view to adapting session content and structure to enhance this in future. What did you find? Sessions were attended by resident doctors ranging from Foundation doctors to Consultant. Participants self-identified their take-home learning which included the need for early recognition to prevent poor cardiac outcomes, awareness of the BCG sign and recognition of incomplete Kawasaki presentations, especially in older or younger children, who are more likely to be overlooked. The pilot session achieved a feedback score of 94.3/100, which increased to 95.3/100 following regional roll-out. Themes from free-text feedback included: the importance of recognising incomplete Kawasaki, awareness of epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, and the value of case-based learning. Participants reported feeling more confident in identifying KD following the sessions, but assessing change in practice and long-term retention were beyond the scope of this pilot. What does it mean? The training sessions were valued by participants and increased self-reported confidence in recognising KD among resident doctors in paediatrics. Participants expressed interest in expanding the programme into longer, face-to-face interactive sessions. This initiative contributes to raising awareness of KD and forms part of a larger body of work. Feedback suggests that a longer study day or regional workshop would have merit and meet an identified learning need, alongside formal evaluation of impact on knowledge retention and practice.

Abstract: Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing medical education by enhancing learning experiences, improving knowledge retention, and providing personalized guidance. Through interactive simulations, virtual tutors, and adaptive learning platforms, Al-powered solutions help students in preclinical education grasp difficult ideas. Thus this study aims to examine the impact of Al on preclinical medical education students' academic performance, engagement, and readiness for clinical training among preclinical medical students, examining its applicability, efficacy, potential, and limitations. Which is done by outlining the objectives and evaluating the effectiveness, opportunities, and challenges of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) tools in medical education among Year 1 and Year 2 MBBS students in a private medical university, Malaysia. Methodology: The study involved 300 sample population, including 152 Year 1 and 148 Year 2 students. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted, with a sample size of 184 with a 95% confidence level. Data were collected through online surveys and analysis using Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS version 23.0.Result: All 184 preclinical students used Al tools in their medical education, mainly relying on ChatGPT. About 84.2% are familiar with Al in this context. The effectiveness of Al in improving learning was rated from 1 to 3, with most students scoring Al as 4 or 5 in problem-solving, decision-making, critical thinking, and inspiring new ideas, indicating a high perception of its effectiveness. Many believe AI supports traditional teaching. However, concerns exist about over-reliance on technology (83.2%) and loss of critical thinking skills (77.7%). Also, 42.9% rated their worries about Al's impact on clinical decision-making skills as a 3. Conclusion: Most preclinical students know about Al in medical education and believe it helps improve learning. Al assists students in solving problems, making decisions, encouraging critical thinking, and generating new ideas. However, concerns felt about much dependence on technology and weaken critical thinking skills in medical education. Students believe that AI will not entirely harm clinical decision-making skills. In summary, Al offers both advantages and disadvantages in medical education.

Abstract: Aims: Psychiatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) present a unique and challenging environment for staff, requiring specialised knowledge and skills to manage complex clinical presentations and ensure patient safety. Currently, there is a gap in readily available, comprehensive training programmes specifically tailored for PICU staff. This project aimed to develop and evaluate a bespoke training programme for staff at Roxeth Ward PICU, addressing this gap and focusing on key clinical and operational challenges pertinent to the PICU setting. The programme sought to enhance staff competency, improve patient care, and create a more positive and therapeutic ward environment. Methods: A bespoke training programme was designed and implemented for all staff at Roxeth Ward PICU, including nurses, psychiatrists, allied health professionals, and support staff. The programme incorporated a variety of interactive learning modalities to maximize engagement and knowledge retention. These included didactic lectures providing foundational knowledge, simulated scenarios (covering both mental health crises, such as managing acutely agitated patients, and medical emergencies, such as NMS), interactive group discussions to facilitate shared learning and problem-solving, and problem-based learning activities focused on real-world case studies encountered in the PICU. Topics covered a range of pertinent PICU issues, including the ward’s structure and processes, the function and purpose of operational/governance meetings, the safe and effective use of rapid tranquillisation and Acuphase, management of psychiatric emergencies, a comprehensive overview of the Mental Health Act and its legal implications for PICU practice, substance misuse management training, de-escalation techniques and strategies, quality improvement initiatives, the use of sensory modulation to create a therapeutic environment, understanding and applying knowledge of common mental health diagnoses, and the management of violence and aggression. Pre- and post-training assessments were conducted to evaluate the impact of the programme on staff knowledge, skills, and confidence. Results: Quantitative feedback from the 35 participants demonstrated a substantial 64% improvement overall in knowledge and confidence following the training programme. These improvements were observed across all domains and topics covered in the training programme and a detailed breakdown of the results for each topic is included in the poster. Qualitative feedback from participants was overwhelmingly positive, with many staff highlighting the value of the interactive learning methods, particularly the simulated scenarios, in enhancing their understanding of complex clinical situations and improving their ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world practice. Participants specifically mentioned the increased confidence they gained in managing acutely agitated patients, understanding the legal implications of the Mental Health Act, and applying de-escalation techniques. The programme’s practical application to the PICU setting was consistently highlighted by participants, reinforcing the need for bespoke training tailored to this specialised area. Conclusion: Our bespoke training programme represents a significant step towards addressing the gap in PICU-specific staff training. The diverse and interactive learning modalities, combined with the focus on key clinical and operational challenges specific to the PICU environment, appear to have a positive impact on staff knowledge, skills, and confidence. Further evaluation will explore the longer-term impact of the programme on staff practices, patient outcomes, and the overall ward environment. This model could serve as a valuable framework for other PICUs seeking to develop and implement tailored staff training programmes and contribute to best practice in mental health care.

Abstract: Aims: Calhoun et al. assessed the effectiveness of in-situ simulation education and showed that adding in-situ simulation to current educational practices may improve patient mortality and morbidity. Collaborative Working is when individuals with various professional backgrounds work together and combine their expertise with other individuals to provide the best care possible. The essence of collaborative working is “working as a team with respect and value for each team member’s unique role and contribution”. The practice of interdisciplinary learning is already in place when Immediate Life Support simulation training is delivered. The concept of broadening this practice out to other areas of clinical practice is therefore not far-fetched and is evidence based. Aims: Embed lessons learnt from serious untoward incidents within an simulated inter-professional educational environment; OSE implementation will improve staff ability to respond to clinical scenarios. Methods: A total of 27 participants attended these sessions conducted across 2 days. The staff rotated through a four-station circuit (10 minutes each with 5 minutes verbal feedback): completing a NEWS2 chart (National Early Warning Score); recording glucose levels on a blood glucose monitoring chart; documenting neurological observations following Rapid Tranquillization administration and effective communication. At each station, participants were asked to complete a Likert questionnaire to self-report their status in 4 key areas: Knowledge, Confidence, Management, Resource Awareness, and preference between Face-to-Face (F2F) or E-learning teaching. Following the station, participants received constructive feedback on their performance and repeated the questionnaire. Results: Qualitative and quantitative data analysis was completed to assess the questionnaire responses, with all stations showing a significant increase in average scores (AS) across all Key Areas, ranging between 16.4% (NEWS2) and 54% (Neurological Observation). Confidence in handling clinical scenarios showed the smallest AS increase across all stations ranging from 12.3% (NEWS2) to 46.1% (Neurological observation). Awareness of trusted resources available had consistent minimal score change, with lowest score change of 6.1% observed in NEWS2. Post-session learning preferences strongly favoured F2F teaching, with all 27 participants preferring it for Communication and Blood Glucose monitoring stations. Neurological observation station showed the biggest improvements in knowledge (58.3%) and confidence in management (65.2%). Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of interactive teaching to improve clinical competency and knowledge retention. The data also suggests the need for improved resource awareness and accessibility and as a result resource folders have been disseminated. Cygnet Healthcare is also implementing OSEs across other hospital sites.

Abstract: The flipped classroom (FC) model has gained increasing recognition as an innovative teaching strategy in medical education, addressing the limitations of passive learning in traditional methods. It takes learning outside the classroom and allows students to preview new material, while leaving classroom time for content-related discussions and joint tasks. However, limited studies have evaluated its impact in Eastern India, particularly in pediatric teaching. The study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the FC model versus the traditional method of teaching in improving knowledge retention and engagement among undergraduate medical students studying pediatric respiratory illnesses. BACKGROUND The flipped classroom (FC) model has gained increasing recognition as an innovative teaching strategy in medical education, addressing the limitations of passive learning in traditional methods. It takes learning outside the classroom and allows students to preview new material, while leaving classroom time for content-related discussions and joint tasks. However, limited studies have evaluated its impact in Eastern India, particularly in pediatric teaching. The study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the FC model versus the traditional method of teaching in improving knowledge retention and engagement among undergraduate medical students studying pediatric respiratory illnesses.A prospective quasi-experimental study was conducted over six months (November 2021 to April 2022) among 130 eighth-semester medical students at Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Bhubaneswar. Participants were divided into two groups: one receiving traditional lectures and the other exposed to FC sessions covering pediatric respiratory competencies. Pre- and post-test scores were compared using SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) with a significance threshold of P < 0.05. The scores were compared, and their perception toward the teaching tool was assessed by a questionnaire-based survey. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective quasi-experimental study was conducted over six months (November 2021 to April 2022) among 130 eighth-semester medical students at Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Bhubaneswar. Participants were divided into two groups: one receiving traditional lectures and the other exposed to FC sessions covering pediatric respiratory competencies. Pre- and post-test scores were compared using SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) with a significance threshold of P < 0.05. The scores were compared, and their perception toward the teaching tool was assessed by a questionnaire-based survey. A total of 130 students, 67 in the control group and 63 in the intervention group, were analyzed for their knowledge score at baseline by a pretested questionnaire. The mean score of knowledge among the control and intervention groups was not different at baseline (P = 0.519). Students in the FC group demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in knowledge scores (mean increase: 2.0 points) compared to the traditional group (mean increase: 0.925 points; P < 0.01). Additionally, 77.8% of participants reported increased engagement in the flipped sessions. RESULTS  A total of 130 students, 67 in the control group and 63 in the intervention group, were analyzed for their knowledge score at baseline by a pretested questionnaire. The mean score of knowledge among the control and intervention groups was not different at baseline (P = 0.519).

Additionally, 77.8% of participants reported increased engagement in the flipped sessions. The greater mean scores after the teaching sessions represent the improved perception of the FC teaching-learning approach for repeatability and better memory retention. The FC method was found to be more effective than the traditional method of teaching. The students' feedback was positive toward the FC method. With careful preparation and faculty training, it can address the issue of medical students' lack of competency in pediatrics. CONCLUSIONS  The greater mean scores after the teaching sessions represent the improved perception of the FC teaching-learning approach for repeatability and better memory retention. The FC method was found to be more effective than the traditional method of teaching. The students' feedback was positive toward the FC method. With careful preparation and faculty training, it can address the issue of medical students' lack of competency in pediatrics.

Abstract: Access to sideline medical care is limited in many public-school athletic programs, especially in underserved urban areas. The Detroit Public School Health Corps (DPSHC) was founded in response to the tragic death of a Detroit public school basketball player who suffered a cardiac arrest during a game, underscoring the critical need for timely and effective sideline emergency care. DPSHC is a student-led inreach initiative targeting local healthcare gaps by providing equity-driven medical training in nearby schools. This study tests the hypothesis that simulation-based training will be more effective than traditional didactic training in improving a student volunteer's clinical preparedness, knowledge retention, and confidence in sideline medical roles. The primary objectives are to compare confidence and knowledge gains between the two training methods, while a secondary objective evaluates the perceived impact of resident physician involvement during simulation. INTRODUCTION Access to sideline medical care is limited in many public-school athletic programs, especially in underserved urban areas. The Detroit Public School Health Corps (DPSHC) was founded in response to the tragic death of a Detroit public school basketball player who suffered a cardiac arrest during a game, underscoring the critical need for timely and effective sideline emergency care.

This study tests the hypothesis that simulation-based training will be more effective than traditional didactic training in improving a student volunteer's clinical preparedness, knowledge retention, and confidence in sideline medical roles. The primary objectives are to compare confidence and knowledge gains between the two training methods, while a secondary objective evaluates the perceived impact of resident physician involvement during simulation.Forty-seven medical student volunteers completed either lecture-based (n=16) or simulation-based (n=31) training. Both groups completed identical pre- and post-training surveys assessing confidence in managing sports injuries and clinical knowledge. Paired t-tests analyzed the data to evaluate within-group improvements from before to after a training session, while independent t-tests compared the degree of improvement between training formats. METHODS Forty-seven medical student volunteers completed either lecture-based (n=16) or simulation-based (n=31) training. Both groups completed identical pre- and post-training surveys assessing confidence in managing sports injuries and clinical knowledge. Paired t-tests analyzed the data to evaluate within-group improvements from before to after a training session, while independent t-tests compared the degree of improvement between training formats.Both groups showed a significant improvement in confidence (p < 0.001). The simulation group showed greater confidence gains than the lecture group (33.06% vs. 24.53%, p = 0.02). Knowledge scores improved more in the simulation group (62.1% vs. 31.25%), though not significantly (p = 0.153). Resident physician involvement was rated invaluable by 25 (80.6%) of the simulation participants. RESULTS Both groups showed a significant improvement in confidence (p < 0.001).

Abstract: This letter responds to Jallad's (2024) study on immersive virtual reality (VR) applications in nursing anatomy education. While acknowledging the positive outcomes in student satisfaction and self‐directed learning, we discuss important considerations regarding implementation modalities, physical comfort, and knowledge retention. Drawing from recent literature, we highlight the need for careful evaluation of delivery methods and suggest incorporating peer‐facilitated learning sessions and long‐term follow‐up assessments.

Abstract: The study examines the effectiveness of microlearning in developing the capacity to address climate change and adapt to environmental challenges. Conducted as an online field experiment with 140 participants, the study focused on the impacts of smartphone use as an illustrative learning domain for education in climate change‐related areas. Using a pre–post research design and simultaneous equation models, the study found improvements in knowledge retention, with a median increase of 38%. The results indicated that the brief microlearning units also promoted sustainability action competencies, such as confidence in one's influence and willingness to act sustainably. This suggests that higher‐order learning processes were also triggered, although to a much lesser extent. Furthermore, learner satisfaction was identified as a mediating variable for these positive outcomes. The study concludes that short bursts of knowledge delivered through microlearning activities can be used alongside traditional training methods to build the critical skills needed for initiatives such as the EU Green Deal.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a game-based mobile application on nursing students' skills in administering subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) injections. Nursing education traditionally involves both theoretical and practical components. With the advent of digital technologies, innovative methods such as game-based learning have been introduced to enhance practical skills and knowledge retention in nursing education. This study explores the use of a mobile application designed to improve students' competence in SC and IM drug administration. This was an experimental study conducted during the 2021-2022 academic year. It involved a study group of 64 students who received training through a simulation game system and a control group of 65 students who underwent traditional training methods. Data were collected using the Self-Demonstration Form, the Study Process Questionnaire, and the Skills Performance List for Subcutaneous and Intramuscular Administration. The study focused on assessing the impact of game-based learning on students' performance and learning approaches. The study group showed significantly greater improvements in learning approaches and medication administration skills compared to the control group. Deep learning scores increased from 31.39 ± 6.23 to 45.05 ± 5.46 in the study group, versus 31.78 ± 5.68 to 37.02 ± 4.17 in the control group ( p  < 0.01). SC and IM administration scores improved significantly in the study group (SC: 22.50 ± 15.46 to 42.45 ± 11.66, p  = 0.015; IM: 27.75 ± 15.98 to 59.45 ± 12.95, p  < 0.001) compared to the control group. Scenario-based analyses also showed significant performance gains in the study group across all scenarios ( p  < 0.05). The HEM-SC-IM game-based mobile application proved effective in improving nursing students' skills in administering SC and IM injections. The interactive and engaging nature of game-based learning provides a valuable educational experience, promoting deeper understanding and practical skills development. This study supports the integration of educational technology in nursing curricula to enhance learning outcomes.The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a game-based mobile application on nursing students' skills in administering subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) injections.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of medical education requires innovative tools to help students manage cognitive overload. Concept mapping (CM) enhances knowledge retention and integration by visually organizing information, and has received positive feedback in various educational contexts. However, the use of CM combined with interactive 3D courseware to teach the cellular mechanisms of bacterial sepsis is underexplored. This study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating a 3D computer simulation with CM to improve understanding of sepsis. Fifty-two second-year medical students were randomized into three groups (A, B, and C). Each group completed five tasks: a pre-simulation self-assessment, a scaffolded pre-simulation CM, a computer simulation, a post-simulation CM, and a post-simulation self-assessment. Group A completed the tasks at the start of the sepsis case in the medical curriculum, Group B in the middle, and Group C at the end. A control group completed only the pre-simulation CM, and third-year students who had previously participated repeated the CM. Pre-simulation CM scores showed significant improvement in all three groups compared to the control group ( p  < 0.05). Post-simulation, Group C significantly outperformed Groups A and B ( p  < 0.05). Third-year students scored 15 points higher than Groups A and B ( p  < 0.001), but their scores were similar to Group C's. CM scores improved across all intervention groups, with Group C showing more than double the increase seen in Groups A and B. This study suggests that combining 3D simulations with CM is an effective strategy for teaching complex medical concepts and warrants further exploration of its long-term impact.The increasing complexity of medical education requires innovative tools to help students manage cognitive overload.

Abstract: Purpose Despite the availability of a vaccine to prevent Human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal cancer (НРУ-ОРС), its incidence has surpassed all other HPV-related cancers. Dental hygienists play an important role in patient education and vaccine counseling for the prevention of HPV-OPC. The purpose of this study was to assess the utilization of HPV Brief Motivational Interviewing (brief MI) Skills Based Training among the University of Minnesota (UMN) dental hygiene alumni. Methods A quantitative study was conducted with a convenience sample of dental hygiene alumni (classes of 2020-2024; п= 135) who completed HPV Brief MI Skills Based Training at the UMN. Multiple recruitment strategies were used including email, mail, social media, and snowball sampling. Participants completed a 37-item anonymous electronic survey via Qualtrics. The survey was adapted from previously used instruments to assess HPV knowledge, attitudes, current practices in HPV counseling, and the application of brief MI for the prevention of HPV-OPC. Results Among the participants (n=51), 49% reported using MI strategies to counsel at least one patient on prevention of HPV-OPC infections and indicated high comfort and confidence in applying MI strategies. However, most participants (73%) acknowledged they do not routinely discuss HPV with patients. Barriers included time constraints, vaccine resistance, difficulty initiating conversations, and lack of confidence or comfort during discussions. Results indicate that knowledge retention and attitudes may be influenced by frequency of practice. Conclusion Dental hygiene alumni from five consecutive cohorts who received HPV Brief MI Skills-Based Training reported comfort and confidence in HPV communication with patients. Findings suggest brief MI is an effective counseling strategy for HPV-OPC prevention and vaccine advocacy. Reported barriers to regular HPV-OPC prevention counseling suggest a change in dental practice culture may be needed.

Abstract: Background Active teaching-learning approaches involve students in the learning process, promoting critical thinking, problem-solving, and knowledge retention. These methods contrast with traditional didactic lectures, which focus on passive listening. This study aims to evaluate the perceptions and effectiveness of active teaching-learning methods among first-year medical students. Methodology A cross-sectional survey of 113 first-year medical students was conducted using a validated questionnaire (Cronbach's alpha = 0.873). Active teaching-learning methods, viz., small group discussions, case-based learning, flipped classroom, and early clinical exposure sessions, were implemented to enhance engagement among first-year MBBS students. The survey collected data on engagement, retention, and critical thinking through Likert-scale questions and open-ended feedback. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results Overall, 79.7% of students agreed that active teaching methods enhanced engagement, while 75.2% reported improved retention. Further, 83.2% felt their clinical reasoning skills benefited. Students emphasized the importance of interactive sessions and real-life clinical case discussions. Conclusions Active teaching-learning approaches improve engagement and critical thinking, aligning with the needs of modern medical education. Integration of these methods into the curriculum, alongside adequate resource allocation, is crucial for long-term success.Background Active teaching-learning approaches involve students in the learning process, promoting critical thinking, problem-solving, and knowledge retention.

Abstract: Purpose Despite the availability of a vaccine to prevent Human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC), its incidence has surpassed all other HPV-related cancers. Dental hygienists play an important role in patient education and vaccine counseling for the prevention of HPV-OPC. The purpose of this study was to assess the utilization of HPV Brief Motivational Interviewing (brief MI) Skills Based Training among the University of Minnesota (UMN) dental hygiene alumni. Methods A quantitative study was conducted with a convenience sample of dental hygiene alumni (classes of 2020-2024; n=135) who completed HPV Brief MI Skills Based Training at the UMN. Multiple recruitment strategies were used including email, mail, social media, and snowball sampling. Participants completed a 37-item anonymous electronic survey via Qualtrics. The survey was adapted from previously used instruments to assess HPV knowledge, attitudes, current practices in HPV counseling, and the application of brief MI for the prevention of HPV-OPC. Results Among the participants (n=51), 49% reported using MI strategies to counsel at least one patient on prevention of HPV-OPC infections and indicated high comfort and confidence in applying MI strategies. However, most participants (73%) acknowledged they do not routinely discuss HPV with patients. Barriers included time constraints, vaccine resistance, difficulty initiating conversations, and lack of confidence or comfort during discussions. Results indicate that knowledge retention and attitudes may be influenced by frequency of practice. Conclusion Dental hygiene alumni from five consecutive cohorts who received HPV Brief MI Skills-Based Training reported comfort and confidence in HPV communication with patients. Findings suggest brief MI is an effective counseling strategy for HPV-OPC prevention and vaccine advocacy. Reported barriers to regular HPV-OPC prevention counseling suggest a change in dental practice culture may be needed.Purpose Despite the availability of a vaccine to prevent Human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC), its incidence has surpassed all other HPV-related cancers.

Abstract: Dementia is a growing global public health concern, particularly in LMICs like Bangladesh. With population aging, there is an increasing prevalence of dementia; care facilities are limited. This scarcity of services places a significant responsibility on untrained family caregivers, impacting the health of persons with dementia and their caregivers. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving dementia care, especially in resource-constrained settings. Recognizing the urgency, the WHO developed an online self-training manual, iSupport, emphasizing education, skill development, and support for caregivers. This study aims to test feasibility of iSupport i) in improving knowledge about dementia and dementia care among family and formal caregivers, and ii) reducing family caregivers’ stress and improving their caregiving skills, mental health, quality of life and relationship with the person with dementia cared for. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of SAJIDA Foundation (2024–005-SFIRB). This non-randomized feasibility study aims to recruit 44 family caregivers and 132 formal caregivers from Dhaka, Bangladesh, using a purposive sampling technique. Participants will be provided access to iSupport for two months. Pre- and post-intervention surveys will be conducted to assess changes in knowledge about dementia care among both family and formal caregivers, as well as changes in psychological well-being among family caregivers. To assess knowledge retention, a follow-up survey will be conducted. Any differences in the outcomes from the pre-intervention period will be tested against the null hypothesis of zero mean difference using a two-sample paired t-test. Additionally, multivariable regression techniques will also be used to control for possible confounders. To understand the facilitators and barriers of implementing iSupport, a qualitative approach will be used to interview 15 family caregivers and conduct four FGDs with formal caregivers. Qualitative data will be analysed using an inductive content analysis approach.

Abstract: Serious games (SGs) are increasingly used in education, although data on their use in neurology education are limited. This study evaluates SG effect on knowledge retention, subjective impression of decision making, and learner satisfaction. Background and Objectives Serious games (SGs) are increasingly used in education, although data on their use in neurology education are limited. This study evaluates SG effect on knowledge retention, subjective impression of decision making, and learner satisfaction.Using a 6-step approach to curriculum development, we designed a digital interactive course as a SG, incorporating realistic video simulations to teach neurologic emergencies. A randomized intervention study compared the SG method (intervention) with clinical case seminars (seminar groups B and C) and no instruction (control group). Knowledge retention was assessed through multiple-choice (MC) tests immediately and 3 weeks postinstruction. Secondary measures included student satisfaction and usability. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 29.0, and free-text responses were analyzed qualitatively.

Descriptive statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 29.0, and free-text responses were analyzed qualitatively.The survey initially included 77 students (control, n = 16; SG, n = 32; seminar control, n = 29), with 57 completing the follow-up survey. Scores on the MC test were similar immediately after the course (SG: 70.1%, Seminar Group B: 65.0%, Seminar Group C: 67.0%) and declined less for the SG (4.1%) than the seminar groups (10.9% for B, 5.5% for C). Likert scale responses exhibited higher satisfaction and usability in the SG group, with 93.5% of SG participants reporting a reduction in fear of clinical emergencies. Feedback from the SG participants was mostly positive, with many commenting on the engaging structure of the course. Results The survey initially included 77 students (control, n = 16; SG, n = 32; seminar control, n = 29), with 57 completing the follow-up survey. Scores on the MC test were similar immediately after the course (SG: 70.1%, Seminar Group B: 65.0%, Seminar Group C: 67.0%) and declined less for the SG (4.1%) than the seminar groups (10.9% for B, 5.5% for C). Likert scale responses exhibited higher satisfaction and usability in the SG group, with 93.5% of SG participants reporting a reduction in fear of clinical emergencies. Feedback from the SG participants was mostly positive, with many commenting on the engaging structure of the course.Video-based SGs have shown efficacy in teaching neurologic emergency medicine. SG-acquired knowledge is more sustained than that acquired through traditional teaching formats and is well-received by Generation Z students.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition encountered by all physicians and healthcare providers. Data indicate that physicians often fail to recognize this syndrome, leading to misdiagnosis, mismanagement, and adverse outcomes. This educational program aimed to assess knowledge about anaphylaxis in a cohort of internal medicine residents and develop and test the efficacy of an educational intervention in addressing gaps in understanding of this critical condition. METHODS: An in-person educational intervention, including a lecture and case-based open discussion, was delivered to 44 internal medicine residents at an academic medical center with pre- and post-intervention selfassessments. Our primary outcome was the change in the rate of residents being able to correctly identify critical features of anaphylaxis and appropriate treatment. Longer-term follow-up was completed in a subset of residents to assess knowledge retention. RESULTS: Immediately following the educational intervention, there was increased likelihood of diagnosing anaphylaxis in a written case scenario from 69% to 91% (RR: 1.30; 95% CI 1.09,1.56) and reporting the correct dose and route of administration of epinephrine from 19% to 95% (RR:4.96; 95% CI: 2.26, 10.88). Residents also demonstrated increased identification of cardiovascular compromise in anaphylaxis, as well as often underrecognized gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms after the intervention. In an assessment evaluating longitudinal retention up to 15 months after the intervention, approximately 50% of those who responded to the longitudinal survey correctly recalled the dosing and route of administration of epinephrine for treating anaphylaxis. DISCUSSION: A brief educational session on anaphylaxis was successful in improving residents7 short-term knowledge about diagnosis and treatment of anaphylaxis and may also impact long-term retention.

Comparing the effectiveness of multiple text reading and rereading on knowledge retention and metacognitive accuracy

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/comparing-effectiveness-multiple-text-reading/docview/3217829359/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Although learning approaches are designed to enhance individuals' ability to store and retrieve information, not all of them are considered effective. The goal of the present study was to experimentally compare the test performance as well as the accuracy of metacognitive judgements of a multiple text reading group, rereading group, and single reading group in a one-day vs. one-week delayed test (3 × 2 between subject design). A total of 186 psychology students ( M age  = 20.76) participated in the experiment focused on reading comprehension, accuracy of metacognitive judgments and knowledge retention. Results of the knowledge test indicate that in the one-day delayed test, multiple text reading and rereading yield similar results: both deliver slightly better results than single reading. In the one-week delayed test, though, multiple text reading yields better results than rereading, and both these reading approaches outperform single reading. Moreover, multiple text reading results in fairly robust knowledge retention with only a slight decrease in scores between the one-day delayed and one-week delayed test. Regarding metacognitive monitoring, judgements of learning in the multiple text reading group remained relatively stable after each reading and participants were underconfident about their knowledge. In the rereading group, judgements of learning increased after each reading and participants were overconfident about their knowledge, especially on the one-day delayed test. These findings have implications for educational practices aimed at enhancing learning outcomes and promoting effective learning.

Abstract: Why did you do this work? Kawasaki disease (KD) is the leading cause of acquired childhood cardiac disease, increasing four-fold over the past decade in the UK. 1 It remains perceivably rare, contributing to delayed diagnosis: 7.8 days from symptom onset on average, where best cardiac outcomes necessitate treatment <7 days. Non-specific symptoms and lack of definitive biomarkers further compounds diagnostic delay. 2 Only 30% present <1 year old, yet this group carries nearly double the risk of aneurysms. 3 Our programme aimed to raise awareness of KD among the paediatric resident workforce. What did you do? A regional training programme on KD was developed, using real case examples provided by Societi, the UK foundation for KD, and the literature aiming to create interactive, case-based sessions which would raise awareness amongst clinicians about KD. 4 The cases were chosen as they identified important knowledge gaps or learning from patient morbidity aiming to improve clinician knowledge so that KD is considered earlier and more seriously in the patient journey. The programme was piloted at one Trust in a face-to-face format, with participants ranging from Foundation doctors to Consultants. Feedback was elicited from all participants via LearnLoop and free-text feedback was analysed thematically. Following feedback, the session was refined and expanded regionally via video-link to multiple hospitals. Feedback was used to understand what participants learned with a view to adapting session content and structure to enhance this in future. What did you find? Sessions were attended by resident doctors ranging from Foundation doctors to Consultant. Participants self-identified their take-home learning which included the need for early recognition to prevent poor cardiac outcomes, awareness of the BCG sign and recognition of incomplete Kawasaki presentations, especially in older or younger children, who are more likely to be overlooked. The pilot session achieved a feedback score of 94.3/100, which increased to 95.3/100 following regional roll-out. Themes from free-text feedback included: the importance of recognising incomplete Kawasaki, awareness of epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, and the value of case-based learning. Participants reported feeling more confident in identifying KD following the sessions, but assessing change in practice and long-term retention were beyond the scope of this pilot. What does it mean? The training sessions were valued by participants and increased self-reported confidence in recognising KD among resident doctors in paediatrics. Participants expressed interest in expanding the programme into longer, face-to-face interactive sessions. This initiative contributes to raising awareness of KD and forms part of a larger body of work. Feedback suggests that a longer study day or regional workshop would have merit and meet an identified learning need, alongside formal evaluation of impact on knowledge retention and practice.

Developing safe and responsible large language model: can we balance bias reduction and language understanding?

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/developing-safe-responsible-large-language-model/docview/3207676401/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation and translation, among others. However, these models often generate texts that can perpetuate biases. Existing approaches to mitigate these biases usually compromise knowledge retention. This study explores whether LLMs can produce safe, unbiased outputs without sacrificing knowledge or comprehension. We introduce the Safe and Responsible Large Language Model ( SR LLM ), which has been instruction fine-tuned atop of a safe fine-tuned auto-regressive decoder-only LLM to reduce biases in generated texts. We developed a specialized dataset with examples of unsafe and corresponding safe variations to train SR LLM to identify and correct biased text. Experiments on our specialized dataset and out-of-distribution test sets reveal that SR LLM effectively reduces biases while preserving knowledge integrity. This performance surpasses that of traditional fine-tuning of smaller language models and base LLMs that merely reply on prompting techniques. Our findings demonstrate that instruction fine-tuning on custom datasets tailored for tasks such as debiasing is a highly effective strategy for minimizing bias in LLM while preserving their inherent knowledge and capabilities. The code and dataset are accessible at https://github.com/shainarazavi/Safe-Responsible-LLM .

Abstract: This letter responds to Jallad's (2024) study on immersive virtual reality (VR) applications in nursing anatomy education. While acknowledging the positive outcomes in student satisfaction and self-directed learning, we discuss important considerations regarding implementation modalities, physical comfort, and knowledge retention. Drawing from recent literature, we highlight the need for careful evaluation of delivery methods and suggest incorporating peer-facilitated learning sessions and long-term follow-up assessments. The letter emphasizes the importance of strategic implementation to maximize educational benefits while minimizing potential drawbacks in VR-based anatomy education.This letter responds to Jallad's (2024) study on immersive virtual reality (VR) applications in nursing anatomy education.

Abstract: As the world becomes more technology focused, emerging technologies such as extended reality (XR) have been incorporated into medical education over the past few decades. Now that XR is more accessible to physician assistant (PA) education, educators must determine the extent to which XR can improve knowledge retention over current modalities. The purpose of this article was to perform a review of what XR pedagogical approaches are being used in PA education and what value they provide to learning. INTRODUCTION As the world becomes more technology focused, emerging technologies such as extended reality (XR) have been incorporated into medical education over the past few decades. Now that XR is more accessible to physician assistant (PA) education, educators must determine the extent to which XR can improve knowledge retention over current modalities. The purpose of this article was to perform a review of what XR pedagogical approaches are being used in PA education and what value they provide to learning.A thorough literature database search conducted by a research librarian identified 228 unique articles published between 2012 and August 2023. These articles were further categorized by date, language, study method, and population sample and further screened for relevance and eligibility. Of the 228 unique articles identified, 8 met the eligibility criteria for this review.

General impressions of XR in PA education reflect its potential to supplement current methods; however, the authors also admit the need for additional critical analysis. RESULTS The focus of research ranged from XR integration to proof of concept of XR in educational environments. Selected studies used both qualitative and quantitative data. General impressions of XR in PA education reflect its potential to supplement current methods; however, the authors also admit the need for additional critical analysis.While there is a paucity of research into this specific topic, multiple studies showed that using XR principles in medical education led to better confidence among students and improved their perception of learning. While there currently is no direct statistically significant evidence to show a superiority of XR over traditional didactic learning, it is important to consider that not all educational tools need to improve outcomes; rather, they can improve student perception, which opens the door to further learning. Future studies should continue to longitudinally evaluate integrating XR into PA programs with a specific focus on knowledge retention.

Abstract: The spreading of digital tools for learning has been impressive in later years. Some attempts have been made to augment traditional tools with digital solutions, still offering the chance to propose multisensory stimulation and interactivity. In this context, the aim of this study is to strengthen the importance of a multisensorial approach as a key factor in the development of learning devices in educational settings. We focused on investigating if there was a significant difference in knowledge retention when adding to the learning experience the stimulation of increasingly more sensorial channels using tangible interfaces. Results indicate that children recall more information if the interface is enhanced through multisensory materials including auditory, visual, and olfactory stimuli. This effect is even stronger when the time between exposition and recall is longer. This study supports the potential of merging digital and physical elements in educational materials to foster learning, in particular, it adds new data supporting the use of the sense of smell to improve memory retention.

Abstract: Electrodiagnostic studies are critical for surgical decision-making in nerve injuries. Surgeons typically rely on the electrodiagnostician's reports and lack formal training in electrodiagnostic study interpretation. This knowledge gap highlights a need for accessible and effective educational resources for surgeons to improve their understanding of electrodiagnostic studies and enhance patient care. BACKGROUND Electrodiagnostic studies are critical for surgical decision-making in nerve injuries. Surgeons typically rely on the electrodiagnostician's reports and lack formal training in electrodiagnostic study interpretation. This knowledge gap highlights a need for accessible and effective educational resources for surgeons to improve their understanding of electrodiagnostic studies and enhance patient care.The educational module consisted of a prelecture knowledge assessment, a 42-minute video lecture on interpreting electrodiagnostic study results, and a postlecture knowledge assessment. Knowledge retention was assessed by means of an additional survey distributed 3 months after module completion. METHODS The educational module consisted of a prelecture knowledge assessment, a 42-minute video lecture on interpreting electrodiagnostic study results, and a postlecture knowledge assessment. Knowledge retention was assessed by means of an additional survey distributed 3 months after module completion.This study, involving 119 participants (79% attending surgeons, 8% fellows, 9% surgical residents, and 2% who described their position as "other"), demonstrated that a 42-minute video-based learning module significantly improved knowledge of electrodiagnostic study interpretation. Median scores increased from 7 to 9 ( P < 0.001), with improvement persisting at 3 months (median retention score, 11; P < 0.025). Among surgeons completing the 3-month assessment, 65.5% reported that knowledge gained from the module had changed their clinical practice. RESULTS This study, involving 119 participants (79% attending surgeons, 8% fellows, 9% surgical residents, and 2% who described their position as "other"), demonstrated that a 42-minute video-based learning module significantly improved knowledge of electrodiagnostic study interpretation. Median scores increased from 7 to 9 ( P < 0.001), with improvement persisting at 3 months (median retention score, 11; P < 0.025). Among surgeons completing the 3-month assessment, 65.5% reported that knowledge gained from the module had changed their clinical practice.This study demonstrates that a concise, video-based learning module can effectively enhance surgeon knowledge of electrodiagnostic study interpretation and may serve as a valuable tool for surgical education and improving patient selection in nerve surgery. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that a concise, video-based learning module can effectively enhance surgeon knowledge of electrodiagnostic study interpretation and may serve as a valuable tool for surgical education and improving patient selection in nerve surgery.

Abstract: Surface dyslexia and dysgraphia are considered diagnostic features of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) and are useful signs in English, a language whose attributes afford numerous opportunities to observe these phenomena. This, however, is not the case in many languages, including Italian, that have high transparency between orthography and phonology, making surface reading and spelling errors scarce. This creates a problem in applying the diagnostic recommendations for svPPA in such languages. Surface dyslexia and dysgraphia are examples of ‘regularization’ errors in which semantic knowledge loss leads to a failure to recognize exceptions that do not follow standard rules of pronunciation. Another form of regularization involves the incorrect inflection of irregular verbs using the rules that govern regular verbs. Unlike irregularly pronounced words, Italian, as with many languages, has numerous irregular verbs. The Italian Verb Inflection Test (IVIT) was developed to test the hypothesis that svPPA would regularize irregular verbs when inflecting them into two Italian past tenses. Results confirmed that people with svPPA made a significantly greater proportion of regularization errors compared to people with typical Alzheimer's disease or logopenic variant PPA. Without recourse to the other diagnostic features of PPA subgroups, the IVIT on its own could separate svPPA from these other two groups with 70% sensitivity and ~ 80% specificity. Regularization of irregular verb inflection offers a solution to the problem of applying the surface dyslexia/dysgraphia criterion for svPPA diagnosis in Italian.

Abstract: Surface dyslexia and dysgraphia are considered diagnostic features of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) and are useful signs in English, a language whose attributes afford numerous opportunities to observe these phenomena. This, however, is not the case in many languages, including Italian, that have high transparency between orthography and phonology, making surface reading and spelling errors scarce. This creates a problem in applying the diagnostic recommendations for svPPA in such languages. Surface dyslexia and dysgraphia are examples of 'regularization' errors in which semantic knowledge loss leads to a failure to recognize exceptions that do not follow standard rules of pronunciation. Another form of regularization involves the incorrect inflection of irregular verbs using the rules that govern regular verbs. Unlike irregularly pronounced words, Italian, as with many languages, has numerous irregular verbs. The Italian Verb Inflection Test (IVIT) was developed to test the hypothesis that svPPA would regularize irregular verbs when inflecting them into two Italian past tenses. Results confirmed that people with svPPA made a significantly greater proportion of regularization errors compared to people with typical Alzheimer's disease or logopenic variant PPA. Without recourse to the other diagnostic features of PPA subgroups, the IVIT on its own could separate svPPA from these other two groups with 70% sensitivity and ~ 80% specificity. Regularization of irregular verb inflection offers a solution to the problem of applying the surface dyslexia/dysgraphia criterion for svPPA diagnosis in Italian.Surface dyslexia and dysgraphia are considered diagnostic features of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) and are useful signs in English, a language whose attributes afford numerous opportunities to observe these phenomena.

Abstract: In simulation-based education, the effectiveness of observation or active participation on the retention of knowledge and skills is uncertain. The aim of the study was to investigate knowledge retention, technical and non-technical skills and self-efficacy among observers and active participants in a simulated palliative extubation. BACKGROUND In simulation-based education, the effectiveness of observation or active participation on the retention of knowledge and skills is uncertain. The aim of the study was to investigate knowledge retention, technical and non-technical skills and self-efficacy among observers and active participants in a simulated palliative extubation.We included medical and nursing undergraduates and residents. On the first day, participants were divided into observers and active participants, each with one participant from medical and nursing backgrounds. We presented a recorded lecture, followed by knowledge and self-efficacy tests for all participants before and after the simulation. After fourteen days, both groups actively participated in the scenario, without observers. We assessed technical and non-technical skills during the simulation and repeated the knowledge and self-efficacy tests after the training. METHOD We included medical and nursing undergraduates and residents. On the first day, participants were divided into observers and active participants, each with one participant from medical and nursing backgrounds. We presented a recorded lecture, followed by knowledge and self-efficacy tests for all participants before and after the simulation. After fourteen days, both groups actively participated in the scenario, without observers. We assessed technical and non-technical skills during the simulation and repeated the knowledge and self-efficacy tests after the training.Forty-four individuals participated in this study, half from each training programme. Knowledge improved after the first training in both groups, with a significant drop only for active participants after 14 days. Self-efficacy increased in both groups, being higher for the active participants. After 14 days, active participants performed better in technical skills compared to observers, but it was similar in both groups for non-technical skills. RESULTS Forty-four individuals participated in this study, half from each training programme. Knowledge improved after the first training in both groups, with a significant drop only for active participants after 14 days. Self-efficacy increased in both groups, being higher for the active participants. After 14 days, active participants performed better in technical skills compared to observers, but it was similar in both groups for non-technical skills.Active participation seems superior to observation in the development of self-efficacy and the retention of technical skills. Observation may be superior to active participation in knowledge retention. Retention of non-technical skills appears to be similar with both observation and active participation. The findings have important implications for current simulation-based education, but further research is recommended. CONCLUSIONS Active participation seems superior to observation in the development of self-efficacy and the retention of technical skills. Observation may be superior to active participation in knowledge retention. Retention of non-technical skills appears to be similar with both observation and active participation. The findings have important implications for current simulation-based education, but further research is recommended.

Abstract: ENG English eng Simulation-based training is a vital tool in obstetrics and gynaecology education, addressing challenges such as limited clinical exposure during short rotation periods and gender-related sensitivities. This need is further underscored by the fact that non-obstetricians and non-midwives often serve as first responders in out-of-hospital and acute care settings where vaginal birth (VB) is imminent. Traditional mannequin-based simulations depend on in-person tutors with demands on time and physical space. In the absence of realistic clinical scenarios, they serve no better than low-fidelity task trainers. Capitalising on recent advancements in affordable virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display (HMD) technology, we developed and iteratively refined a VR-based childbirth training system between 2020 and 2025. Initial user studies demonstrated strong knowledge retention although participants expressed a preference for in-person mannequin-based simulations due to the lack of tactile feedback in VR. To address this limitation, we introduced a mixed reality (MR)-enhanced childbirth training system in 2024. This innovative approach integrates high-precision alignment of virtual elements with physical mannequins and introduces a tactile component to enhance skill acquisition. A pilot study involving 35 Year 4 undergraduate students yielded positive feedback with participants praising the system’s heightened realism and opportunities for peer-to-peer interaction. While both VR and MR have distinct advan-tages and limitations, the affordability and versatility of modern HMD make VR/MR-based training modules highly scalable and adaptable to diverse scenarios, surpassing the single-task limitations of traditional mannequins. This promises to improve training efficiency and expand access to VB training for a broader range of healthcare professionals.

Abstract: Gamification has emerged as a transformative approach in nursing education, especially within simulation-based learning environments. It is recognized for enhancing student engagement, knowledge retention, and confidence. Despite its potential, limited research has explored the perceptions and confidence of nurse educators and students, as well as the challenges encountered during its implementation. The study aimed to assess the perceptions and confidence of nurse educators and nursing students towards integrating gamification into simulation-based nursing education, identify implementation barriers, and develop and validate two psychometric tools: the Gamification Perception Assessment Tool and the Nurse Educator Confidence Tool. BACKGROUND Gamification has emerged as a transformative approach in nursing education, especially within simulation-based learning environments. It is recognized for enhancing student engagement, knowledge retention, and confidence. Despite its potential, limited research has explored the perceptions and confidence of nurse educators and students, as well as the challenges encountered during its implementation. The study aimed to assess the perceptions and confidence of nurse educators and nursing students towards integrating gamification into simulation-based nursing education, identify implementation barriers, and develop and validate two psychometric tools: the Gamification Perception Assessment Tool and the Nurse Educator Confidence Tool.A convergent mixed-methods design was utilized, involving 115 nurse educators and 317 nursing students from eight nursing institutions in Cairo. Quantitative data were collected using the newly developed tools, which underwent rigorous validation through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and reliability testing. Qualitative data were collected via semi-structured questionnaires and interviews with nurse educators and analyzed thematically to explore implementation challenges. METHODS A convergent mixed-methods design was utilized, involving 115 nurse educators and 317 nursing students from eight nursing institutions in Cairo. Quantitative data were collected using the newly developed tools, which underwent rigorous validation through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and reliability testing. Qualitative data were collected via semi-structured questionnaires and interviews with nurse educators and analyzed thematically to explore implementation challenges.The overall mean perception score was 34.8 ± 8.4 for nursing students and 36.3 ± 7.9 for nurse educators, with the majority of participants in both groups showing a high perception level (61.7% for educators and 58.9% for students). Nurse educators displayed moderate to high confidence, which was significantly influenced by their experience and prior training. A strong positive correlation (r = 0.711, p = 0.001) was found between perception and confidence. The psychometric tools demonstrated high reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.68-0.85) and model fit. Thematic analysis revealed barriers such as institutional policy gaps, limited IT support, and lack of training.

However, successful implementation requires institutional support, faculty training, and standardized evaluation tools to overcome existing challenges and optimize educational outcomes. The study provides validated tools and empirical insights into gamification in nursing education. CONCLUSION Gamification is positively perceived and fosters educator confidence in simulation-based nursing education.

Abstract: Mushrooms are a ubiquitous and essential component in our biological environment and have been of interest to humans around the globe for millennia. Knowledge about mushrooms represents a prime example of cumulative culture, one of the key processes in human evolution. Based on a review of available research, we argue that the cognitive mechanisms of cultural transmission impact this knowledge in a twofold manner. First and foremost, they secure the accumulation of (folk‐)mycological knowledge, with the principal objective to capture reliable information on edibility and means for safe distinction. However, they also shape attitudes toward mushrooms, practices involved in foraging and consumption, and appraisals of edibility in distinct ways, with even regression and eventual loss of knowledge as one possible outcome. In using the domain of mushrooms as an example for expounding this dual role that culture plays during knowledge transmission, our paper contributes to theoretical debates around the cognitive and cultural mechanisms involved in human evolution.

Abstract: Major obstetric hemorrhage is the leading direct cause of maternal mortality throughout the world. To prevent maternal mortality, it is crucial to raise concerns regarding the knowledge and skill levels of the healthcare providers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of simulation-based learning on the knowledge retention and skills of health professionals managing postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in the maternity hospitals of a low-resource country. BACKGROUND Major obstetric hemorrhage is the leading direct cause of maternal mortality throughout the world. To prevent maternal mortality, it is crucial to raise concerns regarding the knowledge and skill levels of the healthcare providers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of simulation-based learning on the knowledge retention and skills of health professionals managing postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in the maternity hospitals of a low-resource country.This was a prospective randomized controlled study consisting of two groups: Control Group was made up of maternity hospital healthcare providers whose training was exclusively theory-based and Intervention Group healthcare providers who underwent simulation training in conjunction with theoretical instruction on diagnosing and managing PPH. The training modules were taken from the John Hopkins University Affiliate (JHPIEGO) Helping Mothers Survive version 2018 training program. The mean percentage of correct answers in MCQs and OSCEs was collected from pre-tests, immediate post-tests, and post-tests at 3- and 6-months post training. METHODS This was a prospective randomized controlled study consisting of two groups: Control Group was made up of maternity hospital healthcare providers whose training was exclusively theory-based and Intervention Group healthcare providers who underwent simulation training in conjunction with theoretical instruction on diagnosing and managing PPH. The training modules were taken from the John Hopkins University Affiliate (JHPIEGO) Helping Mothers Survive version 2018 training program. The mean percentage of correct answers in MCQs and OSCEs was collected from pre-tests, immediate post-tests, and post-tests at 3- and 6-months post training.The post-test immediately after the theoretical training showed an increase in the mean MCQ percentages for both groups. From 47.5 to 66.7% for intervention group versus 49.6-69.6% for control group; no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.285). After simulation training, for the interventional group, the mean percentage increased from 66.7 to 79.2%, an increase of approximately 12%. There was a regression in the mean percentage in both groups in the post-test at 3- and 6-months after the training, but it was much more pronounced in the control group, p = 0.000. OSCE assessments revealed a statistically significant improvement in skills in interventional group compared to control group (p < 0.05). Knowledge and skills diminished over time in control group, bordering on pre-training levels at 6 months post training. The member team in the intervention group had maintained a high level of knowledge and skill 6 months after the training. RESULTS The post-test immediately after the theoretical training showed an increase in the mean MCQ percentages for both groups. From 47.5 to 66.7% for intervention group versus 49.6-69.6% for control group; no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.285).

Training should be repeated after a period of 6 months to enhance knowledge and skill retention. CONCLUSION Simulation-based training has a part to play in training healthcare providers to manage post-partum hemorrhage. Training should be repeated after a period of 6 months to enhance knowledge and skill retention.NCT05979701. TRIAL REGISTRATION NCT05979701.

Abstract: Nursing is both an art and a science, demanding specific qualities and competencies from students to succeed. These attributes are essential for effective practice and long-term professional growth. If not developed, they may negatively impact patient outcomes and safety, contributing to medical errors, higher mortality rates, and job dissatisfaction. BACKGROUND Nursing is both an art and a science, demanding specific qualities and competencies from students to succeed. These attributes are essential for effective practice and long-term professional growth. If not developed, they may negatively impact patient outcomes and safety, contributing to medical errors, higher mortality rates, and job dissatisfaction.This study examines the impact of collaborative testing on students' retention of emergency nursing concepts and the development of soft skills. AIM This study examines the impact of collaborative testing on students' retention of emergency nursing concepts and the development of soft skills.A quasi-experimental research design was employed, adhering to the STROBE guidelines. DESIGN A quasi-experimental research design was employed, adhering to the STROBE guidelines.A total of 100 students enrolled in an emergency nursing course participated in the study. They were randomly assigned to either a control group (50 students) or an experimental group (50 students). Data was collected using the Emergency Nursing Academic Achievement Questionnaire and the Collaborative Testing Satisfaction Survey. METHODS AND TOOLS A total of 100 students enrolled in an emergency nursing course participated in the study. They were randomly assigned to either a control group (50 students) or an experimental group (50 students). Data was collected using the Emergency Nursing Academic Achievement Questionnaire and the Collaborative Testing Satisfaction Survey.The findings revealed a significant improvement in the intervention group's post-lecture test scores for tests 2, 3, 4, and 5 (p < 0.001), while no significant difference was observed in the first post-lecture test between the two groups (p = 0.415). Additionally, the intervention group demonstrated significantly higher scores in both the mid-term and final written examinations, indicating enhanced retention of course material (p < 0.001). Furthermore, 84% of students reported high satisfaction, while 14% expressed moderate satisfaction with the collaborative testing experience. They also perceived an improvement in their soft skills, with an overall score of 95.64 ± 4.35. RESULTS The findings revealed a significant improvement in the intervention group's post-lecture test scores for tests 2, 3, 4, and 5 (p < 0.001), while no significant difference was observed in the first post-lecture test between the two groups (p = 0.415). Additionally, the intervention group demonstrated significantly higher scores in both the mid-term and final written examinations, indicating enhanced retention of course material (p < 0.001). Furthermore, 84% of students reported high satisfaction, while 14% expressed moderate satisfaction with the collaborative testing experience. They also perceived an improvement in their soft skills, with an overall score of 95.64 ± 4.35.The results of this study suggest that engaging students in collaborative testing significantly enhances their retention of emergency nursing concepts compared to individual testing. Moreover, most students found the collaborative experience highly satisfactory, reporting improvements in their comprehension of course material, critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and engagement, key competencies for nursing professionals. Additionally, students recommended implementing this approach in other courses. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that engaging students in collaborative testing significantly enhances their retention of emergency nursing concepts compared to individual testing. Moreover, most students found the collaborative experience highly satisfactory, reporting improvements in their comprehension of course material, critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and engagement, key competencies for nursing professionals. Additionally, students recommended implementing this approach in other courses.Incorporating collaborative testing into nursing curricula can promote deeper learning and long-term knowledge retention of critical emergency concepts. From a practical standpoint, this model simulates real-world nursing teamwork, allowing students to practice decision-making, communication, and mutual accountability. It can also help reduce test anxiety, encourage peer learning, and better prepare students for interdisciplinary collaboration and emergency response scenarios they will encounter in clinical practice. Nurse educators should consider adopting collaborative assessment strategies as part of a broader pedagogical shift toward active, team-based learning that mirrors the collaborative nature of modern healthcare settings.

Based on a review of available research, we argue that the cognitive mechanisms of cultural transmission impact this knowledge in a twofold manner. First and foremost, they secure the accumulation of (folk-)mycological knowledge, with the principal objective to capture reliable information on edibility and means for safe distinction. However, they also shape attitudes toward mushrooms, practices involved in foraging and consumption, and appraisals of edibility in distinct ways, with even regression and eventual loss of knowledge as one possible outcome. In using the domain of mushrooms as an example for expounding this dual role that culture plays during knowledge transmission, our paper contributes to theoretical debates around the cognitive and cultural mechanisms involved in human evolution.

Abstract: Purpose This study aims to examine a catharsis-based interdisciplinary approach to learning retention. It introduces a theoretical framework as a structured approach to learning that enhances emotional investment, optimises cognitive processing and strengthens long-term knowledge retention. Design/methodology/approach The study uses integrative literature review as a theoretical–conceptual approach, synthesising research from educational psychology, workplace learning and affective neuroscience. The proposed framework places catharsis as a mechanism for emotional engagement, with cognitive load moderating its effectiveness in workplace training. Findings Catharsis-based learning enhances knowledge retention through engagement on a deeper emotional level. Cognitive load acts as the moderator, highlighting the need to organise emotionally engaging training, like storytelling, simulation and guided reflection, to maximise cognitive retention and practical application. Practical implications This study provides a structured framework for corporate training that integrates catharsis to enhance learning retention. Practitioners can design emotionally compelling, retention-driven training by curating adaptive learning interventions, thus ensuring engagement and learning retrieval. The model is particularly well-suited for high-stakes decision-making and behavioural skills, including leadership development, cultural sensitization and DEI initiatives. Originality/value This research provides a structured framework for academic research, corporate training and HRD practitioners. Unlike conventional learning models, which address only surface-level emotional processing, this study positions catharsis as a pathway to emotional resolution for enhancing learning and long-term memory.

Abstract: Podcasts have become increasingly prominent as tools for health communication, offering flexible and accessible formats for patient education. While widely used in professional training, their role in supporting patient-centered learning remains underexplored. BACKGROUND Podcasts have become increasingly prominent as tools for health communication, offering flexible and accessible formats for patient education. While widely used in professional training, their role in supporting patient-centered learning remains underexplored.This systematic review synthesized studies published from 2010 to 2024 concerning podcast use in patient education. Five databases-PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Embase-were searched using defined keywords. Studies were selected based on relevance to patient education through podcasts, and outcomes such as knowledge retention, comprehension, and engagement. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. Quality assessment was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the CASP checklist. A thematic synthesis approach was employed to analyze qualitative and quantitative findings.

Abstract: Background: Active learning strategies have become increasingly prominent in medical education. Among them, self-directed learning (SDL) and the Jigsaw method aim to enhance student engagement and improve knowledge retention. However, direct comparisons of these strategies within physiology education remain limited, particularly in the Indian context. Objectives: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of SDL and the Jigsaw method on selected physiology topics among first-year Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) students. Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental crossover study at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Raebareli, India, between February and March 2025. First-year MBBS students participated in both SDL and Jigsaw sessions covering two different topics. In Phase 1, students from Batch A engaged in SDL, while Batch B employed the Jigsaw method to learn about ascending tracts. In Phase 2, the methods were reversed: Batch A used the Jigsaw approach, and Batch B engaged in SDL to study sleep physiology. Each session lasted 150 minutes. Knowledge gain was assessed using presession and postsession multiple-choice question (MCQ) tests. Students' perceptions regarding their learning experience, engagement, autonomy, and knowledge retention were measured using a validated 5-point Likert scale questionnaire. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for statistical analysis, with a p value of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 88 students underwent crossover. Both SDL and Jigsaw sessions significantly improved posttest MCQ scores compared to pretest scores. The two methods showed no significant difference in the overall pretest and posttest scores. However, students rated the Jigsaw method higher than SDL for overall experience (median 4.5 vs. 3.5; p < 0.001), engagement (4.7 vs. 4; p < 0.001), and knowledge retention (4.3 vs. 4; p < 0.001). Autonomy scores did not differ significantly (4.5 vs. 4.5; p = 0.16). A majority (69.3%) preferred the Jigsaw approach over SDL. Conclusion: Both the SDL and Jigsaw methods effectively enhance learning outcomes in selected physiology topics among first-year MBBS students. However, the Jigsaw method demonstrates superior overall experience, student engagement, and perceived knowledge acquisition and retention.

Abstract: Background : First aid training in secondary education enhances emergency preparedness and supports public health. Despite its inclusion in many school curricula, there is no consensus on the most effective teaching methodologies. This systematic review aims to compare instructional strategies used in first aid training during Physical Education and evaluate their impact on students' knowledge, practical skills, and confidence. Methods : A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Six databases (SCOPUS, Web of Science, ERIC, DIALNET, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) were searched up to December 2024. Eligible studies were quasi-experimental or observational, involved students aged 11-18, and focused on first aid instruction within Physical Education. Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. Results : Eleven studies with a total of 3069 students aged 11-18 were included. Active and technology-based methodologies outperformed traditional approaches, improving knowledge acquisition (10.2-30.5%) and practical skill development (18.6-42.3%). Long-term retention ranged from 14.2% to 45.8%, with longer interventions yielding better outcomes. Gamification, simulations, and peer learning improved CPR quality and boosted student confidence. However, most studies assessed only short-term outcomes, limiting conclusions about sustained learning. Conclusions : Active methodologies, particularly gamification, simulation, and cooperative learning, enhance knowledge retention, practical skills, and confidence in providing first aid. Although the results were consistently positive, methodological heterogeneity and limited long-term follow-up reduce their generalizability. Further high-quality, longitudinal research is needed to identify the most effective and sustainable strategies. These findings support integrating first aid training into Physical Education as a public health initiative to strengthen emergency preparedness in schools.Background: First aid training in secondary education enhances emergency preparedness and supports public health.

Abstract: Medical residents often struggle with complex clinical scenarios that require sophisticated decision-making skills. While case-based discussion (CBD) is widely used in medical education, its effectiveness can be limited by insufficient guidance and structured support. Scaffolding teaching, which provides graduated assistance aligned with learners' development, may address these limitations. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials evaluating the integration of scaffolding with CBD in residency training remains limited. This study aims to compare an integrated scaffolded case-based learning approach with traditional lecture-based teaching that utilizes the same clinical case materials in enhancing residents' clinical reasoning, self-directed learning, and knowledge acquisition in anesthesiology training. BACKGROUND Medical residents often struggle with complex clinical scenarios that require sophisticated decision-making skills. While case-based discussion (CBD) is widely used in medical education, its effectiveness can be limited by insufficient guidance and structured support. Scaffolding teaching, which provides graduated assistance aligned with learners' development, may address these limitations. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials evaluating the integration of scaffolding with CBD in residency training remains limited. This study aims to compare an integrated scaffolded case-based learning approach with traditional lecture-based teaching that utilizes the same clinical case materials in enhancing residents' clinical reasoning, self-directed learning, and knowledge acquisition in anesthesiology training.This prospective randomized controlled trial encompassed 12 anesthesiology residents, systematically randomized into an experimental cohort (receiving scaffolding teaching integrated with case-based discussion) and a control cohort (receiving traditional lecture-based instruction utilizing the same clinical case). The intervention consisted of a structured 4-week curriculum focusing on HOCM anesthesia management, delivered through weekly instructional sessions. The investigation utilized validated assessment instruments to measure primary outcomes, including clinical reasoning proficiency and self-directed learning capacity, at three time points: baseline, post-intervention (Week 4), and follow-up (Week 8). Secondary outcome measures encompassed teaching satisfaction indices and knowledge retention metrics. Statistical analysis employed t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests for comparative assessment. METHODS This prospective randomized controlled trial encompassed 12 anesthesiology residents, systematically randomized into an experimental cohort (receiving scaffolding teaching integrated with case-based discussion) and a control cohort (receiving traditional lecture-based instruction utilizing the same clinical case). The intervention consisted of a structured 4-week curriculum focusing on HOCM anesthesia management, delivered through weekly instructional sessions. The investigation utilized validated assessment instruments to measure primary outcomes, including clinical reasoning proficiency and self-directed learning capacity, at three time points: baseline, post-intervention (Week 4), and follow-up (Week 8). Secondary outcome measures encompassed teaching satisfaction indices and knowledge retention metrics. Statistical analysis employed t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests for comparative assessment.Post-intervention evaluation at Week 4 revealed statistically significant superiority in the experimental cohort across multiple parameters: clinical reasoning proficiency (83.58 ± 3.28 versus 74.17 ± 4.55, p = 0.002), self-directed learning capacity (79.92 ± 2.56 versus 63.33 ± 3.52, p < 0.001), and teaching satisfaction indices (100.00 ± 0.00 versus 73.00 ± 5.02, p < 0.001). Follow-up assessment at Week 8 demonstrated sustained enhancement in the experimental group, maintaining significant advantages in clinical reasoning proficiency (89.08 ± 5.93 versus 68.17 ± 2.70, p < 0.001), self-directed learning capacity (87.83 ± 2.56 versus 71.58 ± 3.50, p < 0.001), and knowledge retention (98.33 ± 2.58 versus 95.00 ± 0.00, p = 0.010). RESULTS Post-intervention evaluation at Week 4 revealed statistically significant superiority in the experimental cohort across multiple parameters: clinical reasoning proficiency (83.58 ± 3.28 versus 74.17 ± 4.55, p = 0.002), self-directed learning capacity (79.92 ± 2.56 versus 63.33 ± 3.52, p < 0.001), and teaching satisfaction indices (100.00 ± 0.00 versus 73.00 ± 5.02, p < 0.001).

The integrated approach significantly enhances clinical reasoning capabilities, self-directed learning competencies, and knowledge acquisition in complex clinical scenarios compared to the lecture-based approach. These findings establish a robust empirical foundation for the optimization of residency training methodologies, particularly within high-complexity clinical domains such as HOCM anesthesia management. The sustained improvements observed at follow-up further validate the long-term effectiveness of this integrated pedagogical approach.

Abstract: Leadership is essential for nursing to provide high-quality treatment, productive cooperation, and flexible responses to the always-developing healthcare environment. In nursing educational programs, entrepreneurial leadership places a strong emphasis on cultivating qualities that promote creative problem-solving and inventive thinking. These abilities can be employed in clinical settings to enhance patient care, leadership, innovation, and healthcare delivery. Social learning theory describes how these skills are acquired through learning, imitation, observation, and reinforcement.

Abstract: Effective patient education is critical in enhancing treatment outcomes and reducing anxiety in dental procedures. This study compares the effectiveness of AI-generated educational materials with traditional methods in improving patient comprehension and reducing anxiety during endodontic and restorative dental treatments. BACKGROUND Effective patient education is critical in enhancing treatment outcomes and reducing anxiety in dental procedures. This study compares the effectiveness of AI-generated educational materials with traditional methods in improving patient comprehension and reducing anxiety during endodontic and restorative dental treatments.A cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted with 100 participants undergoing restorative or endodontic procedures. Patients were randomized into two groups: those receiving AI-generated instructional materials (via ChatGPT) and those receiving traditional education (verbal explanations and pamphlets). Baseline knowledge and post-intervention knowledge retention were assessed using structured tests. Patient perceptions of clarity, usefulness, comprehensiveness, trust, and anxiety were measured using Likert-scale surveys. Three dental experts evaluated the educational content for accuracy and suitability. Statistical analysis included t-tests and Cohen's kappa to measure inter-rater reliability. METHODS A cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted with 100 participants undergoing restorative or endodontic procedures. Patients were randomized into two groups: those receiving AI-generated instructional materials (via ChatGPT) and those receiving traditional education (verbal explanations and pamphlets).

Patient perceptions of clarity, usefulness, comprehensiveness, trust, and anxiety were measured using Likert-scale surveys. Three dental experts evaluated the educational content for accuracy and suitability. Statistical analysis included t-tests and Cohen's kappa to measure inter-rater reliability.AI-generated materials significantly outperformed traditional methods in all measured dimensions, including clarity (4.42 vs. 3.25), usefulness (4.63 vs. 3.50), comprehensiveness (4.50 vs. 3.29), trust (4.00 vs. 2.96), and anxiety reduction (mean anxiety score: 2.63 vs. 3.38, p < 0.001). Pre- and post-intervention knowledge assessments revealed substantial knowledge improvement in the AI group. Expert evaluations confirmed the accuracy and suitability of AI-generated materials, with high inter-rater reliability (κ = 0.75, p < 0.001). RESULTS AI-generated materials significantly outperformed traditional methods in all measured dimensions, including clarity (4.42 vs. 3.25), usefulness (4.63 vs. 3.50), comprehensiveness (4.50 vs. 3.29), trust (4.00 vs. 2.96), and anxiety reduction (mean anxiety score: 2.63 vs. 3.38, p < 0.001). Pre- and post-intervention knowledge assessments revealed substantial knowledge improvement in the AI group. Expert evaluations confirmed the accuracy and suitability of AI-generated materials, with high inter-rater reliability (κ = 0.75, p < 0.001).AI-generated educational materials demonstrate superior effectiveness in improving patient comprehension and reducing anxiety compared to traditional methods. Their integration into dental practice could enhance patient satisfaction and streamline the educational process, particularly for complex or anxiety-inducing procedures. Future research should explore their application in diverse dental specialties and assess long-term impacts on patient behavior and clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) provides a systematic method for navigating an extensive repository of information and making well-informed judgements regarding patient care. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical knowledge, attitudes and practices related to EBM among medical students and interns in Oman and to identify gaps between general awareness and comprehension. Objectives Evidence-based medicine (EBM) provides a systematic method for navigating an extensive repository of information and making well-informed judgements regarding patient care. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical knowledge, attitudes and practices related to EBM among medical students and interns in Oman and to identify gaps between general awareness and comprehension.This cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2023 to February 2024 at Sultan Qaboos University. An online survey incorporating the Noor Evidence-Based Medicine Questionnaire was used to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and practices related to EBM. Responses were scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2023 to February 2024 at Sultan Qaboos University. An online survey incorporating the Noor Evidence-Based Medicine Questionnaire was used to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and practices related to EBM. Responses were scored using a 5-point Likert scale.A total of 230 medical students and interns completed the survey (response rate = 46%; the optimal sample size was determined to be 218 participants). The participants' mean age was 24.2 ± 1.5 years, with the majority being female (n = 124, 53.9%). Most participants (n = 191, 83%) indicated having previously received EBM training. Overall, participants demonstrated poor levels of EBM-related knowledge (mean percent score: 53.3 ± 5.7%), moderate attitudes (63.5 ± 7.6%) and poor practices (35.3 ± 7.4%). Specifically, 85.7% demonstrated moderate levels of EBM-related knowledge, 71.3% revealed neutral attitudes and 60% reported fair practices. No significant relationships were observed between prior EBM training history and knowledge, attitude or practice scores. However, a significant association was found between the knowledge domain and the level of study ( P = 0.002).

Further studies should investigate specific aspects such as the hours, topics and teaching methodologies used to provide EBM instruction. This will help identify gaps and devise mechanisms to improve knowledge retention.

Abstract: Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of the Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) method in enhancing hospital infection training. Methods A total of 196 infection control staff from clinical departments were selected from a hospital and divided into a control group and an experimental group. The control group received conventional hospital infection control, which training included 10 h of theory lectures and 5 h of practical demonstrations, while the experimental group received three formative assessments using the DOPS method in addition to the conventional training at two-month intervals. The results of the three DOPS assessments in the experimental group were analyzed and compared. The training effectiveness was further evaluated by comparing theory test scores and satisfaction ratings between the two groups. Results Among these 196 study subjects, the majority were over 35 years old, female, doctors or nurses, with middle titles, a bachelor’s degree, and over 10 years of working seniority. The scores of using protective equipment and the handling of emergencies increased over the three DOPS evaluations (3.93 vs. 3.94 vs. 4.15 and 2.37 vs. 2.53 vs. 2.68, respectively). After adjusting for all covariates, the overall theoretical knowledge score in the experimental group was 7.968 times higher than that of the control group. The number of participants in the experimental group who were satisfied with the training was 86 compared to 71 in the control group for knowledge retention, 82 vs. 62 for clinical application, 83 vs. 67 for knowledge extrapolation, 88 vs. 73 for training methods, and 89 vs. 59 for motivation. Conclusion Hospital infection control skills are important for clinical procedural skills. This study found that the application of the DOPS method in infection control training improved trainees’ practical skills, knowledge retention, and ability to implement infection control measures effectively in clinical settings. These results highlight the value of DOPS as a targeted intervention to enhance infection control training outcomes, supporting its further promotion in clinical education programs.

Abstract: Background: Emergency medicine conferences play a pivotal role in advancing clinical knowledge, fostering professional networks, and improving patient outcomes. However, traditional large-scale formats face challenges in ensuring diversity, inclusivity, and participant engagement. This study investigates the effect of different medical conference ence experiences - traditional versus interactive - on the overall experience ratings of 143 healthcare professionals. The research also examines how professional role, experience level, and primary motivation for attendance influence these ratings. Objective: This study aims to assess the impact of alternative conference formats on engagement, inclusivity, and knowledge dissemination, with the goal of informing strategies to design more equitable and impactful emergency medicine conferences. Methods: Data were analyzed using a two-way mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a paired-samples t-test. The findings indicate a statistically significant preference for interactive sessions over traditional ones across the entire sample (M=4.06 vs. M=3.75, p<.001). This preference was particularly strong among participants motivated by networking. Results: However, the study also revealed a nuanced relationship between professional experience and satisfaction, with late-career professionals (20+ years) rating their overall experience significantly lower than their less-experienced counterparts. The consistently high ratings for hands-on workshops across all groups highlight their universal value. These results suggest that tailoring conference content to meet the diverse needs of attendees, especially by incorporating more interactive and applied learning opportunities, can significantly enhance engagement and satisfaction. Conclusion: The results revealed generational differences in satisfaction between "Millennials" and " Generation X" suggesting that future conferences should be tailored to diverse audience needs. Ultimately, the findings provide strong evidence that prioritizing interactive, applied learning can significantly boost engagement and knowledge retention.

Abstract: With the rapid development of the Internet, the information age has arrived in a comprehensive way. The explosive growth of information data has greatly increased people's demand for knowledge management. Knowledge graph, as an effective structured knowledge representation tool, greatly enhances the organization and retrieval capabilities of information. However, in practical applications, knowledge graphs often face problems of knowledge loss and incompleteness, which severely limit their widespread application. To address this issue, this study proposes a neural backward chain inference method based on dynamic knowledge region generation. This method overcomes the bottleneck of performance degradation of traditional static methods on large datasets by introducing a dynamic knowledge region generation mechanism, which significantly improves the completion effect of knowledge graphs. The experiment was conducted on the Unified Medical Language System dataset and the Nations dataset. The results showed that when the size of the Unified Medical Language System dataset reached 2500, the accuracy of the proposed method reached 0.85. It was 6.25%, 20%, and 51.8% higher than the 0.80 of the neural backward chain inference method generated by static knowledge regions, 0.70 of the conditional theorem prover algorithms, and 0.56 of the traditional neural theorems proving algorithm, respectively. In the Nations dataset, the accuracy of the proposed method was 0.80 at the same data scale, which was significantly better than other methods. In addition, the method based on dynamic knowledge region generation reduced the iteration time to 1.4 seconds, which was about 52% and 63% higher than the static method's 2.9 s and the traditional method's 3.8 s, respectively. The research results indicate that the proposed neural backward chain logic algorithm based on dynamic knowledge region generation exhibits good performance in completing knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Research on the educator-learner homophily effect in influencing educator credibility, learner attitudes, knowledge retention, and behavior change remains limited and inconclusive. This study investigated how educator-learner homophily influences small-scale farmers' willingness to adopt agricultural technologies. Using a multi-case study approach, focus groups and key informant interviews were conducted with 60 small-scale farmers in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic who received agricultural training from U.S. volunteers. Farmers' perceptions of learning and educator credibility were analyzed. Guided by the Moscarelli Model (2023), which theorizes that perceived educator credibility comprises subject matter expertise and trustworthiness-moderated by educator-learner homophily-findings revealed an unexpected dynamic. Farmers rated U.S. volunteers as more credible and reliable than local extension agents, despite lower sociodemographic homophily between the farmers and U.S. volunteers. These findings challenge traditional assumptions about the role of homophily in international extension systems. By illuminating how educator-learner homophily influences knowledge transfer and behavior change, this study offers insights for designing more effective extension programs. Volunteer program funders, administrators, and educators can leverage these insights to enhance program outcomes. This research advances the understanding of homophily's role in educator credibility and learner outcomes, calling for a reevaluation of its traditional conceptualization in international education contexts. It supports the conceptualization that homophily may shape the effectiveness of knowledge transfer and behavior change, particularly within programs relying on international volunteers.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) offers potential benefits in assembly training, yet there is a scarcity of research on knowledge retention when utilizing 3D model and animation overlays through Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR). This study investigates the influence of MAR applications, leveraging the signaling principle through 3D animated models, on knowledge gain and retention in a complex Internet of Things (IoT) assembly task. In this regard, this study developed a MAR framework and application to facilitate IoT assembly training. A comparative study was conducted with 40 participants, equally distributed between the MAR and paper manual groups based on prior knowledge and AR familiarity. The evaluation consisted of three phases: a pre‐test, an immediate post‐test, and a delayed post‐test. Data collection involved knowledge tests, task completion time, error rates, usability and subjective feedback. Results showed significant knowledge gain in both groups, with the MAR group achieving a 21% increase and the paper group 15%. In terms of knowledge retention, both approaches were equally effective in helping users retain knowledge and improve task completion performance by reducing task completion time. Notably, the MAR group (0.5 error rate) made fewer errors than the paper group (1.35 error rate). Additionally, MAR demonstrated higher effectiveness based on Perceived Usefulness, Ease of Use, and the NASA Task Load Index. These findings suggest that while both methods support knowledge retention, MAR with better accuracy and usability, making it a valuable tool for IoT assembly training.

Abstract: Background Patients often struggle to select a breast reconstruction option that aligns with their personal values. Decision aids have become popular tools to assist patients in navigating these choices. This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of available breast reconstruction decision aids. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search across five databases from inception to December 2022, identifying studies related to the development, validation, or implementation of decision aids in breast reconstruction. Results Out of 4621 reports, 24 studies met inclusion criteria, covering 14 unique decision aids. These included 13 randomized controlled trials, 9 qualitative studies, and 2 case series. Nine studies reported reduced decisional conflict and 2 studies showed decreased decisional regret. Additionally, 13 studies found improved satisfaction with the information provided, and all seven studies that measured knowledge retention showed improvements. However, none of the studies found a reduction in anxiety or depression following the use of decision aids. Conclusions Decision aids are effective in reducing decisional conflict, enhancing patient satisfaction, and improving knowledge retention in breast reconstruction. Future research should focus on integrating these tools into clinical practice.

Abstract: Traditional didactic teaching methods in medical education, while foundational, often lead to passive learning and insufficient engagement. “Pancreata—The Keto Struggle,” an educational tale‐based game for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), was developed to address these challenges by promoting collaborative learning, enhancing student engagement, and improving knowledge retention through an interactive and narrative‐driven approach. This study involved 150 first‐year medical students divided into 25 small groups of 6 each. Participants were assessed before and after engaging with the game through a structured formative assessment, a validated questionnaire measuring engagement and learning effectiveness, and a confidence level questionnaire. In‐depth small‐group interviews were also conducted for qualitative feedback and thematic analysis was performed. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 17. The introduction of “Pancreata—The Keto Struggle” resulted in significant improvements in students' formative assessment scores, from a mean of 19.2 ± 1.9 before the game to 39.3 ± 2.2 out of 50 after the game ( p  < 0.0001). Notably, students demonstrated the highest confidence gains in managing DKA and interpreting laboratory results. Qualitative analysis identified seven common themes reflecting the game's impact on learning: collaboration, retention of concepts, internal drive, self and peer assessment, joyful learning, beyond books, and aesthetic content. Over 95% of students reported increased engagement and learning effectiveness due to the game's intrinsic motivation, narrative, and group learning mechanics. “Pancreata—The Keto Struggle” effectively revitalizes collaborative learning in medical education by integrating game‐based learning with traditional teaching methods. The game not only facilitates a deeper understanding of complex clinical conditions like DKA but also broadly improves students' clinical management skills and confidence. These findings underscore the potential of educational tale based games to enrich medical education and advocate for their broader application across curricula.

Abstract: The development of information and communication technologies has created limitless prospects for using augmented reality (AR) in various fields. Unfortunately, the multitasking nature of AR systems prevents learners from successfully reflecting and retaining knowledge. This study developed and designed a learning analytics dashboard (LAD) with three components: personal learning data, social comparison, and visualization of the learning process, to promote knowledge acquisition and metacognitive awareness among AR learners. A total of 31 intermediate-level Japanese learners participated in an experiment involving pre-tests, post-tests, and a delayed test to assess the LAD. Learners engaged with the AR learning system for Japanese compound verb learning and utilized the LAD to monitor and reflect on their AR learning activities. Behavioral data were analyzed using Lag Sequential Analysis (LSA), while learning performance was evaluated through one-way repeated-measures ANOVA tests. The findings indicate that the use of the LAD significantly improves learning outcomes and metacognitive processes, such as knowledge of cognition and regulation of cognition. Additionally, there were different usage patterns of the dashboard among learners, which corresponded to significant differences in their learning outcomes and changes in metacognitive awareness. Learners who primarily focused on the learning process and social comparison components of the dashboard demonstrated improved knowledge retention. Conversely, those who mainly concentrated on personal learning data experienced the most significant gains in metacognitive awareness. This study also provides crucial design insights on the integration of dashboard components with cognitive efforts to maximize learning outcomes. Alternate abstract: Plain language summary Improving Language Learning Through a Dashboard: A Study on Japanese Learners Using Augmented Reality This study examined the effectiveness of a learning analytics dashboard (LAD) with three components (personal learning data, social comparison, and visualization of the learning process) in promoting the knowledge acquisition and metacognitive awareness of 31 non-native learners of Japanese in learning Japanese compound verbs. The results indicated that the use of LAD significantly improves learning outcomes and metacognitive processes, such as knowledge of cognition and regulation of cognition, and second, that students who concentrated on the learning process and social comparison showed the most improved performance in knowledge retention, while those who concentrated on personal learning data showed greater improvements in metacognitive awareness. This study contributes significantly to the field of LA by providing evidence that the integration of LAD into AR learning environments can meet the multifaceted challenges posed by concurrent multitasking, thus facilitating a more monitored and reflective learning experience. The research also highlights the benefits of combining dashboard components with cognitive efforts to ensure that metacognitive awareness is effectively harnessed to improve learning.

However, direct comparisons of these strategies within physiology education remain limited, particularly in the Indian context. BACKGROUND  Active learning strategies have become increasingly prominent in medical education. Among them, self-directed learning (SDL) and the Jigsaw method aim to enhance student engagement and improve knowledge retention. However, direct comparisons of these strategies within physiology education remain limited, particularly in the Indian context. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of SDL and the Jigsaw method on selected physiology topics among first-year Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) students. OBJECTIVES  This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of SDL and the Jigsaw method on selected physiology topics among first-year Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) students. We conducted a quasi-experimental crossover study at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Raebareli, India, between February and March 2025. First-year MBBS students participated in both SDL and Jigsaw sessions covering two different topics. In Phase 1, students from Batch A engaged in SDL, while Batch B employed the Jigsaw method to learn about ascending tracts. In Phase 2, the methods were reversed: Batch A used the Jigsaw approach, and Batch B engaged in SDL to study sleep physiology. Each session lasted 150 minutes. Knowledge gain was assessed using presession and postsession multiple-choice question (MCQ) tests. Students' perceptions regarding their learning experience, engagement, autonomy, and knowledge retention were measured using a validated 5-point Likert scale questionnaire. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for statistical analysis, with a p value of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Both SDL and Jigsaw sessions significantly improved posttest MCQ scores compared to pretest scores. The two methods showed no significant difference in the overall pretest and posttest scores. However, students rated the Jigsaw method higher than SDL for overall experience (median 4.5 vs. 3.5; p < 0.001), engagement (4.7 vs. 4; p < 0.001), and knowledge retention (4.3 vs. 4; p < 0.001). Autonomy scores did not differ significantly (4.5 vs. 4.5; p = 0.16). A majority (69.3%) preferred the Jigsaw approach over SDL. RESULTS  A total of 88 students underwent crossover.

Abstract: Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship (LIC) curricula have gained popularity among medical schools due to their demonstrated benefits in fostering improved relationships among patients, students, and faculty compared to traditional block schedules. The University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine (SSOM) adopted a comprehensive LIC curriculum for all campuses in 2014. SSOM encompasses four campuses distributed across the state. Faculty sufficiency has presented a persistent challenge, complicating student scheduling. Additionally, dissatisfaction among faculty regarding patient continuity has emerged as a key concern. To address this, inpatient clinical experiences were incorporated into the LIC curriculum in 2023. PURPOSE Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship (LIC) curricula have gained popularity among medical schools due to their demonstrated benefits in fostering improved relationships among patients, students, and faculty compared to traditional block schedules. The University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine (SSOM) adopted a comprehensive LIC curriculum for all campuses in 2014. SSOM encompasses four campuses distributed across the state. Faculty sufficiency has presented a persistent challenge, complicating student scheduling. Additionally, dissatisfaction among faculty regarding patient continuity has emerged as a key concern. To address this, inpatient clinical experiences were incorporated into the LIC curriculum in 2023.A pre- and post-implementation mixed-methods analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of inpatient clinical experiences on faculty satisfaction. Participants included teaching faculty who completed anonymous online surveys evaluating their satisfaction with the LIC schedule and patient continuity. The first survey was conducted in December 2022 for faculty enrolled in the 2022-23 LIC cohort prior to the implementation of inpatient clinical experiences (ICE). Subsequent surveys were conducted in 2023 and 2024 after implementation of ICE. METHODS A pre- and post-implementation mixed-methods analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of inpatient clinical experiences on faculty satisfaction. Participants included teaching faculty who completed anonymous online surveys evaluating their satisfaction with the LIC schedule and patient continuity. The first survey was conducted in December 2022 for faculty enrolled in the 2022-23 LIC cohort prior to the implementation of inpatient clinical experiences (ICE). Subsequent surveys were conducted in 2023 and 2024 after implementation of ICE.In 2022, 79% of faculty expressed satisfaction with the traditional LIC schedule, yet 30% of faculty (N=92) reported dissatisfaction with patient continuity. Since the implementation of ICE weeks into the LIC, the 2024 faculty reported 73% (N=60) prefer the new hybrid model and 15% (N=12) prefer the traditional LIC. The hybrid model demonstrated a 29% (N=26) dissatisfaction rating for teaching continuity. However, 56% (N=48) of faculty reported satisfaction with student learning outcomes. Further qualitative and quantitative results from this survey will be shared regarding faculty satisfaction with student knowledge retention and teaching workload distribution. RESULTS In 2022, 79% of faculty expressed satisfaction with the traditional LIC schedule, yet 30% of faculty (N=92) reported dissatisfaction with patient continuity.

Abstract: Aim: To explore how Danish registered nurses (RNs) in hospitals experience documenting nursing care in electronic patient records when the content is accessible to patients. Methods: In a qualitative research design, data were generated in six focus groups conducted in late 2022 and early 2023, comprising 31 RNs employed in inpatient wards at a university hospital in Denmark. Subsequently, qualitative content analysis was applied to the gathered data. Results: The findings include three themes: (1) weighing one's words, (2) building trust or triggering conflicts and (3) risking loss of knowledge. Together, these three themes illustrate the complexities that RNs navigate when patients have access to the content of nursing documentation. Conclusion: Patients' access to nursing documentation requires RNs to navigate a complex interplay of factors, including awareness of language‐use, influence on the nurse–patient–relative relationships, and the risk of losing essential knowledge. Therefore, although patients' access to nursing documentation can induce a positive change in terms of strengthening the professional focus on documentation, it can also result in changes in documentation practices in ways that may compromise nursing documentation as a working tool. Implications for the Profession and Patient Care: The findings emphasize an urgent need to explore and discuss how sensitive nursing observations can be shared in a safe and appropriate way when patients have access to the documentation. Furthermore, to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts with patients, it is essential to focus on and prioritize patient involvement in nursing documentation. Impact: RNs navigate complex practices when patients have direct online access to nursing documentation content. It is crucial to clarify which content nursing documentation should entail and how sensitive nursing observations can be shared in a safe and appropriate way. Reporting: The COREQ checklist was used for reporting. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/strategies-attract-users-networked-collaborative/docview/3206287215/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: The rise of multi-sided platforms, such as the Networked Collaborative Manufacturing Platform (NCMP), has enhanced connectivity and collaboration among stakeholders in the complex heavy equipment industry. However, the platform faces the challenge of deciding whether to provide high-quality or low-quality services to meet diverse user needs. Designers and manufacturers must weigh the positive impacts, such as synergy benefit, against negative factors like service fee, potential loss, and knowledge loss when deciding whether to join the platform. This study investigates the strategies of the platform, designers, and manufacturers by constructing a tripartite evolutionary game model. It proposes user acquisition strategies for platforms offering varying services quality levels. The findings indicate that: (1) setting appropriate service fees or commission is essential for achieving optimal cooperation between the platform and users; (2) when offering high-quality services, the platform should prioritize attracting manufacturers by enhancing synergy benefits, adjusting the distribution of these benefits, or increasing potential loss; (3) for low-quality services, users are less motivated to join, so the platform should focus on attracting designers who have lower requirements for synergy benefits or potential loss compared manufacturers; and (4) government subsidy can encourage platforms to offer high-quality services but may cause a "crowding-effect" and "deviation effect". However, if the platform effectively balances costs, pricing, and benefits for users, or it reaches maturity, government subsidy may become unnecessary.

Abstract: Recognition of delirium continues to be a challenge in acute care despite the use of validated and reliable tools. This evidence-based quality improvement project aimed to increase delirium recognition by increasing daily screening using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) tool. Methods to increase usage and accuracy of the assessment included targeted education by specially trained geriatric nurse champions (GNCs). During rounds, GNCs performed bedside assessment, provided real-time feedback, and focused on non-pharmacological interventions on medical-surgical and telemetry units. All patients 65 years of age and older were included. Daily screening of CAM assessment increased by 7.6 % over three months, including an increase in CAM positive results from 7.1 % to 8.5 %-additional favorable outcomes observed with an increase in delirium diagnosis. This project increased knowledge retention and reinforcement of non-pharmacological interventions through peer coaching and focused rounds. Continued training efforts and education are needed to increase identification of patients experiencing delirium.Recognition of delirium continues to be a challenge in acute care despite the use of validated and reliable tools.

Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the state of the literature on knowledge sharing in open source software (OSS) development communities by examining the existing research and identifying the knowledge gaps and opportunities that can inform areas for future research. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was conducted of literature published between January 2011 and February 2023. A total of 24 papers were identified and reviewed. Findings The findings reveal that the literature on knowledge sharing in OSS development communities from developing countries are limited. Additionally, there exists a limited focus on the development of frameworks to support knowledge sharing in OSS communities. The transient nature of OSS development contributors’ results in knowledge loss; thus, knowledge retention needs further investigation. Research limitations/implications This study only included papers whose titles, keywords or abstracts included the search keywords “knowledge sharing” and “Open Source Software”. While the keywords were carefully applied, when applying the search, it cannot be ruled that some relevant studies might have been missed. The study was also limited to conferences and journal papers published in English. Despite the limitations, the study provides a systematic review of knowledge sharing in OSS communities and presents findings that can be useful to researchers and practitioners interested in this area. Originality/value The study provides a systematic literature review of published papers and identifies themes and future research areas on knowledge sharing in OSS communities. Additionally, this review offers insights into future research avenues for theory, content and context on knowledge sharing in OSS development communities.

Abstract: Palestinian higher education institutions face limitations in providing interactive practical training for medical education. Extended reality (XR), which encompasses virtual reality and augmented reality, is increasingly recognized for addressing these challenges by offering immersive learning experiences. BACKGROUND Palestinian higher education institutions face limitations in providing interactive practical training for medical education. Extended reality (XR), which encompasses virtual reality and augmented reality, is increasingly recognized for addressing these challenges by offering immersive learning experiences.This study investigates the factors influencing the acceptance and adoption of XR in health care education within Palestinian universities, exploring its potential to transform traditional teaching methods. OBJECTIVE This study investigates the factors influencing the acceptance and adoption of XR in health care education within Palestinian universities, exploring its potential to transform traditional teaching methods.A qualitative approach was used in this study to collect data through semistructured interviews and artifacts from the participants. The participants of the study were 25 faculty members from 2 large Palestinian universities who teach in the field of medical sciences. METHODS A qualitative approach was used in this study to collect data through semistructured interviews and artifacts from the participants. The participants of the study were 25 faculty members from 2 large Palestinian universities who teach in the field of medical sciences.Three primary categories-external, internal, and design-related factors-emerged as pivotal in influencing XR adoption. Professional development, technical support, and infrastructure were key external enablers. Internally, prior experience with digital tools and positive attitudes had a significant impact on the adoption of XR. Design factors, including ease of use and interactivity, played a crucial role but also posed challenges for less tech-savvy educators. Despite barriers such as cost and technical issues, XR demonstrated notable benefits, including enhanced learning outcomes, improved knowledge retention, and the ability to simulate complex medical scenarios. RESULTS Three primary categories-external, internal, and design-related factors-emerged as pivotal in influencing XR adoption. Professional development, technical support, and infrastructure were key external enablers. Internally, prior experience with digital tools and positive attitudes had a significant impact on the adoption of XR. Design factors, including ease of use and interactivity, played a crucial role but also posed challenges for less tech-savvy educators. Despite barriers such as cost and technical issues, XR demonstrated notable benefits, including enhanced learning outcomes, improved knowledge retention, and the ability to simulate complex medical scenarios.XR technologies offer transformative potential for health care education in Palestine. By addressing challenges and leveraging XR's strengths, educational institutions can foster innovation and improve student engagement and skill acquisition. The study contributes to the theoretical understanding of technology acceptance in education by identifying the interplay of external, internal, and design factors. Practically, it emphasizes strategic investments in infrastructure, professional training, and institutional policies to optimize XR integration.

Abstract: Purpose Lack of knowledge contributes to disparate outcomes among Americans with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study assessed the impact of an educational intervention on disease knowledge and management in Black Americans with asthma or COPD. Design Pre-post study design with 9-month follow-up. Setting Urban church community. Subjects Black American adults (N = 38) with self-reported asthma (18) and COPD (20), of which 76.3% (N = 29) completed the intervention. Intervention The Asthma COPD (ACOPD) Workshop consisted of three 1-hour classes focused on disease knowledge and management behaviors (physical activity, nutrition, and avoiding triggers) delivered in 16 sessions over six months. Measures Knowledge questionnaire. Analysis McNemar’s tests for paired proportions. Results Knowledge of disease concepts increased post-intervention, then decreased at the 9-month follow-up. There was a significant difference in the proportion of participants that provided correct answers to questions about ‘two diseases that constitute COPD’ ( P = .04), ‘main cause of COPD’ ( P = .01), 'written action plan' ( P = .04), and 'untrue statement about asthma,' ( P = .02). Conclusion The ACOPD Workshop increased knowledge of basic disease concepts, risk factors, and management. Regular delivery of educational sessions in the community can support knowledge retention and practice of healthy behaviors.

Abstract: Background : Gatekeeper training (GKT) programs improve knowledge and self-efficacy in suicide prevention, but the sustainability of these improvements is uncertain. While booster sessions are suggested to enhance retention, existing research is inconclusive. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of booster sessions in the LifeKeepers GKT program for maintaining long-term knowledge and self-efficacy at 6 months post-training. Method: A total of 1,732 participants who had completed LifeKeepers GKT were randomly assigned to one of three trial groups, an intervention (booster), control (training as usual), or attention control group. Participants completed measures of knowledge and self-efficacy at 3, 6, and 12 months and reported their frequency of interventions and referrals at 3 and 6 months. Results: No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of knowledge retention, self-efficacy, or behavior change at any follow-up point. However, sustained improvements were observed across all groups. Limitations : Ceiling effects and attrition may have influenced the findings. Conclusion: Booster sessions did not significantly enhance knowledge, self-efficacy, or behavior outcomes. All groups demonstrated sustained improvements, but ceiling effects and attrition caution against overinterpreting the findings. Further research is needed to explore effective strategies for long-term retention.

Abstract: Aim To explore how Danish registered nurses (RNs) in hospitals experience documenting nursing care in electronic patient records when the content is accessible to patients. Methods In a qualitative research design, data were generated in six focus groups conducted in late 2022 and early 2023, comprising 31 RNs employed in inpatient wards at a university hospital in Denmark. Subsequently, qualitative content analysis was applied to the gathered data. Results The findings include three themes: (1) weighing one's words, (2) building trust or triggering conflicts and (3) risking loss of knowledge. Together, these three themes illustrate the complexities that RNs navigate when patients have access to the content of nursing documentation. Conclusion Patients' access to nursing documentation requires RNs to navigate a complex interplay of factors, including awareness of language‐use, influence on the nurse–patient–relative relationships, and the risk of losing essential knowledge. Therefore, although patients' access to nursing documentation can induce a positive change in terms of strengthening the professional focus on documentation, it can also result in changes in documentation practices in ways that may compromise nursing documentation as a working tool. Implications for the Profession and Patient Care The findings emphasize an urgent need to explore and discuss how sensitive nursing observations can be shared in a safe and appropriate way when patients have access to the documentation. Furthermore, to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts with patients, it is essential to focus on and prioritize patient involvement in nursing documentation. Impact RNs navigate complex practices when patients have direct online access to nursing documentation content. It is crucial to clarify which content nursing documentation should entail and how sensitive nursing observations can be shared in a safe and appropriate way. Reporting The COREQ checklist was used for reporting.

Abstract: Class Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) aims at segmenting the incremental new classes without losing the ability on old classes. Currently, some CISS methods based on feature knowledge distillation suffer from the stability-plasticity dilemma, i.e. , excessive knowledge distillation may impede models from learning new classes. Besides, distilling without emphasis fails to preserve old knowledge effectively. To address these issues, a more fine-grained and focused approach to knowledge transfer, named dual attention-guided distillation (DAGD), is proposed for the CISS task. This approach not only ensures that the inherited knowledge is distilled in a targeted manner but also allows the model to adapt and learn new knowledge more efficiently. DAGD model contains a channel attention-guided distillation module and a spatial attention-guided distillation module. The former distills channel-wise attention maps to improve the knowledge transfer of essential channels while accommodating new knowledge learning. The latter encodes a weight coefficient map to highlight important regions in the spatial dimension, which further decouples old knowledge retention and new knowledge entry. Furthermore, a dynamic temperature strategy is introduced to facilitate logit knowledge distillation, specifically sharpening the predictive distribution produced by the output of the old model, thus achieving more accurate knowledge transfer. Extensive experimental results on Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results.

Abstract: AI education is essential to facilitate seamless clinical integration. The HCPC in the UK requires all radiographers to have some level of digital skills to maintain safety of clinical practice. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a dedicated AI seminar on radiography students. INTRODUCTION AI education is essential to facilitate seamless clinical integration. The HCPC in the UK requires all radiographers to have some level of digital skills to maintain safety of clinical practice. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a dedicated AI seminar on radiography students.A dedicated 1.5-h in-person seminar was delivered by an AI vendor to final year undergraduate diagnostic radiography students at a UK University. The course consisted of both theory and practice training. An online survey was built and piloted, consisting of both closed and open-ended questions, to explore their level of knowledge, skills and confidence in AI, before (pre-test) and after the delivery (post-test) of the seminar using a 10-point scale. Pre-test was distributed two weeks before the seminar and post-test was open two weeks after. METHODS A dedicated 1.5-h in-person seminar was delivered by an AI vendor to final year undergraduate diagnostic radiography students at a UK University. The course consisted of both theory and practice training. An online survey was built and piloted, consisting of both closed and open-ended questions, to explore their level of knowledge, skills and confidence in AI, before (pre-test) and after the delivery (post-test) of the seminar using a 10-point scale. Pre-test was distributed two weeks before the seminar and post-test was open two weeks after.A total of 68 students answered the pre-test and 31 the post-test survey. Students' theoretical knowledge (Mean = 6.57 vs Mean = 3.85), skills (Mean = 5.39 vs Mean = 3.44) and confidence (Mean = 5.47 vs Mean = 3.43) on AI were all significantly improved after the seminar. Their responses became more focused and specific in the post-test survey. In both surveys students expressed concerns around reliability and accountability of AI, data management and security, patient confidentiality and overreliance on technology in the open-ended questions. They also requested more AI training with hands-on options in their undergraduate degree. RESULTS A total of 68 students answered the pre-test and 31 the post-test survey.

The learning needs to be customised to maximise knowledge retention and applicability and to include both theoretical and practical aspects for consolidation of skills. CONCLUSION This study confirms the importance of even brief, but customised educational interventions relating to AI for radiographers. The learning needs to be customised to maximise knowledge retention and applicability and to include both theoretical and practical aspects for consolidation of skills.These findings will help radiography educators build more focused, tailored AI courses for future students. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE These findings will help radiography educators build more focused, tailored AI courses for future students.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of foundation models has significantly transformed machine learning, enabling even straightforward architectures to achieve results comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Inspired by the brain’s natural learning process-where studying a new concept activates distinct neural pathways and recalling that memory requires a specific stimulus to fully recover the information-we present a novel approach to dynamic task identification and submodel selection in continual learning. Our method leverages the power of the learning robust visual features without supervision model (DINOv2) foundation model to handle multi-experience datasets by dividing them into multiple experiences, each representing a subset of classes. To build a memory of these classes, we employ strategies such as using random real images, distilled images, k-nearest neighbours (kNN) to identify the closest samples to each cluster, and support vector machines (SVM) to select the most representative samples. During testing, where the task identification (ID) is not provided, we extract features of the test image and use distance measurements to match it with the stored features. Additionally, we introduce a new forgetting metric specifically designed to measure the forgetting rate in task-agnostic continual learning scenarios, unlike traditional task-specific approaches. This metric captures the extent of knowledge loss across tasks where the task identity is unknown during inference. Despite its simple architecture, our method delivers competitive performance across various datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art results in certain instances.

Abstract: This study aimed to assess the potential of ImmeRgaMe, an innovative 360° immersive serious game, to enhance motivation and engagement in MRI education for first-year radiographer students. INTRODUCTION This study aimed to assess the potential of ImmeRgaMe, an innovative 360° immersive serious game, to enhance motivation and engagement in MRI education for first-year radiographer students.The platform was developed as part of an educational innovation initiative and designed to complement traditional teaching methods. It integrates storytelling, progression mechanisms, and interactive tools to teach MRI safety protocols, physical principles, and clinical methods. Beta testing involved 42 participants (students and educators) who completed standardized surveys to evaluate gameplay, usability, and learning outcomes. The impact of microlearning videos embedded in the game was also assessed through pre- and post-test quizzes with 63 first-year students.

Abstract: Traditional didactic teaching methods in medical education, while foundational, often lead to passive learning and insufficient engagement. "Pancreata-The Keto Struggle," an educational tale-based game for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), was developed to address these challenges by promoting collaborative learning, enhancing student engagement, and improving knowledge retention through an interactive and narrative-driven approach. This study involved 150 first-year medical students divided into 25 small groups of 6 each. Participants were assessed before and after engaging with the game through a structured formative assessment, a validated questionnaire measuring engagement and learning effectiveness, and a confidence level questionnaire. In-depth small-group interviews were also conducted for qualitative feedback and thematic analysis was performed. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 17. The introduction of "Pancreata-The Keto Struggle" resulted in significant improvements in students' formative assessment scores, from a mean of 19.2 ± 1.9 before the game to 39.3 ± 2.2 out of 50 after the game (p < 0.0001). Notably, students demonstrated the highest confidence gains in managing DKA and interpreting laboratory results. Qualitative analysis identified seven common themes reflecting the game's impact on learning: collaboration, retention of concepts, internal drive, self and peer assessment, joyful learning, beyond books, and aesthetic content. Over 95% of students reported increased engagement and learning effectiveness due to the game's intrinsic motivation, narrative, and group learning mechanics. "Pancreata-The Keto Struggle" effectively revitalizes collaborative learning in medical education by integrating game-based learning with traditional teaching methods. The game not only facilitates a deeper understanding of complex clinical conditions like DKA but also broadly improves students' clinical management skills and confidence. These findings underscore the potential of educational tale based games to enrich medical education and advocate for their broader application across curricula.Traditional didactic teaching methods in medical education, while foundational, often lead to passive learning and insufficient engagement.

Abstract: Patients often struggle to select a breast reconstruction option that aligns with their personal values. Decision aids have become popular tools to assist patients in navigating these choices. This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of available breast reconstruction decision aids. BACKGROUND Patients often struggle to select a breast reconstruction option that aligns with their personal values. Decision aids have become popular tools to assist patients in navigating these choices. This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of available breast reconstruction decision aids.We conducted a comprehensive search across five databases from inception to December 2022, identifying studies related to the development, validation, or implementation of decision aids in breast reconstruction. METHODS We conducted a comprehensive search across five databases from inception to December 2022, identifying studies related to the development, validation, or implementation of decision aids in breast reconstruction.Out of 4621 reports, 24 studies met inclusion criteria, covering 14 unique decision aids. These included 13 randomized controlled trials, 9 qualitative studies, and 2 case series. Nine studies reported reduced decisional conflict and 2 studies showed decreased decisional regret. Additionally, 13 studies found improved satisfaction with the information provided, and all seven studies that measured knowledge retention showed improvements. However, none of the studies found a reduction in anxiety or depression following the use of decision aids.

Abstract: PurposeLack of knowledge contributes to disparate outcomes among Americans with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study assessed the impact of an educational intervention on disease knowledge and management in Black Americans with asthma or COPD.DesignPre-post study design with 9-month follow-up.SettingUrban church community.SubjectsBlack American adults (N = 38) with self-reported asthma (18) and COPD (20), of which 76.3% (N = 29) completed the intervention.InterventionThe Asthma COPD (ACOPD) Workshop consisted of three 1-hour classes focused on disease knowledge and management behaviors (physical activity, nutrition, and avoiding triggers) delivered in 16 sessions over six months.MeasuresKnowledge questionnaire.AnalysisMcNemar's tests for paired proportions.ResultsKnowledge of disease concepts increased post-intervention, then decreased at the 9-month follow-up. There was a significant difference in the proportion of participants that provided correct answers to questions about 'two diseases that constitute COPD' ( P = .04), 'main cause of COPD' ( P = .01), 'written action plan' ( P = .04), and 'untrue statement about asthma,' ( P = .02).ConclusionThe ACOPD Workshop increased knowledge of basic disease concepts, risk factors, and management. Regular delivery of educational sessions in the community can support knowledge retention and practice of healthy behaviors.PurposeLack of knowledge contributes to disparate outcomes among Americans with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Abstract: To explore how Danish registered nurses (RNs) in hospitals experience documenting nursing care in electronic patient records when the content is accessible to patients. AIM To explore how Danish registered nurses (RNs) in hospitals experience documenting nursing care in electronic patient records when the content is accessible to patients.In a qualitative research design, data were generated in six focus groups conducted in late 2022 and early 2023, comprising 31 RNs employed in inpatient wards at a university hospital in Denmark. Subsequently, qualitative content analysis was applied to the gathered data. METHODS In a qualitative research design, data were generated in six focus groups conducted in late 2022 and early 2023, comprising 31 RNs employed in inpatient wards at a university hospital in Denmark. Subsequently, qualitative content analysis was applied to the gathered data.The findings include three themes: (1) weighing one's words, (2) building trust or triggering conflicts and (3) risking loss of knowledge. Together, these three themes illustrate the complexities that RNs navigate when patients have access to the content of nursing documentation. RESULTS The findings include three themes: (1) weighing one's words, (2) building trust or triggering conflicts and (3) risking loss of knowledge. Together, these three themes illustrate the complexities that RNs navigate when patients have access to the content of nursing documentation.Patients' access to nursing documentation requires RNs to navigate a complex interplay of factors, including awareness of language-use, influence on the nurse-patient-relative relationships, and the risk of losing essential knowledge. Therefore, although patients' access to nursing documentation can induce a positive change in terms of strengthening the professional focus on documentation, it can also result in changes in documentation practices in ways that may compromise nursing documentation as a working tool. CONCLUSION Patients' access to nursing documentation requires RNs to navigate a complex interplay of factors, including awareness of language-use, influence on the nurse-patient-relative relationships, and the risk of losing essential knowledge. Therefore, although patients' access to nursing documentation can induce a positive change in terms of strengthening the professional focus on documentation, it can also result in changes in documentation practices in ways that may compromise nursing documentation as a working tool.The findings emphasize an urgent need to explore and discuss how sensitive nursing observations can be shared in a safe and appropriate way when patients have access to the documentation. Furthermore, to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts with patients, it is essential to focus on and prioritize patient involvement in nursing documentation. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND PATIENT CARE The findings emphasize an urgent need to explore and discuss how sensitive nursing observations can be shared in a safe and appropriate way when patients have access to the documentation. Furthermore, to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts with patients, it is essential to focus on and prioritize patient involvement in nursing documentation.RNs navigate complex practices when patients have direct online access to nursing documentation content. It is crucial to clarify which content nursing documentation should entail and how sensitive nursing observations can be shared in a safe and appropriate way.

Abstract: Multi-instance learning (MIL) is a widely applied technique in practical applications that involve complex data structures. MIL can be broadly categorized into two types: traditional methods and those based on deep learning. These approaches have yielded significant results, especially regarding their problem-solving strategies and experiment validation, providing valuable insights for researchers in the MIL field. However, considerable knowledge is often trapped within the algorithm, leading to subsequent MIL algorithms that rely solely on the model's data fitting to predict unlabeled samples. This results in a significant loss of knowledge and impedes the development of more powerful models. In this article, we propose a novel data-driven knowledge fusion for deep MIL (DKMIL) algorithm. DKMIL adopts a completely different idea from existing deep MIL methods by analyzing the decision-making of key samples in the dataset (referred to as the data-driven) and using the knowledge fusion module designed to extract valuable information from these samples to assist the model's learning. In other words, this module serves as a new interface between data and the model, providing strong scalability and enabling prior knowledge from existing algorithms to enhance the model's learning ability. Furthermore, to adapt the downstream modules of the model to more knowledge-enriched features extracted from the data-driven knowledge fusion (DDKF) module, we propose a two-level attention (TLA) module that gradually learns shallow- and deep-level features of the samples to achieve more effective classification. We will prove the scalability of the knowledge fusion module and verify the efficiency of the proposed architecture by conducting experiments on 62 datasets across five categories.Multi-instance learning (MIL) is a widely applied technique in practical applications that involve complex data structures.

Abstract: Task-incremental learning methods that adopt knowledge distillation face two significant challenges: confidence bias and knowledge loss. These challenges make it difficult to effectively balance the stability and plasticity of the network in the incremental learning process. In this article, we propose double confidence calibration focused distillation (DCCFD) to address these challenges. We introduce intratask and intertask confidence calibration (ECC) modules that can mitigate network overconfidence during incremental learning and reduce the degree of feature representation bias. We also propose a focused distillation (FD) module that can alleviate the problem of knowledge loss during the task increment process, improving model stability without reducing plasticity. Experimental results on the CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and CORE-50 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, with performance that matches or exceeds the state of the art. Furthermore, our method can be used as a plug-and-play module to consistently improve class-incremental learning methods.Task-incremental learning methods that adopt knowledge distillation face two significant challenges: confidence bias and knowledge loss.

Abstract: Background/Objectives : Involving patients in the preoperative anaesthetic assessment (PAA) process can improve their understanding of risks and contribute to better postoperative recovery and outcomes. The iPREDICT study aims to investigate the feasibility of using an interactive consultation tool (ICT) to improve patient awareness of anaesthesia-related risks. Methods : This prospective, single-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical study included patients scheduled for elective surgery under general or combined general and regional anaesthesia. Participants were randomly assigned to online anaesthesia risk education in the ICT group (intervention) or a control group that watched a video without anaesthetic risk content. Both groups received a face-to-face PAA and were assessed about anaesthetic risk knowledge after PAA and two days later. Results : A total of 373 participants were randomised, and 315 completed the assigned online module prior to their PAA. The proportion of male participants was higher (>60%). Most participants already had prior anaesthesia experience. After PAA, 243 patients completed the first risk recall #1 questionnaire, with the ICT group identifying significantly more correct risks than the control group (median 13.0 vs. 11.0, p 60%). Most participants already had prior anaesthesia experience. After PAA, 243 patients completed the first risk recall #1 questionnaire, with the ICT group identifying significantly more correct risks than the control group (median 13.0 vs. 11.0, p < 0.05). In risk recall #2, conducted two days after the PAA, knowledge retention remained stable in the control group, while the experimental group showed further improvement (median 14.0 vs. 13.0, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Using the ICT significantly improved patients' knowledge of anaesthesia-related risks. These results suggest that interactive patient education tools are a feasible and effective way to improve patients' understanding of perioperative anaesthesia risks, potentially contributing to better outcomes, which needs to be addressed in future projects.

Abstract: ABSTRACT Background and Objectives: This study investigates the effectiveness of animation compared to traditional lecture methods on student performance, cognitive outcomes, and knowledge retention among Applied Medical Sciences University students. Methods: In this cross-sectional comparative study, a total of 110 students from the College of Applied Medical Sciences (CAMS), Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University participated in the study conducted between 1st April to 30th June 2024. Participants were divided into two groups: one receiving traditional lecture-based instruction and the other receiving animated instructional content. Quizzes were structured into two components to evaluate knowledge retention and cognitive skills. The study further analyzed performance, gender differences, and academic year to assess the efficacy of animation. Results: The animation group outperformed the traditional group in overall scores of 72.48±10.13 vs. 61.16±12.30, (p=0.001), and the passing rate scaled were 60% and 80%. Largely significant differences were seen in male students (p=0.002) and fourth-year students (p=0.001) in the animation group. Knowledge and cognitive assessments showed statistically significant gains in the animation group compared to traditional methods (p< 0.05). Conclusion: Animation-based learning significantly enhances student performance, particularly in cognitive tasks, and is especially beneficial for fourth-year students. This highlights the effectiveness of animation as a teaching tool. Incorporating it can enhance learning outcomes and academic success in applied medical sciences education.

Abstract: ENG English ENG The state of Texas announced a requirement for all foodservice employees to pursue an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) certified food handler training in September 2016. However, the effectiveness of ANSI-certified food safety training for low-literacy novice food handlers has not been investigated. Low-literacy novice food handlers are those who have some familiarity with the field but may not have the literacy level or may have a language barrier that is as an obstacle to completing the training and/or certification. This study aimed to develop a novel food safety training toolkit (NTK) as a supplementary resource to existing ANSI-certified training tools and evaluate its effectiveness in improving food handlers’ knowledge retention and certification. To achieve this, a mixed-method study was conducted. For the first part of the research, one-on-one interviews were conducted with foodservice stakeholders (managers, sanitarians, owners) to identify the gaps and needs that exist in the current food safety training system. In the second part of the research, NTK was synthesized and designed with clear illustrations and drawings based on previous education and training literature. A between-subjects experiment was conducted to assess the effectiveness of NTK on food handlers’ food safety knowledge. Results showed that the participants’ overall food safety knowledge significantly increased due to NTK when compared to the control group. This study is distinctive because it directly responds to the needs of the foodservice industry, and the study output (NTK) can serve as the cornerstone to fill the gap in current food safety training for low-literacy or novice food handlers in the future.

Abstract: Current image fusion methods are primarily designed for infrared and visible images under normal illumination conditions. In multi-scene environments, where conditions such as varying lighting, weather, or scene characteristics are present, existing methods face challenges, particularly under low-light conditions. Due to the severe degradation of visible images in such scenarios, these methods struggle with insufficient feature representation, poor fusion quality, and knowledge loss during task switching. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a multi-scene image fusion method based on multi-scale adaptive fusion and continuous learning (MMF-Fusion). By establishing a multi-scale adaptive fusion network to continuously learn image features in multiple scenes, the quality of image fusion is improved. The specific methods are as follows: (1) A hybrid structure combining CNN and Transformer method is proposed to enhance the feature expression ability in different scenes by fusing the local features of CNN and the global features of Transformer; (2) A new FFM structure is proposed to fuse multi-scale and multi-scene features, which makes full use of scene information at different scales to improve the fusion quality. (3) Memory Aware Synapses (MAS) continuous learning method is used to train the model and calculate the loss function, which retains the visible light features of the fused images in different scenes, effectively reducing the damage of color information in dark light and mitigating the problem of knowledge loss in the process of task switching. Extensive experimental results show that MMF-Fusion is superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of visual quality and quantitative evaluation. In particular, multimodal fusion and low-illumination enhancement provide more effective information for fused images and facilitate high-level vision tasks.Current image fusion methods are primarily designed for infrared and visible images under normal illumination conditions.

Abstract: Effective infectious waste management in healthcare facilities is critical to public health and environmental safety. BACKGROUND Effective infectious waste management in healthcare facilities is critical to public health and environmental safety.This study aims to develop and implement a scalable digital dashboard with real-time analytics to enhance infectious waste management. It also evaluates staff knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (KAB) while monitoring how these factors evolve over time following dashboard implementation. OBJECTIVES This study aims to develop and implement a scalable digital dashboard with real-time analytics to enhance infectious waste management. It also evaluates staff knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (KAB) while monitoring how these factors evolve over time following dashboard implementation.The ADDIE model guided the development of the dashboard. A pre- and post-intervention survey approach was used to assess changes in KAB. Data trends and waste generation rates were analyzed over time, with departmental breakdowns to identify areas for improvement. METHODS The ADDIE model guided the development of the dashboard. A pre- and post-intervention survey approach was used to assess changes in KAB. Data trends and waste generation rates were analyzed over time, with departmental breakdowns to identify areas for improvement.Data from 29 staff members revealed that 79.3% demonstrated high knowledge, 82.76% had positive attitudes, and 89% exhibited effective behaviors. Strong correlations were found between knowledge and attitudes (r = 0.602, p < 0.001) and attitudes and behaviors (r = 0.673, p < 0.001). Over time, post-intervention surveys showed improvements in knowledge retention and behavioral compliance. The dashboard, integrated with IoT and BI analytics, provided real-time tracking, compliance alerts, and waste trend analysis. The study highlights the effectiveness of digital interventions in optimizing infectious waste management and ensuring regulatory compliance.

Abstract: The state of Texas announced a requirement for all foodservice employees to pursue an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) certified food handler training in September 2016. However, the effectiveness of ANSI-certified food safety training for low-literacy novice food handlers has not been investigated. Low-literacy novice food handlers are those who have some familiarity with the field but may not have the literacy level or may have a language barrier that is as an obstacle to completing the training and/or certification. This study aimed to develop a novel food safety training toolkit (NTK) as a supplementary resource to existing ANSI-certified training tools and evaluate its effectiveness in improving food handlers' knowledge retention and certification. To achieve this, a mixed-method study was conducted. For the first part of the research, one-on-one interviews were conducted with foodservice stakeholders (managers, sanitarians, owners) to identify the gaps and needs that exist in the current food safety training system. In the second part of the research, NTK was synthesized and designed with clear illustrations and drawings based on previous education and training literature. A between-subjects experiment was conducted to assess the effectiveness of NTK on food handlers' food safety knowledge. Results showed that the participants' overall food safety knowledge significantly increased due to NTK when compared to the control group. This study is distinctive because it directly responds to the needs of the foodservice industry, and the study output (NTK) can serve as the cornerstone to fill the gap in current food safety training for low-literacy or novice food handlers in the future.The state of Texas announced a requirement for all foodservice employees to pursue an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) certified food handler training in September 2016.

Abstract: Traditional lecture-based learning has been the cornerstone of dental education; however, active learning strategies such as flipped classrooms are gaining popularity for their potential to enhance student engagement and performance. This study evaluated the effectiveness of three teaching methods-traditional live lectures, flipped video classrooms, and interactive flipped classrooms-on improving academic performance and student perceptions among fourth-year dental students. BACKGROUND Traditional lecture-based learning has been the cornerstone of dental education; however, active learning strategies such as flipped classrooms are gaining popularity for their potential to enhance student engagement and performance. This study evaluated the effectiveness of three teaching methods-traditional live lectures, flipped video classrooms, and interactive flipped classrooms-on improving academic performance and student perceptions among fourth-year dental students.This study employed a stratified randomization design involving 156 fourth-year dental students using a single lecture in an undergraduate orthodontics course. The students were first grouped into four categories based on their Grade Point Average (GPA): Excellent, Very Good, Good, and Satisfactory. From these groups, students were randomly drawn and placed into one of three intervention groups: live lecture, flipped classroom with video lectures, and flipped classroom with interactive video lectures. Pre- and post-intervention assessments evaluated knowledge improvement, while objective structured assessments measured academic performance. Student perceptions were gauged using validated Likert-scale questionnaires. Paired t-tests assessed within-group differences, and ANOVA compared effectiveness across teaching methods. Pearson's correlation analysis examined the relationship between academic performance and GPA of the students.

Pearson's correlation analysis examined the relationship between academic performance and GPA of the students.All three teaching methods showed significant improvements in post-intervention scores (p < 0.001). The Live Lecture Group had the greatest mean improvement (27.69), followed by the Flipped Video Lecture Group (27.30) and the Flipped Interactive Lecture Group (27.11). However, ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups (F (2, 153) = 0.007, p = 0.993). Female students performed better in the live lecture setting (32.60 ± 25.08) compared to males (23.79 ± 21.44). Students with lower GPAs benefited most from the interactive flipped classroom, Pearson's correlation indicated a strong positive association between GPA and post-intervention scores (r = 0.708, p < 0.001). Student satisfaction was highest in the interactive flipped classroom, with 97.7% rating the experience as "Excellent" or "Very Good."

Student satisfaction was highest in the interactive flipped classroom, with 97.7% rating the experience as "Excellent" or "Very Good."All three teaching methods led to significant improvement in post-test scores. While students reported higher engagement and satisfaction in flipped and interactive flipped lectures, the live lecture method was also effective for knowledge retention. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring educational strategies to diverse student needs in dental education. Educators should consider a blended model that integrates flipped and traditional strategies selectively, balancing feasibility with student needs, as developing multiple formats can be time-intensive with only modest differences in outcomes.

Abstract: Illustrative examples demonstrate how abstract information can be applied in real-world. In the context of advancing evidence-informed teaching practice, the current intervention study investigated to what extent student teachers should be supported in learning educational theories and findings by different example-based approaches. Conducting a 1 × 3-factorial design, N = 105 student teachers were randomly assigned to three experimental groups: After a pre-test, all groups received the same learning instruction on the topic of cooperative learning. Then, (1) n = 35 students were prompted to generate own examples for the instructional text, (2) n = 35 students received examples along with the text, and (3) n = 35 students studied the text only, without any prompts or examples. In a post-questionnaire, it was retrospectively assessed how students perceived their learning control in engaging with the material; in a post-test, knowledge retention and knowledge transfer were measured. As assumed, findings revealed that generating examples enhanced perceived learning control and learning outcomes compared to studying provided examples. Students who learned with the instructional text only achieved lowest learning outcomes; but contrary to the expectations, these students perceived their learning control comparably high as those who generated examples. Mediation analyses indicated that for students who received illustrative examples or the instructional text only, a greater learning control perception was positively associated with knowledge retention, subsequently enhancing knowledge transfer. The study underscores the benefits of illustrative examples in teacher education, particularly when students engage in generating them. It suggests further examination of how and why example generation facilitates learning. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: Basic science knowledge is essential for understanding clinical studies and enhancing clinical reasoning in medical practice. However, medical students retain only a portion of the knowledge gained during the early years of medical school. We aimed to examine medical students' knowledge retention of repeated and recently learned topics in physiology and microbiology with additional analysis of individual variability. Given that prior studies have raised concerns about the validity of retention rate as an indicator of stable knowledge, we also explored alternative measures of retention.

Given that prior studies have raised concerns about the validity of retention rate as an indicator of stable knowledge, we also explored alternative measures of retention.Nineteen third- and 22 fourth-year medical students volunteered to repeat the written examinations in physiology and microbiology, respectively, in September 2022 at the University of Pécs. Students previously completed a summative test in the fall semester and another test in the spring semester. Both examinations consisted of multiple-choice questions and the second test included questions from both semesters introducing a unique form of spaced repetition. In our study, students repeated the complete second test after a 16-week non-use retention interval. Besides retention rates, we calculated the percentage of consistently correct and incorrect answers as retention measures. Correlations between retention measures and students' grade point averages (GPAs) were examined.

Abstract: Background: Gamification in medical education is a novel strategy to enhance student learning and engagement that is growing in popularity. One such game is an escape box, where players solve a series of challenges and riddles within a limited time to unlock a box or escape a virtual scenario. Building on the ongoing success of game-based learning, this study aims to expand on the use of games in medical school curricula by implementing an escape box-themed game as an effective strategy to teach pre-clinical science to first-year medical students. Methods: The study, approved by the California Northstate University Institutional Review Board, involved first-year medical students divided into two groups: those who participated in the escape box game and lectures and those who attended lectures only. The study was conducted over three phases: a pre-game survey, the escape box game, and a post-game survey. Overall, the surveys included four questions that assessed confidence in renal medical concepts, three questions that assessed student engagement with the escape box game, and five questions that assessed personality traits based on the Big-Five OCEAN personality model. Results: A total of 72 students participated, with 65 completing both pre- and post-game surveys. The final analysis included 40 students in the escape box, plus the lecture group, and 25 students in the lecture-only group. The escape box group of students found the escape box-themed game to be more stimulating and more interesting than traditional lecture, and for most students, it enhanced engagement beyond previous game-based learning methods. In addition, the overall increase in pre- versus post-game confidence was higher, but statistically insignificant in the escape box group. However, for one question regarding dialysis access, there was a statistically significant increase in confidence of 1.261 ± 0.13 for the escape box group and 0.763 ± 0.272 for the lecture-only group (p = 0.00434). No correlation was found between personality traits and an increase in confidence after escape box game learning. Conclusion: Students found the escape box-themed game substantially more engaging than traditional lectures. There is a strong potential for its use to increase confidence in various other pre-clinical medical concepts. This study demonstrates that gamification of medical education topics, such as dialysis access, enhances student engagement, confidence, and retention (p = 0.00434). Future research should evaluate the longevity of knowledge retention and learning outcomes through longitudinal incorporation of game sessions and assessments throughout medical curriculum phases.

Abstract: Background Conventional lectures in medical training may not always foster adequate comprehension and retention of complex physiological concepts. A modified flipped classroom integrating open-ended scenario-based questions (SBQs), multiple-choice questions (MCQs) assessments using an online response recording (ORR) system, and mind maps may enhance student comprehension, engagement, and knowledge retention. This study evaluates first-year Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) students' perceptions of an integrated instructional module on blood physiology. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Raebareli, India, from November 2024 to February 2025, involving 96 first-year MBBS students. The instructional module consisted of 21 structured lectures that utilized a modified flipped classroom approach with pre-class study materials and in-class PowerPoint-based teaching (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). This approach was integrated with mind map navigations, SBQ discussions, and MCQ assessments via Google Forms (Google LLC, Mountain View, CA). Student perceptions were assessed using a validated 14-item questionnaire categorized into three domains: handout quality, comprehension and retention, and satisfaction and engagement. Additionally, two questions assessed the consistency of handout review before classes and the preferred method among SBQs, MCQs, and mind maps for enhancing understanding and retention. Responses were recorded on a five-point Likert scale. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, principal component factor analysis for construct validity, and Cronbach's alpha for reliability assessment. Results Students highly appreciated the quality of structured handouts (4.57 ± 0.42). Students believed that integrating SBQ discussions, MCQs with ORR, and mind maps helped improve knowledge retention and comprehension (4.28 ± 0.44) in a satisfactory and engaging environment (4.49 ± 0.41). Most students acknowledged the benefits of these methods: 91% agreed that MCQs reinforced key concepts, 96% reported an improved understanding through SBQ discussions, and 92% found mind maps helpful for knowledge retention. Additionally, 72% preferred the combined approach of SBQs, MCQs with ORR, and mind maps for comprehension and retention. However, only 26% consistently reviewed the handouts before classes. Conclusion The modified flipped classroom model integrating SBQs, MCQs with ORR, and mind maps helped students comprehend blood physiology while maintaining engagement in lectures. This structured instructional module offers a feasible and effective strategy for enhancing comprehension and engagement in medical education, even with limited resources.

Abstract: Anatomy education serves as a foundational pillar in medical training, equipping students with critical knowledge of human structure and function essential for clinical practice. Traditional pedagogical approaches, such as cadaveric dissection, anatomical models, and textbook-based learning, have been the cornerstone of medical education for decades. However, these methods face challenges, including limited accessibility (e.g., resource-intensive setups), ethical concerns (e.g., participant privacy), and difficulties in visualizing complex three-dimensional structures (e.g., dynamic systems). Recent advancements in immersive technologies, particularly virtual reality (VR), present a transformative opportunity to enhance anatomy education by offering interactive, scalable, and engaging learning experiences. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of VR simulation in improving medical students' learning outcomes in anatomy education, comparing its effectiveness to conventional teaching methodologies. This systematic review was conducted in strict accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines to ensure methodological rigor. A comprehensive literature search was performed across six major medical databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science, encompassing studies published between January 2019 and February 2024. The search strategy employed a combination of MeSH terms and keywords related to "virtual reality", "anatomy education", and "medical students". Study selection was guided by the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Study (PICOS) framework, with inclusion criteria focusing on randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and comparative analyses evaluating VR-based anatomy instruction for medical students. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess study quality and potential bias. Due to significant heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures, a narrative synthesis approach was adopted to integrate findings thematically rather than through meta-analysis. The review included 14 studies with a total of 961 participants, predominantly medical students across various training stages. Among the included studies, 71% demonstrated statistically significant improvements in anatomy learning outcomes with VR compared to traditional methods, including enhanced spatial understanding, knowledge retention, and learner engagement; 21% of the studies reported no significant difference in learning efficacy between VR and conventional approaches, while only 7% found VR simulation only partially effective, citing technical limitations and a steep learning curve as barriers. Subgroup analyses suggested that VR was particularly beneficial for visualizing complex anatomical regions (e.g., neuroanatomy, musculoskeletal structures) and for students with limited prior exposure to cadaveric dissection. However, variability in VR platform design, assessment tools and instructional integration underscored the need for standardized implementation frameworks. The review generally indicated the benefits of VR simulation in anatomy education, but larger studies are needed to fully explore its potential in medical anatomy training. Future studies should rigorously evaluate VR implementation in anatomy education to provide more comprehensive evidence of its strengths and weaknesses for medical teaching.

Abstract: Veterinary training programs in Europe must equip future professionals with essential knowledge and skills in food hygiene and technology to assess, promote, and monitor food safety, as outlined by the World Organization for Animal Health, Directive 2005/36/EC, and the European Association of Establishments for Veterinary Education standards. In France, veterinary education follows a competency-based framework that includes investigating food chain contamination and participating in multidisciplinary crisis management. To address the challenge of teaching practical public health skills, a food safety escape game was developed at the National Veterinary School of Toulouse. This teaching sequence simulates the management of a food-borne outbreak, using gamification to engage students in problem-solving through a realistic scenario. This study details the game's development, implementation, and efficacy evaluation. Student progress was assessed using a pretest and post-test survey, and perceptions were gathered through qualitative feedback. Results showed significant improvements in students' understanding of food-borne outbreak management and increased engagement with the subject. A debriefing session following the game further enhanced knowledge retention and reflection. The findings highlight the effectiveness of gamification and small-group problem-solving exercises, such as serious games, in veterinary public health education. In particular, the results of student questionnaires suggest that teaching health crisis management through an escape game linked to a real-life situation, along with the game's constraints (e.g., competition between groups, time limits), is highly valued and can improve the quality of teaching. This study provides valuable insights for educators aiming to enhance student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Furthermore, it demonstrates that escape games offer an innovative approach to teaching complex public health subjects, helping students grasp key concepts in an interactive way. Future efforts will focus on expanding the game's scope, adjusting difficulty levels, and refining mechanics to better meet the diverse needs of veterinary students and professionals.Veterinary training programs in Europe must equip future professionals with essential knowledge and skills in food hygiene and technology to assess, promote, and monitor food safety, as outlined by the World Organization for Animal Health, Directive 2005/36/EC, and the European Association of Establishments for Veterinary Education standards.

To address the challenge of teaching practical public health skills, a food safety escape game was developed at the National Veterinary School of Toulouse. This teaching sequence simulates the management of a food-borne outbreak, using gamification to engage students in problem-solving through a realistic scenario. This study details the game's development, implementation, and efficacy evaluation. Student progress was assessed using a pretest and post-test survey, and perceptions were gathered through qualitative feedback. Results showed significant improvements in students' understanding of food-borne outbreak management and increased engagement with the subject. A debriefing session following the game further enhanced knowledge retention and reflection. The findings highlight the effectiveness of gamification and small-group problem-solving exercises, such as serious games, in veterinary public health education. In particular, the results of student questionnaires suggest that teaching health crisis management through an escape game linked to a real-life situation, along with the game's constraints (e.g., competition between groups, time limits), is highly valued and can improve the quality of teaching. This study provides valuable insights for educators aiming to enhance student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Furthermore, it demonstrates that escape games offer an innovative approach to teaching complex public health subjects, helping students grasp key concepts in an interactive way. Future efforts will focus on expanding the game's scope, adjusting difficulty levels, and refining mechanics to better meet the diverse needs of veterinary students and professionals.

Abstract: Appropriate antithrombotic drug use is crucial knowledge for pharmacy students. Background Appropriate antithrombotic drug use is crucial knowledge for pharmacy students.We sought to compare the inverted classroom (IC) approach to a traditional question-and-answer educational approach with the aim of enhancing pharmacy students' engagement with a case-study course on antithrombotic drug use. Objective We sought to compare the inverted classroom (IC) approach to a traditional question-and-answer educational approach with the aim of enhancing pharmacy students' engagement with a case-study course on antithrombotic drug use.Third-year PharmD (Doctor of Pharmacy) students from Paris Cité University were randomly assigned to control (n=171) and IC (n=175) groups. The latter were instructed to read and prepare the preprovided course material 1 week before the in-class session to assume the instructor role on the target day, whereas students of the control group attended a traditional case-study course carried out by the same instructor. All students completed pre- and posttest multiple-choice questions surveys assessing their knowledge levels as well as stress, empathy, and satisfaction questionnaires. Methods Third-year PharmD (Doctor of Pharmacy) students from Paris Cité University were randomly assigned to control (n=171) and IC (n=175) groups. The latter were instructed to read and prepare the preprovided course material 1 week before the in-class session to assume the instructor role on the target day, whereas students of the control group attended a traditional case-study course carried out by the same instructor. All students completed pre- and posttest multiple-choice questions surveys assessing their knowledge levels as well as stress, empathy, and satisfaction questionnaires.A significantly higher participation rate was observed in the control group (93/171, 54%) compared to the IC group (65/175, 37%; P=.002). Women (110/213, 52%) participated more than men (48/133, 36%; P=.002) whatever the group was. Students' knowledge scores from both groups had similar results with no difference neither in the prescore (1.17, SD 0.66 and 1.24, SD 0.72 of 5, respectively) nor in the short-term knowledge retention (2.45, SD 0.61 and 2.35, SD 0.73, respectively). The IC approach did not increase student stress or enhance their empathy for the instructor. It increased the preclass workload (P=.02) and was not well received among students. Results A significantly higher participation rate was observed in the control group (93/171, 54%) compared to the IC group (65/175, 37%; P=.002). Women (110/213, 52%) participated more than men (48/133, 36%; P=.002) whatever the group was.

The IC approach did not increase student stress or enhance their empathy for the instructor. It increased the preclass workload (P=.02) and was not well received among students.This study showed that the traditional educational approach remains an efficient method for case-study courses in the early stages (ie, third-year) of the 6-year PharmD curriculum, yet dynamic methods improving the active role of students in the learning process are still needed. Conclusions This study showed that the traditional educational approach remains an efficient method for case-study courses in the early stages (ie, third-year) of the 6-year PharmD curriculum, yet dynamic methods improving the active role of students in the learning process are still needed.

Abstract: Findings from early phase studies are not always placed in the public domain. This study aims to explore why many early phase clinical oncology studies are not published, as well as identify the potential barriers investigators encountered in the publication process. INTRODUCTION Findings from early phase studies are not always placed in the public domain. This study aims to explore why many early phase clinical oncology studies are not published, as well as identify the potential barriers investigators encountered in the publication process.Semi-structured interviews were conducted among investigators with experience in early phase clinical oncology studies. Interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted among investigators with experience in early phase clinical oncology studies. Interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.Twenty-one investigators were interviewed. The majority worked in Europe (n = 13), while other investigators were based in North America (n = 4), Asia (n = 2) or Oceania (n = 2). We identified three reasons why investigators believed publishing early phase clinical trial results was important: (1) there is an ethical and moral responsibility; (2) there should be no loss of knowledge to society; and (3) there should be no waste of resources. Four main barriers in the publication process of early phase clinical trials were identified: (1) practical barriers (eg, an increased complexity of number of trials/trial sites), (2) insufficient resources (eg, money, time and human), (3) limited motivation (eg, limited intrinsic motivation of the investigator or limited prospect of return for the sponsor), and (4) inadequate collaboration (eg, different interests between industry partners and investigators). Finally, five major stakeholders were identified that can potentially contribute to improving the publication process: (1) journal editors, (2) sponsors, (3) investigators, (4) regulatory bodies, and (5) society. Investigator suggestions for improving this process, for each stakeholder, are presented. RESULTS Twenty-one investigators were interviewed.

Abstract: Adolescent pregnancy poses a significant health challenge for girls aged 15-19 in low- and middle-income countries. While gender transformative interventions (GTIs) aim to address this issue, a substantial research gap exists concerning the underlying mechanisms contributing to their success. This study employs a realist synthesis approach to systematically investigate how, why, for whom, and in what contexts GTIs effectively reduce adolescent pregnancy. Background Adolescent pregnancy poses a significant health challenge for girls aged 15-19 in low- and middle-income countries. While gender transformative interventions (GTIs) aim to address this issue, a substantial research gap exists concerning the underlying mechanisms contributing to their success. This study employs a realist synthesis approach to systematically investigate how, why, for whom, and in what contexts GTIs effectively reduce adolescent pregnancy.A five-step realist review examined literature from four databases and five organisational repositories, including published and grey literature. The review focused on GTIs for adolescents aged 10-19 in low- or middle-income countries. Narrative synthesis and realist analysis were used to develop context-mechanism-outcome configurations. Methods A five-step realist review examined literature from four databases and five organisational repositories, including published and grey literature. The review focused on GTIs for adolescents aged 10-19 in low- or middle-income countries. Narrative synthesis and realist analysis were used to develop context-mechanism-outcome configurations.The review analysed 28 documents covering 14 interventions and proposing eight programme theories across three settings. In the school, creating a supportive environment to foster positive social norms and providing a safe space was emphasised. Comprehensive sexual health education to promote critical thinking, knowledge retention, and goal setting was one of the key strategies. Empowering boys to adopt positive gender norms for behaviour change was also identified. In the health facility, providing a safe, supportive, and confidential environment for accessing services, as well as using digital health apps to empower adolescents in sexual reproductive health, were key. In the community, empowering girls through life skills and economic support and involving community members to foster stronger interpersonal bonds and a gender-positive environment were highlighted. These interventions led to increased contraceptive use, delayed marriage, and reduced adolescent pregnancy. Results The review analysed 28 documents covering 14 interventions and proposing eight programme theories across three settings.

These interventions led to increased contraceptive use, delayed marriage, and reduced adolescent pregnancy.This realist synthesis proposes eight nuanced programme theories of successful GTIs, providing essential insights for developing, implementing, and improving future programmes. These findings offer a foundation for effective strategies to mitigate adolescent pregnancy in diverse socio-cultural contexts. Conclusion This realist synthesis proposes eight nuanced programme theories of successful GTIs, providing essential insights for developing, implementing, and improving future programmes. These findings offer a foundation for effective strategies to mitigate adolescent pregnancy in diverse socio-cultural contexts.PROSPERO: CRD42023398293. Registration PROSPERO: CRD42023398293.

Abstract: Nurses in neonatal intensive care units face critical challenges in managing emergencies where timely, accurate interventions are essential for survival. Traditional nursing education often lacks the hands-on, immersive training required to build complex emergency skills, contributing to persistent neonatal mortality globally. Virtual reality (VR) simulation, grounded in Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory, offers a promising solution by replicating realistic and repeatable clinical scenarios. While VR has shown potential in nursing education, its specific impact on high-risk neonatal emergencies remains underexplored.

AIM To evaluate the effectiveness of a VR simulation program in enhancing nurse competency and improving neonatal outcomes during emergency care, grounded in Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory.A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design was implemented over two weeks across four pediatric hospitals. Through stratified random sampling, 128 NICU nurses were allocated to VR simulation (n = 64) or traditional training (n = 64) groups. Quantitative data were collected using validated instruments (OSCE: CVI = 0.92, MCQ: α = 0.86) measuring clinical skills, knowledge retention, and decision-making accuracy. Qualitative data were gathered through semi-structured interviews (n = 24) exploring experiential aspects.

Abstract: This study aims to analyze the effects of explorative and exploitative skills, along with the moderating role of knowledge vacuum, on innovation process and performance during the merger of public research organizations (PROs) to better comprehend these organizational factors. During the merger of PROs, explorative and exploitative skills can prevent a slow innovation process and knowledge loss. Meanwhile, innovation also serves as PRO's core activity. However, the effect of explorative and exploitative skills (and also the knowledge vacuum) on the innovation process in PROs is still debatable, as they often disregard the knowledge loss effect. This study used 314 questionnaires, which were responded to by scientists of basic and technological research in Indonesia's merged PRO, namely the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN). Data were collected from 2023 to 2024 and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) with Smart-PLS 4.0. The results reveal that the knowledge vacuum has a positive and significant influence on both exploratory-exploitative skills and absorptive-adaptive capabilities of scientists, which will eventually shape their distinctive competencies differently. However, despite the positive influence of the knowledge vacuum, the organization needs to strengthen scientists' explorative and exploitative skills by reinforcing strategic human resource management through periodic training, performing joint activities or active innovation hubs, and guiding scientists to cope with the dynamic transition periods due to mergers. All of them aim to reinforce knowledge exchange and research networks.

Abstract: Escape rooms are used in medical education to encourage teaming and communication skills, but their effectiveness beyond learner satisfaction remains unexplored. This review evaluated their educational value, focusing on alignment with ACGME core competencies. Following the PRISMA framework, a scoping review was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and ERIC through mid-September 2023, excluding commentaries, editorials, and letters. The review included 35 studies, mostly single-institution studies, with various methodologies. Most aligned with competencies in interpersonal and communication skills and systems-based practice, with increased virtual formats during COVID-19 pandemic. High learner satisfaction was noted. Escape rooms effectively foster teamwork and communication in medical education. Further research is needed on knowledge retention and application.

Abstract: Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) applications encounter issues with data protection, continual adaptation, and domain-specific knowledge retention, especially in consumer-centric IoMT scenarios. We overcome these obstacles and facilitate effective knowledge retention and task adaptation in IoMT applications. This study attempts to create a unique privacy-preserving federated learning framework that combines a hierarchical learning structure with Continual Learning (CL). Despite the advancements in Federated Learning (FL), current models have trouble integrating changing datasets in real-time while protecting privacy, as well as catastrophic forgetting, which occurs when previously learned knowledge is lost when adjusting to new tasks. We present a hierarchical learning framework that makes use of three levels of models - Junior Model (JM), Consultant Model (CM), and Senior Consultant Model (SCM) - to overcome these drawbacks. Each level of the model aids in archived retention and domain-knowledge adaptation. To guarantee that the model maintains valuable information over time and adapts to new tasks with ease, our method blends domain adaptation strategies with ongoing learning approaches like knowledge distillation and elastic weight consolidation (EWC). We compare the suggested methodology with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on healthcare datasets for tasks like illness diagnosis and medical image categorization. According to our findings, the hierarchical continual learning model performs better than SOTA techniques in terms of accuracy, task adaptability, and privacy protection. In the healthcare industry, our study sets a new standard for privacy-preserving, continuously adaptable federated learning systems, allowing for real-time, scalable IoMT applications that can adapt dynamically to a variety of changing datasets.

Abstract: This paper assesses the level of knowledge waste in HEIs. The theoretical outline of this work was guided by the knowledge waste scale validated by Klein et al. (2023), divided into four categories: explicit knowledge waste, tacit knowledge retention, overspecialization, and underutilized talent. Survey-type quantitative research was carried out through the application of a questionnaire. The target population of this study is the employees of HEIs. A sample of 837 responses was obtained. Data were analyzed using descriptive and multivariate statistics, applying t and ANOVA tests. The results highlight higher averages for the four categories of knowledge waste in public HEIs. It was found that the administrative technicians had higher averages in terms of overspecialization waste and underutilized talent.

Abstract: Background The yearly courses conducted by the South Asian Society for Sexual Medicine (SASSM) in Bangladesh establish a collaborative training paradigm designed to increase healthcare professionals’ comfort with sexual medicine and develop skills for giving the best treatment possible to individuals with sexual health issues and dysfunctions. Aim The study assessed the impact of course completion on SASSM School Bangladesh participants. Methods A pretest–posttest of 116 (57%) SASSM participants was conducted, comprising data on knowledge acquisition following the 3-day program in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021. A paired t -test was applied to compare the difference between pretest and posttest performance. Logistic regression was conducted to assess the influence of socio-demographic variables. Outcomes The study demonstrates that the SASSM School Bangladesh program significantly improves participants’ knowledge of sexual medicine, with a 12.7-unit increase in test scores, irrespective of socio-demographic factors. Results Majority (102, or 75% of those polled) of the participants were men. Psychiatrists were the most common respondents (39%), followed by dermatologists (32%), urologists (12%), and gynecologists (8%) who completed both surveys. There was a significant difference ( P -value .05. Clinical Implications The study highlights the clinical importance of structured training in sexual medicine, ensuring that healthcare professionals across various specialties are better equipped to diagnose and manage sexual health issues effectively. Strengths and Limitations The study used a pretest–posttest design to measure actual knowledge improvement. Paired t -test and logistic regression were applied to ensure robust analysis. Diverse professionals from psychiatry, dermatology, urology, and gynecology participated in the study, making the findings relevant across specialties. This study evaluates the only structured sexual medicine training program in Bangladesh, contributing new insights into medical education. However, the findings may not be generalizable beyond Bangladesh. The study could not assess whether knowledge retention and clinical practice improved over time. Participants voluntarily enrolled in the study, which can possibly represent a group already interested in sexual medicine. The study focused only on knowledge improvement, not on changes in clinical practice or patient outcomes. Conclusion Specialists of sexual medicine have a unique opportunity to learn and certify their knowledge through the SASSM program, the first of its kind in Bangladesh.

Abstract: Gamification in medical education is a novel strategy to enhance student learning and engagement that is growing in popularity. One such game is an escape box, where players solve a series of challenges and riddles within a limited time to unlock a box or escape a virtual scenario. Building on the ongoing success of game-based learning, this study aims to expand on the use of games in medical school curricula by implementing an escape box-themed game as an effective strategy to teach pre-clinical science to first-year medical students. BACKGROUND Gamification in medical education is a novel strategy to enhance student learning and engagement that is growing in popularity. One such game is an escape box, where players solve a series of challenges and riddles within a limited time to unlock a box or escape a virtual scenario. Building on the ongoing success of game-based learning, this study aims to expand on the use of games in medical school curricula by implementing an escape box-themed game as an effective strategy to teach pre-clinical science to first-year medical students.The study, approved by the California Northstate University Institutional Review Board, involved first-year medical students divided into two groups: those who participated in the escape box game and lectures and those who attended lectures only. The study was conducted over three phases: a pre-game survey, the escape box game, and a post-game survey. Overall, the surveys included four questions that assessed confidence in renal medical concepts, three questions that assessed student engagement with the escape box game, and five questions that assessed personality traits based on the Big-Five OCEAN personality model. METHODS The study, approved by the California Northstate University Institutional Review Board, involved first-year medical students divided into two groups: those who participated in the escape box game and lectures and those who attended lectures only. The study was conducted over three phases: a pre-game survey, the escape box game, and a post-game survey. Overall, the surveys included four questions that assessed confidence in renal medical concepts, three questions that assessed student engagement with the escape box game, and five questions that assessed personality traits based on the Big-Five OCEAN personality model.A total of 72 students participated, with 65 completing both pre- and post-game surveys. The final analysis included 40 students in the escape box, plus the lecture group, and 25 students in the lecture-only group. The escape box group of students found the escape box-themed game to be more stimulating and more interesting than traditional lecture, and for most students, it enhanced engagement beyond previous game-based learning methods. In addition, the overall increase in pre- versus post-game confidence was higher, but statistically insignificant in the escape box group. However, for one question regarding dialysis access, there was a statistically significant increase in confidence of 1.261 ± 0.13 for the escape box group and 0.763 ± 0.272 for the lecture-only group (p = 0.00434). No correlation was found between personality traits and an increase in confidence after escape box game learning. RESULTS A total of 72 students participated, with 65 completing both pre- and post-game surveys. The final analysis included 40 students in the escape box, plus the lecture group, and 25 students in the lecture-only group. The escape box group of students found the escape box-themed game to be more stimulating and more interesting than traditional lecture, and for most students, it enhanced engagement beyond previous game-based learning methods.

No correlation was found between personality traits and an increase in confidence after escape box game learning.Students found the escape box-themed game substantially more engaging than traditional lectures. There is a strong potential for its use to increase confidence in various other pre-clinical medical concepts. This study demonstrates that gamification of medical education topics, such as dialysis access, enhances student engagement, confidence, and retention (p = 0.00434). Future research should evaluate the longevity of knowledge retention and learning outcomes through longitudinal incorporation of game sessions and assessments throughout medical curriculum phases.

Abstract: Escape rooms are used in medical education to encourage teaming and communication skills, but their effectiveness beyond learner satisfaction remains unexplored. This review evaluated their educational value, focusing on alignment with ACGME core competencies. Following the PRISMA framework, a scoping review was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and ERIC through mid-September 2023, excluding commentaries, editorials, and letters. The review included 35 studies, mostly single-institution studies, with various methodologies. Most aligned with competencies in interpersonal and communication skills and systems-based practice, with increased virtual formats during COVID-19 pandemic. High learner satisfaction was noted. Escape rooms effectively foster teamwork and communication in medical education. Further research is needed on knowledge retention and application.Escape rooms are used in medical education to encourage teaming and communication skills, but their effectiveness beyond learner satisfaction remains unexplored.

Abstract: Anatomy education serves as a foundational pillar in medical training, equipping students with critical knowledge of human structure and function essential for clinical practice. Traditional pedagogical approaches, such as cadaveric dissection, anatomical models, and textbook-based learning, have been the cornerstone of medical education for decades. However, these methods face challenges, including limited accessibility (e.g., resource-intensive setups), ethical concerns (e.g., participant privacy), and difficulties in visualizing complex three-dimensional structures (e.g., dynamic systems). Recent advancements in immersive technologies, particularly virtual reality (VR), present a transformative opportunity to enhance anatomy education by offering interactive, scalable, and engaging learning experiences. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of VR simulation in improving medical students' learning outcomes in anatomy education, comparing its effectiveness to conventional teaching methodologies. This systematic review was conducted in strict accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines to ensure methodological rigor. A comprehensive literature search was performed across six major medical databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science, encompassing studies published between January 2019 and February 2024. The search strategy employed a combination of MeSH terms and keywords related to "virtual reality", "anatomy education", and "medical students". Study selection was guided by the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Study (PICOS) framework, with inclusion criteria focusing on randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and comparative analyses evaluating VR-based anatomy instruction for medical students. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess study quality and potential bias. Due to significant heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures, a narrative synthesis approach was adopted to integrate findings thematically rather than through meta-analysis. The review included 14 studies with a total of 961 participants, predominantly medical students across various training stages. Among the included studies, 71% demonstrated statistically significant improvements in anatomy learning outcomes with VR compared to traditional methods, including enhanced spatial understanding, knowledge retention, and learner engagement; 21% of the studies reported no significant difference in learning efficacy between VR and conventional approaches, while only 7% found VR simulation only partially effective, citing technical limitations and a steep learning curve as barriers. Subgroup analyses suggested that VR was particularly beneficial for visualizing complex anatomical regions (e.g., neuroanatomy, musculoskeletal structures) and for students with limited prior exposure to cadaveric dissection. However, variability in VR platform design, assessment tools and instructional integration underscored the need for standardized implementation frameworks. The review generally indicated the benefits of VR simulation in anatomy education, but larger studies are needed to fully explore its potential in medical anatomy training. Future studies should rigorously evaluate VR implementation in anatomy education to provide more comprehensive evidence of its strengths and weaknesses for medical teaching.Anatomy education serves as a foundational pillar in medical training, equipping students with critical knowledge of human structure and function essential for clinical practice.

Abstract: Background Conventional lectures in medical training may not always foster adequate comprehension and retention of complex physiological concepts. A modified flipped classroom integrating open-ended scenario-based questions (SBQs), multiple-choice questions (MCQs) assessments using an online response recording (ORR) system, and mind maps may enhance student comprehension, engagement, and knowledge retention. This study evaluates first-year Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) students' perceptions of an integrated instructional module on blood physiology. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Raebareli, India, from November 2024 to February 2025, involving 96 first-year MBBS students. The instructional module consisted of 21 structured lectures that utilized a modified flipped classroom approach with pre-class study materials and in-class PowerPoint-based teaching (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). This approach was integrated with mind map navigations, SBQ discussions, and MCQ assessments via Google Forms (Google LLC, Mountain View, CA). Student perceptions were assessed using a validated 14-item questionnaire categorized into three domains: handout quality, comprehension and retention, and satisfaction and engagement. Additionally, two questions assessed the consistency of handout review before classes and the preferred method among SBQs, MCQs, and mind maps for enhancing understanding and retention. Responses were recorded on a five-point Likert scale. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, principal component factor analysis for construct validity, and Cronbach's alpha for reliability assessment. Results Students highly appreciated the quality of structured handouts (4.57 ± 0.42). Students believed that integrating SBQ discussions, MCQs with ORR, and mind maps helped improve knowledge retention and comprehension (4.28 ± 0.44) in a satisfactory and engaging environment (4.49 ± 0.41). Most students acknowledged the benefits of these methods: 91% agreed that MCQs reinforced key concepts, 96% reported an improved understanding through SBQ discussions, and 92% found mind maps helpful for knowledge retention. Additionally, 72% preferred the combined approach of SBQs, MCQs with ORR, and mind maps for comprehension and retention. However, only 26% consistently reviewed the handouts before classes. Conclusion The modified flipped classroom model integrating SBQs, MCQs with ORR, and mind maps helped students comprehend blood physiology while maintaining engagement in lectures. This structured instructional module offers a feasible and effective strategy for enhancing comprehension and engagement in medical education, even with limited resources.Background Conventional lectures in medical training may not always foster adequate comprehension and retention of complex physiological concepts.

Abstract: The yearly courses conducted by the South Asian Society for Sexual Medicine (SASSM) in Bangladesh establish a collaborative training paradigm designed to increase healthcare professionals' comfort with sexual medicine and develop skills for giving the best treatment possible to individuals with sexual health issues and dysfunctions. Background The yearly courses conducted by the South Asian Society for Sexual Medicine (SASSM) in Bangladesh establish a collaborative training paradigm designed to increase healthcare professionals' comfort with sexual medicine and develop skills for giving the best treatment possible to individuals with sexual health issues and dysfunctions.The study assessed the impact of course completion on SASSM School Bangladesh participants. Aim The study assessed the impact of course completion on SASSM School Bangladesh participants.A pretest-posttest of 116 (57%) SASSM participants was conducted, comprising data on knowledge acquisition following the 3-day program in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021. A paired t -test was applied to compare the difference between pretest and posttest performance. Logistic regression was conducted to assess the influence of socio-demographic variables. Methods A pretest-posttest of 116 (57%) SASSM participants was conducted, comprising data on knowledge acquisition following the 3-day program in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021. A paired t-test was applied to compare the difference between pretest and posttest performance. Logistic regression was conducted to assess the influence of socio-demographic variables.The study demonstrates that the SASSM School Bangladesh program significantly improves participants' knowledge of sexual medicine, with a 12.7-unit increase in test scores, irrespective of socio-demographic factors. Outcomes The study demonstrates that the SASSM School Bangladesh program significantly improves participants' knowledge of sexual medicine, with a 12.7-unit increase in test scores, irrespective of socio-demographic factors.Majority (102, or 75% of those polled) of the participants were men. Psychiatrists were the most common respondents (39%), followed by dermatologists (32%), urologists (12%), and gynecologists (8%) who completed both surveys. There was a significant difference ( P -value  .05. Results Majority (102, or 75% of those polled) of the participants were men. Psychiatrists were the most common respondents (39%), followed by dermatologists (32%), urologists (12%), and gynecologists (8%) who completed both surveys. There was a significant difference (P-value  .05.The study highlights the clinical importance of structured training in sexual medicine, ensuring that healthcare professionals across various specialties are better equipped to diagnose and manage sexual health issues effectively. Clinical Implications The study highlights the clinical importance of structured training in sexual medicine, ensuring that healthcare professionals across various specialties are better equipped to diagnose and manage sexual health issues effectively.The study used a pretest-posttest design to measure actual knowledge improvement. Paired t -test and logistic regression were applied to ensure robust analysis. Diverse professionals from psychiatry, dermatology, urology, and gynecology participated in the study, making the findings relevant across specialties. This study evaluates the only structured sexual medicine training program in Bangladesh, contributing new insights into medical education.However, the findings may not be generalizable beyond Bangladesh. The study could not assess whether knowledge retention and clinical practice improved over time. Participants voluntarily enrolled in the study, which can possibly represent a group already interested in sexual medicine. The study focused only on knowledge improvement, not on changes in clinical practice or patient outcomes. Strengths and Limitations The study used a pretest-posttest design to measure actual knowledge improvement. Paired t-test and logistic regression were applied to ensure robust analysis. Diverse professionals from psychiatry, dermatology, urology, and gynecology participated in the study, making the findings relevant across specialties. This study evaluates the only structured sexual medicine training program in Bangladesh, contributing new insights into medical education.However, the findings may not be generalizable beyond Bangladesh. The study could not assess whether knowledge retention and clinical practice improved over time. Participants voluntarily enrolled in the study, which can possibly represent a group already interested in sexual medicine. The study focused only on knowledge improvement, not on changes in clinical practice or patient outcomes.Specialists of sexual medicine have a unique opportunity to learn and certify their knowledge through the SASSM program, the first of its kind in Bangladesh. Conclusion Specialists of sexual medicine have a unique opportunity to learn and certify their knowledge through the SASSM program, the first of its kind in Bangladesh.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of animation compared to traditional lecture methods on student performance, cognitive outcomes, and knowledge retention among Applied Medical Sciences University students. Background & Objectives This study investigates the effectiveness of animation compared to traditional lecture methods on student performance, cognitive outcomes, and knowledge retention among Applied Medical Sciences University students.In this cross-sectional comparative study, a total of 110 students from the College of Applied Medical Sciences (CAMS), Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University participated in the study conducted between 1 st April to 30 th June 2024. Participants were divided into two groups: one receiving traditional lecture-based instruction and the other receiving animated instructional content. Quizzes were structured into two components to evaluate knowledge retention and cognitive skills. The study further analyzed performance, gender differences, and academic year to assess the efficacy of animation. Methods In this cross-sectional comparative study, a total of 110 students from the College of Applied Medical Sciences (CAMS), Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University participated in the study conducted between 1st April to 30th June 2024. Participants were divided into two groups: one receiving traditional lecture-based instruction and the other receiving animated instructional content. Quizzes were structured into two components to evaluate knowledge retention and cognitive skills. The study further analyzed performance, gender differences, and academic year to assess the efficacy of animation.The animation group outperformed the traditional group in overall scores of 72.48±10.13 vs. 61.16±12.30, (p=0.001), and the passing rate scaled were 60% and 80%. Largely significant differences were seen in male students (p=0.002) and fourth-year students (p=0.001) in the animation group. Knowledge and cognitive assessments showed statistically significant gains in the animation group compared to traditional methods (p< 0.05). Results The animation group outperformed the traditional group in overall scores of 72.48±10.13 vs. 61.16±12.30, (p=0.001), and the passing rate scaled were 60% and 80%. Largely significant differences were seen in male students (p=0.002) and fourth-year students (p=0.001) in the animation group. Knowledge and cognitive assessments showed statistically significant gains in the animation group compared to traditional methods (p< 0.05).Animation-based learning significantly enhances student performance, particularly in cognitive tasks, and is especially beneficial for fourth-year students. This highlights the effectiveness of animation as a teaching tool. Incorporating it can enhance learning outcomes and academic success in applied medical sciences education. Conclusion Animation-based learning significantly enhances student performance, particularly in cognitive tasks, and is especially beneficial for fourth-year students. This highlights the effectiveness of animation as a teaching tool. Incorporating it can enhance learning outcomes and academic success in applied medical sciences education.

Abstract: The study quantitatively explores the differential impact of a Flipped Classroom approach (FC) on specified learning outcomes in an Advanced Auditing and Assurance class for a one-year master’s in accounting Programme. It uses a dataset from a Ghanaian university to compare a flipped-classroom approach to a traditional teaching approach. The findings suggest that FC comparatively reduces pre-exam anxiety, improves student’s exam scores, and enhances knowledge retention. This study is among a few that explore the impact of FC on Accounting courses in a cultural setting that comparatively adapts slowly to change, and it improves our understanding of different teaching and learning approaches in different contextual, cultural, and geographical settings.

Abstract: Background Advanced practice registered nurses perceive training in chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation as inadequate to practice with competency. Methods Gamification was used to teach CXR interpretation to adult gerontology acute care nurse practitioner learners. After didactic instruction, learners participated in a series of online CXR questions. Results At post-assessment, n = 28 learners were either somewhat (85.7%, n = 24) or very (10.7%, n = 3) confident in making correct diagnoses. Additionally, 64.3% of the learners answered at least 75% of questions correctly, indicating knowledge retention. Conclusion Learners gained confidence and retained knowledge in CXR interpretation in an engaging format.

Knowledge loss and retention in interorganizational projects: evidence from public transportation projects from Pakistan

Author: Iftikhar, Reha b1    ; Rashid, Mehvish2    1 University of the West of Scotland, London, UK2 National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan

Publication info: Iftikhar, Rehab; Rashid, Mehvish. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/knowledge-loss-retention-interorganizational/docview/3187364927/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Purpose Knowledge loss and retention are common phenomena not only for organizations but also for interorganizational projects, where multiple organizations are involved. This paper sets out to understand why knowledge loss occurs and how to retain knowledge, particularly in the context of interorganizational projects. For this purpose, the Orange Line Metro Rail Transit System in Lahore, the Bus Rapid Transit in Peshawar and the Green Line Metrobus in Karachi, all in Pakistan, were examined. Design/methodology/approach A multi-case study approach is employed in this paper. Empirical data were collected through semi-structured interviews and archival documents. To analyze the data, we used a three-step thematization procedure, which included data condensation, data presentation and conclusion. Findings The findings present the determinants of knowledge loss, including high time pressure, memory decay, lack of sharing of personal knowledge and tenuous relationships between salary and experience. For knowledge retention, the findings provide evidence of the transformation of the working environment, externalization, job shadowing, the hiring and rehiring individuals and the provision of incentives. Originality/value By examining knowledge loss and retention in interorganizational projects, this article contributes to the literature on knowledge-based theory.

Abstract: Drawing is a teaching tool that provides numerous benefits to student learning, including enhanced knowledge retention, improved observation skills, and increased engagement with course content. However, these exercises also place high cognitive demands on students and require a considerable time commitment. To acknowledge and celebrate the effort students invest in their drawings; while also giving these illustrations curricular significance, a gallery walk can be an effective teaching strategy. During a gallery walk, students move around a learning space to view, analyze, and discuss work displayed on the walls. This article describes an adaptation of a gallery walk, named a ‘showcase review session’, which was implemented in an undergraduate histology course. This optional session highlighted highly accurate assignment drawings while offering a content review before the final examination. The course instructor created review questions associated with the student drawings, which were projected onto screens around the room. Students could visit the session at any time, with the questions cycling continuously, and the course instructor and teaching assistants circulated to answer questions. Students responded positively to the session, noting that it helped them prepare for their upcoming practical laboratory examination and that showcasing student work added value to the course. Showcase review sessions like the one described can be applied across disciplines, giving students the opportunity to learn from their peers' work while effectively reviewing course content in an engaging and interactive environment.

Abstract: Clinical relevance Just-A-Minute Clinical Pearls as a microlearning concept may be beneficial in enhancing optometry and ophthalmology practice globally. Background Medical education often witnesses a gap in effectively translating the learnings into clinical practice, pointing to the complex and traditional teaching methods as hindrances. The present work studied the usefulness and acceptability of Just-A-Minute Optometry Clinical Pearls, a micro-learning tool, among optometrists and ophthalmologists. Methods Just-A-Minute Optometry clinical pearls were developed by the optometry team of LV Prasad Eye Institute and shared (via email) among optometrists and ophthalmologists on a daily basis between June 2021 to May 2022. In the middle of the project, the recipients were invited to participate in an online survey. The variables studied included frequency of checking clinical pearls, simplicity of their content, grasping speed, most used subspeciality pearls, knowledge gain and retention, practice applicability, overall learning experience, and the likelihood of recommending it to a friend. Results Among 150 respondents, 103 (68.7%) were ophthalmologists, and 46 (30.7%) were optometrists. The majority were from private ( n  = 64, 42.7%) and institutional ( n  = 48, 32%) practices, with 102 (68.4%) having more than five years and 21 (14%) having 2–5 years of experience. About 115 (77%) respondents checked clinical pearls every day, 147 (99%) found the format easy, and 131 (88%) could grasp the content within one minute. They felt that JAM-OCP ‘always’ enhanced clinical knowledge ( n  = 108, 72%) and clinical applicability ( n  = 82, 55%) and helped in knowledge retention ( n  = 123, 84%). The responses to the clinical application significantly varied (Chi-square tests) among subgroups of education qualification ( p  < 0.001) and practice types ( p  < 0.03). Conclusions The Just-A-Minute Optometry Clinical Pearls were beneficial to optometrists and ophthalmologists in their practices. This, as a tele-education tool, supports continuing optometry education across the globe.

Abstract: This study investigated the effects of an educational program involving human–dolphin interactions at a zoo on visitors’ conservation caring, behavioral intentions, and knowledge retention. A total of 412 adult zoo visitors participated in this study. Through an experimental design (n = 224 pre-intervention) with a control group (n = 83) and a treatment group (n = 105; exposed to information about the critically endangered Vaquita), the research aimed to assess the program’s influence on fostering pro-conservation attitudes and actions. Additionally, a follow-up survey five months after the intervention evaluated the longitudinal effects. The Conservation Caring Scale, adapted from previous studies, measured participants’ cognitive, affective, and behavioral components related to wildlife. The findings revealed that while the program successfully conveyed knowledge about dolphin conservation status, its impact on increasing conservation caring and behavioral intentions was limited. Incorporating information about the Vaquita raised awareness but did not significantly influence overall conservation caring or behavioral intent. Follow-up results indicated a decline to baseline levels in conservation caring scores over time, suggesting the need for developing more comprehensive and longitudinal approaches to promote pro-conservation mindsets and actions among zoo visitors. Implications for optimizing educational interventions and cultivating broader conservation commitments in zoo visitors are discussed.

Abstract: Escape rooms offer an immersive approach to nursing education, serving as versatile tools for assessment and skill development. While research has explored their potential as alternatives to traditional assessments, their role as formative assessment and impact on knowledge retention in nursing education remain largely unexplored, prompting the need for further investigation. BACKGROUND Escape rooms offer an immersive approach to nursing education, serving as versatile tools for assessment and skill development. While research has explored their potential as alternatives to traditional assessments, their role as formative assessment and impact on knowledge retention in nursing education remain largely unexplored, prompting the need for further investigation.The study aims to explore the impact of escape rooms as formative assessment on first-year nursing students' knowledge retention. AIM The study aims to explore the impact of escape rooms as formative assessment on first-year nursing students' knowledge retention.We employed a quasi-experimental research design. DESIGN We employed a quasi-experimental research design.Four escape rooms themed around medication, patient safety, low blood sugar, and sepsis were physically set up in a public university located in the southeast U.S. Student teams of two or three went through each room for an alternative formative assessment. SETTINGS Four escape rooms themed around medication, patient safety, low blood sugar, and sepsis were physically set up in a public university located in the southeast U.S. Student teams of two or three went through each room for an alternative formative assessment.134 first-year nursing students, in clinical groups, were randomly assigned into an experimental condition and a control condition. PARTICIPANTS 134 first-year nursing students, in clinical groups, were randomly assigned into an experimental condition and a control condition.A gameful experience questionnaire developed by Högberg et al. (2019) was adapted, comprising 47 items across six categories. Additionally, a test consisting of seventeen multiple-choice questions was administered online for pre-test, post-test, and retention test. Students' perceptions of their learning experiences were also gathered through an open-ended question, with themes identified from their responses. METHODS A gameful experience questionnaire developed by Högberg et al. (2019) was adapted, comprising 47 items across six categories. Additionally, a test consisting of seventeen multiple-choice questions was administered online for pre-test, post-test, and retention test. Students' perceptions of their learning experiences were also gathered through an open-ended question, with themes identified from their responses.The paired t-test on GamefulQuest scores revealed a significant difference between escape rooms and traditional assessment methods, with the experimental group showing notably higher levels of accomplishment, guidance, immersion, playfulness, and social experience. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups on knowledge retention. Student feedback on escape room experiences highlighted entertainment, educational value, collaboration dynamics, and logistical considerations, underscoring the multifaceted nature of these immersive learning environments. RESULTS The paired t-test on GamefulQuest scores revealed a significant difference between escape rooms and traditional assessment methods, with the experimental group showing notably higher levels of accomplishment, guidance, immersion, playfulness, and social experience. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups on knowledge retention. Student feedback on escape room experiences highlighted entertainment, educational value, collaboration dynamics, and logistical considerations, underscoring the multifaceted nature of these immersive learning environments.Escape rooms promoted students' positive perception of learning experience, but showed no significant advantage over traditional assessment methods in terms of retention, aligning with existing literature on problem-based learning (PBL). CONCLUSIONS Escape rooms promoted students' positive perception of learning experience, but showed no significant advantage over traditional assessment methods in terms of retention, aligning with existing literature on problem-based learning (PBL).

Abstract: Fully digital preoperative information could save valuable time and resources. However, compared with face to face consultations, equivalent levels of safety, patient satisfaction and participation need to be maintained when using other methods to inform patients. This trial compared knowledge retention between preoperative stand-alone video education and face-to-face education by an anaesthesiologist. BACKGROUND Fully digital preoperative information could save valuable time and resources. However, compared with face to face consultations, equivalent levels of safety, patient satisfaction and participation need to be maintained when using other methods to inform patients. This trial compared knowledge retention between preoperative stand-alone video education and face-to-face education by an anaesthesiologist.To assess if video education, alone or combined with face-to-face education, leads to better knowledge retention more than conventional face-to-face education. OBJECTIVES To assess if video education, alone or combined with face-to-face education, leads to better knowledge retention more than conventional face-to-face education.A randomised controlled trial with four arms: Video, Anaesthesiologist, Video & Anaesthesiologist, and Reference for baseline measurements and exploration of a test-enhanced learning effect. DESIGN A randomised controlled trial with four arms: Video, Anaesthesiologist, Video & Anaesthesiologist, and Reference for baseline measurements and exploration of a test-enhanced learning effect.A Dutch tertiary care centre from February 2022 to February 2023. SETTING A Dutch tertiary care centre from February 2022 to February 2023.A total of 767 adult patients undergoing preoperative consultation for elective non-cardiothoracic surgery, with 677 included in the complete case analysis. PATIENTS A total of 767 adult patients undergoing preoperative consultation for elective non-cardiothoracic surgery, with 677 included in the complete case analysis.Stand-alone preoperative video education and video education in combination with face-to-face education in the preoperative outpatient clinic. INTERVENTIONS Stand-alone preoperative video education and video education in combination with face-to-face education in the preoperative outpatient clinic.Primary outcome, measured by the Rotterdam Anaesthesia Knowledge Questionnaire, was knowledge retention on day 0. Secondary outcomes included knowledge retention at 14 and 42 days, preoperative anxiety, and the need for additional information using the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale. Other outcomes were satisfaction, self-assessed knowledge, and test-enhanced learning effect. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome, measured by the Rotterdam Anaesthesia Knowledge Questionnaire, was knowledge retention on day 0. Secondary outcomes included knowledge retention at 14 and 42 days, preoperative anxiety, and the need for additional information using the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale. Other outcomes were satisfaction, self-assessed knowledge, and test-enhanced learning effect.Stand-alone video education led to higher Rotterdam Anaesthesia Knowledge Questionnaire scores than face-to-face education on day 0: median [IQR], 87.5 [81.3 to 93.8] vs. 81.3 [68.8 to 87.5], P  < 0.001. Combined education in the "Video & Anaesthesiologist" group led to better knowledge retention compared with both the "Anaesthesiologist" group and the Video group: 93.8 [87.5 to 93.8] vs. 81.3 [68.8 to 87.5], P  < 0.001; 93.8 [87.5 to 93.8] vs. 87.5 [81.3 to 93.8], P  = 0.01, respectively. No differences in the patients' preoperative anxiety and satisfaction levels were found. RESULTS Stand-alone video education led to higher Rotterdam Anaesthesia Knowledge Questionnaire scores than face-to-face education on day 0: median [IQR], 87.5 [81.3 to 93.8] vs. 81.3 [68.8 to 87.5], P  < 0.001. Combined education in the "Video & Anaesthesiologist" group led to better knowledge retention compared with both the "Anaesthesiologist" group and the Video group: 93.8 [87.5 to 93.8] vs. 81.3 [68.8 to 87.5], P  < 0.001; 93.8 [87.5 to 93.8] vs. 87.5 [81.3 to 93.8], P  = 0.01, respectively. No differences in the patients' preoperative anxiety and satisfaction levels were found.Compared with face-to-face education by an anaesthesiologist, stand-alone video and combined video education improve short-term knowledge retention, without increasing patient anxiety. CONCLUSION Compared with face-to-face education by an anaesthesiologist, stand-alone video and combined video education improve short-term knowledge retention, without increasing patient anxiety.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05188547.

Abstract: Just-A-Minute Clinical Pearls as a microlearning concept may be beneficial in enhancing optometry and ophthalmology practice globally. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Just-A-Minute Clinical Pearls as a microlearning concept may be beneficial in enhancing optometry and ophthalmology practice globally.Medical education often witnesses a gap in effectively translating the learnings into clinical practice, pointing to the complex and traditional teaching methods as hindrances. The present work studied the usefulness and acceptability of Just-A-Minute Optometry Clinical Pearls, a micro-learning tool, among optometrists and ophthalmologists. BACKGROUND Medical education often witnesses a gap in effectively translating the learnings into clinical practice, pointing to the complex and traditional teaching methods as hindrances. The present work studied the usefulness and acceptability of Just-A-Minute Optometry Clinical Pearls, a micro-learning tool, among optometrists and ophthalmologists.Just-A-Minute Optometry clinical pearls were developed by the optometry team of LV Prasad Eye Institute and shared (via email) among optometrists and ophthalmologists on a daily basis between June 2021 to May 2022. In the middle of the project, the recipients were invited to participate in an online survey. The variables studied included frequency of checking clinical pearls, simplicity of their content, grasping speed, most used subspeciality pearls, knowledge gain and retention, practice applicability, overall learning experience, and the likelihood of recommending it to a friend. METHODS Just-A-Minute Optometry clinical pearls were developed by the optometry team of LV Prasad Eye Institute and shared (via email) among optometrists and ophthalmologists on a daily basis between June 2021 to May 2022. In the middle of the project, the recipients were invited to participate in an online survey. The variables studied included frequency of checking clinical pearls, simplicity of their content, grasping speed, most used subspeciality pearls, knowledge gain and retention, practice applicability, overall learning experience, and the likelihood of recommending it to a friend.Among 150 respondents, 103 (68.7%) were ophthalmologists, and 46 (30.7%) were optometrists. The majority were from private ( n  = 64, 42.7%) and institutional ( n  = 48, 32%) practices, with 102 (68.4%) having more than five years and 21 (14%) having 2-5 years of experience. About 115 (77%) respondents checked clinical pearls every day, 147 (99%) found the format easy, and 131 (88%) could grasp the content within one minute. They felt that JAM-OCP 'always' enhanced clinical knowledge ( n  = 108, 72%) and clinical applicability ( n  = 82, 55%) and helped in knowledge retention ( n  = 123, 84%). The responses to the clinical application significantly varied (Chi-square tests) among subgroups of education qualification ( p  < 0.001) and practice types ( p  < 0.03). RESULTS Among 150 respondents, 103 (68.7%) were ophthalmologists, and 46 (30.7%) were optometrists.

Abstract: The "Child health card" (CHC) is integral to monitoring a child's growth and assessing development to support the early detection of malnutrition and prompt intervention. CHC is also valuable in keeping track of a child's vaccinations. There are limited studies on knowledge and utilization of CHC in Oyo state, Nigeria. We therefore aimed to assess caregiver's knowledge, retention, and utilization of child health cards in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. Background The "Child health card" (CHC) is integral to monitoring a child's growth and assessing development to support the early detection of malnutrition and prompt intervention. CHC is also valuable in keeping track of a child's vaccinations. There are limited studies on knowledge and utilization of CHC in Oyo state, Nigeria. We therefore aimed to assess caregiver's knowledge, retention, and utilization of child health cards in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria.A community-based mixed-method study using a parallel convergent design was employed. Quantitative data were collected from 617 caregivers at their compounds in the selected communities using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Qualitative data were collected by interviewing caregivers and healthcare workers at health facilities. Bivariate analysis of quantitative indicators and thematic analysis of qualitative interviews were conducted. Methods A community-based mixed-method study using a parallel convergent design was employed. Quantitative data were collected from 617 caregivers at their compounds in the selected communities using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Qualitative data were collected by interviewing caregivers and healthcare workers at health facilities. Bivariate analysis of quantitative indicators and thematic analysis of qualitative interviews were conducted.Caregiver knowledge of the CHC, including the contents of the CHC and growth charts, was poor, but retention was relatively high (69.6%). Retention of the CHC was higher among caregivers whose index child was <12 months (p=0.011) and among those with good knowledge of the CHC (p<0.001). Being employed (p=0.016), having tertiary education (p=0.027), having good knowledge (p<0.001), and good perception of the CHC (p=0.001) were positively associated with the utilization of CHC. We found that when caregivers failed to present the card at immunization clinics, they often faced verbal reprimands from healthcare workers, and in some cases, their child's vaccination was denied. Results Caregiver knowledge of the CHC, including the contents of the CHC and growth charts, was poor, but retention was relatively high (69.6%). Retention of the CHC was higher among caregivers whose index child was <12 months (p=0.011) and among those with good knowledge of the CHC (p<0.001). Being employed (p=0.016), having tertiary education (p=0.027), having good knowledge (p<0.001), and good perception of the CHC (p=0.001) were positively associated with the utilization of CHC. We found that when caregivers failed to present the card at immunization clinics, they often faced verbal reprimands from healthcare workers, and in some cases, their child's vaccination was denied.CHC retention was high despite low utilization by caregivers. Therefore, interventions designed to improve community awareness of the CHC could provide an opportunity to improve the use of child health cards in this setting. Conclusion CHC retention was high despite low utilization by caregivers. Therefore, interventions designed to improve community awareness of the CHC could provide an opportunity to improve the use of child health cards in this setting.

Abstract: Background/Objectives : Informed consent is a crucial part of the clinical trial enrollment process in which patients are asked to understand and provide approval for medical interventions. Consent forms can be complex and hinder patient comprehension, highlighting the need for novel tools to improve the patient enrollment experience. This feasibility study aimed to develop an immersive technology to enroll human subjects in oncology clinical trials and provide 3D avatar-based informed consent in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Methods : Clinical feasibility and the effects of head-mounted VR devices on motion sickness and educational quality were evaluated in adult oncology patients enrolled in an intravenous (IV) port placement intervention study. Participants received before- and after-questionnaires to measure their understanding of the information received in VR. A follow-up questionnaire was given four weeks post-consent to measure knowledge retention. Results : Clinical staff reported that VR technology was manageable to use. Among 16 adult participants, all reported that VR was well tolerated with no motion sickness. The mean pre-intervention knowledge score was 64.6%, with an immediate post-intervention knowledge score of 97.9%. A mean knowledge score of 93.3% four-weeks post-consent was observed among 10/16 participants who completed a follow-up questionnaire. Conclusions : These findings support that VR is well tolerated and effective at delivering information during the informed consent process for oncology clinical trials. Key limitations include the small sample size and single clinical population. Further trials are warranted to compare efficacy over traditional consenting mechanisms and include more diverse clinical populations among a wider participant pool.Background/Objectives: Informed consent is a crucial part of the clinical trial enrollment process in which patients are asked to understand and provide approval for medical interventions.

Abstract: Medical training is traditionally divided into theoretical and clinical studies, but more and more medical schools are now offering an integrated curriculum that brings the two closer together. The solid theoretical knowledge acquisition is of paramount importance as it provides the basis for clinical subjects and, after graduation, for everyday clinical thinking and decision-making. Research has shown that students’ knowledge of theoretical subjects after university examinations can be significantly reduced, leading to difficulties in completing clinical studies and even in medical practice. Previous studies suggest that students forget approximately a third to a quarter of what they have learned in a year. However, the extent of forgetting in individual studies varies widely from discipline to discipline. Teaching methods and learning strategies that support active learning – such as retrieval practice and spaced repetition – have been shown to be effective in promoting long-term knowledge retention. Emphasizing the clinical relevance of theoretical material, taking steps towards an integrated curriculum can also contribute to deeper understanding and long-term knowledge retention. The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive overview of the scientific findings on the long-term knowledge retention of medical students and to provide insights into the field of effective learning and teaching strategies that have been shown to be effective among medical students. The implementation of these strategies could help to improve medical education.

Abstract: During their return trip, she presented with the episodes of dizziness with dyspnoea, slight palpitations on the exertion and the brief loss of knowledge, leading to the request for further examination in emergency room. Medical treatment with diltiazem then brought from home was continued.During hospitalisation, increased withdrawal from inhaled nitrous-oxide and non-invasive ventilation resulted in a severe PAH attack (rebound effect); which caused cardiocircumstantial decompensation and asystolia. Due to the doubt raised by her parents to the quality of preparation of diltiazem received before their departure on vacation, an analysis of the capsules mixture revealed that the capsules contained 10mg of diltiazem instead of 100mg (preparation error leading to underdosing); indicating that initially 100mg three times a day and then 200mg three times a day were supposed to be given after hospitalisation; whereas the capsules contained 10mg of diltiazem were administered, which was brought from home.

Abstract: Smartphone applications are increasingly used in medical and dental education, offering flexible and interactive learning opportunities. In medicine, these tools enhance knowledge retention, clinical decision-making, and patient care. BACKGROUND Smartphone applications are increasingly used in medical and dental education, offering flexible and interactive learning opportunities. In medicine, these tools enhance knowledge retention, clinical decision-making, and patient care.This review aims to evaluate the role of smartphone applications in endodontic education, assessing their quality, functionality, perceived impact, usability, and impact on learning outcomes. OBJECTIVE This review aims to evaluate the role of smartphone applications in endodontic education, assessing their quality, functionality, perceived impact, usability, and impact on learning outcomes.A systematic search of the App Store, Google Play, PubMed, and Scopus was conducted to identify relevant applications. The quality assessment of the apps was performed through heuristic evaluation and the uMARS tool. The Inclusion criteria focused on apps designed for endodontic education and clinical practice. METHODS A systematic search of the App Store, Google Play, PubMed, and Scopus was conducted to identify relevant applications. The quality assessment of the apps was performed through heuristic evaluation and the uMARS tool. The Inclusion criteria focused on apps designed for endodontic education and clinical practice.From 350 records, 9 applications met the criteria. The heuristic rating for all apps was low to medium, except for Endolit, which demonstrated severe usability issues. Dental Endo Master received the best mean score in the uMARS rating. The selected applications offer diverse functionalities, including educational tools (EndoPrep, Endo Lit, Dental Endo Master, Adat Endodontic Cram Cards, Tooth SOS, Injured Tooth, AcciDent), diagnostic aids (Endo10), and case difficulty assessments (AAE Endo Case). Most apps were available on Android and iOS, with ratings ranging from 4.2/5 to 5/5. RESULTS From 350 records, 9 applications met the criteria. The heuristic rating for all apps was low to medium, except for Endolit, which demonstrated severe usability issues. Dental Endo Master received the best mean score in the uMARS rating. The selected applications offer diverse functionalities, including educational tools (EndoPrep, Endo Lit, Dental Endo Master, Adat Endodontic Cram Cards, Tooth SOS, Injured Tooth, AcciDent), diagnostic aids (Endo10), and case difficulty assessments (AAE Endo Case). Most apps were available on Android and iOS, with ratings ranging from 4.2/5 to 5/5.This study highlights the growing role of smartphone applications in endodontics, particularly in education, clinical support, and patient guidance. While these apps offer interactive learning and diagnostic assistance, their quality varies due to differences in developer expertise, usability, and regulatory oversight. Some excel in engagement and functionality, while others require improvements in customization and accessibility. Ensuring evidence-based development, standardized evaluations, and user-centered design is essential for maximizing their impact on dental education and clinical practice. DISCUSSION This study highlights the growing role of smartphone applications in endodontics, particularly in education, clinical support, and patient guidance. While these apps offer interactive learning and diagnostic assistance, their quality varies due to differences in developer expertise, usability, and regulatory oversight. Some excel in engagement and functionality, while others require improvements in customization and accessibility. Ensuring evidence-based development, standardized evaluations, and user-centered design is essential for maximizing their impact on dental education and clinical practice.Smartphone applications have transformative potential in endodontic education, enabling flexible learning and improved clinical skills. However, challenges such as inconsistent quality and limited validation require attention. CONCLUSION Smartphone applications have transformative potential in endodontic education, enabling flexible learning and improved clinical skills. However, challenges such as inconsistent quality and limited validation require attention.No formal registration was required for this narrative review.

Abstract: Mexico is one of the countries with the highest cultural, biological, and agrobiological diversity. However, an accelerated process of ancestral knowledge loss, related to the management of agrobiodiversity, native seeds, and other edible plant species management is affecting food sovereignty. This process of knowledge loss was documented at the Ñäñho region, of southern Querétaro, where our study took place. Our objective was to document the diversity of edible plant diversity, management, and use as well as the agroecosystems from which they are obtained. BACKGROUND Mexico is one of the countries with the highest cultural, biological, and agrobiological diversity. However, an accelerated process of ancestral knowledge loss, related to the management of agrobiodiversity, native seeds, and other edible plant species management is affecting food sovereignty. This process of knowledge loss was documented at the Ñäñho region, of southern Querétaro, where our study took place. Our objective was to document the diversity of edible plant diversity, management, and use as well as the agroecosystems from which they are obtained.Semi-structured interviews were conducted over 2 years (2021-2023) with 50 informants selected through a snowball sampling. Informal interviews and participant observations were also used with these and other people from the same community. Herbarium specimens and seed accessions were collected and photographed. METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted over 2 years (2021-2023) with 50 informants selected through a snowball sampling. Informal interviews and participant observations were also used with these and other people from the same community. Herbarium specimens and seed accessions were collected and photographed.In total, 119 edible plant species were identified. The richest families were Solanaceae, Rosaceae, Cactaceae, and Asteraceae. The edible species occur in 11 agroecosystems with 58.6% of the species native to Mexico, and 41.4% introduced. The orchard, rustic greenhouse, house "milpa," mountain hill, and backyard, have the highest species diversity. The main management types were sowing and gathering plants. Eighty-five plant names were recorded in the Hñäñho language. The plant parts used were fruits (60.5%) and stems (46.2%). The gastronomic categories with the highest species percentage were stews, beverages, and refreshments, while the highest species number used in the gastronomic categories were cacti stalks or "nopales" (Opuntia spp.), maize (Zea mays), and amaranth (Amaranthus spp.).

The plants, local knowledge documentation, and species management provide the basis for promoting projects focused on the Ñäñho biocultural wealth. Efforts are needed to encourage the least represented regional species. Community development programs are needed for food security and sovereignty; these are based on the local biocultural resources.

Abstract: With diabetes reaching epidemic proportions globally, it is imperative to increase the number of providers equipped to screen, educate, and help patients achieve glycemic control. This study evaluated the long-term results of student pharmacists attending a first-year Diabetes Self-Care Education Program (DSEP) by measuring knowledge retention, confidence, and clinical applicability of skills learned over time. The DSEP, integrated into the early pharmacy curriculum, is a 9-h training program made up of interactive lectures, glucose monitoring assignments, and active-learning workshops. Following DSEP training, two cohorts of first-year student pharmacists were surveyed annually for 3 and 5 years to assess knowledge retention, confidence, and clinical use of the DSEP content in their practice sites. By the year 1 follow-up survey, the response rate from the pre-survey period for cohort 1 was 88% and 78% for cohort 2; over time, the response rate decreased. For the long-term follow-up surveys, cohort 1 (5 years) and cohort 2 (3 years) demonstrated overall significantly improved sustained knowledge of diabetes (48% higher average test score, p < 0.001), perceived confidence, and clinical ability (over 60% and 76% increases from baseline, p < 0.001). Within 12 months of completing the DSEP, about two-thirds of students applied their training to assist patients with diabetes and their caregivers. Long-term, participants in both cohorts reported educating and screening over 22,000 patients with diabetes and caregivers in multiple clinical settings over 3 years and 5 years, respectively, following DSEP training. The positive impact of improved knowledge, confidence, and clinical applicability of the DSEP training obtained by student pharmacists was sustained for 3 or more years, impacting thousands of patients with diabetes and caregivers. Considering the growing global diabetes epidemic, pharmacy schools around the world should consider implementing an early DSEP program.With diabetes reaching epidemic proportions globally, it is imperative to increase the number of providers equipped to screen, educate, and help patients achieve glycemic control.

Abstract: Aim: The aim of this quality improvement project was to provide multisession trainings that teach the fundamentals of motivational interviewing (MI) to inpatient behavioral health care workers who lack education and proficiency in these techniques. Background: MI is a therapeutic communication approach that explores a person's mixed feelings or ambivalence and aims to encourage a positive behavior change. It was first developed for patients struggling with substance use disorders to assist them in making decisions regarding their sobriety. Methods: Participants attended three 2-hour MI educational sessions, which spanned 6 weeks. Instruction was through an interactive online module. After each educational session, participants engaged in role-play scenarios. Participants received ratings on their adherence to MI skills. Prior to the first and following the last educational session, participants completed an anonymous online survey to measure individual knowledge of MI fundamentals. Results: Through role-play adherence ratings, MI consistent fundamental skills, such as open-ended questions and reflective statements, demonstrated proficiency. The remaining MI consistent fundamental skills, MI style or spirit, and affirmations did not reach proficiency. MI consistent complex skills did not reach proficiency but did progressively increase in adherence. MI inconsistent skills that should be avoided all met adherence proficiency, other than close-ended questions. Conclusion: This quality improvement training demonstrated that through multiple internet-based educational sessions and role-play scenarios, proficiency in two MI consistent fundamental skills and knowledge increased. Continued efforts to create more educational and practical opportunities for knowledge retention are encouraged.Aim: The aim of this quality improvement project was to provide multisession trainings that teach the fundamentals of motivational interviewing (MI) to inpatient behavioral health care workers who lack education and proficiency in these techniques.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents novel approaches to enhance motivation, curriculum structure and development, and learning and retrieval processes for both learners and instructors. Though a focus for this emerging technology is academic misconduct, we sought to leverage GenAI in curriculum structure to facilitate educational outcomes. For instructors, GenAI offers new opportunities in course design and management while reducing time requirements to evaluate outcomes and personalizing learner feedback. These include innovative instructional designs such as flipped classrooms and gamification, enriching teaching methodologies with focused and interactive approaches, and team-based exercise development among others. For learners, GenAI offers unprecedented self-directed learning opportunities, improved cognitive engagement, and effective retrieval practices, leading to enhanced autonomy, motivation, and knowledge retention. Though empowering, this evolving landscape has integration challenges and ethical considerations, including accuracy, technological evolution, loss of learner's voice, and socioeconomic disparities. Our experience demonstrates that the responsible application of GenAI's in educational settings will revolutionize learning practices, making education more accessible and tailored, producing positive motivational outcomes for both learners and instructors. Thus, we argue that leveraging GenAI in educational settings will improve outcomes with implications extending from primary through higher and continuing education paradigms.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping medical education by enhancing learning strategies, improving training efficiency, and offering personalized educational experiences. Traditional teaching methods, such as classroom lectures and clinical apprenticeships, face numerous challenges, including information overload, teaching quality variability, and standardisation difficulties. AI presents innovative, data-driven, and adaptive solutions to overcome these limitations, making medical training more effective and engaging. This study explores how AI can be applied in the field of medical education, also focusing on personalized learning, virtual simulations, assessment methods, and curriculum development. Additionally, it examines the challenges and ethical concerns surrounding AI integration in medical training. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to analyze various AI-driven advancements in medical education. The study delves into adaptive learning platforms, AI-powered simulations, automated assessments, and chatbot-assisted learning. It also reviews recent technological developments to assess AI's impact on medical training and its future potential. AI enhances medical education by tailoring learning experiences to individual student performance, thereby improving knowledge retention and engagement. Virtual simulations and augmented reality provide immersive, hands-on training in a safe environment. Automated assessments facilitate efficient evaluation by offering instant feedback and grading, while AI-driven chatbots assist students in self-directed learning and clinical decision-making. Additionally, AI aids in developing dynamic, data-driven curricula that evolve with the latest medical advancements. However, concerns about data privacy, bias in various AI algorithms, over-reliance on technology, and accessibility disparities must be addressed. AI revolutionises medical education by fostering efficiency, interactivity, and personalized learning. However, its responsible implementation requires addressing ethical and logistical challenges. Future research should focus on ensuring AI fairness, equitable access, and integration with immersive technologies to optimize medical training further.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to investigate the extent to which pedagogical diversity contributes to learning consolidation by analyzing the interaction between neurobiological, motivational, and environmental factors in knowledge retention. Theoretical Framework: Pedagogical diversity in strategies and environment plays a crucial role in the acquisition and solidification of learning, considering the uniqueness of each individual. However, balancing novelty and repetition is essential for the brain to organize and consolidate learning. The brain learns effectively when challenged by novelty, but it also requires repetition to memorize and reinforce what has been learned. While novelty motivates the brain to explore new connections, repetition is crucial for strengthening learning, transforming new knowledge into something more lasting and automatic. Method: The study adopted a qualitative approach based on a literature review. Sources such as scientific articles in education and neuroscience were analyzed to describe or discuss the findings related to the researched topic. Results and Discussion: nderstanding the neurological mechanisms involved in the process from interest in learning to retrieving learned content when necessary is fundamental for both teachers and learners. However, diversity alone does not guarantee knowledge consolidation. For learning to be effectively and durably established, itis necessary to follow a path that involves habituation and sensitization training, allowing new neural connections to be reinforced and integrated into the cognitive repertoire. Thus, the study found that diversity acts as a catalyst in the learning process when combined with strategies that promote knowledge retention and applicability. Research Implications: Certain considerations for analysis and improvement are projected for contemporary teaching, based on the structure and concepts outlined by the authors and reference works addressing the topic under discussion. Originality and Value: This study encourages reflection on the relevance of pedagogical diversity in different learning environments, alongside the selection of strategies that favor neuroplasticity, motivation, and cognitive consolidation, ultimately contributing to the formation of more capable individuals. Alternate abstract: Objetivo: Este estudo busca investigar até que ponto a diversidade pedagógica resulta na consolidação do aprendizado, analisando a interação entre fatores neurobiológicos, motivacionais e ambientais na retenção do conhecimento. Referencial Teórico: A diversidade pedagógica nas estratégias e no ambiente são importantes no processo de aquisição e solidificação da aprendizagem considerando a singularidade de cada sujeito. Todavia, o equilíbrio entre novidade e repetição é importante para o cérebro organizar e consolidar o aprendizado. O cérebro aprende muito bem quando é desafiado pela novidade, mas também precisa de repeticdo para memorizar e reforcar aquilo que foi aprendido. Enquanto a novidade motiva o cérebro para explorar novas conexões, a repetição é crucial para reforçar tal aprendizado, transformar о conhecimento novo em algo mais duradouro e automático. Método: O estudo adotou uma abordagem qualitativa, baseada em revisão bibliográfica. Foram analisadas fontes como artigos científicos da educação e neurociências, com o objetivo de descrever ou discutir os achados do tema pesquisado. Resultados e Discussão: A ciência dos mecanismos envolvidos no processo neurológico desde o interesse ao aprender até o resgate do aprendido quando necessário é fundamental tanto para quem está ensinando como para quem está aprendendo. No entanto, a diversidade por si só não garante a consolidação do conhecimento. Para que o aprendizado se estabeleça de forma efetiva e duradoura, é necessário percorrer um caminho que envolva treinos de habituação e sensibilização, permitindo que novas conexões neurais sejam reforçadas e integradas ao repertório cognitivo. Dessa forma, o trabalho observou que a diversidade atua como um catalisador do processo de aprendizagem aliada a estratégias que promovam a retenção e a aplicabilidade do conhecimento. Implicações da Pesquisa: Para o ensino atual projetam-se certas considerações passíveis de análise e aperfeiçoamento, fundamentadas na estrutura e nos conceitos delineados pelos autores e obras de referência que abordam a temática em discussão. Originalidade e Valor: Este estudo provoca uma reflexão sobre a relevância da diversidade pedagógica em cada ambiente concomitante a escolha de estratégias favoráveis para a neuroplasticidade, motivação e consolidação cognitiva que levam a formação de indivíduos mais capacitados. Alternate abstract: Objetivo: Este estudio busca investigar en qué medida la diversidad pedagógica contribuye a la consolidación del aprendizaje mediante el análisis de la interacción entre factores neurobiológicos, motivacionales y ambientales en la retención del conocimiento. Marco teórico: La diversidad pedagógica en estrategias y entornos desempefia un papel crucial en la adquisicion y consolidación del aprendizaje, considerando la singularidad de cada individuo. Sin embargo, equilibrar la novedad y la repetición es esencial para que el cerebro organice y consolide el aprendizaje. El cerebro aprende eficazmente cuando se enfrenta a la novedad, pero también requiere la repetición para memorizar y reforzar lo aprendido. Si bien la novedad motiva al cerebro a explorar nuevas conexiones, la repetición es crucial para fortalecer el aprendizaje, transformando el nuevo conocimiento en algo más duradero y automático. Método: El estudio adoptó un enfoque cualitativo basado en una revisión bibliográfica. Se analizaron fuentes como artículos científicos sobre educación y neurociencia para describir o discutir los hallazgos relacionados con el tema investigado. Resultados y Discusión: Comprender los mecanismos neurológicos que intervienen en el proceso, desde el interés por aprender hasta la recuperación del contenido aprendido cuando es necesario, es fundamental tanto para docentes como para estudiantes. Sin embargo, la diversidad por sí sola no garantiza la consolidación del conocimiento. Para que el aprendizaje se establezca de forma efectiva y duradera, es necesario seguir un proceso que incluya entrenamiento de habituación y sensibilización, lo que permite reforzar e integrar nuevas conexiones neuronales en el repertorio cognitivo. Así, el estudio concluyó que la diversidad actúa como catalizador en el proceso de aprendizaje cuando se combina con estrategias que promueven la retención y la aplicabilidad del conocimiento. Implicaciones de la Investigación: Se proyectan ciertas consideraciones para el análisis y la mejora de la docencia contemporánea, basadas en la estructura y los conceptos expuestos por los autores y las obras de referencia que abordan el tema en cuestión. Originalidad y Valor: Este estudio fomenta la reflexión sobre la relevancia de la diversidad pedagógica en diferentes entornos de aprendizaje, junto con la selección de estrategias que favorezcan la neuroplasticidad, la motivación y la consolidación cognitiva, contribuyendo en última instancia a la formación de individuos más capaces.

Abstract: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality in low resource settings. Prompt diagnosis and correct management improves outcomes. To improve clinician knowledge and confidence in DKA management, we designed a novel curriculum for training local clinicians in a low-resource setting. This curriculum aligned to international guidelines, adapted for local resources. Our aim was to assess if the curriculum improved clinician knowledge and confidence. BACKGROUND Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality in low resource settings. Prompt diagnosis and correct management improves outcomes. To improve clinician knowledge and confidence in DKA management, we designed a novel curriculum for training local clinicians in a low-resource setting. This curriculum aligned to international guidelines, adapted for local resources. Our aim was to assess if the curriculum improved clinician knowledge and confidence.Participants included physicians and nurses in the Emergency Department (ED) at a tertiary academic center in Nairobi, Kenya. Participants completed pre/post-tests of knowledge, which permitted prospective curriculum evaluation based on the second level Kirkpatrick hierarchy, knowledge retention. The cases focused on local evidence-based DKA management pathways. They were delivered using novel in-person with virtual (recorded) teaching techniques, permitting both conventional and independent learning. Outcome measures related to knowledge improvement were analyzed using independent t-tests; clinician confidence was assessed via self-reported survey and analyzed using descriptive statistics. METHODS Participants included physicians and nurses in the Emergency Department (ED) at a tertiary academic center in Nairobi, Kenya. Participants completed pre/post-tests of knowledge, which permitted prospective curriculum evaluation based on the second level Kirkpatrick hierarchy, knowledge retention. The cases focused on local evidence-based DKA management pathways. They were delivered using novel in-person with virtual (recorded) teaching techniques, permitting both conventional and independent learning. Outcome measures related to knowledge improvement were analyzed using independent t-tests; clinician confidence was assessed via self-reported survey and analyzed using descriptive statistics.125 clinicians (79.8% nurses and 20.2% physicians) completed pre-training assessment; 104 completed post-training assessment. Prior to training, 53.6% of all trainees reported that they were "highly confident" compared with 61.5% of all trainees post-training (p=0.16). Post-training, there were statistically significant increases in knowledge scores related to DKA diagnosis (14% increase, p=0.03), electrolyte management (41% increase, p<0.0001), fluid administration (28% increase, p=0.01) and insulin administration (24% increase, p=0.01). There was a significant increase in overall clinician knowledge scores with 34.4% (n=43) attaining a knowledge score of 7 or above correct responses out of the 10 cases presented pre-training versus 65.4% n=68 post-training (p<0.0001). RESULTS 125 clinicians (79.8% nurses and 20.2% physicians) completed pre-training assessment; 104 completed post-training assessment.

Future research is underway to evaluate clinical practice changes and patient care outcomes related to this improved knowledge. CONCLUSION Our pretest-posttest results demonstrate that our DKA management course improved clinical knowledge among physicians and nurses working in low-resource ED.

Abstract: ENG English ENG This study investigated the effects of an educational program involving human-dolphin interactions at a zoo on visitors' conservation caring, behavioral intentions, and knowledge retention. A total of 412 adult zoo visitors participated in this study. Through an experimental design (n = 224 pre-intervention) with a control group (n = 83) and a treatment group (n = 105; exposed to information about the critically endangered Vaquita), the research aimed to assess the program's influence on fostering pro-conservation attitudes and actions. Additionally, a follow-up survey five months after the intervention evaluated the longitudinal effects. The Conservation Caring Scale, adapted from previous studies, measured participants' cognitive, affective, and behavioral components related to wildlife. The findings revealed that while the program successfully conveyed knowledge about dolphin conservation status, its impact on increasing conservation caring and behavioral intentions was limited. Incorporating information about the Vaquita raised awareness but did not significantly influence overall conservation caring or behavioral intent. Follow-up results indicated a decline to baseline levels in conservation caring scores over time, suggesting the need for developing more comprehensive and longitudinal approaches to promote pro-conservation mindsets and actions among zoo visitors. Implications for optimizing educational interventions and cultivating broader conservation commitments in zoo visitors are discussed.

Abstract: Stroke treatment has significantly improved over the last decades, but the complexity of stroke cases requires specialized care through dedicated teams with specific knowledge and training. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), widely used to assess neurological deficits and make treatment decisions, is reliable but requires specific training and certification. The traditional didactic training method, based on a video, may not adequately address certain NIHSS intricacies nor engage health care professionals (HCPs) in continuous learning, leading to suboptimal proficiency. In the context of time-constrained clinical settings, highly interactive e-learning could be a promising alternative for NIHSS knowledge acquisition and retention. BACKGROUND Stroke treatment has significantly improved over the last decades, but the complexity of stroke cases requires specialized care through dedicated teams with specific knowledge and training. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), widely used to assess neurological deficits and make treatment decisions, is reliable but requires specific training and certification. The traditional didactic training method, based on a video, may not adequately address certain NIHSS intricacies nor engage health care professionals (HCPs) in continuous learning, leading to suboptimal proficiency. In the context of time-constrained clinical settings, highly interactive e-learning could be a promising alternative for NIHSS knowledge acquisition and retention.This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a highly interactive e-learning module compared with a traditional didactic video in improving NIHSS knowledge among previously trained HCPs. Furthermore, its impact on knowledge retention was also assessed. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a highly interactive e-learning module compared with a traditional didactic video in improving NIHSS knowledge among previously trained HCPs. Furthermore, its impact on knowledge retention was also assessed.A prospective, multicentric, triple-blind, and web-based randomized controlled trial was conducted in 3 Swiss university hospitals, involving HCPs previously trained in NIHSS. Invitations were sent through email, and participants were randomized to either the e-learning or traditional didactic video group through a fully automated process upon self-registration on the website. A 50-question quiz was administered before and after exposure to the training method, and scores were compared to assess knowledge acquisition. The quiz was repeated after 1 month to evaluate retention. Subjective assessments of learning methods that is, user satisfaction, probability of recommendation, perceived difficulty, and perception of duration, were also collected through a Likert-scale questionnaire. A sample size of 72 participants were deemed necessary to have an 80% chance of detecting a difference of 2 points in the postcourse quiz between groups at the 5% significance level.

A sample size of 72 participants were deemed necessary to have an 80% chance of detecting a difference of 2 points in the postcourse quiz between groups at the 5% significance level.Invitations to participate were sent through email to an estimated 325 HCPs. 174 HCPs enrolled in the study, of which 97 completed the study course. Both learning methods significantly improved NIHSS knowledge, with an improvement of 3.2 (range 2.0-4.3) points in the e-learning group and of 2.1 (1.2-3.1) points in the video group. However, the e-learning group performed better, with higher scores in knowledge acquisition (median score 39.0, IQR 36.0-41.0 vs 37, IQR 34.0-39.0; P=.03) and in knowledge retention (mean score 38.2, 95% CI 36.7-39.7 vs 35.8, 95% CI 34.8-36.8; P=.007). Participants in the e-learning group were more likely to recommend the learning method (77% vs 49%, P=.02), while no significant difference was found for satisfaction (P=.17), perceived duration (P=.17), and difficulty (P=.32).

CONCLUSIONS A highly interactive e-learning module was found to be an effective asynchronous method for NIHSS knowledge acquisition and retention in previously NIHSS-trained HCPs, and may now be considered for inclusion in NIHSS training programs for HCPs.RR2-10.3390/healthcare9111460.

Abstract: Sepsis is one of the most challenging and complex clinical states, with persistently high mortality rates. Guidelines recommend the early identification of sepsis patients and immediate initiation of the Hour-1 Bundle treatment to reduce mortality from sepsis. Emergency nurses play a vital role in the early screening of sepsis. Studies indicate that mind mapping and In-Situ Simulation (ISS) training not only aid healthcare professionals in reinforcing theoretical knowledge retention but also enhance skills in coordination, task management, and communication during simulation exercises. This, in turn, promotes the effective implementation of various treatments during resuscitation. The combination of theoretical and practical training methods is more effective than a single training approach. In June 2023, our hospital's emergency department conducted training for emergency nurses on sepsis mind mapping combined with ISS.

OBJECTIVE To explore the effect of mind mapping combined with ISS training in promoting the emergency nurses' implementation of the Hour-1 Bundle in sepsis patients.Using mind mapping and ISS training methods, 24 emergency nurses were divided into 6 groups for a 12-week training period. The study compared their pre- and post-training knowledge of sepsis, identification and diagnostic time, Hour-1 Bundle treatment completion rate, and non-technical skill scores. Post-training, the emergency nurses evaluated the effectiveness of the training. METHODS Using mind mapping and ISS training methods, 24 emergency nurses were divided into 6 groups for a 12-week training period. The study compared their pre- and post-training knowledge of sepsis, identification and diagnostic time, Hour-1 Bundle treatment completion rate, and non-technical skill scores. Post-training, the emergency nurses evaluated the effectiveness of the training.The scores for sepsis knowledge among emergency nurses before and after training were 44.17 ± 9.21 and 60.42 ± 5.29, respectively. The identification and diagnostic times (hours) were 0.63 ± 0.18 and 0.49 ± 0.13, respectively. The Hour-1 Bundle treatment completion rates were 58.33% and 85.7%, respectively. There was a significant increase in all non-technical skill scores, with statistical significance (P < 0.05, P < 0.001). After two ISS trainings, the SET-M scores progressively increased, indicating a high satisfaction rate among nurses with the mind mapping and ISS training. RESULTS The scores for sepsis knowledge among emergency nurses before and after training were 44.17 ± 9.21 and 60.42 ± 5.29, respectively. The identification and diagnostic times (hours) were 0.63 ± 0.18 and 0.49 ± 0.13, respectively. The Hour-1 Bundle treatment completion rates were 58.33% and 85.7%, respectively. There was a significant increase in all non-technical skill scores, with statistical significance (P < 0.05, P < 0.001). After two ISS trainings, the SET-M scores progressively increased, indicating a high satisfaction rate among nurses with the mind mapping and ISS training.The combination of mind mapping and ISS training enables emergency nurses to identify sepsis earlier and promotes the effective implementation of the Hour-1 Bundle treatment in sepsis patients, while also enhancing their cognitive understanding of sepsis and non-technical skills. CONCLUSION The combination of mind mapping and ISS training enables emergency nurses to identify sepsis earlier and promotes the effective implementation of the Hour-1 Bundle treatment in sepsis patients, while also enhancing their cognitive understanding of sepsis and non-technical skills.

Abstract: To investigate long-term effectiveness of immersive virtual reality (VR) compared with traditional learning methods in a radiography education program through a comparative longitudinal analysis. PURPOSE To investigate long-term effectiveness of immersive virtual reality (VR) compared with traditional learning methods in a radiography education program through a comparative longitudinal analysis.For 3 years, educational outcomes, such as student engagement and knowledge retention, were assessed to determine the effects of hybrid simulation methods incorporating immersive VR. The study used Virtual Medical Coaching's X-Ray Pro VR software to integrate VR into the curriculum. METHODS For 3 years, educational outcomes, such as student engagement and knowledge retention, were assessed to determine the effects of hybrid simulation methods incorporating immersive VR. The study used Virtual Medical Coaching's X-Ray Pro VR software to integrate VR into the curriculum.The data and graphical analyses substantiate the effectiveness of the hybrid learning model over traditional physical methods in terms of academic and practical performance metrics, affective measures, and career preparedness. Students using a hybrid of VR and physical simulations had significantly higher mean posttest scores, mean practical exam scores, career readiness, internship performance, mean motivation level, and mean engagement level compared with the students who only used physical simulation machines (P < .001). RESULTS The data and graphical analyses substantiate the effectiveness of the hybrid learning model over traditional physical methods in terms of academic and practical performance metrics, affective measures, and career preparedness. Students using a hybrid of VR and physical simulations had significantly higher mean posttest scores, mean practical exam scores, career readiness, internship performance, mean motivation level, and mean engagement level compared with the students who only used physical simulation machines (P < .001).The significant improvements in student engagement and retention observed in this study suggest that VR can effectively address some of the limitations of traditional learning methods. The immersive nature of VR might provide a more engaging and interactive learning environment, leading to better educational outcomes. These findings support the potential for VR to be a valuable tool in higher education, particularly in fields that benefit from simulation-based training. However, further research is needed to explore the practical challenges of implementing VR at scale and to evaluate its effectiveness across various educational disciplines. DISCUSSION The significant improvements in student engagement and retention observed in this study suggest that VR can effectively address some of the limitations of traditional learning methods.

These findings support the potential for VR to be a valuable tool in higher education, particularly in fields that benefit from simulation-based training. However, further research is needed to explore the practical challenges of implementing VR at scale and to evaluate its effectiveness across various educational disciplines.This study uniquely contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence of the sustained benefits of VR in educational settings, highlighting its potential to transform learning experiences and outcomes. The implications of these results suggest the need for educational institutions to consider integrating VR technologies strategically into their curricula to optimize teaching and learning effectiveness.

Abstract: Significance & Background: As healthcare evolves, innovative teaching methods are crucial for preparing new graduate oncology nurses to address complex patient needs. The COVID-19 pandemic has left many new nurses struggling with clinical transitions due to insufficient experience and decision-making skills. Concurrently, senior nurses are experiencing burnout, making traditional learning methods less effective. Most preceptors and new graduate nurses belong to the Millennial and Generation Z demographics, who value instant gratification, active engagement, and multimodal learning. Escape rooms offer an interactive approach that fosters critical thinking, teamwork, and effective communication under pressure. These engaging experiences enhance collaboration, strengthen relationships, and provide opportunities for debriefing and reflection, ultimately helping new nurses transition more smoothly into clinical practice. Purpose: The goal is to develop an engaging escape room experience for new graduate nurses and their preceptors. This innovative activity will promote active learning, enhance teamwork under pressure, and strengthen the preceptor-nurse relationship. By fostering collaboration, boosting confidence, and encouraging reflection, this initiative will facilitate a smoother transition into clinical practice, ultimately improving patient care outcomes. Interventions: Participants, comprising new graduate oncology nurses and their preceptors, will engage in scenarios that simulate real-life oncology challenges, such as patient care dilemmas, critical thinking skills, and interprofessional collaboration. Using various games and puzzles, each escape room will be tailored to address key competencies in oncology nursing, integrating evidence-based practices and ethical considerations. Results: We anticipate that incorporating escape room learning into the new graduate nursing orientation will facilitate a smoother transition to clinical practice by enhancing critical thinking skills and effective communication. To measure success, we will analyze pre- and post-surveys to assess improvements in knowledge retention, skill competency, teamwork, and confidence in caring for our oncology population. Discussion: Escape rooms not only stimulate a deeper understanding of oncology concepts but also strengthen the preceptor-nurse relationship, promoting mentorship and support. Through debriefing sessions, participants will reflect on their experiences, reinforcing lessons learned and enhancing their confidence in clinical practice. The anticipated outcomes include improved clinical readiness, enhanced communication skills, and a greater sense of community within oncology nursing teams. This innovative approach offers a compelling framework for preparing the next generation of oncology nurses, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and outcomes.

Abstract: Significance 8% Background: Annual competency training can be used to validate hands-on required skills and reinforce best practice and practice changes for oncology nurses. Despite providing repeated information during the 2022 and 2023 competency sessions, some incumbent nurses voiced that they were never made aware of practice changes and reported a lack of knowledge about material reviewed during reeducation meetings. Purpose: To improve engagement and knowledge retention, two Jeopardy-style games were created using Microsoft PowerPoint. One game focused on office practice and radiation oncology nurses and the other on infusion nurses. Categories for the infusion game included consents, emergency response, safe-handling, chemotherapy & immunotherapy, Central Venous Access Devices (CVAD), and miscellaneous. The office practice game included questions on consents, emergency response, miscellaneous, triage & symptom management, CVAD, and oncology emergencies. Five questions were created for each category, and each was assigned a point value between $200 and $1000. An explanation slide was created for each correct answer. Interventions: At each competency session, nurse educators created two teams and assigned participants considering the nurses' current role and prior oncology experience. Each team was given a buzzer and instructed to ring it after the question was read aloud. The nurse educators kept score and facilitated the game ensuring that the rationale for each answer was reviewed. Results: Nurses reported that the Jeopardy-style game was highly engaging and promoted knowledge retention. Many nurses verbalized that they appreciated receiving information through the interactive format and that it promoted knowledge development and re- tention. Some even took notes during the game. Discussion: Gamification will be implemented in future competency sessions based off of the overwhelmingly positive feedback received this year. The nurse educators followed trends in incorrect answers and are developing future education sessions to address the gaps in knowledge discovered during the competency sessions.

Abstract: Significance & Background: As healthcare advances rapidly, nurses must continuously update their expertise to provide optimal care. Lymphoma, a malignancy of the lymphatic system, requires specialized knowledge for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Oncology nurses, integral to patient care in clinics and infusion settings, often find it challenging to keep up with new developments in disease-specific treatment, especially in a community oncology setting. Improving nurses' education in this area is essential for better patient outcomes. Enhanced knowledge enables nurses to offer more effective care, better symptom management, and more comprehensive patient support, thereby improving overall healthcare outcomes. Purpose: This project aims to boost nurses' knowledge and confidence in managing lymphoma patients. The educational initiative focuses on critical aspects of lymphoma care, including its types, symptoms, diagnostic procedures, treatments, and management strategies. Interventions: The educational program utilized a hybrid approach, featuring both interactive face-to-face sessions with PowerPoint presentations and a Zoombased option to accommodate varying schedules. The Nursing Professional Development Center (NPDC) provided 0.5 contact hours to encourage participation. Participants' baseline knowledge and confidence levels were assessed via a nine-question pretest, and their progress measured with a post-test to gauge the effectiveness of the intervention. Results: Participation in the study included twenty-four nurses, two medical assistants, and one pharmacy student. Evaluation involved a statistical analysis of pretest and post-test results to determine changes in knowledge and confidence. Results indicated a significant improvement. Participants scored 52% higher in their knowledge of lymphoma using the same questions pretest and post-test. Confidence levels rose from an average of 2.88 to 6.42 on a Likert Scale from © (no knowledge) to 10 (complete confidence). Discussion: The combination of in-person and Zoom-based education offered flexibility and accessibility, addressing different learning preferences and schedules. Recorded Zoom sessions further ensured that future nurses could access the material. The notable increase in both knowledge and confidence among participants highlights the effectiveness of a targeted educational approach. This project demonstrates the potential of similar short, hybrid, targeted, disease-specific interventions to meet educational needs in other specialized areas of oncology nursing. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of such educational programs on clinical practice and patient outcomes as well as assessing knowledge retention for participants.

Abstract: Significance & Background: Chemotherapy treatment requires extensive patient education, which can overwhelm patients. To empower patients to take an active role in their treatment, oncology nurses must allow them to learn at their own pace. Oncology nurses are uniquely positioned to provide ongoing patient education during their scheduled infusion treatments. Purpose: Knowledge retention varies from patient to patient and patient education varies from nurse to nurse. To minimize gaps in what is taught, we standardized our patient education by developing deliberate scripted materials focusing on key concepts of treatments and management of common side effects. The goal of this improvement project was to increase patient education retention by 30% to 40% within three months. Our theory was that this could be accomplished by using nurse conducted, standardized, repeated, patient education using the teach-back method. Interventions: Patients on a chemotherapy regimen with a treatment cycle requiring a clinic visit every 2 weeks were selected to pilot. Through staffcollaboration, a list of standardized questions related to common, and drug specific patient education was created. Using this tool, we conducted our face-to-face, teach-back patient education sessions. Each session consisted of the same patient education. To evaluate the impact on knowledge retention, each session was scored by dividing the number of correct answers by the total number of questions and this was expressed as percent correct. First session scores were noted as baseline scores, second and third session scores were then compared with the baseline scores. Results: After three months of conducting patient education sessions, we observed that patient scores increased as predicted. The mean score of Session 1 was 45%, rising to 66% in Session 2, and reaching 81% in Session 3. The result was a 36% increase in knowledge retention between Sessions 1 and 3. Standardized, repeated, patient education using the teach-back method successfully increased patient knowledge retention. Discussion: We are currently working on sustaining this quality improvement project in our Infusion Center by introducing different chemotherapy regimens and questions tailored to meet the specific needs of patients on those therapies. Repeated, patient teach-back sessions: · Represent an innovative approach aimed at improving patient education retention. · Foster meaningful and satisfying communication between patients and nurses. · Contribute to a valuable, positive healthcare experience. · Enhance the quality of service provided to patients.

Abstract: Background: The “Fundamentals of Nursing” course is crucial for equipping novice undergraduate nursing students with essential skills for their professional practice. However, a gap exists between nursing education and clinical readiness—a challenge exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and issues like absenteeism in clinical sessions. The flipped classroom has been proposed as an innovative strategy to bridge this gap, offering students opportunities for self-paced learning before class and enabling more active, hands-on practice during lab sessions. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the flipped classroom approach on undergraduate nursing students' knowledge retention, skill performance, self-directed learning, collaborative learning, work engagement, learning ability, and satisfaction in a Fundamentals of Nursing clinical course. Design: A non-equivalent quasi-experimental design was used to compare the flipped classroom method against traditional demonstration-based instruction within a clinical skills lab setting. Participants: The study included 100 nursing students enrolled in the “Fundamentals of Nursing” theory and lab courses at Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman, during the fall and spring semesters of 2022. Methods: The experimental group engaged with pre-recorded video lectures, infographics, and other educational materials before class, while the control group received conventional demonstration-based instruction. Data were collected through pre-quiz and post-quiz scores, skill evaluation checklists, and surveys assessing various learning outcomes. Results: Although students in the flipped classroom group showed significantly higher pre-quiz scores, indicating better initial understanding, there was no significant difference in post-quiz scores, skill evaluation, or other measured learning outcomes compared to the control group. Unexpectedly, the flipped classroom approach had a detrimental effect on self-reported learning ability and satisfaction. Specifically, the mean scores for learning ability were 35.57 (SD = 5.30) in the flipped classroom group versus 37.89 (SD = 5.26) in the control group, with t = 2.186, p = 0.031 (95 % CI 0.21 to 4.42). Satisfaction scores in the flipped classroom were 44.35 (SD = 11.07) compared to 48.43 (SD = 7.53) in the control group, t = 2.119, p = 0.037 (95 % CI 0.26 to 7.91). Conclusions: The flipped classroom approach did not significantly enhance most of the educational outcomes compared to traditional demonstration-based teaching. While it offers benefits in terms of adaptability to remote scenarios, its impact on self-directed learning and student satisfaction requires careful consideration and further investigation. Future research should explore its application across multiple skills and longer durations to fully ascertain its effectiveness.

Abstract: The risk entailed is not up for debate: cyber conflict has already produced significant loss of knowledge, wealth, and even human life (Miller, 2022; Center for Strategic & International Studies, n.d.). [...]we offer a few critical considerations for policymakers as the cyber era continues to unfold to assist them in making cyber policy that is more intentionally ethical while retaining competitive advantage. [...]the Western legal tradition places state conflict and private conflict on the same spectrum, seeking to regulate both through legal systems built by consensus and accumulated historical tradition and interpretation, and grounded in moral and ethical reasoning. [...]identifying where and how cyber conflict may depart from existing tradition and reasoning is an essential step to incorporating ethical cyber action into the larger societal framework of conflict management. While they are by no means exhaustive, we feel these categories cover the majority of reasoning underlying statecraft: * Teleological egoism, or realism, in which agents make decisions to optimize their own utility, however, they may define and measure it. * Teleological utilitarianism, in which agents decide to optimize a global notion of utility, however, they may define and measure it. * Kantianism, used here to represent Kant's assertion of persons as inherent ends and his prohibition against using any person as merely a means to an end, thereby prioritizing human dignity over all other concerns. * Virtue, in which agents make decisions based on attributes they purport, or aspire, to embody. * Contractarianism, in which agents make decisions in accordance with a set of rules that are, or would theoretically be, agreed upon by all, or a significant portion of, the agents governed by those rules. 2.

Abstract: The "Fundamentals of Nursing" course is crucial for equipping novice undergraduate nursing students with essential skills for their professional practice. However, a gap exists between nursing education and clinical readiness-a challenge exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and issues like absenteeism in clinical sessions. The flipped classroom has been proposed as an innovative strategy to bridge this gap, offering students opportunities for self-paced learning before class and enabling more active, hands-on practice during lab sessions. BACKGROUND The "Fundamentals of Nursing" course is crucial for equipping novice undergraduate nursing students with essential skills for their professional practice. However, a gap exists between nursing education and clinical readiness-a challenge exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and issues like absenteeism in clinical sessions. The flipped classroom has been proposed as an innovative strategy to bridge this gap, offering students opportunities for self-paced learning before class and enabling more active, hands-on practice during lab sessions.This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the flipped classroom approach on undergraduate nursing students' knowledge retention, skill performance, self-directed learning, collaborative learning, work engagement, learning ability, and satisfaction in a Fundamentals of Nursing clinical course. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the flipped classroom approach on undergraduate nursing students' knowledge retention, skill performance, self-directed learning, collaborative learning, work engagement, learning ability, and satisfaction in a Fundamentals of Nursing clinical course.A non-equivalent quasi-experimental design was used to compare the flipped classroom method against traditional demonstration-based instruction within a clinical skills lab setting. DESIGN A non-equivalent quasi-experimental design was used to compare the flipped classroom method against traditional demonstration-based instruction within a clinical skills lab setting.The study included 100 nursing students enrolled in the "Fundamentals of Nursing" theory and lab courses at Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman, during the fall and spring semesters of 2022. PARTICIPANTS The study included 100 nursing students enrolled in the "Fundamentals of Nursing" theory and lab courses at Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman, during the fall and spring semesters of 2022.The experimental group engaged with pre-recorded video lectures, infographics, and other educational materials before class, while the control group received conventional demonstration-based instruction. Data were collected through pre-quiz and post-quiz scores, skill evaluation checklists, and surveys assessing various learning outcomes. METHODS The experimental group engaged with pre-recorded video lectures, infographics, and other educational materials before class, while the control group received conventional demonstration-based instruction. Data were collected through pre-quiz and post-quiz scores, skill evaluation checklists, and surveys assessing various learning outcomes.Although students in the flipped classroom group showed significantly higher pre-quiz scores, indicating better initial understanding, there was no significant difference in post-quiz scores, skill evaluation, or other measured learning outcomes compared to the control group. Unexpectedly, the flipped classroom approach had a detrimental effect on self-reported learning ability and satisfaction. Specifically, the mean scores for learning ability were 35.57 (SD = 5.30) in the flipped classroom group versus 37.89 (SD = 5.26) in the control group, with t = 2.186, p = 0.031 (95 % CI 0.21 to 4.42). Satisfaction scores in the flipped classroom were 44.35 (SD = 11.07) compared to 48.43 (SD = 7.53) in the control group, t = 2.119, p = 0.037 (95 % CI 0.26 to 7.91). RESULTS Although students in the flipped classroom group showed significantly higher pre-quiz scores, indicating better initial understanding, there was no significant difference in post-quiz scores, skill evaluation, or other measured learning outcomes compared to the control group. Unexpectedly, the flipped classroom approach had a detrimental effect on self-reported learning ability and satisfaction.

While it offers benefits in terms of adaptability to remote scenarios, its impact on self-directed learning and student satisfaction requires careful consideration and further investigation. Future research should explore its application across multiple skills and longer durations to fully ascertain its effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS The flipped classroom approach did not significantly enhance most of the educational outcomes compared to traditional demonstration-based teaching. While it offers benefits in terms of adaptability to remote scenarios, its impact on self-directed learning and student satisfaction requires careful consideration and further investigation.

Abstract: Purpose This paper aims to address the challenges faced by the cheese industry, particularly concerning the preservation and transfer of traditional cheesemaking knowledge. It emphasises the need for innovative solutions in sustainably managing knowledge and skills amidst changing demographic and technological landscapes. Design/methodology/approach Our approach consists of developing and implementing a digital tool, the cheese eK-Book, which is designed to capture, structure and disseminate cheesemaking knowledge. This tool is based on a semantic network and is accessible via smartphones and tablets and aims to facilitate continuous learning, knowledge transfer and collaboration across diverse stakeholders in the cheese production sector. Findings The study highlights several critical findings. Traditional cheesemaking knowledge is currently at risk due to a number of factors, including the ageing of skilled workers, a lack of succession planning and pressures from globalisation and industrialisation. The European dairy sector is evolving towards more specialised and automated production, requiring a skilled workforce capable of adapting to these changes. There is a significant gap between traditional cheese makers and research institutions, hindering the adoption of new technologies and best practices. The cheese eK-Book offers a promising solution to these challenges by preserving knowledge, supporting continuous learning and enhancing collaboration between industry stakeholders and educational/research institutions. The tool facilitates access to scientific knowledge, promotes work–life balance by offering a range of flexible learning opportunities and supports tailored training programmes based on individual users’ needs. Originality/value This article contributes original insights by proposing a comprehensive digital solution tailored to the specific, current needs of the cheese industry. By integrating modern technology with traditional knowledge, the cheese eK-Book not only preserves expertise but also fosters innovation and sustainability within the sector. It bridges the gap between practical cheesemaking skills and contemporary scientific understanding, addressing critical challenges such as knowledge retention, succession planning and workforce development in a rapidly evolving industry landscape. The strength of the Cheese eK-Book lies in its capacity to communicate knowledge, traditions and teachings across generations. This transfer of knowledge and skills plays a crucial role in preserving heritage and fostering connections across different generations within a community.

Abstract: The training of nursing professionals has grown increasingly complex due to technological and scientific advancements, demanding higher educational quality and fostering critical thinking. The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has emphasized active teaching/learning methods (ATLMs), which promote critical thinking, decision-making, group work, motivation, and knowledge retention. ATLMs require teachers to adopt a guiding role and adapt their methodologies. While tools like OPPUMAUGR assess ATLM use in education, validated instruments specific to nursing educators remain unavailable, despite studies highlighting ATLMs’ positive impact on nursing students. This study developed and validated the OPPUMA-NV scale for measuring nursing degree lecturers’ perceptions of the use of active teaching/learning methods nursing degree at the University of Granada. The scale, completed by 381 participants (70.6% women, the largest group aged ‘Between 41 and 50 y. o.’), measures six factors: The institution promotes change (14 items), Range of ATLMs (19 items), Traditional methodology (8 items), Student-centred teaching (4 items), Barriers to implementing ATLMs (9 items) and ATLMs implementation facilitators (5 items). It demonstrated high reliability (α=0.859). Descriptive analysis showed that gender (being a man or a woman) had impact on factor 2 ‘Range of ATLMs’. Within professional categories, had impact factors 3 (‘Traditional methodology’) and 5 (‘Barriers to implementing ATLMs’). This tool indicated effectiveness for determining the factors that influence the nursing degree teachers’ application of ATLMs.

Abstract: Background Didactic Lecture (DL) is a teaching method that has been there for a long time in our educational system, but student involvement is minimal. Problem-based Learning (PBL) differs in that it involves students in the learning process. Various skills are learned, such as self-learning, group discussion, communication skills, teamwork and knowledge retention. Critical thinking, analysis and the ability to solve real problems are some benefits of PBL, which can help medical students understand clinical scenarios and analyse, interpret and come up with possible solutions based on sound knowledge. Thus, there is a need to assess the effectiveness of PBL in recall, interpretation and problem-solving skills as compared to the traditional lecture method, as there are very few Indian studies related to PBL in Indian medical students. Materials and Methods A non-randomised interventional study was carried out in the Department of Pharmacology at East Point Medical College, Bengaluru. Groups A and B, each with 60 medical students, participated in PBL and DL for either of the two competencies (myocardial infarction and iron deficiency anaemia). After the completion of the DL and PBL sessions, 20 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) were given to the students. The effectiveness of the teaching method was determined by comparing the mean scores of MCQs of both groups. Results The group scores were compared using an independent sample t -test and expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The total mean score of PBL for the topic myocardial infarction (11.00 ± 2.64, p value = .001) was statistically significant compared with the total mean score in the DL group (9.38 ± 2.52), and the total mean score of PBL for the topic iron deficiency anaemia (15.28 ± 3.53, p value = .001) was significant compared to the total mean score in the DL group (12.98 ± 3.61), respectively. The mean score for recall and problem-solving for the topic of myocardial infarction was statistically significant in the PBL group compared to the DL group. The mean score for recall, interpretation and problem-solving for the topic of iron deficiency anaemia was statistically significant in the PBL group compared with the DL group. Conclusion PBL showed marked improvement in recall, interpretation and problem-solving abilities compared with DL. So, including PBL as a teaching–learning method can promote active and student-centered learning.

Abstract: The limitations of lectures are magnified when teaching technical skills. A "flipped classroom" (FC) model allows learners to first review material and replaces lectures with active teacher-learner engagement. FC has been shown to improve knowledge retention, but its impact on skill acquisition is unknown. This exploratory study assesses the feasibility and learner perception of an FC model for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) simulation. INTRODUCTION The limitations of lectures are magnified when teaching technical skills. A "flipped classroom" (FC) model allows learners to first review material and replaces lectures with active teacher-learner engagement. FC has been shown to improve knowledge retention, but its impact on skill acquisition is unknown. This exploratory study assesses the feasibility and learner perception of an FC model for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) simulation.Urology residents participated in a PCNL simulation curriculum. Residents first reviewed materials on obtaining percutaneous access, followed by an in-person discussion and 4 simulation activities. Pre-/post-simulation surveys were collected regarding prior experience, confidence in skills (rating scale from 1-5, unable to perform to can perform independently), and scores on a validated Flipped Classroom Perception Instrument (agreement scale 1-5). METHODS Urology residents participated in a PCNL simulation curriculum. Residents first reviewed materials on obtaining percutaneous access, followed by an in-person discussion and 4 simulation activities. Pre-/post-simulation surveys were collected regarding prior experience, confidence in skills (rating scale from 1-5, unable to perform to can perform independently), and scores on a validated Flipped Classroom Perception Instrument (agreement scale 1-5).Thirteen residents with varying PCNL experience reported significantly increased confidence in obtaining access across all measures ( P < .01): performing new access overall, new fluoroscopic access with bull's-eye and triangulation techniques, and using existing access. There was no difference in the increase in confidence ratings based on prior PCNL experience. FC was highly rated, with mean scores on the perception instrument 4.0 to 4.5 before and 4.2 to 4.7 after the activity. Each simulation component was perceived as highly effective (overall mean, 4.7; pre-simulation materials, 4.3; in-person discussion, 4.4; simulation, 4.8). There was no difference based on prior PCNL experience. RESULTS Thirteen residents with varying PCNL experience reported significantly increased confidence in obtaining access across all measures (P < .01): performing new access overall, new fluoroscopic access with bull's-eye and triangulation techniques, and using existing access. There was no difference in the increase in confidence ratings based on prior PCNL experience. FC was highly rated, with mean scores on the perception instrument 4.0 to 4.5 before and 4.2 to 4.7 after the activity. Each simulation component was perceived as highly effective (overall mean, 4.7; pre-simulation materials, 4.3; in-person discussion, 4.4; simulation, 4.8). There was no difference based on prior PCNL experience.An FC model was feasible and rated by learners as highly effective for teaching percutaneous renal access and significantly improved residents' skill confidence regardless of prior PCNL experience. CONCLUSIONS An FC model was feasible and rated by learners as highly effective for teaching percutaneous renal access and significantly improved residents' skill confidence regardless of prior PCNL experience.

The use of virtual reality in human training: trends and a research agenda

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/use-virtual-reality-human-training-trends/docview/3159007935/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Traditional classroom training sessions can negatively impact participants’ engagement and knowledge retention. In response, several organisations are moving towards innovative and more engaging approaches, such as virtual reality (VR). By using VR, participants can immerse in a simulated environment, acquiring experiences in rare and hazardous situations that cannot be experienced in the natural environment without risk to the participants. VR has been applied in several areas, and this study aims to understand the applicability and impact of VR simulators on human training and perspectives of this emergent area. Drawn on a rigorous systematic literature review of 82 articles, the study presents findings from the thematic analysis. First, descriptive results outline the VR literature and its applications as an innovative training and learning tool. Second, a prescriptive thematic analysis has identified emerging themes related to behavioural, technological, and organisational benefits. The results also show the VR challenges related to technological limitations, restricted resources, and academic research. This study demonstrates the development of VR in human training, presenting contributions to theory and practice. The study presents some limitations related to the scope and focus of the study, and future pathways to address these limitations are suggested. For instance, the research protocol did not consider conference papers or articles that were not in English, and it was limited to a search period. Furthermore, emergent topics such as artificial intelligence and VR technology's physiological-emotional and sensory aspects in training should be addressed. Therefore, future studies should address these topics and use the research agenda suggested in this study.

Abstract: Pediatric airway diseases are associated with complex challenges because of smaller and more dynamic airway structures in children. These conditions, should be immediately and precisely recognized to prevent life-threatening obstructions and long-term respiratory complications. Recently, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an innovative approach to clinical medical education. To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of VR-based education and traditional lectures in enhancing knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, and motivation among senior respiratory therapy students. BACKGROUND Pediatric airway diseases are associated with complex challenges because of smaller and more dynamic airway structures in children. These conditions, should be immediately and precisely recognized to prevent life-threatening obstructions and long-term respiratory complications. Recently, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an innovative approach to clinical medical education. To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of VR-based education and traditional lectures in enhancing knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, and motivation among senior respiratory therapy students.This study was conducted between November 2020 and September 2022, involving 54 students from a School of Respiratory Therapy, with 43 completing a pretest and undergoing random assignment into either a VR or a traditional education (non-VR) group. Samsung Gear VR Oculus headsets were used by the VR group for instructions on conditions such as laryngeal malacia, subglottic stenosis, and tracheomalacia. Theoretical exams, objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE), and instructional material motivation survey (IMMS) were used to evaluate participants' knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, and application capabilities, followed by a statistical analysis comparing both study groups.

Theoretical exams, objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE), and instructional material motivation survey (IMMS) were used to evaluate participants' knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, and application capabilities, followed by a statistical analysis comparing both study groups.No significant differences in pretest scores were observed between the two groups. However, the VR group outperformed the non-VR group in OSCE scores significantly (15 ± 3 vs 10 ± 3, p = 0.003) and demonstrated greater learning motivation and satisfaction based on IMMS scores. No notable difference in immediate posteducation theoretical examination scores was observed between the groups. RESULTS No significant differences in pretest scores were observed between the two groups.

No notable difference in immediate posteducation theoretical examination scores was observed between the groups.VR can effectively serve as a supplemental educational tool in clinical training programs for pediatric airway disease. To optimize its implementation in medical educational settings, further research with larger cohorts and longer follow-up periods is needed. CONCLUSION VR can effectively serve as a supplemental educational tool in clinical training programs for pediatric airway disease.
