    "Abstract": "To compare medical students' and residents' knowledge retention of assessment, diagnosis and treatment procedures, as well as a learning experience, of patients with spinal trauma after training with either a Virtual Patient case or a video-recorded traditional lecture. OBJECTIVES To compare medical students' and residents' knowledge retention of assessment, diagnosis and treatment procedures, as well as a learning experience, of patients with spinal trauma after training with either a Virtual Patient case or a video-recorded traditional lecture.A total of 170 volunteers (85 medical students and 85 residents in orthopedic surgery) were randomly allocated (stratified for student/resident and gender) to either a video-recorded standard lecture or a Virtual Patient-based training session where they interactively assessed a clinical case portraying a motorcycle accident. The knowledge retention was assessed by a test immediately following the educational intervention and repeated after a minimum of 2 months. Participants' learning experiences were evaluated with exit questionnaires. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was applied on knowledge scores. A total of 81% (n = 138) of the participants completed both tests. METHODS A total of 170 volunteers (85 medical students and 85 residents in orthopedic surgery) were randomly allocated (stratified for student/resident and gender) to either a video-recorded standard lecture or a Virtual Patient-based training session where they interactively assessed a clinical case portraying a motorcycle accident. The knowledge retention was assessed by a test immediately following the educational intervention and repeated after a minimum of 2 months. Participants' learning experiences were evaluated with exit questionnaires. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was applied on knowledge scores. A total of 81% (n = 138) of the participants completed both tests.There was a small but significant decline in first and second test results for both groups (F (1, 135) = 18.154, p = 0.00). However, no significant differences in short-term and long-term knowledge retention were observed between the two teaching methods. The Virtual Patient group reported higher learning experience levels in engagement, stimulation, general perception, and expectations. RESULTS There was a small but significant decline in first and second test results for both groups (F(1, 135) = 18.154, p = 0.00). However, no significant differences in short-term and long-term knowledge retention were observed between the two teaching methods. The Virtual Patient group reported higher learning experience levels in engagement, stimulation, general perception, and expectations.Participants' levels engagement were reported in favor of the VP format. Similar knowledge retention was achieved through either a Virtual Patient or a recorded lecture. CONCLUSIONS Participants' levels engagement were reported in favor of the VP format. Similar knowledge retention was achieved through either a Virtual Patient or a recorded lecture.",

    "Abstract": "Background Efforts are needed to ensure that smokers with lower health literacy are provided with understandable and impactful information about the health consequences of smoking and benefits of quitting. Purpose To test the influence of health literacy on smokers’ responses to health risk messages manipulated on framing (gain vs. loss) and emotionality (factual vs. emotional). Methods Participants ( N = 402) were randomized to evaluate one of four sets of smoking risk messages (factual gain-framed, factual loss-framed, emotional gain-framed, or emotional loss-framed). Multiple linear regressions examined main effects of health literacy, message emotionality, and message framing on: (a) risk perceptions, (b) behavioral expectations (i.e. cut down, limit, quit), and (c) risk knowledge. Two-way interactions of health literacy with emotionality and framing were examined for these outcomes. Analyses were based on theory-driven, a priori hypotheses. Results As hypothesized, main effects emerged such that smokers with higher health literacy reported stronger risk perceptions and knowledge retention regardless of message type. Additionally, emotional (vs. factual) and gain- (vs. loss-) framed messages were associated with certain lower risk perceptions regardless of health literacy level. Consistent with hypotheses, two-way crossover interactions emerged between health literacy and emotionality. Among smokers with higher health literacy, factual messages produced higher perceived risk and stronger expectations for quitting. Among smokers with lower health literacy, emotional messages produced higher perceived risk and stronger expectations for quitting. Conclusions Health literacy plays an important role in influencing how smokers respond to different risk messages. One’s health literacy should be considered when determining whether risk communications emphasize factual or emotional content.",

    "Abstract": "Previous research has explored the experiences of medical students using body painting as a learning tool. However, to date, faculty experiences and views have not been explored. This international qualitative study utilized a grounded theory approach with data collection through interviews with academics and clinicians who utilized body painting as part of their anatomical teaching. Twenty-six anatomists participated in the study from 14 centers worldwide. Three themes emerged from the data: (1) the efficacy of body painting, (2) the promotion of knowledge retention and recall, (3) considerations and practicalities regarding the use of body painting as a teaching tool. Subthemes show that body painting is used as an adjunct to the curriculum for teaching surface anatomy and peer examination. Benefits included diffusing the formal curricula, high student engagement and learning for future clinical practice. Body painting was advocated for promoting knowledge retention and recall, particularly learning through the process of cognitive load due to combining the use of color and kinesthetic learning with anatomical theory. Critical discussions surfaced on the topic of undressing in the classroom due to cultural and personal considerations possibly leading to unequal involvement and different learning experiences. Overall results support previous research showing that anatomists appreciate body painting as an effective, enjoyable, engaging and cost efficient adjunct to the multimodal anatomy curriculum. The role of cognitive load theory in learning anatomy through body painting emerged from the data as a possible theoretical framework supporting learning benefits from body painting and is suggested for further investigation.

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG The loss of traditional knowledge, concomitant with changes in livelihoods, languages, and demographics of indigenous and local groups, is a global concern. However, documenting such loss poses serious methodological challenges. Comparing the results of contemporary studies with past research is often problematic due to methodological differences. Here, comparing studies that attempted to document the traditional ethnobotanical knowledge of the Chácobo of Bolivia, we tried to examine whether knowledge loss was really occurring across more than 100 years or was only researcher’s perception. The Chácobo are a Panoan-speaking tribe of about 1000 members, first visited by researchers in 1911, and subsequently in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Each study had different foci, but all recorded ethnobotanical data. The first more detailed anthropological report exists from the late 1960s, and ecological-ethnobotanical studies were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on available literature, in particular the botanical studies of Boom (1987) and Bergeron (1998), it seemed that Chácobo plant use now centers on income generation. Both Boom (1987) and Bergeron (1998) perceived that traditional plant use related to household artifacts and medicine, as well as traditional crop varieties had almost disappeared. Here, we hypothesized that plant knowledge documented and the perception of so-called knowledge loss observed in these depended completely on the background of the interviewers and the methods employed, and that in a sufficiently comprehensive ethnobotanical study, we would be able to document all species and uses mentioned in previous studies. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a complete ethnobotanical inventory of almost the entire adult Chácobo population, with interviews and plant collection conducted directly by Chácobo counterparts. The results verify our initial hypothesis and showed that the loss of knowledge perceived in previous studies simply was an artifact of the research methods employed. Traditional crop varieties are still widely grown, most Chácobo know, and can name, traditional artifacts, and many still know the names and uses of medicinal species. However, some knowledge, including the manufacture of artifacts and proficient identification of many medicinal plants, is limited to the older generation.",

    "Abstract": "A primary goal of nursing programs is to ensure that graduates can successfully enter into professional practice. This paper examines the relationship between competence, confidence, and knowledge retention in undergraduate nursing students. The study involved a three test quantitative component as well as a qualitative component. The quantitative component comprised a pretest, posttest immediately following the intervention, posttest three month design. The intervention was comprised of an intensive one day advanced cardiac skills knowledge and simulation activity. The three tests measured competence, confidence, and knowledge retention. The results of the study demonstrated the intervention was effective in improving perceptions of competence and confidence both immediately and at a three month timeframe. Knowledge retention also was statistically significant at a three month timeframe. This study demonstrates the value of advanced knowledge and skill for undergraduate nursing students. Despite the policy enforced reality that participants were not able to use the knowledge and skill in clinical practice, the motivational benefit of the advanced knowledge had significant positive effects on participants.",

    "Abstract": "Surgical team members use fire risk assessment tools to determine the risk of a surgical fire occurring and facilitate communication to reduce risk. The purposes of this quality improvement project were to improve knowledge and awareness of surgical fire risk and increase practitioners' use of a fire risk assessment tool during the surgical safety communication process. We recruited a purposive sample of participants that included all surgical team members of a metropolitan ambulatory surgical center. We based the educational intervention on published evidence and findings of a preintervention knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) survey. We assessed knowledge, current practice, and practice intent using a 10-item pretest and posttest, and used a follow-up posttest to assess knowledge retention and practice change. The findings suggest that a brief educational intervention regarding fire risk assessment contributes to improving staff member knowledge and use of prevention strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Previous research has explored the experiences of medical students using body painting as a learning tool. However, to date, faculty experiences and views have not been explored. This international qualitative study utilized a grounded theory approach with data collection through interviews with academics and clinicians who utilized body painting as part of their anatomical teaching. Twenty-six anatomists participated in the study from 14 centers worldwide. Three themes emerged from the data: (1) the efficacy of body painting, (2) the promotion of knowledge retention and recall, (3) considerations and practicalities regarding the use of body painting as a teaching tool. Subthemes show that body painting is used as an adjunct to the curriculum for teaching surface anatomy and peer examination. Benefits included diffusing the formal curricula, high student engagement and learning for future clinical practice. Body painting was advocated for promoting knowledge retention and recall, particularly learning through the process of cognitive load due to combining the use of color and kinesthetic learning with anatomical theory. Critical discussions surfaced on the topic of undressing in the classroom due to cultural and personal considerations possibly leading to unequal involvement and different learning experiences. Overall results support previous research showing that anatomists appreciate body painting as an effective, enjoyable, engaging and cost efficient adjunct to the multimodal anatomy curriculum. The role of cognitive load theory in learning anatomy through body painting emerged from the data as a possible theoretical framework supporting learning benefits from body painting and is suggested for further investigation.

    "Abstract": "Rural health care providers (HCPs) care for millions of Americans despite challenges. Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) provides rural HCPs training in assessment and interventions for critically ill/injured pediatric patients (American Heart Association, 2015). The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of integration of high fidelity simulators into PALS courses in a rural setting. PURPOSE Rural health care providers (HCPs) care for millions of Americans despite challenges. Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) provides rural HCPs training in assessment and interventions for critically ill/injured pediatric patients (American Heart Association, 2015). The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of integration of high fidelity simulators into PALS courses in a rural setting.Participants were randomized by course to control or experimental PALS conditions where the control group received PALS with low fidelity static manikins (LFM) and the experimental group received PALS with high-fidelity simulators (HFS). Multiple level modeling (MLM) was used to examine participants time-to-task on pre-identified skills on PALS core case scenarios during testing on the last day of the course. MLM also was used to examine the differences in PALS knowledge and skills self-efficacy (SEI) between control and experimental groups at course end and six months later. DESIGN AND METHODS Participants were randomized by course to control or experimental PALS conditions where the control group received PALS with low fidelity static manikins (LFM) and the experimental group received PALS with high-fidelity simulators (HFS). Multiple level modeling (MLM) was used to examine participants time-to-task on pre-identified skills on PALS core case scenarios during testing on the last day of the course. MLM also was used to examine the differences in PALS knowledge and skills self-efficacy (SEI) between control and experimental groups at course end and six months later.The experimental and control groups had similar scores on the PALS post course knowledge exam, however the skill performance of the experimental group on time-to-task in core case scenarios was significantly better when compared to the control group (p=0.05). A decrease in knowledge exam scores and SEI scores occurred in both groups over time, however the control group had significantly greater declines in PALS written exam (p=0.042) and SEI (p=0.003). RESULTS The experimental and control groups had similar scores on the PALS post course knowledge exam, however the skill performance of the experimental group on time-to-task in core case scenarios was significantly better when compared to the control group (p=0.05). A decrease in knowledge exam scores and SEI scores occurred in both groups over time, however the control group had significantly greater declines in PALS written exam (p=0.042) and SEI (p=0.003).Integration of HFS into PALS may increase HCPs' ability to recall valuable knowledge when seconds matter most. Further research in long-term recall of knowledge and retention of skills following PALS training is needed. CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Integration of HFS into PALS may increase HCPs' ability to recall valuable knowledge when seconds matter most. Further research in long-term recall of knowledge and retention of skills following PALS training is needed.",

    "Abstract": "The Emergency Neurological Life Support (ENLS) is an educational initiative designed to improve the acute management of neurological injuries. However, the applicability of the course in low-income countries in unknown. We evaluated the impact of the course on knowledge, decision-making skills and preparedness to manage neurological emergencies in a resource-limited country. Background The Emergency Neurological Life Support (ENLS) is an educational initiative designed to improve the acute management of neurological injuries. However, the applicability of the course in low-income countries in unknown. We evaluated the impact of the course on knowledge, decision-making skills and preparedness to manage neurological emergencies in a resource-limited country.A prospective cohort study design was implemented for the first ENLS course held in Asia. Knowledge and decision-making skills for neurological emergencies were assessed at baseline, post-course and at 6 months following course completion. To determine perceived knowledge and preparedness, data were collected using surveys administered immediately post-course and 6 months later. Methods A prospective cohort study design was implemented for the first ENLS course held in Asia. Knowledge and decision-making skills for neurological emergencies were assessed at baseline, post-course and at 6 months following course completion. To determine perceived knowledge and preparedness, data were collected using surveys administered immediately post-course and 6 months later.A total of 34 acute care physicians from across Nepal attended the course. Knowledge and decision-making skills significantly improved following the course (p=0.0008). Knowledge and decision-making skills remained significantly improved after 6 months, compared with before the course (p=0.02), with no significant loss of skills immediately following the course to the 6-month follow-up (p=0.16). At 6 months, the willingness to participate in continuing medical education activities remained evident, with 77% (10/13) of participants reporting a change in their clinical practice and decision-making, with the repeated use of ENLS protocols as the main driver of change.

    "Abstract": "Previous research has explored the experiences of medical students using body painting as a learning tool. However, to date, faculty experiences and views have not been explored. This international qualitative study utilized a grounded theory approach with data collection through interviews with academics and clinicians who utilized body painting as part of their anatomical teaching. Twenty‐six anatomists participated in the study from 14 centers worldwide. Three themes emerged from the data: (1) the efficacy of body painting, (2) the promotion of knowledge retention and recall, (3) considerations and practicalities regarding the use of body painting as a teaching tool. Subthemes show that body painting is used as an adjunct to the curriculum for teaching surface anatomy and peer examination. Benefits included diffusing the formal curricula, high student engagement and learning for future clinical practice. Body painting was advocated for promoting knowledge retention and recall, particularly learning through the process of cognitive load due to combining the use of color and kinesthetic learning with anatomical theory. Critical discussions surfaced on the topic of undressing in the classroom due to cultural and personal considerations possibly leading to unequal involvement and different learning experiences. Overall results support previous research showing that anatomists appreciate body painting as an effective, enjoyable, engaging and cost efficient adjunct to the multimodal anatomy curriculum. The role of cognitive load theory in learning anatomy through body painting emerged from the data as a possible theoretical framework supporting learning benefits from body painting and is suggested for further investigation.

The purposes of this quality improvement project were to improve knowledge and awareness of surgical fire risk and increase practitioners' use of a fire risk assessment tool during the surgical safety communication process. We recruited a purposive sample of participants that included all surgical team members of a metropolitan ambulatory surgical center. We based the educational intervention on published evidence and findings of a preintervention knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) survey. We assessed knowledge, current practice, and practice intent using a 10-item pretest and posttest, and used a follow-up posttest to assess knowledge retention and practice change. The findings suggest that a brief educational intervention regarding fire risk assessment contributes to improving staff member knowledge and use of prevention strategies.Surgical team members use fire risk assessment tools to determine the risk of a surgical fire occurring and facilitate communication to reduce risk.

    "Abstract": "Summary Providing historical information to deal with knowledge loss about a scientific experiment has been the focus of some several researches. However, computational support for large-scale scientific experiments is still incipient and is considered one of e-science's greatest challenges. In this vein, providing provenance information to a scientist is part of these challenges. Provenance information helps to assure the reliability and reproducibility of experiments. Therefore, this work has as its main objective to present a new ontology--Open Provenance Model Ontology-e (OPMO-e)--which is part of an architecture, named SciProvMiner. Open Provenance Model Ontology-e is a new ontology that encompasses both prospective and retrospective provenance. SciProvMiner captures the provenance and implements all inference and completeness rules defined by Open Provenance Model to provide provenance information beyond those already established. We hypothesize that the capture and management of provenance data will provide scientists with implicit strategical information about the experiment through OPMO-e. Case studies were carried out to evaluate OPMO-e use considering SciProvMiner. The obtained results revealed that the use of the proposed ontology and SciProvMiner can enhance scientist's knowledge about an experiment.",

    "Abstract": "The loss of traditional knowledge, concomitant with changes in livelihoods, languages, and demographics of indigenous and local groups, is a global concern. However, documenting such loss poses serious methodological challenges. Comparing the results of contemporary studies with past research is often problematic due to methodological differences. Here, comparing studies that attempted to document the traditional ethnobotanical knowledge of the Chácobo of Bolivia, we tried to examine whether knowledge loss was really occurring across more than 100 years or was only researcher’s perception. The Chácobo are a Panoan-speaking tribe of about 1000 members, first visited by researchers in 1911, and subsequently in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Each study had different foci, but all recorded ethnobotanical data. The first more detailed anthropological report exists from the late 1960s, and ecological-ethnobotanical studies were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on available literature, in particular the botanical studies of Boom (1987) and Bergeron (1998), it seemed that Chácobo plant use now centers on income generation. Both Boom (1987) and Bergeron (1998) perceived that traditional plant use related to household artifacts and medicine, as well as traditional crop varieties had almost disappeared. Here, we hypothesized that plant knowledge documented and the perception of so-called knowledge loss observed in these depended completely on the background of the interviewers and the methods employed, and that in a sufficiently comprehensive ethnobotanical study, we would be able to document all species and uses mentioned in previous studies. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a complete ethnobotanical inventory of almost the entire adult Chácobo population, with interviews and plant collection conducted directly by Chácobo counterparts. The results verify our initial hypothesis and showed that the loss of knowledge perceived in previous studies simply was an artifact of the research methods employed. Traditional crop varieties are still widely grown, most Chácobo know, and can name, traditional artifacts, and many still know the names and uses of medicinal species. However, some knowledge, including the manufacture of artifacts and proficient identification of many medicinal plants, is limited to the older generation. Alternate abstract: La pérdida del conocimiento tradicional, los cambios en los medios de subsistencia, la pérdida de las lenguas locales, y la reducción demográfíca de los grupos indígenas y locales, es una preocupación mundial. Sin embargo, documentar dicha pérdida plantea serios desafíos metodológicos. Comparar los resultados de estudios recientes con investigaciones pasadas, no resulta fácil debido a las diferencias metodológicas. Aquí comparamos estudios que documentaron el conocimiento tradicional etnobotánico de los Chácobo en Bolivia, buscando examinar si la pérdida de conocimiento tradicional realmente ha estado sucediendo durante los últimos 100 años, o si solo era la percepción de los investigadores. Los Chácobo son una tribu Pano hablantes, actualmente conformada por aproximadamente 1000 miembros. Fueron visitados por primera vez por investigadores en 1911, y posteriormente en los años 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980 y 1990. Cada estudio tenía enfoques diferentes, pero todos registraron datos etnobotánicos. El primer informe antropológico más detallado existe desde fines de la década de 1960, y se llevaron a cabo estudios ecológico-etnobotánicos en los años ochenta y noventa. Basado en la literatura disponible, en particular los estudios botánicos de Boom (1987) y Bergeron (1998), la percepción fue que el uso de plantas por los Chácobo ahora se centraba en la generación de ingresos. Ambos autores percibieron que el uso de las plantas tradicionales relacionado con la fabricación de artefactos, la medicina tradicional, así como las variedades de cultivos tradicionales, casi habían desaparecido. Nosotros planteamos la hipótesis de que el conocimiento etnobotánico documentado y la percepción de pérdida de conocimiento observada en estudios previos, depende completamente de los antecedentes de los entrevistadores y los métodos empleados, sugiriendo que con un estudio etnobotánico suficientemente completo podríamos ser capaces de documentar todas las especies y usos mencionados en estudios previos. Probamos esta hipótesis realizando un inventario etnobotánico completo entrevistando casi la totalidad de la población adulta de los Chácobo y realizando la recolección de plantas, ambas actividades fueron desarrolladas directamente por contrapartes Chácobo. Los resultados verifican nuestra hipótesis inicial y muestran que la pérdida de conocimiento percibida en estudios previos simplemente fue un artefacto de los métodos de investigación empleados. Las variedades de cultivos tradicionales todavía se cultivan ampliamente; la mayoría de los Chácobo conocen y pueden nombrar los artefactos tradicionales, y la muchos aún conocen los nombres y los usos de las especies de plantas medicinales. Sin embargo, cierto tipo de conocimiento, incluida la fabricación de ciertos artefactos y la identificación de algunas plantas medicinales, se limitan a las generaciones más viejas.",

    "Abstract": "The prevalence of end-stage renal disease is rising in the United States, which bears high financial and public health burden. The most common modality of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the United States is in-center hemodialysis. Many patients report lack of comprehensive and timely education about their treatment options, which may preclude them from participating in home-based dialysis therapies and kidney transplantation evaluation. While RRT education has traditionally been provided in-person, the rise of telehealth has afforded new opportunities to improve upon the status quo. For example, technology-augmented RRT education has recently been implemented into telehealth nephrology clinics, informational websites and mobile applications maintained by professional organizations, patient-driven forums on social media, and multimodality programs. The benefits of technology in RRT education are increased access for geographically isolated and/or medically frail patients, versatility of content delivery, information repetition to enhance knowledge retention, and interpersonal connection for educational content and emotional support. Challenges center around privacy and accuracy of information sharing, in addition to differential access to technology due to age and socioeconomic status. A review of available scholarly and social media resources suggests that technology-aided delivery of education about treatment options for end-stage renal disease provides an important alternative and/or supplemental resource for patients and families.The prevalence of end-stage renal disease is rising in the United States, which bears high financial and public health burden.

    "Abstract": "A primary goal of nursing programs is to ensure that graduates can successfully enter into professional practice. This paper examines the relationship between competence, confidence, and knowledge retention in undergraduate nursing students. The study involved a three test quantitative component as well as a qualitative component. The quantitative component comprised a pretest, posttest immediately following the intervention, posttest three month design. The intervention was comprised of an intensive one day advanced cardiac skills knowledge and simulation activity. The three tests measured competence, confidence, and knowledge retention. The results of the study demonstrated the intervention was effective in improving perceptions of competence and confidence both immediately and at a three month timeframe. Knowledge retention also was statistically significant at a three month timeframe. This study demonstrates the value of advanced knowledge and skill for undergraduate nursing students. Despite the policy enforced reality that participants were not able to use the knowledge and skill in clinical practice, the motivational benefit of the advanced knowledge had significant positive effects on participants.A primary goal of nursing programs is to ensure that graduates can successfully enter into professional practice.

    "Abstract": "Previous research has explored the experiences of medical students using body painting as a learning tool. However, to date, faculty experiences and views have not been explored. This international qualitative study utilized a grounded theory approach with data collection through interviews with academics and clinicians who utilized body painting as part of their anatomical teaching. Twenty-six anatomists participated in the study from 14 centers worldwide. Three themes emerged from the data: (1) the efficacy of body painting, (2) the promotion of knowledge retention and recall, (3) considerations and practicalities regarding the use of body painting as a teaching tool. Subthemes show that body painting is used as an adjunct to the curriculum for teaching surface anatomy and peer examination. Benefits included diffusing the formal curricula, high student engagement and learning for future clinical practice. Body painting was advocated for promoting knowledge retention and recall, particularly learning through the process of cognitive load due to combining the use of color and kinesthetic learning with anatomical theory. Critical discussions surfaced on the topic of undressing in the classroom due to cultural and personal considerations possibly leading to unequal involvement and different learning experiences. Overall results support previous research showing that anatomists appreciate body painting as an effective, enjoyable, engaging and cost efficient adjunct to the multimodal anatomy curriculum. The role of cognitive load theory in learning anatomy through body painting emerged from the data as a possible theoretical framework supporting learning benefits from body painting and is suggested for further investigation.

BACKGROUND Spatial 3-dimensional understanding of the brain is essential to learning neuroanatomy, and 3-dimensional learning techniques have been proposed as tools to enhance neuroanatomy training. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of immersive virtual-reality neuroanatomy training and compare it to traditional paper-based methods.In this randomized controlled study, participants consisted of first- or second-year medical students from the University of Saskatchewan recruited via email and posters displayed throughout the medical school. Participants were randomly assigned to the virtual-reality group or the paper-based group and studied the spatial relations between neural structures for 12 minutes after performing a neuroanatomy baseline test, with both test and control questions. A postintervention test was administered immediately after the study period and 5-9 days later. Satisfaction measures were obtained.

A postintervention test was administered immediately after the study period and 5-9 days later. Satisfaction measures were obtained.Of the 66 participants randomly assigned to the study groups, 64 were included in the final analysis, 31 in the virtual-reality group and 33 in the paper-based group. The 2 groups performed comparably on the baseline questions and showed significant performance improvement on the test questions following study. There were no significant differences between groups for the control questions, the postintervention test questions or the 7-day postintervention test questions. Satisfaction survey results indicated that neurophobia was decreased.

    "Abstract": "Efforts are needed to ensure that smokers with lower health literacy are provided with understandable and impactful information about the health consequences of smoking and benefits of quitting. Background Efforts are needed to ensure that smokers with lower health literacy are provided with understandable and impactful information about the health consequences of smoking and benefits of quitting.To test the influence of health literacy on smokers' responses to health risk messages manipulated on framing (gain vs. loss) and emotionality (factual vs. emotional). Purpose To test the influence of health literacy on smokers' responses to health risk messages manipulated on framing (gain vs. loss) and emotionality (factual vs. emotional).Participants (N = 402) were randomized to evaluate one of four sets of smoking risk messages (factual gain-framed, factual loss-framed, emotional gain-framed, or emotional loss-framed). Multiple linear regressions examined main effects of health literacy, message emotionality, and message framing on: (a) risk perceptions, (b) behavioral expectations (i.e. cut down, limit, quit), and (c) risk knowledge. Two-way interactions of health literacy with emotionality and framing were examined for these outcomes. Analyses were based on theory-driven, a priori hypotheses. Methods Participants (N = 402) were randomized to evaluate one of four sets of smoking risk messages (factual gain-framed, factual loss-framed, emotional gain-framed, or emotional loss-framed). Multiple linear regressions examined main effects of health literacy, message emotionality, and message framing on: (a) risk perceptions, (b) behavioral expectations (i.e. cut down, limit, quit), and (c) risk knowledge. Two-way interactions of health literacy with emotionality and framing were examined for these outcomes. Analyses were based on theory-driven, a priori hypotheses.As hypothesized, main effects emerged such that smokers with higher health literacy reported stronger risk perceptions and knowledge retention regardless of message type. Additionally, emotional (vs. factual) and gain- (vs. loss-) framed messages were associated with certain lower risk perceptions regardless of health literacy level. Consistent with hypotheses, two-way crossover interactions emerged between health literacy and emotionality. Among smokers with higher health literacy, factual messages produced higher perceived risk and stronger expectations for quitting. Among smokers with lower health literacy, emotional messages produced higher perceived risk and stronger expectations for quitting. Results As hypothesized, main effects emerged such that smokers with higher health literacy reported stronger risk perceptions and knowledge retention regardless of message type. Additionally, emotional (vs. factual) and gain- (vs. loss-) framed messages were associated with certain lower risk perceptions regardless of health literacy level. Consistent with hypotheses, two-way crossover interactions emerged between health literacy and emotionality. Among smokers with higher health literacy, factual messages produced higher perceived risk and stronger expectations for quitting. Among smokers with lower health literacy, emotional messages produced higher perceived risk and stronger expectations for quitting.Health literacy plays an important role in influencing how smokers respond to different risk messages. One's health literacy should be considered when determining whether risk communications emphasize factual or emotional content. Conclusions Health literacy plays an important role in influencing how smokers respond to different risk messages. One's health literacy should be considered when determining whether risk communications emphasize factual or emotional content.",

    "Abstract": "Coping with the rapid growth of medical information requires processing and critical assessment of new information beyond simple memorization of facts, especially in the context of evidence‐based medicine (EBM). As both students and tutors experience challenges during EBM education research into learning methods that enforce indepth understanding of EBM concepts is essential for later implementation of effective health care practices. Although students intuitively predict that repeated studying produces better results, recent research has showed that retrieval practice of recovering knowledge from memory enhances actual learning, understanding, and retention of complex concepts. Effects of this phenomenon have been shown to be superior to the restudying approach, where material is being studied repeatedly (reread) but without knowledge testing. Moreover, retrieval has been demonstrated to be more effective than restudying when assessing both short‐ and long‐term effects, with the assumption being that the testing effect is the result of the mental effort, where one has to elaborate information to solve the task. As the influence of retrieval‐based learning on knowledge retention has not, we compared the effectiveness of retrieval‐based learning and standard learning by rereading on knowledge retention in medical students exposed to EBM concepts for the first time and those already familiar with these concepts.

    "Abstract": "Damage to left inferior prefrontal cortex in stroke aphasia is associated with semantic deficits reflecting poor control over conceptual retrieval, as opposed to loss of knowledge. However, little is known about how functional recruitment within the semantic network changes in patients with executive-semantic deficits. The current study acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 14 patients with semantic aphasia, who had difficulty with flexible semantic retrieval following left prefrontal damage, and 16 healthy age-matched controls, allowing us to examine activation and connectivity in the semantic network. We examined neural activity while participants listened to spoken sentences that varied in their levels of lexical ambiguity and during rest. We found group differences in two regions thought to be good candidates for functional compensation: ventral anterior temporal lobe (vATL), which is strongly implicated in comprehension, and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), which is hypothesized to work together with left inferior prefrontal cortex to support controlled aspects of semantic retrieval. The patients recruited both of these sites more than controls in response to meaningful sentences. Subsequent analysis identified that, in control participants, the recruitment of pMTG to ambiguous sentences was inversely related to functional coupling between pMTG and anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG) at rest, while the patients showed the opposite pattern. Moreover, stronger connectivity between pMTG and aSTG in patients was associated with better performance on a test of verbal semantic association, suggesting that this temporal lobe connection supports comprehension in the face of damage to left inferior prefrontal cortex. These results characterize network changes in patients with executive-semantic deficits and converge with studies of healthy participants in providing evidence for a distributed system underpinning semantic control that includes pMTG in addition to left inferior prefrontal cortex.

    "Abstract": "There is a push to use classroom technology and active teaching methods to replace didactic lectures as the most prevalent format for resident education. This multisite collaborative cohort study involving nine residency programs across the United States compared a standard slide-based didactic lecture, a facilitated group discussion via an engaged classroom, and a high-fidelity, hands-on simulation scenario for teaching the topic of acute dyspnea. The primary outcome was knowledge retention at 2 to 4 weeks. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES There is a push to use classroom technology and active teaching methods to replace didactic lectures as the most prevalent format for resident education. This multisite collaborative cohort study involving nine residency programs across the United States compared a standard slide-based didactic lecture, a facilitated group discussion via an engaged classroom, and a high-fidelity, hands-on simulation scenario for teaching the topic of acute dyspnea. The primary outcome was knowledge retention at 2 to 4 weeks.Each teaching method was assigned to three different residency programs in the collaborative according to local resources. Learning objectives were determined by faculty. Pre- and posttest questions were validated and utilized as a measurement of knowledge retention. Each site administered the pretest, taught the topic of acute dyspnea utilizing their assigned method, and administered a posttest 2 to 4 weeks later. Differences between the groups were compared using paired t-tests. METHODS Each teaching method was assigned to three different residency programs in the collaborative according to local resources. Learning objectives were determined by faculty. Pre- and posttest questions were validated and utilized as a measurement of knowledge retention. Each site administered the pretest, taught the topic of acute dyspnea utilizing their assigned method, and administered a posttest 2 to 4 weeks later. Differences between the groups were compared using paired t-tests.A total of 146 residents completed the posttest, and scores increased from baseline across all groups. The average score increased 6% in the standard lecture group (n=47), 11% in the engaged classroom (n=53), and 9% in the simulation group (n=56). The differences in improvement between engaged classroom and simulation were not statistically significant. RESULTS A total of 146 residents completed the posttest, and scores increased from baseline across all groups. The average score increased 6% in the standard lecture group (n=47), 11% in the engaged classroom (n=53), and 9% in the simulation group (n=56). The differences in improvement between engaged classroom and simulation were not statistically significant.Compared to standard lecture, both engaged classroom and high-fidelity simulation were associated with a statistically significant improvement in knowledge retention. Knowledge retention after engaged classroom and high-fidelity simulation did not significantly differ. More research is necessary to determine if different teaching methods result in different levels of comfort and skill with actual patient care. CONCLUSIONS Compared to standard lecture, both engaged classroom and high-fidelity simulation were associated with a statistically significant improvement in knowledge retention. Knowledge retention after engaged classroom and high-fidelity simulation did not significantly differ. More research is necessary to determine if different teaching methods result in different levels of comfort and skill with actual patient care.",

    "Abstract": "Damage to left inferior prefrontal cortex in stroke aphasia is associated with semantic deficits reflecting poor control over conceptual retrieval, as opposed to loss of knowledge. However, little is known about how functional recruitment within the semantic network changes in patients with executive-semantic deficits. The current study acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 14 patients with semantic aphasia, who had difficulty with flexible semantic retrieval following left prefrontal damage, and 16 healthy age-matched controls, allowing us to examine activation and connectivity in the semantic network. We examined neural activity while participants listened to spoken sentences that varied in their levels of lexical ambiguity and during rest. We found group differences in two regions thought to be good candidates for functional compensation: ventral anterior temporal lobe (vATL), which is strongly implicated in comprehension, and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), which is hypothesized to work together with left inferior prefrontal cortex to support controlled aspects of semantic retrieval. The patients recruited both of these sites more than controls in response to meaningful sentences. Subsequent analysis identified that, in control participants, the recruitment of pMTG to ambiguous sentences was inversely related to functional coupling between pMTG and anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG) at rest, while the patients showed the opposite pattern. Moreover, stronger connectivity between pMTG and aSTG in patients was associated with better performance on a test of verbal semantic association, suggesting that this temporal lobe connection supports comprehension in the face of damage to left inferior prefrontal cortex. These results characterize network changes in patients with executive-semantic deficits and converge with studies of healthy participants in providing evidence for a distributed system underpinning semantic control that includes pMTG in addition to left inferior prefrontal cortex.Damage to left inferior prefrontal cortex in stroke aphasia is associated with semantic deficits reflecting poor control over conceptual retrieval, as opposed to loss of knowledge.

    "Abstract": "Introduction Podcasts and blog posts have gained popularity in Free Open Access Medical education (FOAM). Previous work suggests that podcasts may be useful for knowledge acquisition in undergraduate medical education. However, there remains a paucity of research comparing the two mediums. This study aims to investigate if there are differences in knowledge acquisition and usage conditions by medical students using podcasts and blog posts. Methods Medical students were randomized to either the podcast or blog post group. They completed an initial online assessment of their baseline knowledge on the subject matter. Participants then received access to learning materials and were given four weeks to complete the follow-up assessment on their own time. Independent t-test, paired samples t-test, and a mixed ANOVA (analysis of variance) were conducted to assess knowledge acquisition. An intention-to-teach analysis was used to impute missing data from students lost to follow-up. Simple descriptive statistical data was used to describe media usage conditions. Results Completion of at least one follow-up assessment was comparable (68% podcasts (n = 21/31), 73% blog posts (n = 22/30)). Both groups showed significant improvements in their test scores, with an average 22% improvement for the podcast group and 29% for the blog post group. There was no significant statistical difference in knowledge acquisition between educational modalities overall. Students in the blog post group that completed both post-intervention quizzes showed a larger improvement than the podcast group in the toxicology topic, with similar improvements in the asthma topic. The podcast group tended to engage in multiple activities while using the learning materials (e.g. at least two to three of the following: driving, eating, chores, taking notes, exercising/walking), while the blog readers tended to do fewer activities (e.g. only one of the following: note taking, eating).

Poor adherence may result in prolonged disease infectiousness, drug resistance, relapse and death. The aim of this study was to assess factors influencing adherence to tuberculosis treatment in selected health facilities in Asmara, Eritrea.A qualitative study which included in-depth interviews with 12 TB patients, three focus group discussions in selected health facilities in which one group comprised eight patients and key informant interviews with three health workers. Data analysis was done by translating and transcribing the verbatim of the interviews and focus group discussions. Transcribed data was then analysed using thematic framework procedure. METHODS A qualitative study which included in-depth interviews with 12 TB patients, three focus group discussions in selected health facilities in which one group comprised eight patients and key informant interviews with three health workers. Data analysis was done by translating and transcribing the verbatim of the interviews and focus group discussions. Transcribed data was then analysed using thematic framework procedure.This study found that patients lacked knowledge about the cause, transmission and duration of treatment of TB. The most common reason mentioned for discontinuing treatment was the patient \"felt cured\". Almost half of the respondents did not know the standard treatment duration and the consequences they face if they halt treatment. Patients reported losing their job when their diagnosis was known, were too ill to continue working or unable to find daily work due to time-consuming treatment arrangements. With few exceptions, the majority of patients reported that the short distance to the clinic encouraged them to attend regular treatment follow-up. Most of the respondents were unable to get enough food, leading to stress and feelings of hopelessness. Lack of social support for most of the patients was a critical factor for adherence as were stigma, medication side effects and long treatment duration. Recognized as an enabler to treatment adherence, health workers had good communication and positive attitude towards their patients. RESULTS This study found that patients lacked knowledge about the cause, transmission and duration of treatment of TB.

Lack of social support for most of the patients was a critical factor for adherence as were stigma, medication side effects and long treatment duration. Recognized as an enabler to treatment adherence, health workers had good communication and positive attitude towards their patients.Lack of knowledge, loss of income, stigma and lack of social support, drug side effects and long treatment duration emerged as important barriers for treatment adherence. Short distances to health facilities, good communication and accepting attitude of health care providers emerged as enablers for treatment adherence. For better treatment adherence, comprehensive health education at treatment sites, patient's family members and the community at large and strengthening of social support structures need to be addressed. CONCLUSION Lack of knowledge, loss of income, stigma and lack of social support, drug side effects and long treatment duration emerged as important barriers for treatment adherence. Short distances to health facilities, good communication and accepting attitude of health care providers emerged as enablers for treatment adherence.

    "Abstract": "Attracting and retaining talented staff has always been a challenge for state DOTs. When it comes to innovative project delivery, the problem becomes more apparent as a unique set of project management skills are reqired to perform design–build services. Evaluating the best practices with respect to staff education and training for design–build roles and responsibilities can be helpful to strengthen the design–build workforce inside the state DOT. The overarching objective of this research project is to study the practices in organizational structuring and professional staffing of the innovative delivery units in several state DOTs across the nation that are actively utilizing design–build in order to: 1. Identify and analyze the latest developments and trends in project leadership staffing needs for innovative delivery programs among state DOTs across the nation; 2. Identify and analyze major challenges and barriers faced by innovative project delivery units to fulfill project leadership staffing needs; 3. Identify and analyze the organizational structure of innovative project delivery units in state DOTs with an active design–build programs; 4. Identify and analyze the skillsets, experience, and professional backgrounds of the PMs (Project Managers) in the innovative delivery units; 5. Identify the list of skills, type of expertise and key professional leadership staffing requirements for various project delivery responsibilities throughout the project lifecycle; 6. Identify and analyze the organizational structure and role of district offices in accomplishing various project delivery tasks and responsibilities; 7. Identify and analyze state DOTs’ preferred model for innovative project delivery (e.g., outsourcing to consultants, relying on in-house resources, sharing resources with the other involved offices, or a combination of those approaches), and, 8. Identify best practices in workface training, knowledge retention and sharing, and knowledge management utilized by the innovative delivery units. 9. Identify and investigate the main issues and practices related to the effective use of owner’s consultants or representative (at either program level or project level) in providing services to the design–build program. Several challenges for organizational structuring and professional staffing of design-build programs are identified by State DOTs’ subject matter experts who were surveyed by email and interviewed by phone as the following. Moreover, differences among state DOTs on how to respond to the challenges of professional staffing for innovative delivery programs and strategies to enhance professional staffing of innovative delivery programs are identified.",

    "Abstract": "Bu çalışma, çoklu ortam uygulamalarına dayalı verilen eleştirel okuma eğitiminin altıncı sınıf öğrencilerinin eleştirel okuma becerilerine olan etkisini ortaya çıkarma amacı ile yapılmıştır. Nicel ve nitel araştırma yöntemlerinin bir arada kullanıldığı karma model deseninde olan araştırma, ön test-son test ve kontrol gruplu bir çalışmadır. Toplumların bilgi bombardımanına tutulduğu 21. yy. da bireylerin bilgiyi eleştirel olarak okumasını etkileyen faktörleri incelemesi bakımından araştırma önem taşımaktadır. Çalışma, MEB’e bağlı İstanbul ili Güngören ilçesi Mustafa Kemal Ortaokulu’nda öğrenim gören altıncı sınıf öğrencileri ile Türkçe derslerinde yürütülmüştür. Sınıf mevcutları ve Türkçe dersindeki başarıları istatistikî açıdan benzer bulunan altıncı sınıf seviyesinde beş şubeden 6-E sınıfı deney ve 6-K sınıfı kontrol grubu olarak belirlenmiştir. Deney ve kontrol grubunda araştırmaya 30’ar öğrenci katılmıştır. Uygulamalar altıncı sınıf Türkçe ders kitabında bulunan “Sevgi”, “Okuma Kültürü” ve “Duygular” temalarından seçilen sekiz okuma metni ve etkinlikleri ile gerçekleştirilmiştir. Deney grubunda, Türkçe dersinde görseller, sesler, videolar, grafikler, animasyon, karikatür, resim, belgesel, müzik vb. çeşitli çoklu ortam içeriklerinin desteğinden yararlanılarak çoklu ortam uygulamalarına dayalı öğretim ortamı hazırlanmış ve çoklu ortam uygulamalarına dayalı olarak eleştirel okuma eğitimi yapılmıştır. Kontrol grubunda ise dersler, 2016-2017 eğitim-öğretim yılı Türkçe Dersi Öğretmen Kılavuz Kitabı doğrultusunda işlenmiştir. Veri toplama araçları olarak; uygulama öncesinde deney ve kontrol grubunu belirlemek ve öğrencilerin okuduğunu anlama beceri düzeylerini tespit etmek için “Okuduğunu Anlama Testi”, deney ve kontrol gruplarını belirledikten sonra ise araştırmacı tarafından oluşturulan yarı yapılandırılmış görüşme formu, öğrencilerin eleştirel okuma ve çoklu ortama ilişkin görüşlerini ortaya çıkarma adına deney grubuna uygulama öncesinde ve sonrasında, kontrol grubuna ise uygulama öncesinde yapılmıştır. Araştırmada nicel verileri toplama amacı ile araştırmacı tarafından geliştirilen “Çoklu Ortama Dayalı Eleştirel Okuma Testi” deney ve kontrol gruplarında bulunan öğrencilere ön test ve son test olarak uygulanmıştır. Araştırmadan elde edilen veriler; uygun analiz paket programları kullanılarak analiz edilmiştir. Veriler değerlendirilirken tanımlayıcı istatistik metotları (sayı, yüzde, ortalama, standart sapma) kullanılmıştır. Araştırmada nicel verilerin analizi için t testi, ANOVA ve MANOVA testleri kullanılmış; nitel verilerin analizinde ise içerik analizi, t testi ve ki-kare testi kullanılmıştır. Yapılan analizler sonucunda çoklu ortam uygulamalarına dayalı öğretim ile ders işlenen deney grubundaki öğrencilerin eleştirel okuma başarılarında bir artış olduğu gözlenirken kontrol grubunda anlamlı bir değişikliğe rastlanılmamıştır. Deney ve kontrol grubu ortalamaları arasındaki fark, deney grubu lehine olmuş ve tüm bulgularda istatistiksel açıdan anlamlı bulunmuştur. Çoklu ortama dayalı eleştirel okuma eğitiminin eleştirel okuma becerilerine etki düzeyinin yüksek olduğu belirlenmiştir. Araştırmada nitel verilerin analiz sonuçlarına göre eleştirel okuma eğitimi öncesinde deney ve kontrol gruplarının eleştirel okuma ve çoklu ortam kullanımına ilişkin görüşlerinin benzer olduğu, eğitim sonrasında ise deney grubundaki öğrencilerin çoklu ortama dayalı eleştirel okuma uygulamalarından memnun oldukları ortaya çıkmıştır. Buna göre eleştirel okuma eğitiminin öğrencilerin okuduğunu anlama, yorumlama, değerlendirme, karşılaştırma, bilgiyi somutlaştırabilme ve kalıcılığını sağlama ve çıkarımda bulunma gibi becerilerini geliştirdiği tespit edilmiştir. Bu sonuçlara göre araştırmacının önerileri şöyledir: Çoklu ortam uygulamaları eleştirel okumaya katkı sağladığından Türkçe Öğretim Programına eklenebilir, bunlar Türkçe derslerinde ve diğer derslerde kullanılabilir. Türkçe öğretim programlarında ve ders kitaplarında eleştirel okumayı ele alan kazanım, uygulama ve etkinlikler artırılabilir. Çoklu ortama dayalı eleştirel okuma uygulamalarını ele alan çalışmalar ortaöğretim ve lisans düzeylerinde de yapılabilir. Alternate abstract: The present study was conducted to determine the effect of multimedia-based critical reading education on critical reading skills of 6th grade students. The study, which is a mixed model, is a pre-test, post-test and control group study. In the 21st century, when societies are bombarded with information, research is important in terms of examining the factors affecting the reading of information critically. The study was conducted with 6th grade Turkish language students at Mustafa Kemal Middle School in Güngören district of İstanbul province which is a public school under the Ministry of National Education. Among the five 6 th grade classes with similar size and academic achievement, Class 6E was determined as the experiment and Class 6K was determined as the control group. 30 students participated in the study in the experimental and control groups. The applications were carried out with eight reading texts and activities selected from the themes “Love,” “Reading Culture,” and “Emotions” in 6th grade Turkish language textbook. In the experimental group, a multimedia-based educational environment was created with the support of multimedia content such as visuals, audio, videos, graphics, animation, cartoons, pictures, documentaries, music, etc. in Turkish language course and multimedia-based critical reading education was conducted. In the control group, the courses were instructed based on the 2016-2017 academic year Turkish Language Teacher's Guidebook. Data collection instruments included “Reading Comprehension Test,” which was applied to determine the experiment and control groups before the study and to determine the reading comprehension levels of the students and a semi-structured interview form developed by the researcher, which was applied to the experiment group before and after the application and to the control group before the application to determine the views of the students on critical reading and multimedia. To collect the quantitative data in the study, “Multimedia-Based Critical Reading Test,” developed by the researcher, was applied as pre- and post-tests to students in experiment and control groups. The study data were analyzed using the appropriate analysis package programs to determine the critical reading achievements of the students and their views on critical reading skills and instruction were analyzed. Descriptive statistical methods (count, percentage, mean, standard deviation) were used in data analysis. T test, ANOVA and MANOVA tests were used for the quantitative data analysis. In the analysis of qualitative data, content analysis, t-test and chi-square test were used. The analyses conducted in the present study demonstrated that there was an increase in the critical reading achievements of the students in the experimental group who were instructed with multimedia-based activities, while there was no significant change in the control group. The difference between the mean experiment and control group scores favored the experiment group and was statistically significant based on all findings. It was determined that multimedia-based critical reading education had a significant impact on critical reading skills. The analysis of qualitative data demonstrated that the views of the students in the experiment and control groups on critical reading and multimedia use were similar before the critical reading education; however, the students in the experiment group were satisfied with the multimedia-based critical reading activities. Thus, it was concluded that critical reading education improved students’ reading comprehension, interpretation, evaluation, comparison, concretization, knowledge retention and inference skills. According to these results, the researcher's suggestions are as follows: Since multimedia applications contribute to critical reading, they can be added to the Turkish Curriculum and used in Turkish courses and other courses. Acquisition, practice and activities that address critical reading in Turkish curricula and textbooks can be increased. Studies on critical reading practices based on multiple media can be done at secondary and undergraduate levels.",

    "Abstract": "Audience: This curriculum, created and implemented at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, was designed to educate our emergency medicine (EM) residents, PGY-1 to PGY-3, as well as medical students and attending physicians. Introduction: In 2013, chest pain alone was the principal reason for visit for over 6 million Emergency Department visits in the United States. This represents 4.9% of all Emergency Department visits.1 Residents must be proficient in the differential diagnosis and management of the wide variety of cardiovascular emergencies. The flipped classroom curricular model emphasizes self-directed learning activities completed by learners, followed by small group discussions pertaining to the topic reviewed. The active learning fostered by this curriculum increases faculty and learner engagement and interaction time typically absent in traditional lecture-based formats.2-4 Studies have revealed that the application of knowledge through case studies, personal interaction with content experts, and integrated questions are effective learning strategies for emergency medicine residents.4-6 The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center EM Residency didactic curriculum recently transitioned to a “flipped classroom” approach.7-10 We created this innovative curriculum aimed to improve our residency education program and to share educational resources with other EM residency programs. Our curriculum utilizes an 18-month curricular cycle to cover the defined emergency medicine content. The flipped classroom curriculum maximizes didactic time and resident engagement, fosters intellectual curiosity and active learning, and meets the needs of today’s learners. 3,11,13 Aims/Goals: We aim to teach the presentation and management of cardiovascular emergencies through the creation of a flipped classroom design. This unique, innovative curriculum utilizes resources chosen by education faculty and resident learners, study questions, real-life experiences, and small group discussions in place of traditional lectures. In doing so, a goal of the curriculum is to encourage self-directed learning, improve understanding and knowledge retention, and improve the educational experience of our residents. Methods: The educational strategies used in this curriculum include small group modules authored by education faculty and content experts based on the core emergency medicine content. This program also includes resident-submitted questions that were developed during review of the content. The question and answer format of the Socratic Method--with a focus on fostering an open learning environment, not negative “pimping”-type questionin--is used during small group sessions to encourage active participation and discussion; small groups also focus on the synthesis and application of knowledge through the discussion of real life experiences. The use of free open access medical education (FOAM) resources allows learners to work at their own pace and maximize autonomy. Topics: Emergency medicine, flipped classroom, medical education, cardiovascular emergencies, pedagogy, teaching.",

    "Abstract": "Various information measures have been defined on Bayes Nets (BN) with the assumption that the Bayes Net is stationary. Our interest is in the utilization of a BN as a component of a real-time, information-based sensor management system wherein the dynamics of the situation cause changes both in the structure and underlying probabilities of the nodes in the BN. If a BN is used to represent the situation assessment (SA) of an environment as a result of our observations of that environment, we can say that the BN represents our knowledge about the situation in the form of a temporal Bayes net (TBN). If one were to not observe the processes in an environment with additional sensor observations, then the underlying probabilities of at least some of the BN nodes diffuse at a rate dependent on the dynamics of the process whose uncertainty is represented by that node, hence the use of the modifier temporal. This loss of knowledge in the form of increasing uncertainty results in information flow from the TBN, or, as we refer to it here, temporal information loss. In order to compensate for this temporal information loss and maintain or improve our knowledge of an environment, the environment needs to be observed by obtaining data. We focus in this paper on choosing a global TBN information measure In doing so, we differentiate between aleatory nodes with stationary uncertainties and epistemic nodes with temporal uncertainties, as well as formulate a dynamic representation of these temporal uncertainties. We provide several examples of temporal information loss under different dynamic assumptions.",

    "Abstract": "A prevenção da intenção de turnover tem sido uma preocupação constante tanto para a gestão de recursos humanos como para as organizações. A perda do talento resulta em diversas consequências nefastas tais como a perda de conhecimento, novos gastos em recrutamento, quebras na produtividade e a perda de vantagem competitiva. Como tal, urge a necessidade de compreender os fatores que possam explicar e diminuir esta taxa de saída dos colaboradores da empresa. Dos diferentes fatores que têm sido associados à intenção de turnover , a inteligência emocional surge como uma característica indispensável na gestão das emoções que pode ter impacto na intenção de turnover . Contudo, a literatura tem-se focado na inteligência emocional do próprio, não demonstrando a importância que a inteligência emocional das chefias pode ter na retenção de talento. Perante esta ideia, esta Dissertação pretende demonstrar a influência de fatores individuais e contextuais na relação entre inteligência emocional das chefias e intenção de turnover . O modelo de investigação foi testado numa amostra de cerca de 200 colaboradores escolarizados e com idades compreendidas entre os 20 e os 58 anos, numa consultora tecnológica. Os resultados obtidos permitem aferir uma relação significativa entre inteligência emocional das chefias e intenção de turnover e a potencialidade de pesquisas futuras neste tema. Nomeadamente, um modelo mais robusto para tentar perceber que outras variáveis podem mediar a relação entre inteligência emocional das chefias e intenção de turnover . Alternate abstract: The prevention of turnover intention has been a constant concern for both human resources management and organizations. The loss of talent results in a number of disastrous consequences, such as loss of knowledge, new recruitment expenditures, productivity losses and a loss of the competitive advantage. As such, there is an urgent need to understand the factors that can explain and reduce turnover intention. Regarding all the different factors that have been associated with turnover intention, emotional intelligence emerges as an indispensable characteristic in the management of emotions that can have a great impact on turnover intention. However, the literature has focused on self-emotional intelligence, not demonstrating the real effect that the emotional intelligence of the managers can have on talent retention. Given this idea, this dissertation intends to demonstrate the influence of individual and contextual factors in the relationship between emotional intelligence of the managers and turnover intention. The research model was tested in a sample of about 200 highly educated employees between the ages of 20 and 58, in a technological consultancy firm. It was found a significant relationship between emotional intelligence of the managers and turnover intention and it showed the necessity to study the specificity of this business area. A more robust model should be studied in a larger sample, in order to understand which other variables may mediate the relationship between emotional intelligence of the managers and turnover intention.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hands-only bystander CPR increases survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Video-based CPR instruction in schools has been proposed as a means to mass-educate laypersons in Hands-only CPR™ (HOCPR), in developed as well as developing countries. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to determine whether a brief video- and mannequin-based instructional program, developed by the American Heart Association (AHA), is an effective strategy for teaching Costa Rican middle- and high-school age children to learn the steps of HOCPR. Methods: This study took place in four educational centers that spanned the entire socioeconomic spectrum within the Grand Metropolitan Area of Costa Rica. Three hundred and eight students from the sixth to eleventh grades participated. The intervention included exposure to the AHA “CPR Anytime” video and practice with CPR mannequins. Before and after the intervention, students took a four-question, multiple-choice quiz that measured their knowledge of the correct steps and proper techniques of HOCPR; a separate question assessed their level of comfort “doing CPR on someone with a cardiac arrest.” Pre- and post-intervention “percent correct” scores were compared and tested for statistical significance using paired t-tests or the McNemar test as appropriate. Improvement in knowledge and comfort levels were also compared across the different educational centers and compared with similar programs implemented in the United States. Results: The students’ overall scores (mean percent correct) on the multiple choice questions more than doubled after training (40.9% ± 1.4% before training vs. 92.5% ± 0.9% after training, p < 0.00001). Improvements were observed in each school, regardless of geographic location or socioeconomic status. Knowledge of the appropriate steps of HOCPR doubled after training (42.2% before training vs. 92.5% after training, p < 0.000001). Post-intervention, a majority (73%) of children reported comfort with performing CPR on an individual who had suffered a cardiac arrest. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the AHA “CPR Anytime” program in teaching HOCPR to school-age children within the Grand Metropolitan Area of Costa Rica. Additional studies are needed to measure longer-term knowledge retention and students’ ability to perform CPR in simulated cardiac arrest settings.",

    "Abstract": "The prime aim of this thesis is to establish to what extent can companies prevent knowledge loss due to the change of personnel and the loss o f employees. In order to answer to this question, firstly the concept of knowledge and its various definitions and classifications are looked into, with the most significant distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge at its spearhead. The literature review including classical texts of Ikujiro Nonaka, who coined the concept o f knowledge creating companies at the beginning o f 1990s, has been conducted. Hence, the literature review dates back to the beginning o f the 1990s demonstrating the development of ideas and concepts throughout almost three decades up to today. Subsequently, the thesis analyzes different classical approaches to the process o f knowledge creation, conducting the in-depth analysis o f Nonaka's approach, known as model SECI, elaborating on concept o f Ba and knowledge conversion taking place in corresponding Ba's such as socialization, externalization, combination and internalization. It is Nonaka's theory that became the base for further consideration of the problem from theoretical and practical viewpoints, giving rise to the concept o f knowledge creating companies, as well as the discipline o f Knowledge Management. The further part o f this thesis aims to assess the current situation in Portuguese IT consulting companies by analyzing the survey, previously prepared and conducted in the above-mentioned type of companies in Portugal. Basing on the data gathered, the final conclusions and recommendations are drawn, presenting the current situation in Portuguese IT consulting companies, by looking into the following three main categories o f information: (1) the check-up o f skills and knowledge level on the stage o f recruitment to the company, as well as after probationary period, (2) providing employees with training of various type, including training courses related to their discipline as well as other skills, e.g. foreign languages or soft skills, and, more importantly for this thesis, (3) the openness o f information and knowledge flow in the organization. The latter proves to be o f the upmost importance for this thesis since it demonstrates i f the organization is prepared and encouraging for its employees to socialize, and hence, to share their thoughts in an informal way, which is the only way o f tacit knowledge to be passed on.",

    "Abstract": "Case-based scenarios are the foundation of many continuing professional development (CPD) activities. In spite of the lack of literature on methodologically sound approaches to designing online health education, there is evidence that the use of case-based scenarios in continuing professional development (CPD) can effectively promote authentic learning experiences relevant to clinical practice (Ryan et al. 2007; Shaw et al. 2011; Janssen et al. 2016). METHODOLOGY REAL-WORLD EDUCATIONAL DESIGN EXPERIENCE The CASE methodology draws on over two decades of experience by the authors in developing cases for online education programs targeted at a wide variety of health professionals, including physicians (Jiwa et al. 2014), oncologists (Robinson et al. 2017) and nurses (Phillips et al. 2014), The CASE methodology is applicable to the development of case-based learning scenarios that are designed to capture the attention of busy practicing clinicians.

    "Abstract": "This study sought to explore whether a paradigm shift is needed to implement a Systems Thinking approach in risk mitigation strategies on Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects. Underpinned in Principal Agent Theory and Systems Thinking, the study followed a qualitative methodology. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted over a month. Ten practitioners from the public and private sectors, with relevant South African health sector PPP experience, were purposively selected. Key study findings revealed different perspectives held by public and private parties regarding risk identification, analysis and mitigation, driven by their conflicting mandates. Institutional knowledge loss within the public sector was found to erode the rigour of risk mitigation. Barriers to adopting a Systems Thinking Approach were: entrenched standards validated by existing international practice, culture of silo-ism; lack of leadership support for innovation and bureaucratic processes. The study has business implications since optimal risk allocation influences private sector investment appetite. Private sector collaboration is critical to achieve the infrastructure goals set out by the National Development Plan. Key study insights propose policy amendments, knowledge management and a mind-set change to mitigate health PPP project risk. Areas for future research are delineated.",

    "Abstract": "Num cenário de saída dos colaboradores por reforma, as empresas deparam-se com a perda do conhecimento crítico, um dos maiores ativos empresariais. Este trabalho consiste no desenho de um projeto piloto de retenção de conhecimento sénior na área da Manutenção do Metropolitano de Lisboa, EPE, que possa ser replicado nas restantes áreas da Empresa e até mesmo, noutras organizações, com a necessária customização. No projeto pretende-se responder à questão de como pode o Metro reter o conhecimento crítico perante um cenário de saída por reforma dos detentores desse conhecimento. A metodologia utilizada na recolha de dados permite uma complementaridade entre os elementos qualitativos ( focus group e entrevistas individuais semiestruturadas) e os quantitativos (questionário). Com base na literatura e nos elementos recolhidos é concebida uma framework de retenção de conhecimento sénior com cinco fases: preliminar; mapeamento de pessoas e de conhecimento; transferência, integração e avaliação de resultados. Destas fases, a transferência é a mais relevante, pressupondo, consoante o tipo de conhecimento, a aplicação de ferramentas e de processos, quer relacionados com a codificação, quer com a interação pessoal designadamente, o mentoring , o plano de sucessão técnico ou o programa de job-shadowing . Contudo, existem ferramentas de retenção de conhecimento cuja aplicação pode ficar limitada por razões exógenas ao Metro, relacionadas com a falta de autonomia para recrutar. Alternate abstract: Companies face the loss of critical knowledge, one of its vital assets, in scenarios of experienced workers’ retirement. This thesis consists in the design of a pilot project of senior knowledge retention in the Maintenance Division of ‘Metropolitano de Lisboa, EPE’ (Metro), which could then be replicated into other areas of the Company and even other organizations, with the appropriate customization. The aim of this project is to answer the question of how can Metro retain the critical knowledge of these workers, once they leave the company. The research methodology encompasses both qualitative (focus group and semi-structured interviews) and quantitative (questionnaires) data. Based on the literature and collected data, a framework of senior knowledge retention was then defined along 5 stages: preliminary, people-knowledge mapping, knowledge transfer, integration and results evaluation. Among these stages, knowledge transfer has a pivotal role, assuming that, for a given type of knowledge, distinct tools and processes must then be applied, either regarding documentation or personal interaction such as a mentoring program , a technical succession plan or a job shadowing program. Nevertheless, the efficiency and effectiveness of some knowledge retention tools may be refrained, in some organizational scenarios, due to external factors – such as the lack of recruiting autonomy at Metro. Considering that this is a project defined to retain senior knowledge, with structured stages, it is believed that it will add value to the organization as a whole, in a resilient and innovative way.",

Prior to the treatment, they sat for their prettest. Immediate posttest and delayed posttest were conducted after the treatment cycles. Results of the tests have shown significant intragroup effects of dictogloss and consciousness-raising on participants’ comprehension, writing tasks and also their knowledge retention of English simple past tense over time. However, only comprehension test have shown significant intergroup (between groups) results with DG group performing better than C-R and the control groups. Interview with selected participants had also been conducted to look at the other factors that might influence these outcomes. These factors include motivation, learning styles, their affective filter and also their ‘noticing’ awareness.",

    "Abstract": "Hoje em dia, em tempos de crescente globalização e rápido avanço tecnológico, tornou-se claro que para ter sucesso as empresas devem evitar a perda de conhecimento. Se querem manter-se competitivas, devem reconhecer a importância dos recursos humanos como o principal ativo e explorar ao máximo o seu potencial de desenvolvimento através do investimento em formação contínua de forma a prover os seus funcionários de habilidades e conhecimentos adicionais. A literatura acerca das práticas de recursos humanos e desempenho das organizações sugere que existe uma associação positiva entre as duas variáveis. Contudo, embora haja muitos estudos conceituais acerca da relação existente entre as práticas de RH e o desempenho, poucos são os estudos empíricos que realmente testam essa relação de causalidade, especialmente no que diz respeito a formação. Assim, a presente pesquisa tem como objetivo analisar o efeito potencial do desenvolvimento de recursos humanos, da aprendizagem organizacional e da formação profissional na melhoria do desempenho organizacional. De forma a alcançar esses objetivos, optou-se por uma abordagem qualitativa e quantitativa, através da condução de um questionário a 53 colaboradores das instituições bancárias são-tomenses e em paralelo, da realização de entrevistas semiestruturadas aos cinco responsáveis de RH das instituições em estudo. Os resultados revelam que a gestão eficiente de pessoas e o desenvolvimento de RH estão positiva e significativamente relacionadas com a melhoria do desempenho. No entanto, apesar de haver consciência de que a formação e a promoção da aprendizagem organizacional são bastante benéficas e possibilitam o aumento da qualidade do trabalho, ambas mostraram não ter um efeito estatisticamente significativo na melhoria do desempenho. Os resultados indicam ainda que, apesar das limitações orçamentais, é necessário investir cada vez mais em formação adequada às necessidades dos colaboradores em consonância com os objetivos estratégicos e melhorar os sistemas de aprendizagem organizacionais. Alternate abstract: Nowadays, in times of increasing globalization and rapid technological advancement, it has become clear that to succeed companies must avoid the loss of knowledge. If they want to remain competitive, they must recognize the value of human resources as the main asset and maximize their growth potential by investing in ongoing training that provides their employees additional skills and knowledge. The existing literature about HR practices and company performance suggests that there is a positive association between the two variables. However, although there are many conceptual studies on the relationship between HR practices and performance, few empirical studies actually test this causal relationship, specially regarding to training. Thus, the present research aims to analyze the potential effect of human resource development, organizational learning and training in improving organizational performance. In order to reach these objectives, a qualitative and quantitative approach was chosen by conducting a questionnaire to 53 employees of santomean banking institutions and in parallel, by conducting semi-structured interviews with five HR managers from those institutions. The results reveal that efficient people management and the of HR development are positively and significantly associated with performance improvement. However, despite the awareness that training and the promotion of organizational learning are very beneficial and can increase the quality of work, both have shown to have no statistically significant effect on performance improvement. The results also show that despite budgetary constraints, it is fundamental to invest even more in appropriate training to the needs of employees, in line with strategic objectives and improve organizational learning systems.",

    "Abstract": "Despite the understanding that loss of knowledge resulting from demographic changes in the workforce, in particular, the massive retirement of baby-boomers, constitutes a high potential risk in advanced economies, research on knowledge continuity (KC) is scant. In particular, empirical research of the antecedents that determine inter-generation KC behavior (KCB) is limited mainly to qualitative studies emphasizing the departing employees' perceptions. The study presented in this dissertation addressed this gap in the literature by adopting a broader perspective to investigate the antecedents of effective inter-generation KC behavior among knowledge workers, incorporating personal and organizational factors before their retirement and the effectiveness of KC behavior after their retirement. Furthermore, we offer a first-of-its-kind multiple-stakeholder approach to the investigation of inter-generation KC, considering the perceptions of various stakeholders that may affect and be affected by knowledge continuity. The study comprised three phases. First, we identified dyads of soon-to-retire employees and their successors in a large technology-intensive firm. In the second and third phases, to test the study hypotheses, we used a longitudinal design to collect data at two time points, before and after the workers’ retirement (six months after retirement). Data were collected from 87 dyads and their relevant supervisors and colleagues. The findings suggest that the interaction between soon-to retire employees and their successors embedded in trust relations is positively related to KC behavior, but does not indirectly influence KC effectiveness (KCE) as mediated by KC behavior. Moreover, the workers’ perceptions of task interdependence do not moderate these relationships. In addition, transformational leadership does not affect KC behavior directly and does not indirectly influence KC effectiveness. However, the effects of successors and supervisors’ perceptions of task interdependence were found to moderate these relationships. Transformational leadership is positively associated with KC behavior, but only among successors who perceive low task interdependence. Furthermore, KC behavior is positively associated with KC effectiveness only among supervisors who perceive high task interdependence. Finally, a moderated-mediation effect of transformational leadership style and task interdependence on KC effectiveness via KC behavior is found. The analysis results demonstrate differences in stakeholders' perceptions. We identified that the supervisors' demonstrated a \"blind spot,\" which, given their role in enabling KC, may have crucial implications in terms of their willingness to act and invest in KC processes. In summary, considering the growing senior population that will be ageing and exiting the workforce in the coming years, the current study sheds light on the influence of different characteristics and needs among different generations and their implications for KC behavior and KC effectiveness. We discuss the important role of managers' behaviors and stakeholders' perceptions in KC among knowledge workers and how human resources practices can help facilitate inter-generation KC and harness its effectiveness. Alternate abstract: למרות ההבנה כי אובדן ידע נוכח שינויים דמוגרפיים בכח העבודה, ובפרט- פרישתם המאסיבית של \"בייבי-בומרס\", הינו בעל פוטנציאל סיכון גבוה בעידן כלכלה מתקדמת, מחקרים העוסקים בנושא המשכיות ידע הינם מעטים. באופן מדויק, מחקרים אמפיריים לגבי הגורמים המסבירים התנהגות המשכיות ידע בין-דורית מוגבלים בעיקר למחקרים איכותניים, המדגישים בעיקר את נקודת מבטו של הפורש. המחקר הנוכחי מטפל בפערים הללו על ידי אימוץ נקודת מבט רחבה, על מנת לחקור את המנבאים להתנהגות המשכיות ידע בין דורית בקרב עובדי ידע, הכוללת שילוב בחינת גורמים אישיים וארגוניים לפני פרישה, והאפקטיביות של אותה התנהגות, לאחר הפרישה. יתר על כן, המחקר מציע, לראשונה, גישה מרובת בעלי עניין כדי לחקור המשכיות ידע בין-דורית, הלוקחת בחשבון תפיסות של מגוון בעלי עניין, העשויים להשפיע ולהיות מושפעים מהמשכיות הידע. המחקר כלל שלושה שלבים. ראשית, מיפינו צימודים )דיאדות( של עובדים לקראת פרישת גיל ו\"יורשיהם\" בחברה עתירת-טכנולוגיה גדולה. בשלב השני והשלישי, על מנת לבחון את השערות המחקר, ביצענו שימוש בטכניקת מחקר אורך בשתי נקודות זמן, לפני ואחרי פרישה )6 חודשים לאחר הפרישה(. הנתונים נאספו מ – 87\" צמדים\" של עובדים אשר השיבו לשאלון, כמו גם הממונים והעמיתים שלהם בעבודה. מן הממצאים עולה כי האינטראקציה בין הפורש ליורש המגולמת במידת יחסי האמון ביניהם קשורה באופן חיובי להתנהגות המשכיות ידע, אך אינה בעלת השפעה עקיפה על אפקטיביות המשכיות ידע. יתרה מזו, תפיסות לגבי רמת תלות המשימה אינן מתערבות בקשרי הגומלין הללו. בנוסף, מנהיגות טרנספורמטיבית אינה קשורה באופן ישיר להתנהגות המשכיות ידע, ואינה בעלת השפעה עקיפה על אפקטיביות המשכיות ידע. אולם, נמצאו השפעות של תפיסות יורשים ומנהלים לגבי רמת תלות המשימה, כמתערבות בקשרי הגומלין הללו. מנהיגות טרנספורמטיבית נמצאה קשורה באופן חיובי להתנהגות המשכיות ידע רק בקרב יורשים התופסים כי אינם תלויים אחד בשני לביצוע המשימה. יתר על כן, התנהגות המשכיות ידע קשורה באופן חיובי לאפקטיביות המשכיות ידע, רק כאשר מנהלים תופסים כי קיימת תלות בקרב העובדים לביצוע המשימה. לבסוף, תפיסות הממונים והיורשים לגבי רמת תלות משימה נמצאו כמתערבות בקשר העקיף בין סגנון מנהיגות טרנספורמטיבי לבין אפקטיביות המשכיות ידע. הממצאים הראו שקיימים פערים בתפיסות בין בעלי העניין השונים, כשזיהינו תופעה של מעין \"נקודת עיוורון\" בקרב המנהלים. בהינתן שלמנהלים תפקיד מפתח במימוש המשכיות ידע, יש לתופעה זו השלכות משמעותיות בנכונותם לפעול ולהשקיע בתהליכי המשכיות ידע. לסיכום, בהינתן הגידול בהיקף האוכלוסייה המתבגרת היוצאת מכח העבודה בשנים הקרובות, המחקר הנוכחי שופך אור על השפעת ההבדלים במאפיינים ובצרכים בקרב הדורות השונים והשלכותיהם על התנהגות המשכיות ידע והאפקטיביות שלה. אנו דנים בתפקיד החשוב שיש להתנהגות המנהלים ולתפיסות בעלי העניין השונים, בהתייחס להמשכיות ידע בקרב עובדי ידע וכיצד פרקטיקות משאבי אנוש יכולות לסייע להמשכיות ידע בין-דורית ולהשגת האפקטיביות שלה.",

    "Abstract": "The goal of this longitudinal study was to measure the attitudes and behaviors of participants of the Marsh Maneuvers program over the course of the last 25 years. The goal of the Marsh Maneuvers program is to educate students into becoming environmentally literate adults. Environmental literacy is considered herein to be people possessing knowledge about and positive attitudes and behaviors towards the environment. Although students learn basic science and environmental knowledge in the classroom, true environmental literacy is believed to require more hands-on understanding of the material. To evaluate the effectiveness of the program, the following three objectives were completed. Lesson plans for the Marsh Maneuvers camp were developed in order to identify specific concepts being taught. The short-term knowledge retention of the Marsh Maneuvers participants was analyzed using pre-and posttests. Finally, the long-term impact of the Marsh Maneuvers program over the past 25 years was determined using a survey. When analyzing the short-term retention results, there was a 36% average increase in knowledge between pre and posttests, which was significant. Nontraditional education programs are designed to overcome barriers that can be presented in a traditional classroom setting (gender, age, GPA). All participants, regardless of gender, age, or GPA, saw an increase in knowledge during the program. The long-term survey results showed that Marsh Maneuvers participants had slightly more positive attitudes and behaviors. The Marsh Maneuvers participants demonstrated environmental knowledge similar to the control group with only one question being statistically significant between the two groups. Marsh Maneuvers is an effective informal education program to increase environmental literacy for 4-H members in Louisiana based on short and long term study results.",

    "Abstract": "Learning is an iterative process which consists of knowledge acquisition, assessment of supposed knowledge, identification of misconceptions, and refinement of understanding. Within courses, teachers often employ textbook review questions as a method of assessing student knowledge retention. However, student attempts to resolve misconceptions or reinforce concepts following these questions may leave them searching large expanses of textbook content. This project aims to alleviate this problem by providing formative feedback in the form of textbook passages. By utilizing question answering and reading comprehension methodologies, a search algorithm for selecting relevant material within textbooks is developed. The algorithm capitalizes on the inherent structure of textbooks which, intuitively, reduces the search space. Evaluation of question answering and information retrieval practices in the education domain is performed beyond simple factoid questions. Results are compared to data collected via subject matter experts, and limitations of these models, as they pertain to textbooks, are explored.",

    "Abstract": "In the knowledge economy, knowledge becomes a strategic resource for any company contributing significantly to achieving its competitive advantage. Knowledge risk is associated with any knowledge activity which is done under the pressure of uncertainty. Researchers focus their attention especially on the following types of knowledge risks: knowledge loss, knowledge leakage, knowledge spillover, knowledge outsourcing, knowledge gaps, and improper use of knowledge. All the researchers analyze knowledge risk by using for knowledge the metaphor of stock-and-flow, which implies that knowledge is considered in its explicit form as being rational. According to the theory of knowledge fields, which is based on the metaphor of knowledge as energy, we consider a holistic approach comprising the rational knowledge field, emotional knowledge field, and spiritual knowledge field. In this perspective, the risk is associated with each knowledge field such that the whole phenomenon of knowledge risk becomes more complex. The purpose of this paper is to present a holistic approach to the knowledge risk based on this theory of knowledge fields and the energy metaphor for knowledge. It is a conceptual analysis based on metaphorical thinking and literature background. Our findings lead to a larger perspective in understanding and using the concept of knowledge risk in knowledge management.",

    "Abstract": "Background In 2014, to help family medicine residents prepare for their certification examination, the ITPCRG team (McGill University-Department of Family Medicine) created an IAM smartphone application. This mobile app was inspired by the concept of spaced education (SE). We operationalized SE as follows: access to clinical information on the 99 Priority Topics in Family Medicine and their Key Features, a weekly alert to read one new topic, open ended test questions, and answer feedback. SE has positive effects on long-term knowledge retention in highly focused specialties. However, SE has not yet been studied in the context of the family medicine residency. This study aimed to describe residents' participation in SE, explore the factors that influenced sustainable participation in SE mediated by weekly alerts on the IAM app, and describe strategies for IAM app improvement from residents' perspectives. Objectives Quantitative: (1) To estimate the extent to which an intervention (weekly alerts on the mobile app as a mediator of SE) stimulates residents to visit the IAM app during their first year of training, (2) To identify participants for the second qualitative phase (residents following alerts most closely and least closely). Qualitative: (1) To describe factors, from the perspectives of residents, which facilitate or hinder sustainable participation in SE mediated by weekly alerts, (2) To describe strategies recommended by residents for improvement of the IAM app as an information system for SE. Methodology and methods: Using a sequential explanatory mixed methods research design, two sequential studies were performed. Phase 1: Pre-experimental study was conducted to describe app use among incoming first year family medicine residents at McMaster (2015) and to identify participants for the second qualitative phase (residents following alerts most closely and least closely). Phase 2: In qualitative descriptive study, 13 residents were interviewed. Semi-structured interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis (deductive-inductive approach) to describe residents' perspectives. Results In phase 1, 81 of 96 (84%) first year residents consented to participate in the study. Typical participants were between 25 and 31 years old, predominantly female (71%) and predominantly using iOS devices (76%). Of 81 residents who consented to participate in the study, 65 residents (80%) installed and used the app. A count of page visits per month revealed that the effect of alerts from the IAM app was not sustained. The stimulating effect of alerts was observed only during the first two months of the study. For these who used the IAM app, the number of topics of the week each resident visited within 1-week of the alert (or alert visits) varied from 0 to 34 (mean=1.7, SD=4.5), and the total number of pages each participant visited (total page visits) varied from 1 to 442 (mean=28.3, SD=61.4). In phase 2, both barriers and facilitators to resident's sustainable participation in SE mediated by weekly alerts appeared to fall into five dimensions: user-related factors, information content factors, mobile app design factors, alert system factors, and service factors. Strategies for improvement of the IAM app appeared to fall into four dimensions: information content factors, mobile app design factors, alert system factors, and service factors. Discussion and conclusion These study findings were consistent with the literature on SE. Inspired by the DeLone and McLean Information Systems (IS) Success Model, five dimensions (user-related factors, information content factors, mobile app design factors, alert system factors, and service factors) appear to be potential predictors of users' sustainable participation in SE. Results of this study were used to modify the IAM app according to residents' needs. The next phase of the IAM app project will test a new version of the IAM app and measure the effectiveness of SE. Alternate abstract: Introduction En 2014, le Groupe de recherche sur les technologies de l'information en soins primaires (ITPCRG) a créé une application mobile IAM. Inspirée du concept de l'éducation espacée (EE), l'application IAM a été développée pour aider les résidents en médecine de famille à se préparer à l'examen de certification. L'EE a été mise en œuvre en utilisant 99 sujets d'étude prioritaires (éléments clés), des alertes hebdomadaires incitant à lire un nouveau sujet, et une question ouverte avec une réponse correcte pour chaque sujet. L'EE a des effets positifs sur la mémoire à long terme dans des domaines très spécialisés. Toutefois, l'EE n'a pas encore été étudiée dans le contexte de la formation postdoctorale en médecine de famille. Cette étude visait à décrire la participation des résidents à l'EE, à explorer les facteurs qui ont influencé la participation durable à l'EE médiée par les alertes hebdomadaires de l'application IAM. Objectifs Quantitatifs: 1) Estimer dans quelle mesure une intervention (alertes hebdomadaires sur l'application mobile en tant que médiateur de l'EE) stimule les résidents à utiliser l'application IAM au cours de leur première année de formation; 2) Identifier des participants pour la deuxième phase qualitative (résidents suivant les alertes de la manière la plus assidue et la moins assidue). Qualitatifs: 1) Décrire les facteurs, du point de vue des résidents, qui facilitent ou entravent la participation durable à l'EE médiée par une alerte hebdomadaire; 2) Décrire les stratégies recommandées par les résidents pour l'amélioration de l'application IAM en tant que système d'information pour faciliter l'EE. Méthodologie et méthodes Dans un devis mixte séquentiel explicatif, deux phases de recherche ont été réalisées. Phase 1: Une étude pré-expérimentale a été menée pour décrire l'utilisation de l'application chez les résidents de première année en médecine de famille à McMaster (2015) et pour identifier les participants pour la deuxième phase qualitative. Phase 2: Dans une étude descriptive qualitative, 13 résidents ont été interviewés. J'ai utilisé une approche déductive et inductive pour analyser des entrevues semi-structurées (analyse thématique) afin de décrire les points de vue des résidents. Résultats Phase 1: 81 des 96 résidents ont consenti à participer. Les résidents typiques avaient entre 25 et 31ans, principalement des femmes (71%), et utilisaient des appareils mobiles iOS (76%). Sur les 81 résidents qui ont consenti à participer, 65 résidents (80%) ont installé l'application IAM. Le nombre de pages visitées par mois a révélé que l'effet des alertes n'était pas maintenu. L'impact stimulant des alertes a été observé uniquement durant les deux premiers mois de l'étude. Pour les résidents qui ont utilisé l'application IAM, le nombre de sujets de la semaine visités dans la semaine d'alerte (visites d'alerte) variait de 0 à 34 (moyenne 1,7 et écart-type 4,5) et le nombre total de pages visitées par chaque participant a varié de 1 à 442 (moyenne 28,3 et écart-type 61,4). Phase 2 : Les obstacles et les facilitateurs de la participation durable à l'EE ont été classés selon cinq dimensions: facteurs liés à l'utilisateur, au contenu de l'information, à la conception de l'application, au système d'alerte et aux services. Les stratégies d'amélioration de l'application IAM proposées par les résidents ont été classées selon quatre dimensions: le contenu de l'information, la conception de l'application mobile, le système d'alerte, et les services. Discussion et conclusion Les résultats de l'étude sont conformes à la littérature sur l'EE. Inspirée par le modèle de succès des systèmes d'information proposé par DeLone et McLean, je suggère que les cinq dimensions mentionnées ci-dessus sont des prédicteurs potentiels de la participation durable des résidents en EE. Ces résultats ont été utilisés pour renforcer une intervention éducative espacée pour les résidents en médecine de famille.",

    "Abstract": "The authors perform a classroom experiment to test the effectiveness of discipline-specific case studies on knowledge acquisition and retention in advanced business statistics courses. The results indicate that although students are more engaged in the case studies, overall there is no impact on acquisition or retention of statistics knowledge by having students engage in discipline-specific case studies relative to traditional case studies. However, for high-performing students, discipline-specific case studies have a positive and significant impact on statistical knowledge retention. Moreover, our research reaffirms past research, which has found greater retention for students with higher grade point average, and there exists a significant negative correlation between retention and time.",

INTRODUCTION Adolescents are often thought of as a healthy population, however, they routinely engage in high-risk behaviors that can lead to health problems. Medical students designed MiHealth, a program in which medical students teach health lessons in the high school classroom to help address these behaviors.A series of six lessons were created and implemented in the classroom for this pilot study focused on sexual health, intimate partner violence, mental health, smoking and marijuana, nutrition, and physical fitness. High school students in grades nine through twelve at a public high school in southeast Michigan receiving the MiHealth curriculum (N=52) or the standard health education curriculum (N=61) were surveyed on health knowledge, attitudes, and intentions before and after the program. METHODS A series of six lessons were created and implemented in the classroom for this pilot study focused on sexual health, intimate partner violence, mental health, smoking and marijuana, nutrition, and physical fitness. High school students in grades nine through twelve at a public high school in southeast Michigan receiving the MiHealth curriculum (N=52) or the standard health education curriculum (N=61) were surveyed on health knowledge, attitudes, and intentions before and after the program.Six weeks after program completion, high school students who received the MiHealth curriculum scored significantly higher on health knowledge ( P =0.007), and expressed significantly healthier attitudes and intentions toward risk behavior compared to controls ( P =0.025). Among individual themes, MiHealth resulted in significant knowledge gains in sexual health ( P =0.001) and mental health ( P <0.025), and significantly healthier attitudes regarding sexual health ( P =0.047), nutrition ( P =0.040), and smoking and marijuana ( P =0.012). RESULTS Six weeks after program completion, high school students who received the MiHealth curriculum scored significantly higher on health knowledge ( P=0.007), and expressed significantly healthier attitudes and intentions toward risk behavior compared to controls (P=0.025).

    "Abstract": "U radu je predstavljeno eksperimentalno istraživanje koje je imalo za cilj da utvrdi doprinos e-učionice projekta Dositej, tehničkih sredstava, elektronskih nastavnih materijala i interaktivnih modela organizacije nastave na nivo, kvalitet i trajnost znanja učenika u obradi nastavnih sadržaja iz predmeta Poznavanje prirode. Ispitivani su i mišljenja učenika o doprinosu primijenjenih inovativnih modela interaktivnog učenja na kvalitet njihovih znanja. U istraživanju je učestvovalo 188 učenika iz osnovnih škola Republike Srpske/BiH. Učenici su bili podijeljeni u četiri grupe: K, E1, E2 i E3. U svakoj grupi je bilo 47 učenika. Grupe su izjednačene na osnovu broja učenika, rezultata sa inicijalnog testa, opšteg uspjeha na kraju četvrtog razreda i ocjene iz predmeta Priroda i društvo na kraju četvrtog razreda. U K grupi učenici su nastavne sadržaje u okviru nastavne teme Postanak i sastav Zemlje učili u tradicionalnoj učionici primjenom tradicionalnih nastavnih sredstava. U E1 grupi učenici su nastavne sadržaje učili u okruženju e-učionice projekta Dositej, primjenom programa za upravljanje učenjem Mythware, Intel-ovih prenosnih kompjutera namijenjenih učenicima nižih razreda osnovne škole (CMPC-ijeva) i interaktivnog modela organizacije nastave, frontalnim i individualnim oblikom rada i radom u parovima. U E2 grupi učenici su nastavne sadržaje učili u školskom računarskom kabinetu primjenom kompjutera, projektora, kompakt-diska sa multimedijalnim obrazovnim softverom i interaktivnog modela organizacije nastave, frontalnim i individualnim oblikom rada i radom u parovima. U E3 grupi učenici su nastavne sadržaje učili u tradicionalnoj učionici primjenom nastavničkog kompjutera, projektora, multimedijalne obrazovne prezentacije i interaktivnog modela organizacije nastave, frontalnim i grupnim oblikom rada. U istraživanju je korišćena metoda teorijske analize, deskriptivno-analitička metoda, komparativna metoda, metoda modelovanja i eksperiment sa paralelnim grupama. Od istraživačkih tehnika korišćeno je testiranje, anketiranje i skaliranje. Instrumenti mjerenja su bili: test znanja (inicijalni test, finalni test i retest) i anketni upitnik. Dobijeni rezultati pokazuju da su učenici prve (e-učionica projekta Dositej) i treće (multimedijalna obrazovna prezentacija) eksperimentalne grupe ostvarili bolja postignuća (nivo i kvalitet znanja) u odnosu na učenike druge (multimedijalni obrazovni softver) eksperimentalne grupe i kontrolne grupe, što je potvrđeno i testiranjem razlika jer jeutvrđena statistički značajna razlika u prilog prve i treće eksperimentalne grupe. I u pogledu trajnosti znanja (retencije) najbolje rezultate su ostvarile prva i treća eksperimentalna grupa, u odnosu na drugu eksperimentalnu grupu i kontrolnu grupu, iako je najslabiju retenciju ostvarila prva eksperimentalna grupa. Učenici eksperimentalnih grupa imaju pretežno afirmativna mišljenja o tri primijenjena eksperimentalna modela nastave na kvalitet njihovih stečenih znanja iz predmeta Poznavanje prirode. Navedeni zaključci ukazuju da primjena eučionice, tehničkih sredstava i elektronskih nastavnih materijala doprinosi da se u nastavi iz predmeta Poznavanje prirode primijene principi konstruktivističke (aktivne) nastave. Takođe, značajnu vrijednost imaju i tehnička sredstva nižeg nivoa složenosti, primjena multimedijalne obrazovne prezentacije, ukoliko se pravilno i na osmišljen način primjenjuju. U budućnosti je potrebno formirati multidisciplinaran tim stručnjaka iz pedagoških, didaktičko-metodičkih i tehničkih nauka na nivou svih relevantnih obrazovnih institucija i ustanova u Republici Srpskoj koji bi radio na planskom uvođenju elektronskog obrazovanja u osnovne škole jer bez takvih sveobuhvatnih sistemskih rješenja svi pokušaji će ostati na nivou projekata koji imaju svoje ograničeno vremensko trajanje. Alternate abstract: The paper presents an experimental research aimed at determining the contribution of the Project Dositej e-classroom, technical resources, electronic teaching materials and interactive models of organization of classes, to the level, quality, and permanence of student knowledge in the processing of the teaching contents in the subject of Science. Student opinions on the contribution of applied innovative models of interactive learning to the quality of their knowledge have also been examined. A total of 188 students from primary schools in the Republic of Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina have articipated in the research. The students were divided into four groups: C, E1, E2 and E3. Each group consisted of 47 students. The groups were matched based on the number of students, their results from the initial test, overall achievements at the end of fourth grade and their grades in the subject Science and Social Studies at the end of fourth grade. In Group C, the students learned the teaching contents related to the teaching topic Creation and Composition of the Earth, in a traditional classroom and in a traditional manner. In Group E1, the students learned the teaching contents within the Project Dositej e-learning surroundings, by utilizing the learning management program Mythware, Intel’s portable computers intended for lower primary school grade students (CMPC’s) and an interactive model of teaching organization, frontal and individual forms of activity and activity in pairs. In Group E2, the students learned the teaching contents in the school’s computer science lab, by utilizing computers, projectors, compact discs with multimedia educational software and an interactive model of teaching organization, frontal and individual forms of activity and activity in pairs. In Group E3, the students earned the teaching contents in a traditional classroom by utilizing the teacher’s computer, a projector, a multimedia educational presentation and an interactive model of teaching organization, frontal and group activities. The method of theoretical analysis, descriptive-analytical method, comparative method, method of modelling and an experimental design with parallel groups, were used in the research. Tests, surveys and scales were used in terms of research techniques. The measurement instruments were: the knowledge test (initial and final tests and a re-test) and a survey questionnaire. The obtained results indicate that the students from the first (Project Dositej e-classroom) and the third (multimedia educational presentation) experimental groups achieved better results (regarding the level and quality of knowledge) compared to the students from the second experimental group (multimedia educational software) and the control group, which was also confirmed by testing the differences, because a statistically significant difference was determined in favour of the first and third experimental group. The first and the third experimental group have also achieved the best results regarding the permanence of knowledge (retention), compared to the second experimental and the control group, even though the weakest quality of retention was achieved by the first experimental group. The students from experimental groups have predominantly affirmative opinions about the three applied experimental models of teaching regarding the quality of their acquired knowledge in the subject of Science. The above conclusions indicate that the implementation of the e-classroom, technical resources and electronic teaching materials contributes to the application of the principles of constructivist (active) teaching in the subject of Science. Also, technical resources of a lower level of complexity, application of a multimedia educational presentation, if used properly and in a meaningful way, possess a significant value. In the future, a multidisciplinary team of experts from pedagogical, didactic and methodical and technical sciences should be formed at the level of all relevant educational institutions in the Republic of Srpska, that would work on the planned introduction of electronic education into primary schools, because without such comprehensive systematic solutions all attempts are bound to remain on the level of projects which are of limited duration.",

    "Abstract": "This thesis investigates whether there is a link between organisational change in the rail industry and changes to the managerial knowledge base required to design and implement new products (that is, passenger rail services). The privatisation of Britain's railways in the 1990s brought to an end a system of management training that had been in place for some 80 years. Over the two decades since then there have been numerous attempts by successive governments to understand why the expected financial benefits of privatisation did not materialise. At the same time, a number of commentators have highlighted the issue of knowledge loss. This thesis suggests that the innovative creation of new products using existing physical and human resources requires the bringing together of different forms of technical knowledge, know-that, with a knowledge of wider contextual issues. Whilst attempts have been - and continue to be - made by the rail industry to codify know-that, contextual knowledge tends to be tacit and intangible. There is currently no single theory explaining the link between organisational structure and knowledge creation. A new analytical framework is therefore developed, which provides a theoretical basis for thinking about the impact of changes in the organisational context of learning on different managerial knowledge components. Application of this shows that there are limits to the extent to which knowledge can be codified and risks attached to over-relying on codified sources. This finding builds on previous work by Nonaka and others on the capture of tacit knowledge (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995) and the importance of the social context in knowledge development (Nonaka and Krogh, 2009). Development of the framework relied on understanding the historical context of organisational phenomena.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The focus of this study is on the knowledge retention process, including knowledge capture, knowledge codification and the internalising of knowledge in organisations – a key aspect of age management. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to an understanding of the difficulties in this process to discuss implications for organizational measures to retain knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on field research on a Swedish multinational company from the perspective of senior employees. Findings: The findings indicate that knowledge retention is a complex phenomenon, partly because valued knowledge is tacit and knowing is highly subjective and transferred through learning in collaboration with others in the process of undertaking assignments and acting together in work situations. Research limitations/implications: Knowledge retention is considered only from the perspective of senior, white-collar employees in this study; it would be of interest to consider other employees’ perspectives as well. A second limitation is that the data were collected at a single site. It could be argued, however, that a single case study research format provides an opportunity to gain deep knowledge and allows for explanations about observed phenomena, thereby contributing towards transferable scientific knowledge. Practical implications: Knowledge retention is hindered by focusing solely on senior workers and on an explicit and commodified view of knowledge. Social implications: Knowledge retention should be an on-going way of working throughout the organization in which tacit knowledge and knowing are important. Originality/value: This study shows the importance of considering knowledge and knowing retention as a matter of continual interaction between actors. Retention of tacit knowledge and knowing is not merely a matter of capturing and codifying knowledge. This study contributes to an understanding of the internalisation of tacit knowledge and knowing in continual interaction and cannot be preceded by a step-wise process.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the critical types of knowledge lost when employees depart companies in the oil and gas field. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a grounded theory methodology. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with elite informants in the oil and gas sector to gain an in-depth insight into the research problem. ATLAS.ti was used for data analysis and coding. Findings: In the oil and gas industry, employees generally have job rotation and work at various geographical locations during their career. The departing employees possess valuable types of knowledge depending on the role and duties they have performed over the years. These include specialized technical knowledge, contextual knowledge of working at different geographical locations, knowledge of train wrecks and history of company, knowledge of relationships and networks, knowledge of business processes and knowledge of management. Research limitations/implications: The study findings might only be applicable to the oil and gas sector. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified gap on the identification of critical areas of knowledge loss when employees depart from oil and gas companies. The study adds to the existing body of literature on this underexplored area in the knowledge management literature.

    "Abstract": "A career on board the ships as engineers is an interesting option for young people graduating high schools in Constanta county and not only. Thermodynamics plays a vital role in the academic life of future marine engineers. This is why physics professors and Thermodynamic lecturers from \"Gheorghe Duca\" Technological High School and Constanta Maritime University decided to test the level of retention of perquisites in Thermodynamics, with focus on internal combustion engines (ICE). A group of 30students from \"Gheorghe Duca\" Technological High School have been tested in order to quantify the gained knowledge on ICE. They have been selected from the last year of study, they being interested in maritime jobs. The testing was based on a questionnaire containing theoretical and calculus aspects. The time of solving was established at 50 minutes. The results showed that our future graduates (and potential future maritime professionals) proved a good knowledge retention. Also the analysis of the questionnaire results is able to provide to the CMU lecturer a profile of its potential students. In the same time, he can improve his activities during classes, in order to achieve the right level of knowledge requirement.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium Infectious Disease Fellowship program historically included a monthly short-answer and multiple-choice quiz. The intent was to ensure medical knowledge in relevant content areas that may not be addressed through clinical rotations, such as operationally relevant infectious disease. After completion, it was discussed in a small group with faculty. Over time, faculty noted increasing dissatisfaction with the activity. Spaced interval education is useful in retention of medical knowledge and skills by medical students and residents. Its use in infectious disease fellow education has not been described. To improve the quiz experience, we assessed the introduction of spaced education curriculum in our program. Materials and Methods: A pre-intervention survey was distributed to assess the monthly quiz with Likert scale and open-ended questions. A multiple-choice question spaced education curriculum was created using the Qstream(R) platform in 2011. Faculty development on question writing was conducted. Two questions were delivered every 2 d. Incorrectly and correctly answered questions were repeated after 7 and 13 d, respectively. Questions needed to be answered correctly twice to be retired. Fellow satisfaction was assessed at semi-annual fellowship reviews over 5 yr and by a one-time repeat survey. Results: Pre-intervention survey of six fellows indicated dissatisfaction with the time commitment of the monthly quiz (median Likert score of 2, mean 6.5 h to complete), neutral in perceived utility, but satisfaction with knowledge retention (Likert score 4). Eighteen fellows over 5 yr participated in the spaced education curriculum. Three quizzes with 20, 39, and 48 questions were designed. Seventeen percentage of questions addressed operationally relevant topics. Fifty-nine percentage of questions were answered correctly on first attempt, improving to 93% correct answer rate at the end of the analysis. Questions were attempted 2,999 times. Fellows consistently indicated that the platform was “highly enjoyed,” “beneficial,” a “fun format,” and “completely satisfied.” Fellows additionally commented that they desired more questions and considered the platform helpful in board preparation. Formal survey data post-intervention found that the fellows were satisfied with the new approach, found it to be useful in board preparation, overall educational value, and in-line with their personal learning style (median Likert score of 4 for all queries). Fellows were satisfied with time commitment, spending a mean of 47 min on the spaced education curriculum questions per month. Conclusions: Introduction of a spaced education curriculum resulted in a sustained positive learner experience for > 5 yr with demonstrated mastery of material. Spaced education learning is a viable addition to augment training experience, especially in areas of curricular gaps such as operational medicine. Correct answer data may also be useful to perform Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-required objective assessment of knowledge.

    "Abstract": "Numerous entities such as parents, students, legislators, and the public are criticizing higher education including business schools for costs, lack of transparency, and relevance to the real world. Several studies have found declines in student performance and the lack of improvement in critical thinking and analytical skills. The deepest question is - are pedagogical methods leading to long term retention and use by graduates? Traditional education provides explicit knowledge via lectures and textbooks. Tacit knowledge is acquired with direct experience, observation, and reflection. Research on knowledge acquisition and retention shows that several steps must be taken to move neurological impulses into long term memory. The authors argue that more teaching emphasizing tacit knowledge such as the SBI's field-based consulting should be utilized.

    "Abstract": "Large-scale online learning environments such as MOOCs provide an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of learning strategies in an informal learning context with a diverse learner population. Here, we evaluate the extent to which retrieval practice -- recognized as one of the most effective learning strategies -- facilitates long-term knowledge retention (and thus learning outcomes) among MOOC learners using an instructional intervention. We observed no effect on learning outcomes and high levels of treatment non-compliance. In addition, we conducted a series of exploratory studies into long-term recall of knowledge acquired in MOOCs. Surprisingly, both passing and non-passing learners scored similarly on a knowledge post-test, retaining approximately two-thirds of what they learned over the long term.",

    "Abstract": "With an increase in the number of people living in proximity to active volcanic centres worldwide, there is a greater need to provide effective and engaging education and outreach programmes to reduce vulnerability and prepare exposed communities for potential future volcanic eruptions. The finalisation of the Sendai Framework (UNISDR, 2015a) has also cemented the need for disaster risk managers to engage at-risk communities with education and outreach programmes, to reduce the number of deaths and injuries caused by volcanic eruptions worldwide. Education and outreach programmes are already commonplace for disaster risk reduction, with many taking the form of traditional presentations, maps, diagrams, TV and radio broadcasts. In recent years, there has been a shift towards the use of more creative media to communicate volcanic hazards and engage populations in outreach activities. These have included films, comic strips, puppet shows, board games and video games. However, to-date there is little empirical evidence for the use of these media with at-risk communities. This research seeks to address this issue by providing evidence for the effective use of creative media for volcanic hazard education by adopting the use of video games (or serious games). To assess how effective serious games could be as an education tool, a bespoke video game (St. Vincent’s Volcano) was developed collaborative with disaster risk agencies and communities on the Eastern Caribbean island of St. Vincent and then trialled with adults and students from across the island. A range of outreach sessions were adopted to compare and contrast the applications of the game and to identify the most effective method of its delivery. These sessions included a traditional outreach presentation used as a control, and a group of UK students for a cohort comparison. Data were collected through a mixed-methods approach. Overall the results of the study demonstrate how successful the game can be as an education tool, promoting knowledge improvement in players. The results also demonstrate how the role of the outreach instructor is important to encourage engagement and can result in higher levels of overall positive engagement exhibited by the students. The game was also successful at promoting knowledge gain and engagement with adult participants. The results also demonstrated promise for games in promoting longer-term knowledge retention and for improving awareness of existing outreach materials. This research provides a foundation for the increased integration of emerging technologies within traditional education sessions. The work also shares some of the challenges and lessons learnt throughout the development and testing processes and provides recommendations for researchers looking to pursue a similar study or to adopt the use of serious games.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to test the use of generating self-explanations in nursing education as it relates to student academic achievement in theoretical nursing courses. With the study being built upon a framework of cognitive constructivism, a mixed methods approach was used to examine the academic achievement of associate degree nursing students in a community college in northeast Texas. Unit exam grades and final exam grades were examined in two integrated theoretical nursing courses over the course of one semester. Demographic variables were considered, along with the semester of nursing school in which the student was enrolled. The quantitative portion of the study examined the amount of self-explanations generated as it related to academic achievement on unit exams and the final exam through a repeated measures approach. It also examined whether the semester of nursing school in which the participant was enrolled impacted the exam scores when generating self-explanations. While quantitative results yielded no significance, this non-significance and mean exam scores demonstrated that generating self-explanations can indicate knowledge retention and produce similar results to standard multiple-choice practice questions not-requiring self-explanations. Qualitative inquiry produced descriptive data, which highlighted four major themes and points of discussion including (a) activity design, (b) individual learners, (c) method of self-reflection, and (d) theory and practice. These qualitative data points augmented the quantitative results and provided valuable insight into the use of generating self-explanations in nursing classrooms and for areas of further research. With consideration given to quantitative and qualitative analysis, generating self-explanations should be considered as a tool to utilize in nursing classrooms.",

Computing Science students and practitioners use it to model real world objects and simulate problems in several disciplines such as mathematics, artificial intelligence, games or linguistics. Based on the assessment made by the proponents, little percentage of the students who took the course were able to retain knowledge on its theoretical foundation, while none on the application side. It was further supported by some literature that some computing students find difficulties in learning this course. The main reason is the knowledge retention because they cannot remember their previous lessons. This research can be a useful contribution in designing a better e-learning application particularly for the Computing Science students. Given the right feature, the mobile application can benefit both the educational institution, students and faculty members. In view of this study, it is highly recommended to pursue the development of the application, implement it and conduct a pre- and post-test assessment on the knowledge retention of students who will utilize this system. Provide a wider population and test other parameters to determine what really affects the student’s knowledge retention.",

This research reports on results of a randomised field experiment with Australian consumers using an SFM mobile app developed by the researchers.The SFM app development employed insights from the Health Literacy Online Heuristics framework and the experiment involved evaluation of information and/or knowledge acquisition from the app versus from a paper-based version. The experiment spanned four weeks and involved eight participants (experimental group n=4; control group n=4). METHOD The SFM app development employed insights from the Health Literacy Online Heuristics framework and the experiment involved evaluation of information and/or knowledge acquisition from the app versus from a paper-based version. The experiment spanned four weeks and involved eight participants (experimental group n=4; control group n=4).The results highlight differentials in cognitive burden between paper and the app; beneficial affordances from the app for refreshing consumer knowledge; and longer knowledge retention on safe food management from app use over-time. RESULTS The results highlight differentials in cognitive burden between paper and the app; beneficial affordances from the app for refreshing consumer knowledge; and longer knowledge retention on safe food management from app use over-time.We identified two key impacts of the app on consumer knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention. First, the SFM app takes longer to achieve knowledge acquisition but results in longer knowledge retention than the control. Second, the SFM app induces some level of cognitive load in adoption however; the affordance of its reuse for quick but infrequent revisitations facilitates knowledge retention. Although the study is limited by the small sample size, it however highlights the need for a large scale and purely quantitative investigation that are generalisable to the Australian population. DISCUSSION We identified two key impacts of the app on consumer knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention.

Although the study is limited by the small sample size, it however highlights the need for a large scale and purely quantitative investigation that are generalisable to the Australian population.It is anticipated that the insights gained from this study can be used to develop nationwide interventions for addressing consumer SFM knowledge gaps in the home; thus, moving a step closer towards addressing SFM behaviours of Australian consumers. CONCLUSION It is anticipated that the insights gained from this study can be used to develop nationwide interventions for addressing consumer SFM knowledge gaps in the home; thus, moving a step closer towards addressing SFM behaviours of Australian consumers.",

    "Abstract": "The Effect of Digital Storytelling on Academic Performance, Interest and Motivation of Police Cadets in a Law Enforcement Academy. Doctor of Education (Ed.D.), December 2018, 93pp., 6 tables, 83 references, 5 appendices. With increasing criticism concerning police interactions with the public and the use-of-force decisions, the importance of preservice law enforcement instruction is an ongoing concern for both police practitioners and the public. Law enforcement education can benefit from the integration of new instructional strategies that can increase comprehension and long-term knowledge retention transferable into the field. Digital storytelling has been proffered as an effective cross-cultural communication tool and has been noted as having the ability to infiltrate the diverse communication needs of the law enforcement profession. This study sought to determine if digital storytelling could influence academic performance in the cadet police training, and if its use could increase a police cadet’s interest and motivation in the topic being taught at the regional law enforcement academy. In this mixed methods research study, two cohorts in a regional police academy were exposed to digital storytelling, and the results and effects were analyzed. This study discussed how the findings affected this diverse work environment and proposed opportunities for further research in law enforcement education and practice.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The literature shows an optimistic landscape for the effectiveness of games in medical education. Nevertheless, games are not considered mainstream material in medical teaching. Two research questions that arise are the following: What pedagogical strategies do developers use when creating games for medical education? And what is the quality of the evidence on the effectiveness of games? Methods: A systematic review was made by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers following the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines. We included peer-reviewed journal articles which described or assessed the use of serious games or gamified apps in medical education. We used the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) to assess the quality of evidence in the use of games. We also evaluated the pedagogical perspectives of such articles. Results: Even though game developers claim that games are useful pedagogical tools, the evidence on their effectiveness is moderate, as assessed by the MERSQI score. Behaviourism and cognitivism continue to be the predominant pedagogical strategies, and games are complementary devices that do not replace traditional medical teaching tools. Medical educators prefer simulations and quizzes focused on knowledge retention and skill development through repetition and do not demand the use of sophisticated games in their classrooms. Moreover, public access to medical games is limited. Discussion: Our aim was to put the pedagogical strategy into dialogue with the evidence on the effectiveness of the use of medical games. This makes sense since the practical use of games depends on the quality of the evidence about their effectiveness. Moreover, recognition of said pedagogical strategy would allow game developers to design more robust games which would greatly contribute to the learning process.",

National Institute of Technology is center of KOSEN. At the NIT of college, there is a Core curriculum that is the core of KOSEN education. On top of that there is the Model curriculum. A model core curriculum (MCC) that features the characteristics of each college is implemented by combining these. MCC is largely classified into ten fields. Learning goals and reach targets are defined for each. There is besides the learning curriculum, they are defined about generic skills. However, generic skills are different from the content of knowledge retention. Therefore, it is difficult to carry out the paper test and the confirmation test. Generic skills are needed to act in society. Even in MCC, it is suggested that evaluation that integrates fields is necessary, but its evaluation method has not been proposed. We have been conducting generic skill surveys using objective evaluation for 4 years at NIT Sendai college. We propose an evaluation method using this result to evaluate MCC's such as ability to cross field and show its possibility.",

    "Abstract": "In the knowledge economy, knowledge becomes a strategic resource for any company contributing significantly to achieving its competitive advantage. Knowledge risk is associated with any knowledge activity which is done under the pressure of uncertainty. Researchers focus their attention especially on the following types of knowledge risks: knowledge loss, knowledge leakage, knowledge spillover, knowledge outsourcing, knowledge gaps, and improper use of knowledge. All the researchers analyze knowledge risk by using for knowledge the metaphor of stock-and-flow, which implies that knowledge is considered in its explicit form as being rational. According to the theory of knowledge fields, which is based on the metaphor of knowledge as energy, we consider a holistic approach comprising the rational knowledge field, emotional knowledge field, and spiritual knowledge field. In this perspective, the risk is associated with each knowledge field such that the whole phenomenon of knowledge risk becomes more complex. The purpose of this paper is to present a holistic approach to the knowledge risk based on this theory of knowledge fields and the energy metaphor for knowledge. It is a conceptual analysis based on metaphorical thinking and literature background. Our findings lead to a larger perspective in understanding and using the concept of knowledge risk in knowledge management.",

    "Abstract": "Governments have encouraged higher education institutions (HEIs) to develop entrepreneurial, innovative and highly employable graduates. Accordingly, employability, enterprise and entrepreneurship are all high on the agendas of United Kingdom (UK) HEIs (Sewell and Dacre Pool, 2010) and the use of constructivist approaches, such as experiential learning and problem based learning, may offer an effective way to develop the entrepreneurial, enterprising and employability skills that both graduates and employers need. Constructivist approaches in higher education (HE) have become increasingly common across a wide range of disciplines in recent decades. This is particularly true in the field of entrepreneurship where the development of entrepreneurial skills requires different hands-on or experience based approaches to the more traditional didactic lecture based teaching methods (Jones and English, 2004; Jones and Iredale, 2010; Zahra and Welter, 2008). Constructivism lends itself to active based learning approaches which can result in improved problem solving skills, improved knowledge retention, and improved motivation (Bonwell and Eison, 1991; Rhem, 1998; Snyder, 2003). Furthermore, unlike didactic teaching approaches, constructivist active learning can lead to changes in both thought and attitude, and the development of behavioural skills (Bligh, 2000; Grimley et al., 2011). Whilst there is much practical practitioner based research focusing on the implementation of constructivist enterprise education, there is limited existing research focusing on the constructivist learning theory underpinning constructivism. This has led to a degree of separation between practitioner-based research and constructivist learning theory in abstraction and application. This thesis addresses three research questions • How can constructivism be applied to enterprise education in HE? • What is the relationship between constructivist learning environments and the development of enterprising graduates? • How can learning environments be created and implemented to effectively support the development of enterprising graduates? This thesis investigates a range of constructivist pedagogic interventions across a range of academic levels, subjects, and disciplines, both within and outside of formal curricula, to explore their ability to develop enterprising skills and to consider how they can be created, developed and implemented to effectively support the development of these skills. In addition, the portfolio contains an assessment of the relationship between a range of entrepreneurial attitudes and the likelihood of graduate employment in a professional field six months after graduation in Paper 1. This provides some quantitative evidence that enterprising skills that can be developed by constructivist active learning can have an impact on graduate employability. This portfolio provides a strong case for the use of constructivist approaches in developing a wide range of entrepreneurial and enterprising skills that graduates require, enhancing their employability and enabling them to be more enterprising. These skills included developing a proactive disposition, achievement motivation, self-efficacy, interpersonal skills, team working, communication skills, planning, attitude to risk, leadership and a preference for innovation. This portfolio found support for the contention that in general, students respond positively to these approaches and satisfaction levels are high e.g. in Paper 5 and in Paper 6. However, Papers 2 and 4 highlighted the importance of adequate temporary scaffolding, where appropriate, to ensure access to learning for all students. The learning points that can be taken from the portfolio to help develop and create the best pedagogy and constructivist learning environment for students to maximise the benefits of constructivism are summarised in Appendix 2. Paper 7 considers the development of a constructivist intervention that involves external stakeholders. This research focused on the perspectives of students, faculty and stakeholders to better understand the creation, implementation, and development of such pedagogic interventions. This thesis concludes that enterprise education in HE should be based not only on didactic teaching but should also involve the application of constructivist active learning approaches (particularly experiential learning) based and grounded on constructivist learning theory to develop enterprise skills. Thus enterprise education can be viewed as a mixture or fusion of didactic teaching to impart essential theoretical knowledge and the application of constructivist learning approaches which seek to develop experiential knowledge and skills, which can be developed through both experience and reflection. This thesis contributes to knowledge by combining constructivist learning theory and practice based research to underpin the application of constructivism in enterprise education. It provides additional depth and breadth to research on constructivist pedagogy, using a range of research methods across a range of educational settings, to support the development of enterprise skills and employability. It identifies how to achieve best practice in the delivery of constructivist learning through the implementation of constructivist learning principles and highlights the pivotal role of the educator in supporting student learning in a constructivist learning environment.",

    "Abstract": "Background Family physicians are in frequent contact with patients, and their contribution to oral health promotion programs could be utilized more effectively. We implemented an oral health care (OHC) educational seminar for physicians and evaluated its impact on their knowledge retention in OHC. Methods We conducted an educational trial for primary care physicians ( n  = 106) working in Public Health Centers in Tehran city. W e launched a self-administered questionnaire about pediatric dentistry, general dental, and dentistry-related medical knowledge and backgrounds. Physicians in intervention group A ( n  = 38) received an educational intervention (Booklet, Continuous Medical Education (CME), and Pamphlet), and those in group B ( n  = 32) received only an OHC pamphlet. Group C ( n  = 36) served as the control. A post-intervention survey followed four months later to measure the difference in the physicians’ knowledge; the Chi-square test, ANOVA and linear regression analysis served for statistical analysis. Results The intervention significantly increased the physicians’ oral health knowledge scores in all three domains and their total knowledge score ( p  <  0.001). Those physicians who had lower knowledge scores at the baseline showed a higher increase in their post-intervention knowledge. The models showed no associations between the background variables and the knowledge change. Conclusion The primary care physicians’ OHC knowledge improved considerably after an educational seminar with a reminder. These findings suggest that OHC topics should be included in physicians’ CME programs or in their curriculum to promote oral health, especially among non-privileged populations.",

    "Abstract": "Sport-related concussions continue to be a serious epidemic for youth participants. Detection and management of concussion injuries may be improved through enrichment of educational modules and improvement of communication. The Health Belief Model (HBM) is a significant theory to consider when assessing the effectiveness of a concussion education program to influence a coach’s actions and behaviors. A pathway to improper management, created by improper reporting by athletes, lack of recognition by coaches, and lack of access to athletic training services, must be mitigated through effective concussion educational initiatives. The purposes of this study are to investigate the effect of an online concussion education program, Concussion in Sports , on the knowledge retention among high school football coaches over a 15-week follow up period as well as to determine whether any variables can successfully predict knowledge retention. A quasi-experimental repeated measure design was used to measure knowledge retention over time for high school football coaches from Calcasieu and Jefferson Davis parishes in south Louisiana. The main outcome measure in this study included coaches’ knowledge retention in the follow up period. The assessments consisted of 31 questions divided into three distinct subsections: signs and symptoms recognition, common concussion misconceptions, and scenario-based questions. A 2-tailed dependent samples t-test was conducted to test knowledge retention, while a multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess which coaching characteristics and school attributes affect knowledge retention. High school football coaches had significantly lower overall as well as signs and symptoms subsection scores on 15-week follow-up assessments compared to post-course assessments, but the participants did not have significantly lower misconception or scenario subsection scores. Coaching role and personal concussion history did predict overall assessment scores; whereas, coaching role also influenced signs and symptoms subsection scores. Finally, neither access to an athletic trainer or school size significantly predicted knowledge retention when both variables are included. This study provides some foundational support that knowledge was not retained in high school football coaches in south Louisiana. This study confirms the need to continue to assess long-term outcomes to assure knowledge retention in high school football coaches after online concussion education.",

    "Abstract": "Simulation has been used in nursing education for many years in order to show students complex patients, allow practice of new skills without allowing actual harm to come to the patient, as well as being able to build up student confidence in abilities. The primary focus for this qualitative study was associate degree nursing faculty perceptions of their students transferability of knowledge gained through participating in simulation activities in the clinical setting and, may assist in planning future educational activities. The nursing faculty provided insight to what they felt the students needed to know and reflected on what they actually saw students do in actual clinical situations. The research question addressed in this study was the following: What are associate degree nursing faculty perceptions on student transferability of knowledge to an actual clinical setting after having experience in simulation activities? There was also a research sub question addressed, which was, What do associate degree nursing faculty perceive as barriers to becoming successful in clinical performance and knowledge retention? The study used a basic qualitative design. A basic qualitative design was appropriate for this study because it examined simulation use by nursing faculty at multiple chosen schools and their experiences with knowledge transferability. The study sample consisted of associate degree nursing faculty from the East South Central and West South Central regions of the United States. The study participants ranged in age from 30--66 years of age, and they all have been teaching for at least one year. The guided face-to-face interviews by the participants revealed the following themes, providing a safe environment, clinical experiences/nursing skills, simulation integration in course content, and faculty development and training regarding simulation use. The purpose of the study was to examine transferability of knowledge gained through simulation activities on student clinical performance, and this was actually not addressed in any of the participants' answers. The researcher found that all the faculty participants are able to work together in all areas where simulation is utilized, in order to produce competent graduates who will be able to enter the workforce as nurses. Recommendations for further research include using a larger sample size and from other geographical regions in order to have a more diverse sample of nursing faculty.

    "Abstract": "This qualitative case study documented the perceptions of K-8 ELA teachers and reading interventionists in Northeast Florida. The research problem explored the effectiveness of remediation strategies implemented into the course design to improve student proficiency on end-of-year state assessments. Data collection included semi-structured interviews, nonparticipant observations, and a review of physical documents. Semi-structured interviews were conducted until data saturation was reached. The theoretical framework of this qualitative case study was based on: social cognitive theory; literary theory; and choice theory. A lack of horizontal procedures my produce inconsistencies when examining student's grade-level performance. Interview responses from 20 ELA teachers were manually analyzed with the assistance of Microsoft Word and revealed six emergent themes. Three themes related to remediation perceptions: theme 1, \"Proficiency Standards and Knowledge Retention determine the effectiveness of Remediation\"; theme 2, \"Differentiated Instruction increases Remediation effectiveness\"; and theme 3, \"Remediation is a gradual Process of Cognitive Development.\" Three themes related to pedagogical beliefs: theme 4, \"Instructional Strategies to assess Learning and observe Student's Behavior\"; theme 5, \"Course Material containing Strategies for Remediation in K-8 ELA\"; and theme 6, \"Remediation Challenges that limit the effectiveness of Intervention.\" Each theme included a set of quality indicators. The findings may lead to models for remediation or development of policy connected to remediation in K-8 ELA.

    "Abstract": "Debriefing offers an opportunity to ensure that students can master critical components of nursing that they might not otherwise learn and to remove epistemological roadblocks to knowledge acquisition. Within this study, Debriefing for Meaningful Learning (DML), a theoretically-derived, evidence based and structured debriefing method, was used to explore student's knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and application of knowledge from one patient situation to a different, yet parallel, situation. This quasi-experimental pretest, posttest study explored the impact of the type of debriefing method on the development of knowledge, knowledge retention, and knowledge application. Eighty-two prelicensure baccalaureate nursing students, enrolled in an adult health (medical-surgical nursing) theory course, participated in this study testing the use of Debriefing for Meaningful Learning compared with customary debriefing. The outcomes of this study revealed a significant difference in knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and knowledge application with DML compared to customary debriefing. These findings are significant for nurse educators using simulation to potentiate clinical learning in prelicensure students and add to the growing evidence regarding the impact of debriefing.

    "Abstract": "Outsourcing provides organizations the opportunity for cost-saving and increased opportunities to build a competitive advantage, while better utilizing limited resources and focusing efforts on their strategic goals. There was a risk associated with deciding to outsource human resources (HR) functions in the federal government, which can influence management’s ability to make informed decisions and affect an organization’s effectiveness. Social groups inside an organization can influence knowledge, innovation, and productivity. Research has shown nothing emerges from a social group except individual behavior, and individual behavior can influence the organization’s growth in a marketplace. The purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore the perceived risk to the federal government associated with deciding to outsource HR functions. This research was conducted using a qualitative method with a multiple case study design. Data collection and analysis focused on those federal agencies in the Washington, DC geographical area having at least 2,000 employees and outsourcing at least 40% of their HR functions (e.g., compensation and benefits, employee relations, and compliance) and support services (e.g., payroll, recruitment, and benefit administration). Once these organizations were identified, a review of historical documents related to outsourced functions covering a period of at least five-years will be performed using at a selected federal agency. Additionally, an observational research approach using naturalistic observation as teams of HR practitioners within the targeted agency was done as the practitioners performed duties within their everyday environment (e.g., approximately 3-5 teams with approximately 25 personnel as target sample size). Finally, one-on-one semi-structured interviews with purposefully selected HR staff and management (e.g., approximately 10-12 participants from the target agencies) was conducted. These interviews drew a deeper understanding of the shared experiences of the participants and the perceived influence outsourcing HR functions has on knowledge retention needed to be retained in the federal government. Knowledge gained from this study could add value to the body of knowledge for future HR professionals and management to make informed outsourcing decisions in the federal government. The findings of this research added value to the body of knowledge for future HR professionals to influence outsourcing decisions in the federal government. Additionally, this study may inspire future researchers’ study of the desired competencies of HR practitioners in the federal government.",

    "Abstract": "Although online education offerings continue to grow in the higher education marketplace, issues of student achievement and course rigour still challenge the underlying instructional model, and alignment with institutional missions. Pedagogically, instructors and course designers can mitigate these issues by leveraging technology to further enhance students' cognition and knowledge retention within the online domain. This study analysed the effects of visual hints and elaborate feedback embedded in serious educational games to determine the effects on student learning and information recollection. Using a quasi-experimental design and quantitative testing methods based on differing forms of feedback in the game, significant differences were found among three groups of students in an online educational environment. Mean scores on comprehension tests indicated that participants who were exposed to elaborate feedback and visual hints performed better than control groups in an online learning environment. This supports the underlying framework of information processing theory.",

    "Abstract": "This study aims at investigating the impact of brain-based learning on the retention of English language knowledge amongst young adult learners. The participants were subjected to an intervention in brain-based learning principles for approximately four and a half months. The results of the proficiency exams administered at the beginning of and following the intervention were analysed in an effort to explore whether brain-based learning intervention exerts impact on the improvement of participants' proficiency in English. With a view to examining knowledge retention, the results of the retention exam administered six months after the post-proficiency exam were analysed. An interview was conducted both after the post-proficiency and the retention exam to gain insights into the participants' views of the brain-based learning intervention. The findings attained from the analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data yield that establishing a learning environment compatible with brain-based learning principles enables knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "E-learning has become an integral part of organizational training and development for many businesses, which may present challenges for an older workforce who are not technology savvy. This qualitative research study addresses a gap in the literature in which there is currently no existing research focusing specifically on e-learning as a sole learning modality and knowledge retention for adult workers over ae 40. This qualitative phenomenological study explored the perspectives of adult workers age 40 regarding knowledge retention when e-learning was used as the sole learning modality in the workplace. This study represented the perspectives and experiences of 22 research participants. The data collection method included group interview sessions. Each participant provided their own perspectives through semi-structured interviews using open-ended questions, allowing them to share their personal experiences regarding e-learning in the workplace. The data were analyzed by the researcher, which resulted in four common themes: 1) knowledge is an essential function of any job; 2) increased knowledge is retained when learning takes place in a preferred learning environment; 3) e-learning is a least preferred learning modality; and 4) a blended-learning environment is preferred and best effective for long-term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2018 IEEE Games, Entertainment, Media Conference (GEM) Conference Start Date: 2018, Aug. 15 Conference End Date: 2018, Aug. 17 Conference Location: Galway, Ireland In developed societies road safety skills are taught early and often practiced under the supervision of a parent, providing children with a combination of theoretical and practical knowledge. At some point children will attempt to cross a road unsupervised, at that point in time their safety depends on the effectiveness of their road safety education. To date, various attempts to supplement road safety education with technology were made. Most common approach focus on addressing declarative knowledge, by delivering road safety theory in an engaging fashion. Apart from expanding on text based resources to include instructional videos and animations, some stakeholders (e.g.: Irish Road Safety Authority) attempt to take advantage of game-based learning [1]. However, despite the high capacity for interaction being common in Virtual Environments, available game-based solutions to road safety education are currently limited to delivering and assessing declarative knowledge. With recent advancements in the field of Virtual Reality (VR) Head Mounted Displays, procedural knowledge might also be addressed in Virtual Environments. This paper describes the design and development process of a computer-supported learning system that attempts to address psycho-motor skills involved in crossing a road safely, changing learners' attitude towards road safety best practices, and enabling independent practice of transferable skills. By implementing game-based learning principles and following best practice for serious game design (such as making educational components essential to successful game-play, or instructional scaffolding) we hope to make it not only more effective, but also engaging, allowing us to rely on learners' intrinsic motivation [2], to increase their independent practice time and provide them with feedback that will help to condition safe behaviour and increase retention. Presence in Virtual Reality might evoke responses to Virtual Environment as if it was real (RAIR) [3] and enable learners to truly experience learning scenarios. In consequence leading to formation of autobiographical memories constructed from multisensory input, which should result in an increased knowledge retention and transfer [4].",

The nursing faculty provided insight to what they felt the students needed to know and reflected on what they actually saw students do in actual clinical situations. The research question addressed in this study was the following: What are associate degree nursing faculty perceptions on student transferability of knowledge to an actual clinical setting after having experience in simulation activities? There was also a research sub question addressed, which was, What do associate degree nursing faculty perceive as barriers to becoming successful in clinical performance and knowledge retention? The study used a basic qualitative design. A basic qualitative design was appropriate for this study because it examined simulation use by nursing faculty at multiple chosen schools and their experiences with knowledge transferability. The study sample consisted of associate degree nursing faculty from the East South Central and West South Central regions of the United States. The study participants ranged in age from 30--66 years of age, and they all have been teaching for at least one year. The guided face-to-face interviews by the participants revealed the following themes, providing a safe environment, clinical experiences/nursing skills, simulation integration in course content, and faculty development and training regarding simulation use. The purpose of the study was to examine transferability of knowledge gained through simulation activities on student clinical performance, and this was actually not addressed in any of the participants' answers. The researcher found that all the faculty participants are able to work together in all areas where simulation is utilized, in order to produce competent graduates who will be able to enter the workforce as nurses. Recommendations for further research include using a larger sample size and from other geographical regions in order to have a more diverse sample of nursing faculty.

    "Abstract": "Background Informal health care providers particularly “village doctors” are the first point of care for under-five childhood illnesses in rural Bangladesh. We engaged village doctors as part of the Multi-Country Evaluation (MCE) of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) and assessed their management of sick under-five children before and after a modified IMCI training, supplemented with ongoing monitoring and supportive supervision. Methods In 2003-2004, 144 village doctors across 131 IMCI intervention villages in Matlab Bangladesh participated in a two-day IMCI training; 135 of which completed pre- and post-training evaluation tests. In 2007, 38 IMCI-trained village doctors completed an end-of-project knowledge retention test. Village doctor prescription practices for sick under-five children were examined through household surveys, and routine monitoring visits. In-depth interviews were done with mothers seeking care from village doctors. Results Village doctors’ knowledge on the assessment and management of childhood illnesses improved significantly after training; knowledge of danger signs of pneumonia and severe pneumonia increased from 39% to 78% ( P  < 0.0001) and from 17% to 47% ( P  < 0.0001) respectively. Knowledge on the correct management of severe pneumonia increased from 62% to 84% ( P  < 0.0001), and diarrhoea management improved from 65% to 82% ( P  = 0.0005). Village doctors retained this knowledge over three years except for home management of pneumonia. No significant differences were observed in prescribing practices for diarrhoea and pneumonia management between trained and untrained village doctors. Village doctors were accessible to communities; 76% had cell phones; almost all attended home calls, and did not charge consultation fees. Nearly all (91%) received incentives from pharmaceutical representatives. Conclusions Village doctors have the capacity to learn and retain knowledge on the appropriate management of under-five illnesses. Training alone did not improve inappropriate antibiotic prescription practices. Intensive monitoring and efforts to target key actors including pharmaceutical companies, which influence village doctors dispensing practices, and implementation of mechanisms to track and regulate these providers are necessary for future engagement in management of under-five childhood illnesses.",

    "Abstract": "The FAA Part 147 program at Purdue University requires students in Aeronautical Engineering Technology (AET) major to take 1125 hours of laboratory works. Students are required to work in several different laboratory environments including airframe, powerplant, aircraft sheet metal processing, composite materials processing, electricity and electronics, non-destructive testing, aircraft system, maintenance practices and advanced manufacturing. Although course instructors emphasize laboratory safety, there is currently no pre-laboratory training for all students before they log any laboratory hours. Starting from 2004, occupational injuries and illness rates in the air transportation industry were shown to be much higher than the average for private industry (BLS, 2016). The FAA and the aviation industry have realized the importance of establishing safety training program for workers (FAA, 2004, October). Curriculum design in Part 147 aviation maintenance technician schools should help future employees of the aviation industry improve occupational safety performance by enhancing students¡¯ laboratory safety behaviors (White, Kroes, & Watson, 2000, May). The current study evaluated laboratory safety knowledge retention after design and delivery of a lecture-based pre-laboratory safety training protocol for AET students. The training protocol focused on three knowledge domains: laboratory safety operation, laboratory safety equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE), and NISW building Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The researcher in the current study adopted a true experimental design with pretest, posttest and delay posttest. Control group was used. There were 109 students participated in the research and completed the entire process. Data were collected through a test instrument including 15 multiple choice questions, designed and validated by the researcher. After the training, students in the experimental group demonstrated a significant improvement in safety knowledge both immediately and 30 days after. Statistical analysis showed that students' former experiences have no effect on their short/long-term knowledge retention. Additionally, the knowledge retention of PPE module 30 days after the training indicates that a recurrent training on PPE is necessary. The outcome of this study may help safety committees and administrators from the AET program to build a more comprehensive pre-laboratory safety training curriculum. Additionally, research outcomes from the current study may guide investigators toward future efforts and a more focused orientation on laboratory safety training in university aviation programs.",

    "Abstract": "This qualitative case study documented the perceptions of K-8 ELA teachers and reading interventionists in Northeast Florida. The research problem explored the effectiveness of remediation strategies implemented into the course design to improve student proficiency on end-of-year state assessments. Data collection included semi-structured interviews, nonparticipant observations, and a review of physical documents. Semi-structured interviews were conducted until data saturation was reached. The theoretical framework of this qualitative case study was based on: social cognitive theory; literary theory; and choice theory. A lack of horizontal procedures my produce inconsistencies when examining student's grade-level performance. Interview responses from 20 ELA teachers were manually analyzed with the assistance of Microsoft Word and revealed six emergent themes. Three themes related to remediation perceptions: theme 1, Proficiency Standards and Knowledge Retention determine the effectiveness of Remediation; theme 2, Differentiated Instruction increases Remediation effectiveness; and theme 3, Remediation is a gradual Process of Cognitive Development. Three themes related to pedagogical beliefs: theme 4, Instructional Strategies to assess Learning and observe Student's Behavior; theme 5, Course Material containing Strategies for Remediation in K-8 ELA; and theme 6, Remediation Challenges that limit the effectiveness of Intervention. Each theme included a set of quality indicators. The findings may lead to models for remediation or development of policy connected to remediation in K-8 ELA.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diagnostic imaging is an integral aspect of care that is often insufficient, if not altogether absent, in rural and remote regions of low to middle income countries (LMICs) such as Tanzania. The introduction of ultrasound can significantly impact treatment in these countries due to its portability, low cost, safety, and usefulness in various medical assessments. This study reviews the implementation of a four-week ultrasound course administered annually from 2013–2016 in a healthcare professional school in Mwanza, Tanzania by first-year allopathic US medical students. METHODS: Participants ( n =582, over 4 years) were recruited from the Tandabui Institute of Health Sciences and Technology to take the ultrasound course. Subjects were predominantly clinical officer students, but other participants included other healthcare professional students, practicing healthcare professionals, and school employees. Data collected includes pre-course examination scores, post-course examination scores, course quiz scores, demographic surveys, and postcourse feedback surveys. Data was analyzed using two-tailed t-tests and the single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: For all participants who completed both the pre- and post-course examinations ( n =229, 39.1% of the total recruited), there was a significant mean improvement in their ultrasound knowledge of 42.5%, P <0.01. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that trained first-year medical students can effectively teach a point of care ultrasound course to healthcare professional students within four weeks in Tanzania. Future investigation into the level of long-term knowledge retention, impact of ultrasound training on knowledge of human anatomy and diagnostic capabilities, and how expansion of an ultrasound curriculum has impacted access to care in rural Tanzania is warranted.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, the researcher aimed to understand how students learned the targeted knowledge with an interactive response system (IRS) tool, and whether learners in two different learning modes: individual and group use of IRS, differed in their learning performance and knowledge retention after the IRS activity. These two kinds of IRS interaction were integrated into the course which included multiple choice questions for testing memorable knowledge and open-ended questions for enhancing organization and critical thinking ability via a methodology that involved 120 college students and included the analysis of tests, survey questionnaires and a course learning diary. Overall, the results were consistent with the consensus that students perceive the IRS as a positive addition to their classes, as its use increased course participation, fostered interaction, and promoted the general enjoyment of the class. The results revealed that the immediate learning performance of the learners who participated in the activity through group use of the IRS was better than that of the learners with individual IRS accounts; however, the individual IRS users seemed to have better learning retention of the learning contents, and showed significant improvement on the delayed tests. Furthermore, the study also confirmed that the IRS with collaborative work could promote the students' academic and social-emotional performance because the collaborative learning allowed them to learn from peers' opinions and to make judgments and co-examine the learning concepts again while finding the correct answer. This paper contributes data and analysis that highlight the pedagogical benefits of the implementation of an IRS, and supports the value of using the IRS for college education.",

    "Abstract": "This paper examines how and what teachers learn from their older and younger colleagues. Data were gathered from interviews and written reports from 27 Belgian and Finnish teachers. Thematic qualitative analysis was used. The results revealed differences in what teachers learn from older and younger colleagues. Teachers reported learning innovative teaching methods and ICT skills from younger colleagues, whereas practical information, classroom management skills, self-regulation and community building were learned mainly from older colleagues. Attitudes regarding teaching and different ways of being a teacher were learned from both younger and older colleagues alike. Similarities were also found in how teachers learned from their older and younger colleagues. Informal activities and relationships, different forms of mentoring, and working in subject teams or seminars were important sources of learning. An intergenerational learning perspective is important with respect to demographic changes in school staff and in preventing knowledge loss and teacher dropout.",

    "Abstract": "Lecturing is widely considered to be a passive, teacher-centred teaching method that fails to foster learning, yet it remains the most feasible method of teaching among higher institutions. Some modern lectures, aligned with recommendations from published guidelines on effective lecturing, are less didactic and more interactive than others, but little is known about converting the classical knowledge-transfer process of lecturing to actual learning. We introduce a cognitive load theory-based lecture guideline that adopts various types of empirically proven strategies to manage learners' mental loads during lectures. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to evaluate its effectiveness by determining the between-group difference in cognitive load level, self-perceived learning, knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention. This study discusses the practical application of the guideline and several examples of the principles.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to evaluate how managers influence accidental and intentional organizational forgetting, i.e. knowledge depreciation, knowledge loss and unlearning. Design/methodology/approach: The literature was reviewed based on predetermined search terms to identify peer-reviewed articles published in English and available in full-text format from the EBSCOhost and Google Scholar databases. Empirical and theoretical contributions were included. Additional articles, books and book chapters were manually selected and included based on recent reviews and syntheses of organizational forgetting work. Findings: Findings revealed that managers contributed to preventing accidental knowledge depreciation and loss and preserving organizational memory. With respect to intentional forgetting, findings revealed contradictory positions: on the one hand, managers contributed to the disbandment of existing beliefs and frames of reference, but on the other hand, they preserved existing knowledge and power structures. Research limitations/implications: The study was limited by the accessibility of subscribed journals and databases, research scope and time span. Practical implications: This paper provides useful guidelines to managers who need to reduce the disruptive effects of accidental forgetting or plan intentional forgetting, i.e. managed unlearning. Originality/value: This paper represents a first attempt to review and define the influence of managers on organizational forgetting.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the effectiveness of teaching with simulations, compared to active learning without simulations. It utilizes an anonymous extra-credit pop quiz on four topics, each taught with a different method: (1) simulation and in-class debriefing; (2) simulation only; (3) in-class discussions with an accompanying research essay; and (4) in-class discussions only. The study presents a range of assessment techniques used in simulation literature, and suggests the use of the anonymous extra-credit pop quiz as a simple and familiar teaching practice, but an overlooked assessment tool for simulations. The study presents the \"Iranian Plane\" simulation developed to teach decision making in crisis situations to political science undergraduates. It analyzes empirical evidence on knowledge retention with and without simulations based on students' performance on the pop quiz 3 months after the simulation. The analysis shows that learning with simulation and debriefing together attains teaching goals set in advance. Simulation with debriefing was the most effective teaching mode for knowledge retention in terms of students' performance in the quiz, simulation only was almost as successful, but learning without simulation was less efficient.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Recently, medical education has made significant progress, and medical teachers are trying to find methods that have most impressive effects on learning. One of the useful learning methods is student active participation. One of the helpful teaching aids in this method is mobile technology. The present study aimed to determine the effect of sending educational questions through short message service (SMS) on academic achievement and satisfaction of medical students and compare that with lecture teaching. Subjects and Methods: In an semi-experimental, two chapters of urology reference book, Smiths General Urology 17thedition, were taught to 47 medical students of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in urology course in 2013 academic year. Kidney tumors chapter was educated by sending questions through SMS, and bladder tumors part was taught in a lecture session. For each method, pretest and posttest were held, each consisting of thirty multiple choice questions. To examine the knowledge retention, a test session was held on the same terms for each chapter, 1 month later. At the end, survey forms were distributed to assess student's satisfaction with SMS learning method. Data were analyzed through using SPSS 20. Results: The findings demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the two learning methods in the medication test scores. Evaluation of the satisfaction showed 78.72% of participants were not satisfied. Conclusions: The results of the study showed that distance learning through SMS in medical students could lead to increase knowledge, however, it was not effective on their satisfaction.",

    "Abstract": "Debriefing offers an opportunity to ensure that students can master critical components of nursing that they might not otherwise learn and to remove epistemological roadblocks to knowledge acquisition. Within this study, Debriefing for Meaningful Learning (DML), a theoretically-derived, evidence based and structured debriefing method, was used to explore student’s knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and application of knowledge from one patient situation to a different, yet parallel, situation. This quasi-experimental pretest, posttest study explored the impact of the type of debriefing method on the development of knowledge, knowledge retention, and knowledge application. Eighty-two prelicensure baccalaureate nursing students, enrolled in an adult health (medical-surgical nursing) theory course, participated in this study testing the use of Debriefing for Meaningful Learning compared with customary debriefing. The outcomes of this study revealed a significant difference in knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and knowledge application with DML compared to customary debriefing. These findings are significant for nurse educators using simulation to potentiate clinical learning in prelicensure students and add to the growing evidence regarding the impact of debriefing.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the critical types of knowledge lost when employees depart companies in the oil and gas field. Design/methodology/approach The study adopts a grounded theory methodology. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with elite informants in the oil and gas sector to gain an in-depth insight into the research problem. ATLAS.ti was used for data analysis and coding. Findings In the oil and gas industry, employees generally have job rotation and work at various geographical locations during their career. The departing employees possess valuable types of knowledge depending on the role and duties they have performed over the years. These include specialized technical knowledge, contextual knowledge of working at different geographical locations, knowledge of train wrecks and history of company, knowledge of relationships and networks, knowledge of business processes and knowledge of management. Research limitations/implications The study findings might only be applicable to the oil and gas sector. Originality/value This paper fulfills an identified gap on the identification of critical areas of knowledge loss when employees depart from oil and gas companies. The study adds to the existing body of literature on this underexplored area in the knowledge management literature.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The focus of this study is on the knowledge retention process, including knowledge capture, knowledge codification and the internalising of knowledge in organisations – a key aspect of age management. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to an understanding of the difficulties in this process to discuss implications for organizational measures to retain knowledge. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on field research on a Swedish multinational company from the perspective of senior employees. Findings The findings indicate that knowledge retention is a complex phenomenon, partly because valued knowledge is tacit and knowing is highly subjective and transferred through learning in collaboration with others in the process of undertaking assignments and acting together in work situations. Research limitations/implications Knowledge retention is considered only from the perspective of senior, white-collar employees in this study; it would be of interest to consider other employees’ perspectives as well. A second limitation is that the data were collected at a single site. It could be argued, however, that a single case study research format provides an opportunity to gain deep knowledge and allows for explanations about observed phenomena, thereby contributing towards transferable scientific knowledge. Practical implications Knowledge retention is hindered by focusing solely on senior workers and on an explicit and commodified view of knowledge. Social implications Knowledge retention should be an on-going way of working throughout the organization in which tacit knowledge and knowing are important. Originality/value This study shows the importance of considering knowledge and knowing retention as a matter of continual interaction between actors. Retention of tacit knowledge and knowing is not merely a matter of capturing and codifying knowledge. This study contributes to an understanding of the internalisation of tacit knowledge and knowing in continual interaction and cannot be preceded by a step-wise process.",

    "Abstract": "The author argues that private intellectual property (PIP) refusal and ownership by everybody of everything can be very useful not only for society in general, but also for private owners. G. Snowden’s and J. Assange’s investigations demonstrated how useless and senseless could be protection of intellectual property in conditions of developed information and communication technologies. PIP leads to very substantial loss of knowledge that could be observed on NASA Apollo mission example. Also PIP causes very significant damage to future generations’ interests, because the biggest knowledge protection is actually not allowing them use and improve existing knowledge in full extent. How loss of knowledge could be stopped and overcome? Very interesting pattern of entirely new interrelation practice is wikinomics – economy of mass collaboration. It means peer production, open innovations and, after all, network, not hierarchical organization. And these changes lead to substantial shifts in organization of society and economy.",

    "Abstract": "Simulation has been used in nursing education for many years in order to show students complex patients, allow practice of new skills without allowing actual harm to come to the patient, as well as being able to build up student confidence in abilities. The primary focus for this qualitative study was associate degree nursing faculty perceptions of their students transferability of knowledge gained through participating in simulation activities in the clinical setting and, may assist in planning future educational activities. The nursing faculty provided insight to what they felt the students needed to know and reflected on what they actually saw students do in actual clinical situations. The research question addressed in this study was the following: What are associate degree nursing faculty perceptions on student transferability of knowledge to an actual clinical setting after having experience in simulation activities? There was also a research sub question addressed, which was, What do associate degree nursing faculty perceive as barriers to becoming successful in clinical performance and knowledge retention? The study used a basic qualitative design. A basic qualitative design was appropriate for this study because it examined simulation use by nursing faculty at multiple chosen schools and their experiences with knowledge transferability. The study sample consisted of associate degree nursing faculty from the East South Central and West South Central regions of the United States. The study participants ranged in age from 30–66 years of age, and they all have been teaching for at least one year. The guided face-to-face interviews by the participants revealed the following themes, providing a safe environment, clinical experiences/nursing skills, simulation integration in course content, and faculty development and training regarding simulation use. The purpose of the study was to examine transferability of knowledge gained through simulation activities on student clinical performance, and this was actually not addressed in any of the participants’ answers. The researcher found that all the faculty participants are able to work together in all areas where simulation is utilized, in order to produce competent graduates who will be able to enter the workforce as nurses.

    "Abstract": "The main aim of this study is to investigate to what extent equity crowdfunding could enable firms to outsource research and development activities. Likewise, the present study aims at analysing the relationship between desorptive capacity (DCAP) and equity crowdfunding performance. We also aim at studying the mediation role of ICT firm's capabilities, connective capacity and minor equity ownership. In this regard, this study intends to pioneer into connecting the knowledge management theory with the crowdfunding studies. A sample of 180 projects based on the top ten European equity crowdfunding platforms has been used. Findings indicate that desorptive capacity enables companies in developing external knowledge retention and expoitation which, in turn, enhance equity crowdfunding performance.",

    "Abstract": "The nuclear power industry in the United States (U.S.) has gone through various changes throughout its history. Most recently, plans to grow the industry through the construction of new power plants have ceased. Because of this, the industry is at a period where the longevity and resilience of existing nuclear power plants are vital to its subsistence. One of the ways existing nuclear power plants can assure longevity and resilience is by performing engineering design modifications efficiently and at a lower cost. Strategic plans, such as the Delivering the Nuclear Promise, can support nuclear utilities to achieve this. Another strategy to accomplish longevity and resilience is to ensure individuals performing these projects possess the proper knowledge to complete tasks efficiently while being cost-effective. Knowledge retention is the main purpose of this research project. This doctoral dissertation develops a case study for engineering design modification projects at nuclear power plants, with the intention of it becoming a knowledge retention tool to support the longevity and resilience of the industry. A literature review of subjects such as an overview of nuclear power plants, license renewal, resilience, and knowledge management comprises the first part of this paper. The literature review is followed by the description of the research methodology and the results of the research. Three parts comprise the results section. Part one develops a work breakdown structure (WBS) for a design modification project. Part two provides a list of activity descriptions that need to be completed as part of a conceptual design package, including estimated person-hours and proposed durations for each activity. The third part performs a risk assessment using the Failure Modes and Effects (FMEA) tool. This section identifies potential failure modes for each activity, causes of failure, human performance tools that can help prevent or detect the failures, and recommends actions to address and mitigate the risks identified. The results of this case study demonstrate how, with the correct knowledge, engineering design modification risks can be mitigated and activities can be accounted for when developing project estimates. This information can assist the future development of efficient and cost-effective projects within the nuclear industry. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge is a key resource for firms, capable of providing a firm-level competitive advantage. Interfirm networks are a valuable source of knowledge for firms, as both breadth and depth of knowledge can be developed via interfirm relationships. However, for firms that have acquired and developed valuable knowledge assets, they may view their interfirm network as providing an opportunity for knowledge loss via knowledge spillovers. Knowledge spillovers allow the recipient to gain knowledge without compensation to the knowledge-originating firm. Spillovers lead to a loss of present and future value to the knowledge-originating firm. Indeed, firms with valuable knowledge asset may implement network safeguards to limit potential knowledge spillovers via their network size, intensity, structure, and position within the network. While extant research has examined the effect of networks on knowledge outcomes, limited attention has been paid to how firms may adapt their networks to safeguard their knowledge once they have created significant value in their knowledge assets. Furthermore, as networks are a key knowledge resource, it is unknown if these network safeguards will harm the future value of the firm's knowledge asset due to the restriction of available knowledge. This dissertation seeks to explore these issues by examining how firms with knowledge assets of high value may safeguard their knowledge via their network size, intensity, structure, and position, and ultimately how these efforts may impact the value of their future knowledge assets.

    "Abstract": "This study is a meta-analysis investigating the effectiveness of applying the modality principle on learners' learning performances in knowledge retention and knowledge transfer and learners' cognitive load for college students and adult learners. Three moderator variables were tested to find out if they affect the degree of the effects: (a) pace of presentation, (b) length of verbal segment, and (c) type of visualization. Primary studies focused on the modality principle in instructional contexts from 1995 to 2017 were searched and 41 studies were selected through the literature search and screening processes. Seventy-six pairs of comparisons involving 3,917 participants were identified from the selected studies. The overall effects of the modality principle for learning performances were analyzed using a multivariate meta-analysis with the random effects model. A small effect size was found for knowledge retention, and a medium effect size was found for knowledge transfer. The results of the overall effect sizes analysis showed that the effect size for knowledge transfer was larger than the effect size for knowledge retention. For pace of presentation, no significant result was found for knowledge retention or knowledge transfer. For length of verbal segment, a significant difference was found between the effect size of the long verbal segment subgroup and the short verbal segment subgroup for knowledge transfer but not for knowledge retention. The effect size of the short verbal segment subgroup was larger than the effect size of the long verbal segment subgroup for knowledge transfer. For type of visualization, the results for knowledge retention and knowledge transfer were both significant. The effect size was larger when learning materials were presented using dynamic pictures than when using static pictures. A negative small effect size was found for learners' cognitive load, indicating that college students and adult learners who received instruction with pictures and spoken words experienced lower cognitive load than those who received instruction with pictures and printed words. No significant difference was found in the three moderator variables analysis. Based on the results of this study, it should be taken into consideration in designing instruction for college students and adult learners the conditions of applying the modality principle, especially for length of verbal segment and type of visualization. For future studies on the modality principle, researchers may focus more on long-term learning performances, the impact of learners' cognitive characteristics, and use of comprehensive cognitive load measurement methods to measure different constructs of learners' cognitive load.

    "Abstract": "Background The Choosing Wisely campaign highlights the importance of clinical reasoning abilities for competent and reflective physicians. The principles of this campaign should be addressed in undergraduate medical education. Recent research suggests that answering questions on important steps in patient management promotes knowledge retention. It is less clear whether increasing the authenticity of educational material by the inclusion of videos further enhances learning outcome. Methods In a prospective randomised controlled cross-over study, we assessed whether repeated video-based testing is more effective than repeated text-based testing in training students to choose appropriate diagnostic tests, arrive at correct diagnoses and identify advisable therapies. Following an entry exam, fourth-year undergraduate medical students attended 10 weekly computer-based seminars during which they studied patient case histories. Each case contained five key feature questions (items) on the diagnosis and treatment of the presented patient. Students were randomly allocated to read text cases (control condition) or watch videos (intervention), and assignment to either text or video was switched between groups every week. Using a within-subjects design, student performance on video-based and text-based items was assessed 13 weeks (exit exam) and 9 months (retention test) after the first day of term. The primary outcome was the within-subject difference in performance on video-based and text-based items in the exit exam. Results Of 125 eligible students, 93 provided data for all three exams (response rate 74.4%). Percent scores were significantly higher for video-based than for text-based items in the exit exam (76.2 ± 19.4% vs. 72.4 ± 19.1%, p  = 0.026) but not the retention test (69.2 ± 20.2% vs. 66.4 ± 20.3%, p  = 0.108). An additional Bayesian analysis of this retention test suggested that video-based training is marginally more effective than text-based training in the long term (Bayes factor 2.36). Regardless of presentation format, student responses revealed a high prevalence of erroneous beliefs that, if applied to the clinical context, could place patients at risk. Conclusion Repeated video-based key feature testing produces superior short-term learning outcome compared to text-based testing. Given the high prevalence of misconceptions, efforts to improve clinical reasoning training in medical education are warranted. The Choosing Wisely campaign lends itself to being part of this process.",

    "Abstract": "Information Technology project managers have found that collective turnover of consultants lowers code quality, increases knowledge loss and negatively impacts team performance. Within the last decade, companies have begun to see that offshore consultants have a turnover rate greater than 26%, more than double the rates for the rest of the IT consulting industry. Collective turnover also puts additional pressure on the project team, causing work exhaustion and thus additional turnover. The purpose of this single case study was to explore strategies that 6 successful project managers utilized to limit and reduce the impact of collective turnover of their hybrid sourced project teams. Participants were selected through purposeful sampling, based on career experiences and history of successful project execution. Data collection was completed through semi structured face to face interviews, acquisition of company documents including knowledge transfer plans, onboarding documents and turnover statistics. Data were analyzed using coding and key word analysis. Three themes emerged from data collection on the impact collective turnover has on hybrid sourced project teams. First, collective turnover of consultants decreased team performance. Second, improving global team dynamics reduced the negative impact of collective turnover. Last using knowledge transfer tools and project documentation practices reduced the negative impact of collective turnover. This research may contribute to effectively social change by providing managers information and techniques to improve global team dynamics and remove cultural barriers from the workplace.

    "Abstract": "To compare medical students' and residents' knowledge retention of assessment, diagnosis and treatment procedures, as well as a learning experience, of patients with spinal trauma after training with either a Virtual Patient case or a video-recorded traditional lecture. A total of 170 volunteers (85 medical students and 85 residents in orthopedic surgery) were randomly allocated (stratified for student/resident and gender) to either a videorecorded standard lecture or a Virtual Patient-based training session where they interactively assessed a clinical case portraying a motorcycle accident. The knowledge retention was assessed by a test immediately following the educational intervention and repeated after a minimum of 2 months. Participants' learning experiences were evaluated with exit questionnaires. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was applied on knowledge scores. A total of 81% (n = 138) of the participants completed both tests. There was a small but significant decline in first and second test results for both groups (F(1, 135) = 18.154, p = 0.00). However, no significant differences in short-term and longterm knowledge retention were observed between the two teaching methods. The Virtual Patient group reported higher learning experience levels in engagement, stimulation, general perception, and expectations. Participants' levels engagement were reported in favor of the VP format. Similar knowledge retention was achieved through either a Virtual Patient or a recorded lecture.",

    "Abstract": "Social Engineering has become a significant threat to the security of business, government, and academic institutions. As vulnerabilities to social engineering attacks increase, organizations must incorporate risk mitigation strategies to their portfolios of Information Systems Security Countermeasures (ISSC). The goal is to implement mitigation strategies that balance the cost of implementation, the privacy of employees, and the resulting expected costs of social engineering attacks. In this paper we develop an analytical model that calculates the total cost of protection, including the trade-off between the cost of implementing protection strategies and the resulting expected cost of social engineering attacks. We use the model to examine the sensitivity of total costs to various model parameters, including costs of training, knowledge retention and depreciation rate, and number of employees. This model builds on prior work from the Ponemon Institute examining the economic costs of social engineering attacks and the methods implemented to reduce the risk and mitigate the costs of such attacks. In particular, we leverage the empirical analysis presented in Ponemon Institute(2015) to develop a model that examines the economic impacts of various mitigation strategies and the resulting economic trade-offs. This works illustrates that knowledge and awareness among users is an effective method for controlling social engineering threats. The scenarios highlighted in this work illustrated how costs play a role in protection using knowledge as a countermeasure and found the most cost effective solutions using the same model used by Ponemon(2015). This analysis may help companies develop efficient ways to protect themselves from social engineering attacks while efficiently managing resources in the social engineering realm.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Knowledge loss caused by employee exit has become a significant corporate risk. This paper aims to explore how to measure the impact of knowledge loss. The paper is based on empirical evidence from a five-year longitudinal study. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a longitudinal change project for a large Australian Research Council Linkage Project grant in the period 2008-2013. The method was a single case study using a critical realism paradigm. The project was a transformational change programme which aimed to help make the partner organization a learning organization to minimize the impact of knowledge loss. The partner organization was a large Australian Government Department, which faced the threat of knowledge loss caused by its ageing workforce. The sample was 118 respondents, mainly engineering and technical workers. A total of 150 respondents were invited to participate in the study which involved an annual survey and attendance at regular training workshops and related activities, with a participation rate of 79 per cent. Findings: The results found that knowledge loss has most negative impact in terms of organizational problems including low productivity (morale), strategic misalignment of the workforce (capability gaps), resource cuts (stakeholders unhappy with performance), decreased work quantity and quality (inexperienced employees), work outputs not being used (customers mistrust), longer time to competence (learning cost) and slow task completion (increased search cycle time). The second most significant impact was increased sense of risk associated with work activities and declining capacity to manage the risk. The third main impact was decreased organizational knowledge base: knowledge loss creates knowledge deficit which is unlikely to be filled over time, as shown by the knowledge accounts of surviving employees which remained stable overall. The two remaining measurement constructs—psychological contract and learning organizational capacity—improved, which suggests that the negative impact of knowledge loss may be addressed with appropriate knowledge management. Research limitations/implications: The research is based on a single case study in a public sector organization. While the longitudinal nature of the study and the rich data collected offsets this issue, it also presents good opportunities for researchers and practitioners to test the ideas presented in this paper in other industry contexts. The complexity and range of the constructs, concepts and scale items is acknowledged. Tables have been used wherever possible to help the reader access the findings. Practical implications: Knowledge loss is perhaps the greatest corporate risk facing organizations today. This paper provides a method to measure the impact of knowledge loss. Managers may use this to assess the significance of the risk and use this as a business case to take action to minimize the impact of knowledge loss. Originality/value: Prior research has found knowledge loss has caused decreased psychological contract, lost organizational memory, inefficiency and ineffectiveness and declining capability; however, these concepts are discussed in broad terms only. This paper addresses the need for measurement concepts which helps us understand the nature of the impact of knowledge loss. Five knowledge loss concepts are developed: knowledge resources, psychological contract, learning organization capacity, risk management and organizational problems. The results are based on a large-scale longitudinal study providing empirical evidence of change over a three-year period, situated within the context of a research intervention, i.e. knowledge management programme.

    "Abstract": "This qualitative case study documented the perceptions of K-8 ELA teachers and reading interventionists in Northeast Florida. The research problem explored the effectiveness of remediation strategies implemented into the course design to improve student proficiency on end-of-year state assessments. Data collection included semi-structured interviews, nonparticipant observations, and a review of physical documents. Semi-structured interviews were conducted until data saturation was reached. The theoretical framework of this qualitative case study was based on: social cognitive theory; literary theory; and choice theory. A lack of horizontal procedures my produce inconsistencies when examining student’s grade-level performance. Interview responses from 20 ELA teachers were manually analyzed with the assistance of Microsoft Word and revealed six emergent themes. Three themes related to remediation perceptions: theme 1, Proficiency Standards and Knowledge Retention determine the effectiveness of Remediation; theme 2, Differentiated Instruction increases Remediation effectiveness; and theme 3, Remediation is a gradual Process of Cognitive Development. Three themes related to pedagogical beliefs: theme 4, Instructional Strategies to assess Learning and observe Student’s Behavior; theme 5, Course Material containing Strategies for Remediation in K-8 ELA; and theme 6, Remediation Challenges that limit the effectiveness of Intervention. Each theme included a set of quality indicators. The findings may lead to models for remediation or development of policy connected to remediation in K-8 ELA.",

    "Abstract": "Problem: Prediabetes is an increasingly prevalent condition, involving the recognition of elevated blood glucose levels through a diagnostic hemoglobin A1C reading between 5.7% and 6.4%; if left unaddressed, severe complications may occur (American Diabetes Association [ADA], 2016; Menke, Casagrande, Geiss & Cowie, 2015). While research has shown that successful incorporation of the lifestyle modifications of diet and exercise can lower the risk for these complications by up to 58%, the utilization of beneficial modifications has not been reported by all of those with this condition (ADA, 2016; Dorsey & Songer, 2011). Project Aim: The purpose of this project was to distinguish if newly diagnosed adults with prediabetes who were provided with both verbal and written education, compared to those who only received verbal education, would experience an improved retention of information regarding necessary lifestyle modifications, and demonstrate a willingness to change in a one-month follow-up survey. Project Method: The theoretical framework for this project is the Transtheoretical Model of behavior change (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). The project took place across four local, urban primary care clinics. Participants were separated into two groups at the time of agreeing to project involvement using consecutive assignment. Group A received verbal instructions from their healthcare provider regarding prediabetes, and then participated in a teach-back session with the DNP student to further review the ADA's (2016) recommendations for lifestyle modifications. Group B received the same verbal education, but was also provided with an educational leaflet from the ADA (2016) during their teach-back session. Research has shown that more than half of the education patients receive during office visits is either forgotten or incorrect (AHRQ, 2015). To enhance knowledge retention, emphasis was placed on utilizing the validated Teach Back Method (AHRQ, 2015) for all participants. One-month Likert scale follow-up surveys were electronically delivered to all participants for evaluation and assessment of the project's outcomes. Project Findings: Follow-up surveys were sent electronically to the 13 project participants, 12 completed surveys were returned. Data were gathered and analyzed. The Mann Whitney U Test (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) was used to calculate statistical significance (p=<0.05). Significant improvement was noted with Group B's responses to how often they felt the verbal instructions they received regarding their condition were easy to understand (U=5, p<0.0455). Significant findings were also noted with Group B's responses quantifying how often anyone in their healthcare practice asked them to describe how they were going to follow their specific health instructions (U= 3.5, p<0.0251). There were no significant findings seen in the prediabetes management portion of the electronic survey: overall feeling well managing prediabetes (p=0.689), would like to do better with exercising (p=0.873), would like to improve with eating better foods (p=0.749), currently doing well with exercising (p=0.749), currently doing well with eating better foods (p=0.936). No significance was noted on the last health literacy question in the electronic survey regarding how often participants felt their health care providers and staff had spent time with them (p=0.093). Conclusion: Including written materials, along with verbal instruction, regarding the new diagnosis of prediabetes and necessary lifestyle modifications can improve ease of patient learning and foster opportunities for health care workers to utilize the validated teach-back method. Further research is recommended to evaluate the relationship between verbal and written education and retention of prediabetes management instruction and willingness to change by incorporating recommended lifestyle modifications.

    "Abstract": "The orchid species richness of Sichuan Province is second highest in China, but price speculation and overharvest have led to significant population collapses in recent years. Though the integral link between biological and cultural diversity is well documented, understanding of the cultural impact of biological extinction events is limited. This dissertation tested the hypothesis that the loss of biodiversity results in an associated loss of cultural knowledge in relation to the orchid biocultural diversity in Sichuan. It was divided into four parts. 1) A knowledge survey to test the relationship between orchid biodiversity decline and cultural knowledge loss on four different orchid knowledge types in eight villages in rural Sichuan. 2) A complementary knowledge survey to test how the impacts of urbanization on people's orchid knowledge differed based on knowledge type, with interviews conducted in three jurisdictions in Sichuan with differing levels of urbanization. 3) A social network analysis of the same 8 villages from part 1, tested how an individual's social position within a community and a network's overall structure might mitigate the loss of knowledge resulting from local species extinction. 4) An in-depth literature review and case study analysis of six key Chinese botanical gardens to identify which model(s) are most effective at orchid biocultural diversity conservation. Results revealed species extinction drives significant cultural knowledge loss, across all types of knowledge. Social network structure and rural proximity to natural areas are not sufficient by themselves to preserve a community's knowledge following species extinction. Comprehensive botanical gardens are uniquely positioned to effectively maintain ex situ collections of threatened plant species and cultural knowledge, manage in situ populations, work to restore natural ecosystems, and reintroduce species back into the wild and traditional knowledge back into local communities. However, the current botanical garden institutional capacity within Sichuan is inadequate to address these conservation goals, with the need for three to five new BG in the province. These findings help advance our understanding of how biodiversity loss affects cultural knowledge loss, with implications for biocultural diversity conservation more generally.

    "Abstract": "This dissertation investigated the effects of temporal distribution of practice (relatively massed vs. distributed) on the learning and retention of oral Mandarin tonal word production by native English-speaking adults within the theoretical framework of skill acquisition and retention theories. The present study focused on oral production of Mandarin two-syllable words as a function of temporal distribution of practice. It also explored whether the effects of this distribution differ depending on the type of knowledge to be acquired or retained (declarative word knowledge vs. skills in oral production) and on individual differences in cognitive aptitudes (including working memory, phonological short-term memory, declarative memory, procedural memory, and musical aptitude). Eighty native English-speaking adults who did not have any prior knowledge of a tonal language completed all sessions of the study and provided data for analysis. These participants were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions, i.e., Condition A with a 1-day ISI (intersession interval) and a 1-week RI (retention interval), Condition B with a 1-day ISI and a 4-week RI, Condition C with a 1-week ISI and a 1-week RI, and Condition D with a 1-week ISI and a 4-week RI. Each participant came in for five sessions. All participants completed a set of cognitive aptitude tests and underwent the same number and content of training sessions, which differed only on training or testing schedules. The results showed that the effects of ISI and RI differed depending on the type of knowledge/skill to be retained, declarative versus procedural. For the retention of declarative knowledge, RI had a robust effect: the longer the RI, the worse the retention. Spacing, or distributed practice seemed to improve long-term retention of declarative knowledge; however, this ISI effect was much weaker. With regard to procedural knowledge retention, ISI seems to play a role, but not RI, and it was massed practice that had an advantage over distributed practice. Musical aptitude, working memory, and declarative memory ability were found to play facilitative roles in L2 learning of Mandarin tonal word productions. Procedural memory ability was found to interact with ISI and RI for various RT outcome measures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "This study is a meta-analysis investigating the effectiveness of applying the modality principle on learners’ learning performances in knowledge retention and knowledge transfer and learners’ cognitive load for college students and adult learners. Three moderator variables were tested to find out if they affect the degree of the effects: (a) pace of presentation, (b) length of verbal segment, and (c) type of visualization. Primary studies focused on the modality principle in instructional contexts from 1995 to 2017 were searched and 41 studies were selected through the literature search and screening processes. Seventy-six pairs of comparisons involving 3,917 participants were identified from the selected studies. The overall effects of the modality principle for learning performances were analyzed using a multivariate meta-analysis with the random effects model. A small effect size was found for knowledge retention, and a medium effect size was found for knowledge transfer. The results of the overall effect sizes analysis showed that the effect size for knowledge transfer was larger than the effect size for knowledge retention. For pace of presentation, no significant result was found for knowledge retention or knowledge transfer. For length of verbal segment, a significant difference was found between the effect size of the long verbal segment subgroup and the short verbal segment subgroup for knowledge transfer but not for knowledge retention. The effect size of the short verbal segment subgroup was larger than the effect size of the long verbal segment subgroup for knowledge transfer. For type of visualization, the results for knowledge retention and knowledge transfer were both significant. The effect size was larger when learning materials were presented using dynamic pictures than when using static pictures. A negative small effect size was found for learners’ cognitive load, indicating that college students and adult learners who received instruction with pictures and spoken words experienced lower cognitive load than those who received instruction with pictures and printed words. No significant difference was found in the three moderator variables analysis. Based on the results of this study, it should be taken into consideration in designing instruction for college students and adult learners the conditions of applying the modality principle, especially for length of verbal segment and type of visualization. For future studies on the modality principle, researchers may focus more on long-term learning performances, the impact of learners’ cognitive characteristics, and use of comprehensive cognitive load measurement methods to measure different constructs of learners’ cognitive load.",

    "Abstract": "By the year 2025, 75% of the workforce will consist of Generation Y (Kim, 2017). With the major shift in the workforce, organizations must consider the different learning styles and expectations of the Y generation, as compared to the previous, dominant generations (Tulgan, 2009). In order to determine if there is a difference in short-term and long-term retention levels when deploying two different modalities of training within an organizational training program specific to the Y Generation, a quantitative quasi-experimental study was used. The study consisted of 40 subjects who were administered pretest, immediate post and long-term posttests in conjunction with a training module. The findings from this study demonstrate that although knowledge retention decreases over time, knowledge retention scores were higher on the short-term assessments compared to the scores on the long-term assessments. However, there was a sharper decline in knowledge retention among employees who participated in computer-based training compared to employees who participated in face-to-face training. Based on these findings, all null hypotheses can be rejected. In sum, these findings provide support for the use of face-to-face training modalities for employees who fall within Generation Y. The results support the need for training programs to use face-to-face training modalities for employees who fall within Generation Y. Despite exciting new technology, it can be stated that computers should not replace classrooms and teachers, for training purposes, in the immediate future.

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was two-fold. In Specific Aim One, we examined the associations between education level, personal trainer credentials and characteristics, and knowledge of exercise science and personal training principles. In Specific Aim Two we examined associations between education, personal trainer credentials and knowledge of personal trainers with client retention. This study utilized a cross-sectional research design. An anonymous electronic survey was used to collect the data. Eligible participants (N = 226) were individuals who were providing one-on-one personal training services for at least one client. All data were assessed for normality prior to data analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate sample characteristics. Mean and standard deviations, median and interquartile range [IQR] or frequency and percentages were reported for the sample characteristics. Bivariate associations were examined with dependent t-tests and one-way ANOVAs for normally distributed data. Mann- Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for non-normally distributed variables. The median knowledge score for the sample was 6.0 [3.00] points, out of a possible 24, with 92.5% of the sample scoring 10 or lower. Sex (Male/Female), education level, having a degree in the field, certification status (yes/no) and number of certifications were not associated with knowledge scores (p > 0.05). Years of experience in personal training was positively associated with mean knowledge scores (H(3) = 9.280, p = 0.026). Sex of the personal trainer, having a degree in the field (yes/no), the number of personal trainer certifications, the cost of training, the type of facility, the type of employment of the personal trainer and knowledge scores were not associated with client retention (p > 0.05). Education level (F 3,87 = 8.176, p < 0.001), personal training certification (yes/no) (t 38 = 2.277, p = 0.029), years of experience (F 3,87 = 3.169, p = 0.028), facility size (F 4,84 = 8.049, p < 0.001), and exercise science degree type (F 3,48 = 6.008, p = 0.001) were all associated with client retention. This study provides insight on knowledge retention of active personal trainers on subject matter deemed foundational by four certifying organizations. The findings should influence both the preparatory learning and well as continuing education approaches of both certifying organizations and institutions of higher learning.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge is a key resource for firms, capable of providing a firm-level competitive advantage. Interfirm networks are a valuable source of knowledge for firms, as both breadth and depth of knowledge can be developed via interfirm relationships. However, for firms that have acquired and developed valuable knowledge assets, they may view their interfirm network as providing an opportunity for knowledge loss via knowledge spillovers. Knowledge spillovers allow the recipient to gain knowledge without compensation to the knowledge-originating firm. Spillovers lead to a loss of present and future value to the knowledge-originating firm. Indeed, firms with valuable knowledge asset may implement network safeguards to limit potential knowledge spillovers via their network size, intensity, structure, and position within the network. While extant research has examined the effect of networks on knowledge outcomes, limited attention has been paid to how firms may adapt their networks to safeguard their knowledge once they have created significant value in their knowledge assets. Furthermore, as networks are a key knowledge resource, it is unknown if these network safeguards will harm the future value of the firm’s knowledge asset due to the restriction of available knowledge. This dissertation seeks to explore these issues by examining how firms with knowledge assets of high value may safeguard their knowledge via their network size, intensity, structure, and position, and ultimately how these efforts may impact the value of their future knowledge assets.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Knowledge retention plays an important role in combating organisational knowledge loss. However, some organisations, including mining companies, still lose organisational knowledge because of employees’ retiring, resigning, downsizing, attrition and so on. This leaves the organisations with a shortage of qualified senior experienced employees to meet production needs, which has a negative impact on the running of the operational functions on a day-to-day basis. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate knowledge retention strategies in a platinum mine in the North West Province of South Africa. Method: The study used qualitative research approach. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Results: The key findings of the study revealed that although the mine has a knowledge retention policy, some of the employees are not aware of its existence and there was not enough support of knowledge retention initiatives from the management. Conclusion: The study concludes by arguing that having knowledge retention policy, strategies and initiatives on paper but failing to implement is as good as not having it. The organisation needs to implement knowledge retention policy in order to benefit from the knowledge retention initiative.",

    "Abstract": "The nuclear power industry in the United States (U.S.) has gone through various changes throughout its history. Most recently, plans to grow the industry through the construction of new power plants have ceased. Because of this, the industry is at a period where the longevity and resilience of existing nuclear power plants are vital to its subsistence. One of the ways existing nuclear power plants can assure longevity and resilience is by performing engineering design modifications efficiently and at a lower cost. Strategic plans, such as the Delivering the Nuclear Promise, can support nuclear utilities to achieve this. Another strategy to accomplish longevity and resilience is to ensure individuals performing these projects possess the proper knowledge to complete tasks efficiently while being cost-effective. Knowledge retention is the main purpose of this research project. This doctoral dissertation develops a case study for engineering design modification projects at nuclear power plants, with the intention of it becoming a knowledge retention tool to support the longevity and resilience of the industry. A literature review of subjects such as an overview of nuclear power plants, license renewal, resilience, and knowledge management comprises the first part of this paper. The literature review is followed by the description of the research methodology and the results of the research. Three parts comprise the results section. Part one develops a work breakdown structure (WBS) for a design modification project. Part two provides a list of activity descriptions that need to be completed as part of a conceptual design package, including estimated person-hours and proposed durations for each activity. The third part performs a risk assessment using the Failure Modes and Effects (FMEA) tool. This section identifies potential failure modes for each activity, causes of failure, human performance tools that can help prevent or detect the failures, and recommends actions to address and mitigate the risks identified. The results of this case study demonstrate how, with the correct knowledge, engineering design modification risks can be mitigated and activities can be accounted for when developing project estimates. This information can assist the future development of efficient and cost-effective projects within the nuclear industry.",

    "Abstract": "Efficacy of games as learning medium is of interest to researchers and the gaming industry. A critical metric for learning is knowledge retention and very few studies have conducted in-depth comparisons of: a) game versus no-game learning, b) collaborative versus individual learning. Towards this, the study reported in this article will present the findings from an experiment using Asia and world maps, cut into pieces as in a jigsaw puzzle. The participants were primary school children who were randomly assigned to the puzzle and no-puzzle group. To understand the role of collaborative interactions in learning, each group was further divided into two subgroups. Each subgroup either solved the puzzle or studied the full map (no-puzzle) individually or collaboratively. Three post-tests were conducted over a period of 10 days. The mean scores and Mann Whitney test shows: a) In the no-puzzle condition, no difference in the average scores of the individual and collaborative groups for both maps was observed, b) In the puzzle condition, the collaborative group score was slightly more than that of the individual group for Asia map, while the difference was significant for the continent map, and c) Puzzle and no-puzzle individual group scores were comparative for Asia map but the continent map groups showed a major difference. The findings are mixed with collaborative puzzle solving showing higher retention while puzzle solving does not show significant effect on learning and retention.",

    "Abstract": "A central argument in the research on traditional knowledge, which persists in the scientific literature, is that the entrance of exotic plants in local medical systems is directly associated with acculturation. However, this logic has put an end for a long period to efforts to understand why such species have so successfully entered socio-ecological systems or even their real role in such systems. This study provides evidence that (1) in some socio-environmental contexts, exotic medicinal species usually confer greater adaptive advantages to local populations, and (2) despite their general importance, exotic species only excel in medical systems when cost-benefit ratio is favorable to them. Thus, in order to avoid the loss of knowledge about native plants and to ensure biocultural conservation, it is necessary to create strategies to amplify the advantages of these species.A central argument in the research on traditional knowledge, which persists in the scientific literature, is that the entrance of exotic plants in local medical systems is directly associated with acculturation.

    "Abstract": "Safeguarding assets, especially information, is a common challenge complicated by advancing technology and human interaction. The human factor is the most vulnerable element posing threats to the security of information, data, and digital assets. The problem is, little is known about whether training reinforcement improves knowledge retention. In order to enhance preparedness, a quantitative study was needed to remove the potential for employee self-evaluation bias, or over-estimation of capabilities and determine the need for training reinforcement. The purpose of this quantitative design study was to compare groups (one control and one test group) to determine the effect of training reinforcement intervention on a population of 379 West Virginia university faculty, adjunct faculty, and staff. This researcher used an online training program, followed by online post-test exams. A quantitative study was the best approach because numerical data answers the research question, meets the purpose and addresses the problem. This researcher used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test the null hypothesis and compare the means between groups. The system randomly assigned participants only one group. The same dependent variable was measures for each group. A between-group variance identified the amount of variation between the different data sets. There was a significant effect in training reinforcement on participants' scores at the p<.05 level for the F(1, 72) = 29.365, p = .000. The finding of this study leads the researcher to recommend employee preparedness training reinforcement. The part-time participants scored lower than full-time participants, also suggesting a need for additional training. Additional research into potential reasons part-time employees scored lower will support the organization's efforts to enhance preparedness.

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the effectiveness of matching learners' optimal learning styles to their overall knowledge retention. The study attempted to determine if learners who are placed in an online learning environment that matches their optimal learning styles will retain the information at a higher rate than those learners who are not in an adapted learning environment. There were 56 participants that took one of two lessons; the first lesson was textual based, had no hypertext, and was not influenced heavily by the coherence principle, while the second lesson was multimedia based utilizing hypermedia guided by the coherence principle. Each participant took Felder and Soloman's (1991, 2000) Index of Learning Styles (ILS) questionnaire and was classified using the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM; 1998) into four individual categories. Groups were separated using the Visual/Verbal section of the FSLSM with 55% (n = 31) of participants going to the adapted group, and 45% (n =25) of participants going to the non-adapted group. Each participant completed an immediate posttest directly after the lesson and a retention posttest a week later. Several repeated measures MANOVA tests were conducted to measure the significance of differences in the tests between groups and within groups. Repeated measures MANOVA tests were conducted to determine if significance existed between the immediate posttest results and the retention posttest results. Also, participants were asked their perspectives if the lesson type they received was beneficial to their perceived learning of the material. Of the 56 students who took part in this study, 31 students were placed in the adapted group and 25 in the non-adapted group based on outcomes of the ILS and the FLSSM. No significant differences were found between groups taking the multimedia lesson and the textual lesson in the immediate posttest. No significant differences were found between the adapted and the non-adapted groups on the immediate posttest. No significant difference was found between the adapted and the non-adapted groups on the retention posttest. However, results also revealed that the adapted group scored significantly higher on the retention posttest when compared with the immediate posttest. Interestingly, the non-adapted group scored significantly higher on the immediate posttest when compared with the retention posttest. When queried about the perception of benefit of the lesson style, 42% of the adapted group replied in the affirmative following the immediate posttest, yet that percentage grew to 81% following the retention posttest. The non-adapted group had 28% reply in the affirmative following the immediate posttest, and that percentage grew to 48% following the retention posttest. Both groups found benefit, yet the numbers associated with the adapted group were higher. Overall perceptions of benefit corresponded to higher test scores as opposed to those who did not find benefit, who had a lower score. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "Through advancements in modern medicine, human beings worldwide are living longer. The increase in life expectancy creates a need for a more qualified and knowledgeable nursing workforce for the delivery of quality geriatric health care. Although nurses are the primary care providers for vulnerable older adults, they are generally not well trained or prepared in geriatric care. Therefore, the purpose of the project was to develop an education program aimed at improving nursing knowledge of geriatric care in the long-term care (LTC) setting. The goal of the project was to answer the research question: What impact would attendance in the program have on improving nursing geriatric knowledge, retention, and job satisfaction by project end? Guided by the advancing research and clinical practice through close collaboration (ARCC) model for evidence-based practice (EBP), the learning needs of nurses in the LTC setting were assessed. The 6-week education program was designed to provide education on the basics of geriatric care, pharmacology and aging, symptom evaluation, dementia care, and geriatric physical assessment. Project participants consisted of 8 nurses who volunteered to take part in the program. The program was evaluated using a pre-test and post-test method to examine nurse's knowledge before and after the education program. Using a paired t test, the results indicated a significant increase (p < .05) between the mean pre-test (3.75) and mean post-test (4.25) scores of nurse knowledge of geriatric care. The education program improved participant knowledge of geriatric care. Positive social change will be achieved with this scholarly project as nurses with greater knowledge gain confidence, strengthen decision making and clinical skills, and improve patient outcomes in the LTC setting.

    "Abstract": "Information Technology project managers have found that collective turnover of consultants lowers code quality, increases knowledge loss and negatively impacts team performance. Within the last decade, companies have begun to see that offshore consultants have a turnover rate greater than 26%, more than double the rates for the rest of the IT consulting industry. Collective turnover also puts additional pressure on the project team, causing work exhaustion and thus additional turnover. The purpose of this single case study was to explore strategies that 6 successful project managers utilized to limit and reduce the impact of collective turnover of their hybrid sourced project teams. Participants were selected through purposeful sampling, based on career experiences and history of successful project execution. Data collection was completed through semi structured face to face interviews, acquisition of company documents including knowledge transfer plans, onboarding documents and turnover statistics. Data were analyzed using coding and key word analysis. Three themes emerged from data collection on the impact collective turnover has on hybrid sourced project teams. First, collective turnover of consultants decreased team performance. Second, improving global team dynamics reduced the negative impact of collective turnover. Last using knowledge transfer tools and project documentation practices reduced the negative impact of collective turnover. This research may contribute to effectively social change by providing managers information and techniques to improve global team dynamics and remove cultural barriers from the workplace.",

    "Abstract": "This dissertation is a qualitative investigation of the phenomenon of flow states and peak experiences encountered by four participants from a 16-day river trip through the Grand Canyon. In contemporary society, a troubling dichotomy exists between an unprecedented access to information, with a simultaneous loss of knowledge and appreciation of the restorative benefits of nature. The purpose of this research was to explore the capacity of remote environments to facilitate flow states, peak experiences, and transpersonal meaning. The study utilized the heuristic research method to systematically explore the phenomenology and assigned meaning of a singular human experience. Data was collected through retrospective phone interviews and e-mail correspondences. The six-stage research process identified parallel themes in the participants reported encounters with flow states, peak experiences, and assigned transpersonal meaning, which included positive influences on physical and emotional well-being, and a deeper appreciation for the natural world. The results of this research supported the existing relevant literature and highlighted the potential of immersive nature encounters to promote personal growth, happiness, self-understanding, social connectedness, and respect for nature and the greater circle of life. The study's findings may be useful in developing nature-based continuing education curriculum for healthcare providers, designing therapeutic interventions for clinical and sub-clinical adult and adolescent populations, and promoting awareness and dissemination of information about the restorative value of the natural world to human health and well-being.

INTRODUCTION Recently, medical education has made significant progress, and medical teachers are trying to find methods that have most impressive effects on learning. One of the useful learning methods is student active participation. One of the helpful teaching aids in this method is mobile technology. The present study aimed to determine the effect of sending educational questions through short message service (SMS) on academic achievement and satisfaction of medical students and compare that with lecture teaching.In an semi-experimental, two chapters of urology reference book, Smiths General Urology 17 th edition, were taught to 47 medical students of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in urology course in 2013 academic year. Kidney tumors chapter was educated by sending questions through SMS, and bladder tumors part was taught in a lecture session. For each method, pretest and posttest were held, each consisting of thirty multiple choice questions. To examine the knowledge retention, a test session was held on the same terms for each chapter, 1 month later. At the end, survey forms were distributed to assess student's satisfaction with SMS learning method. Data were analyzed through using SPSS 20. SUBJECTS AND METHODS In an semi-experimental, two chapters of urology reference book, Smiths General Urology 17th edition, were taught to 47 medical students of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in urology course in 2013 academic year. Kidney tumors chapter was educated by sending questions through SMS, and bladder tumors part was taught in a lecture session. For each method, pretest and posttest were held, each consisting of thirty multiple choice questions. To examine the knowledge retention, a test session was held on the same terms for each chapter, 1 month later. At the end, survey forms were distributed to assess student's satisfaction with SMS learning method. Data were analyzed through using SPSS 20.The findings demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the two learning methods in the medication test scores. Evaluation of the satisfaction showed 78.72% of participants were not satisfied. RESULTS The findings demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the two learning methods in the medication test scores. Evaluation of the satisfaction showed 78.72% of participants were not satisfied.The results of the study showed that distance learning through SMS in medical students could lead to increase knowledge, however, it was not effective on their satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS The results of the study showed that distance learning through SMS in medical students could lead to increase knowledge, however, it was not effective on their satisfaction.",

    "Abstract": "Local and indigenous knowledge is being transformed globally, particularly being eroded when pertaining to ecology. In many parts of the world, rural and indigenous communities are facing tremendous cultural, economic and environmental changes, which contribute to weaken their local knowledge base. In the face of profound and ongoing environmental changes, both cultural and biological diversity are likely to be severely impacted as well as local resilience capacities from this loss. In this global literature review, we analyse the drivers of various types of local and indigenous ecological knowledge transformation and assess the directionality of the reported change. Results of this analysis show a global impoverishment of local and indigenous knowledge with 77% of papers reporting the loss of knowledge driven by globalization, modernization, and market integration. The recording of this loss, however, is not symmetrical, with losses being recorded more strongly in medicinal and ethnobotanical knowledge. Persistence of knowledge (15% of the studies) occurred in studies where traditional practices were being maintained consiously and where hybrid knowledge was being produced as a resut of certain types of incentives created by economic development. This review provides some insights into local and indigenous ecological knowledge change, its causes and implications, and recommends venues for the development of replicable and comparative research. The larger implication of these results is that because of the interconnection between cultural and biological diversity, the loss of local and indigenous knowledge is likely to critically threaten effective conservation of biodiversity, particularly in community-based conservation local efforts.Local and indigenous knowledge is being transformed globally, particularly being eroded when pertaining to ecology.

    "Abstract": "Approximately 50% of New York City hospitals lack succession planning as baby boomers transition out of the workforce into retirement. The potential loss of knowledge capital could affect leadership development and corporate stability. Guided by the transformational leadership theory, the purpose of this single site case study was to explore successful strategies executive-level leaders used to facilitate succession planning within their hospital. Three hospital executive-level leaders from a single site location participated in a semistructured face-to-face interview and provided data that assisted the analysis. Four themes emerged from the data analysis through a word cloud format that showed the most commonly used words and phrases from participants’ responses to interview questions and review of company succession planning documents. The themes were organizational strategies used to promote executive-level succession planning, encouraging peer-mentorship, knowledge sharing strategies, and talent management. The findings revealed that the participants’ organization lacked formal succession planning strategies, but policies were in place that promoted in-house training and development to prepare the next generation of executive-level leaders. The findings of this study can contribute to positive social change by providing a work-related environment that embraces knowledge sharing and leadership development to increase leadership performance, income, and productivity, to ensure a better quality of life for employees and to improve the healthcare of patients and the community served.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge retention and learning transfer are important to organizations. The topics of knowledge retention and learning transfer are consistently researched individually. However, there is a gap in the existing literature on the relationship between employee perception of facilitating knowledge retention learning transfer. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between employee perception of facilitating knowledge retention and employee perception of learning transfer. A quantitative methodology was used to examine knowledge retention and learning transfer from the employee perception. The Learning Transfer System Inventory ([LTSI]), (Bates, Holton, & Hatala, \"A Revised Learning Transfer System Inventory: Factorial Replication and Validation\", 2012) was the instrument used to measure the employee perception. Current employees of the Middle Atlantic government who were members of a selected professional association and have attended at least one training program offered by the government were the targeted population. Findings of the study support that a transfer design had a high correlation with the opportunity to use and perceived content validity. The lowest correlation was the opportunity to use and personal capacity for transfer. Based on the statistical data, there is a significant relationship between environmental and motivational factors and employee perception of learning transfer and facilitating knowledge retention; and there is no relationship between individual factors and employee perception of learning transfer and facilitating knowledge retention. This study is important, as it may be a valuable addition to the existing body of knowledge in the field of human resource management, by contributing new or additional knowledge on facilitating knowledge retention and learning transfer. The study is also valuable to the field of business by providing relevant information that will allow organizations to develop effective training programs that will equip employees with the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to contribute to the success of the organization.

    "Abstract": "Introduction Podcasts and blog posts have gained popularity in Free Open Access Medical education (FOAM). Previous work suggests that podcasts may be useful for knowledge acquisition in undergraduate medical education. However, there remains a paucity of research comparing the two mediums. This study aims to investigate if there are differences in knowledge acquisition and usage conditions by medical students using podcasts and blog posts. Methods Medical students were randomized to either the podcast or blog post group. They completed an initial online assessment of their baseline knowledge on the subject matter. Participants then received access to learning materials and were given four weeks to complete the follow-up assessment on their own time. Independent t-test, paired samples t-test, and a mixed ANOVA (analysis of variance) were conducted to assess knowledge acquisition. An intention-to-teach analysis was used to impute missing data from students lost to follow-up. Simple descriptive statistical data was used to describe media usage conditions. Results Completion of at least one follow-up assessment was comparable (68% podcasts (n = 21/31), 73% blog posts (n = 22/30)). Both groups showed significant improvements in their test scores, with an average 22% improvement for the podcast group and 29% for the blog post group. There was no significant statistical difference in knowledge acquisition between educational modalities overall. Students in the blog post group that completed both post-intervention quizzes showed a larger improvement than the podcast group in the toxicology topic, with similar improvements in the asthma topic. The podcast group tended to engage in multiple activities while using the learning materials (e.g. at least two to three of the following: driving, eating, chores, taking notes, exercising/walking), while the blog readers tended to do fewer activities (e.g. only one of the following: note taking, eating). Conclusion This study suggests that podcasts and blog posts are useful for extracurricular knowledge acquisition by undergraduate medical students with no significant difference between the two modalities. The usage conditions for each type of media differ.",

    "Abstract": "Physicians and others who work in QI have developed the habit of being concerned with better patient outcomes, better system performance and better professional development as separate and distinct entities.1 During the last five years, the Clinical Care Improvement Training Program (CCITP) has been implemented as a formal curriculum that teaches QI principles to health care providers across Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), a large JCI accredited group of tertiary hospitals in Qatar.While lectures are powerful methods for delivering large amount of information, studies have shown that interactive teaching styles are more popular and that the use of more of them would result in better knowledge retention.2'3 Thus, through combining them with other modalities such as simulation, problem based learning and group discussions, a better learning experience is achieved.4, 5 E-learning embraces an approach that typically aspires to be flexible, engaging and learner-centered; one that encourages interaction, and collaboration and communication, often asynchronously.6 Blended learning (BL), also known as hybrid learning, is a concept that describes the integration of classroom face-to-face instructions with online learning experiences.Enhancing participants' interaction in group activities has a positive impact on the learning process unlike the didactic lectures.9 The new BL format created a sense of community among participants through group discussion and collaboration and thus produced a stronger sense of community among students than either traditional or fully online courses through providing collaborative learning experiences.10 Conclusions BL is a well perceived teaching modality in medical education.",

[...]this article offers medical practice managers six strategies they can use to avoid burnout themselves. [...]there is more at stake for a medical practice with burned out employees than simply declines in performance. Besides the obvious consequences of burnout, there is also the potential for a great loss of knowledge, expertise, and creativity. [...]according to Bailey,12 many studies show that burned-out employees have lower cortisol levels than their peers. Because cortisol helps restrain activation of the immune system and other components of the stress response, Smith explains, a deficit may disinhibit immune function, leading to hyperactivity of innate immune inflammatory responses.",

    "Abstract": "The problem was the lack of effective succession planning strategies to facilitate the transfer of technical expertise from retiring employees to younger employees. A rebound of oil exploration activities in Nigeria would adversely affect the drilling sector due to lack of preparation and succession planning to meet the demand for technical expertise. The purpose of this case study was to explore how a succession planning program contributes to knowledge transfer and development of expertise for business continuity and prevents loss of knowledge in the oil-drilling sector in Nigeria. Twenty-four participants from one oil-drilling contractor in Nigeria participated in the study. The conceptual framework was guided by knowledge creation theory, succession planning concepts, and transformational leadership theory. Data collection included semistructured face-to-face interviews supplemented with document review. Data analysis involved a traditional text method where data coder pace each piece of data into various categories by hand. This study revealed 4 themes: individual development program, mentoring, on-the-job training, and 360-degree communication. Findings may affect oil-drilling practices by contributing to enhanced succession planning and knowledge transfer initiatives. The implication for positive social change may include the development of individuals for leadership roles and could add to the organization talent bench, and reduce knowledge gaps while ensuring business continuity.

    "Abstract": "Embodied interactions and learning have garnered a lot of interest among researchers and game designers in past years, especially with the recent development of consumer-level body sensory devices like the Microsoft Kinect. This study focused on examining whether embodied interactions, enabled by the Kinect, could lead to greater knowledge acquisition compared to traditional mouse-based interactions working with STEM-related (numeric systems) and language-related (Chinese character) learning in a virtual learning environment for adult learners. Embodied cognition, body movements and learning, cognitive processing theories were discussed as a theoretical framework for this study. A 3D virtual learning environment was designed, in which learners could interact with the instructional materials through either their body movements, or a mouse. The study utilized an experimental, two-group, pre- and posttest design. The experimental group used the Kinect-enabled embodied interactions and the control group used the traditional mouse-based interactions during an on-site learning intervention. Fifty-three adult participants were recruited and randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. Scores from immediate posttest and delayed posttest between the two groups were compared with ANCOVA using pretest score as the covariate. Statistical results informed that embodied interactions enabled by the Kinect facilitated learning in numeric systems and Chinese characters for the participating adult learners. However, compared with the mouse interaction, the embodied interaction enabled by the Kinect did not lead to significantly better knowledge retention and application results in both immediate posttest and delayed posttest in numeric systems learning. And for Chinese characters learning, compared with the mouse interaction, the embodied interaction enabled by the Kinect did not lead to significantly better knowledge retention results in the immediate posttest either, but achieved significantly better performance in the delayed posttest. The study outcome implies that Kinect-based embodied interactions do not necessarily lead to better learning performances over traditional mouse-based interactions for adult learners. The performances may depend on subject areas, and at what time learners' knowledge retrieval were evaluated. When designing computer-mediated learning modules, researchers and practitioners should not only look at the new technology and novel approaches to interacting with the computers, but also take the subject areas, learners, and time issues into consideration as well.

The intent was to ensure medical knowledge in relevant content areas that may not be addressed through clinical rotations, such as operationally relevant infectious disease. After completion, it was discussed in a small group with faculty. Over time, faculty noted increasing dissatisfaction with the activity. Spaced interval education is useful in retention of medical knowledge and skills by medical students and residents. Its use in infectious disease fellow education has not been described. To improve the quiz experience, we assessed the introduction of spaced education curriculum in our program.A pre-intervention survey was distributed to assess the monthly quiz with Likert scale and open-ended questions. A multiple-choice question spaced education curriculum was created using the Qstream(R) platform in 2011. Faculty development on question writing was conducted. Two questions were delivered every 2 d. Incorrectly and correctly answered questions were repeated after 7 and 13 d, respectively. Questions needed to be answered correctly twice to be retired. Fellow satisfaction was assessed at semi-annual fellowship reviews over 5 yr and by a one-time repeat survey. Materials and Methods A pre-intervention survey was distributed to assess the monthly quiz with Likert scale and open-ended questions. A multiple-choice question spaced education curriculum was created using the Qstream(R) platform in 2011. Faculty development on question writing was conducted. Two questions were delivered every 2 d. Incorrectly and correctly answered questions were repeated after 7 and 13 d, respectively. Questions needed to be answered correctly twice to be retired. Fellow satisfaction was assessed at semi-annual fellowship reviews over 5 yr and by a one-time repeat survey.Pre-intervention survey of six fellows indicated dissatisfaction with the time commitment of the monthly quiz (median Likert score of 2, mean 6.5 h to complete), neutral in perceived utility, but satisfaction with knowledge retention (Likert score 4). Eighteen fellows over 5 yr participated in the spaced education curriculum. Three quizzes with 20, 39, and 48 questions were designed. Seventeen percentage of questions addressed operationally relevant topics. Fifty-nine percentage of questions were answered correctly on first attempt, improving to 93% correct answer rate at the end of the analysis. Questions were attempted 2,999 times. Fellows consistently indicated that the platform was \"highly enjoyed,\" \"beneficial,\" a \"fun format,\" and \"completely satisfied.\" Fellows additionally commented that they desired more questions and considered the platform helpful in board preparation. Formal survey data post-intervention found that the fellows were satisfied with the new approach, found it to be useful in board preparation, overall educational value, and in-line with their personal learning style (median Likert score of 4 for all queries). Fellows were satisfied with time commitment, spending a mean of 47 min on the spaced education curriculum questions per month.

INTRODUCTION We evaluated the effects of implementing Team-Based Learning (TBL) on student engagement, accountability, satisfaction, and preference for lecture or team-based learning. Moreover, we assessed the effect of TBL on knowledge retention and application over time through short answer questions based on clinical scenarios addressing history taking and diagnosis skills in medical students.The study was conducted in a quasi-experimental design. The study population were all of the third-year medical students (n = 84) participating in a course of rheumatology in Shariati Hospital, which is a teaching hospital affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences. We compared TBL with the conventional lecture-based method. The assessments were performed after implementation of TBL by the Classroom Engagement Survey (CES) and Team-Based Learning Student Assessment Instrument (TBL-SAI). The assessment for application of knowledge was conducted in 3 time-points through short answer questions on rheumatic diseases. The comparison of results was made by Student's t-test and repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) using SPSS software, version 16.

The assessment for application of knowledge was conducted in 3 time-points through short answer questions on rheumatic diseases. The comparison of results was made by Student's t-test and repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) using SPSS software, version 16.The CES scores indicated a high level of engagement in TBL (Mean±SD=26.7±3.70, p=0.0001) but not in the lecture-based sessions (Mean±SD=23.80±4.35, p=0.09). The total mean score (SD) for TBL-SAI was 159.68 (14.14) for TBL sessions indicating a favorable outcome (p=0.0001). The student scores obtained from the short answer questions showed that over time the students' scores had declined significantly less for the TBL sessions in comparison to the lecture-based sessions, F (2, 166) = 4.624, p=0.011. RESULTS The CES scores indicated a high level of engagement in TBL (Mean±SD=26.7±3.70, p=0.0001) but not in the lecture-based sessions (Mean±SD=23.80±4.35, p=0.09).

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of interactive learning technology in the classroom can impact knowledge retention among students as compared to classrooms where interactive learning technology was not utilized. Through a quasi-experimental design, the study explored non-cognitive factor relationships to knowledge retention and post-test scores, comparing the results in undergraduate courses where instructors integrated interactive learning technology with undergraduate courses where instructors did not integrate learning technology. Descriptive, ANOVA, and ANCOVA statistical analyses were used to analyze knowledge retention and post-test scores as well as covariates from 215 students in undergraduate courses at one academic institution. The results revealed several important findings. First, there was a significant effect on both post-test scores and knowledge retention when audience response systems were integrated into the classroom. Second, the integration of audience response systems in the classroom effect on knowledge retention and post-test scores was significantly different from students in the online classroom who did not use audience response systems, despite having access to supplementary material when they took pre- and post-tests. Course topic and student status had no significant effect post-test scores or knowledge retention when audience response systems were integrated into the classroom. Finally, faculty status did have a significant effect on post-test scores and knowledge retention when audience response systems were integrated into the classroom. By understanding the non-cognitive factors that contribute to improve knowledge retention and post-test scores, institutions can improve their faculty members' effectiveness and success in the classroom.

BACKGROUND Diagnostic imaging is an integral aspect of care that is often insufficient, if not altogether absent, in rural and remote regions of low to middle income countries (LMICs) such as Tanzania. The introduction of ultrasound can significantly impact treatment in these countries due to its portability, low cost, safety, and usefulness in various medical assessments. This study reviews the implementation of a four-week ultrasound course administered annually from 2013-2016 in a healthcare professional school in Mwanza, Tanzania by first-year allopathic US medical students.Participants ( n =582, over 4 years) were recruited from the Tandabui Institute of Health Sciences and Technology to take the ultrasound course. Subjects were predominantly clinical officer students, but other participants included other healthcare professional students, practicing healthcare professionals, and school employees. Data collected includes pre-course examination scores, post-course examination scores, course quiz scores, demographic surveys, and post-course feedback surveys. Data was analyzed using two-tailed t -tests and the single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Data collected includes pre-course examination scores, post-course examination scores, course quiz scores, demographic surveys, and post-course feedback surveys. Data was analyzed using two-tailed t-tests and the single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA).For all participants who completed both the pre- and post-course examinations ( n =229, 39.1% of the total recruited), there was a significant mean improvement in their ultrasound knowledge of 42.5%, P <0.01. RESULTS For all participants who completed both the pre- and post-course examinations (n=229, 39.1% of the total recruited), there was a significant mean improvement in their ultrasound knowledge of 42.5%, P<0.01.Our data suggests that trained first-year medical students can effectively teach a point of care ultrasound course to healthcare professional students within four weeks in Tanzania. Future investigation into the level of long-term knowledge retention, impact of ultrasound training on knowledge of human anatomy and diagnostic capabilities, and how expansion of an ultrasound curriculum has impacted access to care in rural Tanzania is warranted.

    "Abstract": "Through advancements in modern medicine, human beings worldwide are living longer. The increase in life expectancy creates a need for a more qualified and knowledgeable nursing workforce for the delivery of quality geriatric health care. Although nurses are the primary care providers for vulnerable older adults, they are generally not well trained or prepared in geriatric care. Therefore, the purpose of the project was to develop an education program aimed at improving nursing knowledge of geriatric care in the long-term care (LTC) setting. The goal of the project was to answer the research question: What impact would attendance in the program have on improving nursing geriatric knowledge, retention, and job satisfaction by project end? Guided by the advancing research and clinical practice through close collaboration (ARCC) model for evidence-based practice (EBP), the learning needs of nurses in the LTC setting were assessed. The 6-week education program was designed to provide education on the basics of geriatric care, pharmacology and aging, symptom evaluation, dementia care, and geriatric physical assessment. Project participants consisted of 8 nurses who volunteered to take part in the program. The program was evaluated using a pre-test and post-test method to examine nurse’s knowledge before and after the education program. Using a paired t test, the results indicated a significant increase ( p < .05) between the mean pre-test (3.75) and mean post-test (4.25) scores of nurse knowledge of geriatric care. The education program improved participant knowledge of geriatric care. Positive social change will be achieved with this scholarly project as nurses with greater knowledge gain confidence, strengthen decision making and clinical skills, and improve patient outcomes in the LTC setting.",

    "Abstract": "Government-reported statistics and existing research herald an epic age demographic change in the federal workforce, as a large number of its workers approach the average retirement age of 61.3 (United States Office of Personnel Management, 2016, March). Hence, this study examined the changing age demographic of the federal workforce with regard to workforce separation and retirement. Through years of professional practice, older workers accumulated a breadth of knowledge that provides widespread benefit to the respective federal organizations. As a result, there is a need for effective knowledge management (KM) strategies that respond to the changing knowledge requirements of federal workers. Based on this age demographic trend, a significant consideration for knowledge retention and knowledge sharing in the federal workforce emerges (Slagter, 2007). This researcher found that the appropriate KM strategies address the knowledge considerations specific to the federal workforce. Management practitioners are presented with both challenges and opportunities for the development of new management strategies to address changing workforce dynamics. Consistent with the chosen management focus of applied leadership and change in an organizational context, this researcher pursued KM success strategies for a federal agency workplace that faces significant demographic change. Through this evidence-based study, the researcher identified and analyzed relationships between KM concepts. A KM strategic framework is provided for mitigating the projected knowledge gaps in the federal workforce. This success framework provides elements for KM strategy development including; situational adaptation, social factors, and the management of knowledge as an essential resource.

BACKGROUND In sub-Saharan Africa, efforts to control antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are aggravated by unregulated drug sales and use, and high connectivity between human, livestock, and wildlife populations. Our previous research indicates that Maasai agropastoralists-who have high exposure to livestock and livestock products and self-administer veterinary antibiotics-harbor antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli). Here, we report the results of a public health intervention project among Maasai aimed at reducing selection and transmission of E. coli bacteria.Research was conducted in two Maasai communities in Northern Tanzania. Participants were provided with health knowledge and technological innovations to facilitate: 1) the prudent use of veterinary antibiotics (tape measures and dosage charts to calculate livestock weight for more accurate dosage), and, 2) the pasteurization of milk (thermometers), the latter of which was motivated by findings of high levels of resistant E. coli in Maasai milk. To determine knowledge retention and intervention adoption, we conducted a two-month follow-up evaluation in the largest of the two communities.

Bacterial and AMR knowledge were not, however, associated with self-reported use of the innovations. Among women, self-reported use of the thermometers was associated with having more children and greater retention of knowledge about the health benefits of the innovations. Whereas 70% of women used their innovations correctly, men performed only 18% of the weight-estimation steps correctly. Men's correct use was associated with schooling, such that high illiteracy rates remain an important obstacle to the dissemination and diffusion of weight-estimation materials.

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG BACKGROUND: The Chácobo are a Panoan speaking tribe of about 1000 members (300+ adults) in Beni, Bolivia. Originally nomadic, the Chácabo were relocated to their current main location in the 1960s. Researchers have visited the Chácabo since 1911. A first more detailed anthropological report exists from the late 1960s, and ecological–ethnobotanical studies were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. The presented work represents a complete ethnobotanical inventory of the entire adult Chácobo population, with interviews and plant collection conducted directly by Chácobo counterparts. METHODS: Based on previous reports and our preliminary studies, we hypothesized that twenty-first century Chácobo plant use centered on income generation, and that traditional plant use related to household utensils, medicine and traditional crop varieties had almost disappeared. To test this hypothesis, we started the “Chácobo Ethnobotany Project,” training 10 indigenous Chácobo participants in ethnobotanical interview and plant collection techniques, in order to more fully document Chácobo knowledge and avoid the influence of foreign interviewers. RESULTS: Our study found 331 useful plant species in 241genera of 95 plant families, with leaves, roots and bark being the most commonly used plant parts The comprehensive documentation that these methods enabled completely nullified our initial hypothesis of knowledge loss. Traditional crop varieties are still widely grown and traditional knowledge is alive. Moreover, it is being actively recuperated in certain domains by the younger generation. Most Chácobo know, and can name, traditional utensils and tools, although only the older generation has still the skills to manufacture them. While many Chácobo still know the names and uses of medicinal species, the younger generation is however often unsure how to identify them. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper we illustrate the complexity of perspectives on knowledge at different ages, and the persistence of knowledge over almost a century. We found that traditional knowledge was only partially affected by the processes of exposure to a market economy, and that different knowledge domains experienced different trends as a result of these changes. Overall knowledge was widely distributed, and we did not observe a directional knowledge loss. We stress the importance to not directly conclude processes of knowledge loss, cultural erosion or acculturation when comparing the knowledge of different age groups.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG BACKGROUND: Traditional medicinal plant species documentation is very crucial in Ethiopia for biodiversity conservation, bioactive chemical extractions and indigenous knowledge retention. Having first observed the inhabitants of Gubalafto District (Northern Ethiopia), the author gathered, recorded, and documented the human traditional medicinal plant species and the associated indigenous knowledge. METHODS: The study was conducted from February 2013 to January 2015 and used descriptive field survey design. Eighty-four informants were selected from seven study kebeles (sub-districts) in the District through purposive, snowball, and random sampling techniques. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews, guided field walks, demonstrations, and focus group discussions with the help of guided questions. Data were organized and analyzed by descriptive statistics with SPSS version 20 and Microsoft Office Excel 2007. RESULTS: A total of 135 medicinal plant species within 120 genera and 64 families were documented. Among the species, Ocimum lamiifolium and Rhamnus prinoides scored the highest informant citations and fidelity level value, respectively. In the study area, Asteraceae with 8.1% and herbs with 50.4% plant species were the most used sources for their medicinal uses. A total of 65 ailments were identified as being treated by traditional medicinal plants, among which stomachache (abdominal health problems) was frequently reported. Solanum incanum was reported for the treatment of many of the reported diseases. The leaf, fresh parts, and crushed forms of the medicinal plants were the most preferred in remedy preparations. Oral application was the highest reported administration for 110 preparations. A majority of medicinal plant species existed in the wild without any particular conservation effort. Few informants (about 5%) had only brief notes about the traditional medicinal plants. Ninety percent of the respondents have learned indigenous medicinal plants knowledge from their family members and friends secretly. Orthodox Church schools were found the main place for 65% of healer’s indigenous knowledge origin and experiences. Elders, aged between 40 and 84 years, gave detailed descriptions about traditional medicinal plants. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional medicinal plants and associated indigenous knowledge are the main systems to maintain human health in Gubalafto District. But minimal conservation measures were recorded in the community. Thus, in-situ and ex-situ conservation practices and sustainable utilization are required in the District.",

    "Abstract": "Autobiographical memory refers to memory for personal information. The compromise of autobiographical memory in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) results in a loss of knowledge about events and facts that defined the patients’ life, and consequently, degradation of their self-knowledge and sense of identity. The compromise of autobiographical memory in AD can be attributed to a diminished subjective experience of memory and a diminished sense of the self. Our review provides a comprehensive overview of cognitive and clinical processes that may be involved in difficulties to retrieve autobiographical memories in Alzheimer’s disease. Our review also proposes a theoretical model according to which, the diminished ability to retrieve contextual information and the over-generality of recall result in a diminished subjective experience of past and future thinking. Besides its theoretical contribution, our review proposes clinical applicability for evaluation and rehabilitation of autobiographical memory in AD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract) Original language abstract La mémoire autobiographique est la mémoire des connaissances et des événements liés à soi. La difficulté de rappel autobiographique dans la maladie d’Alzheimer correspond à une altération de la récupération des souvenirs et/ou des connaissances personnelles. Cette difficulté aboutit également à une altération de l’expérience subjective du rappel et à une dégradation de la conscience de soi. Cet article vise à décrire l’état des connaissances actuelles sur les différents enjeux cognitifs et cliniques de la difficulté de rappel autobiographique dans la maladie d’Alzheimer. À travers cet état de la question, nous proposons un modèle théorique selon lequel une difficulté dans le rappel des éléments contextuels et une sémantisation des souvenirs aboutiraient à une altération de l’expérience subjective lors de la projection dans le passé et dans le futur. Parallèlement à cette conceptualisation théorique, nous proposons quelques pistes de recherches, ainsi que des perspectives à destination des chercheurs et cliniciens impliqués dans la compréhension, l’évaluation et la prise en charge de la mémoire autobiographique dans la maladie d’Alzheimer.

    "Abstract": "Autobiographical memory refers to memory for personal information. The compromise of autobiographical memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD) results in a loss of knowledge about events and facts that defined the patients' life, and consequently, degradation of their self-knowledge and sense of identity. The compromise of autobiographical memory in AD can be attributed to a diminished subjective experience of memory and a diminished sense of the self. Our review provides a comprehensive overview of cognitive and clinical processes that may be involved in difficulties to retrieve autobiographical memories in Alzheimer's disease. Our review also proposes a theoretical model according to which, the diminished ability to retrieve contextual information and the overgenerality of recall result in a diminished subjective experience of past and future thinking. Besides its theoretical contribution, our review proposes clinical applicability for evaluation and rehabilitation of autobiographical memory in AD.Autobiographical memory refers to memory for personal information.

    "Abstract": "Education has tapped into gaming to increase engagement and facilitate knowledge retention through experiential modalities. There have been several high technological intensity digital laboratories where learners are engaged with the subject matter through various activities. There are also several low intensity web-based solutions that familiarize learners with curriculum material but in less experientially intensive manners. A ubiquitous approach to highly impactful, low cost, high reusability gamified educational approach is a versatile mixed reality educational environment. Using prolific technologies such as inexpensive augmented reality (AR) headsets and a versatile low maintenance database (DB) back-ends, a real-world environment can be transformed with 3D graphics and audio to various educational spaces of highly impactful content. Such a simple implementation is presented here for virtual patients in medicine. A simple DB back-end supports a presentation front-end developed in Unity, utilizing the “vuforia”-mixed reality platform. Based on this implementation, future directions are explored.",

    "Abstract": "User engagement (UE) is a quality of user experience characterized by the depth of an actor's cognitive, temporal, and/or emotional investment in an interaction with a digital system. Currently more art than science, UE has gained theoretical and methodological traction over the past decade, yet there is still a need to establish empirical links between UE and desired outcomes (e.g., learning, behavior change), and to understand the myriad user, system, contextual, and so on, factors that predict successful digital engagement. This paper focuses on the relationship between UE and media format as a potential antecedent, and the outcome of learning, operationalized as short‐term knowledge retention. Participants interacted with two human‐interest stories in one of four media formats: video, audio, narrative text, or transcript‐style text; short‐term knowledge retention was measured using post‐task multiple choice and short‐answer questions. It was anticipated that format would have a strong effect on UE, and that more engaged users would recall more information about the stories. However, these hypotheses were not fully supported, and the nature of the relationship between UE and learning was more nuanced than expected. This research has implications for the design of information systems and, more fundamentally, the impetus to make digital environments engaging.",

    "Abstract": "The ABCDE (with A standing for asymmetry, B for border irregularity, C for color variegation, D for diameter larger than 6 mm, and E for evolution) rule for melanoma (MM) recognition is widely taught in the general population. The ugly duckling (UD) sign is an alternate MM recognition strategy that is not generally taught. BACKGROUND The ABCDE (with A standing for asymmetry, B for border irregularity, C for color variegation, D for diameter larger than 6 mm, and E for evolution) rule for melanoma (MM) recognition is widely taught in the general population. The ugly duckling (UD) sign is an alternate MM recognition strategy that is not generally taught.To compare the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MM recognition with UD sign and the ABCD rule in a general population. OBJECTIVE To compare the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MM recognition with UD sign and the ABCD rule in a general population.Participants were randomized into either the ABCD or UD arm of the study. An educational tutorial on their respective teaching method followed. Participants were subsequently tested using images of 9 lesions (7 nevi and 2 MMs) and asked to categorize each image as MM or not MM. METHODS Participants were randomized into either the ABCD or UD arm of the study. An educational tutorial on their respective teaching method followed. Participants were subsequently tested using images of 9 lesions (7 nevi and 2 MMs) and asked to categorize each image as MM or not MM.A total of 51 participants were randomized to the ABCD group and 50 to the UD group. The sensitivity for MM recognition of both groups was similar. The specificity and accuracy for MM recognition was significantly higher (P =.02, P = .02) in the UD group. RESULTS A total of 51 participants were randomized to the ABCD group and 50 to the UD group. The sensitivity for MM recognition of both groups was similar. The specificity and accuracy for MM recognition was significantly higher (P =.02, P = .02) in the UD group.The E for evolution in the ABCDE rule was not tested. No follow-up knowledge retention test was conducted. LIMITATIONS The E for evolution in the ABCDE rule was not tested. No follow-up knowledge retention test was conducted.The UD sign significantly improved accuracy and specificity of MM recognition. We recommend adding the UD sign to patient education in addition to the traditional ABCDE rule. CONCLUSION The UD sign significantly improved accuracy and specificity of MM recognition. We recommend adding the UD sign to patient education in addition to the traditional ABCDE rule.",

    "Abstract": "Outcomes research exists incorporating non-digital games in veterinary education; however, little research examines outcomes from digital applications. Bauman’s Layered-Learning Model was applied to investigate whether a digital matching game produced short-term knowledge gains in veterinary students. Two groups of students (n 1 =67; n 2 =55) practiced the matching game for an hour. A Wilcoxon signed rank test tested for a statistically significant improvement in pre-test/post-test scores. All statistical analyses were done using R. Mean and median pre-test scores were 15 (SD=1.88; IQR: 2) and post-test scores 16 (SD=1.80; IQR: 2). Mean and median pre-test score for Group 2 were 13 (SD=2.30; IQR=2.5) and post-test scores 15 (SD=1.93; IQR=2.5). Both groups increased significantly in post-test scores ( P value<.0001). Statistically significant short-term increases of marginal importance in histology knowledge was seen. A greater increase might be seen with quiz revision increasing difficulty and discrimination ability. Further directions should investigate long-term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Community health workers (CHWs) are increasingly being tasked to prevent and manage cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors in underserved populations in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs); however, little is known about the required training necessary for them to accomplish their role. This review aimed to evaluate the training of CHWs for the prevention and management of CVD and its risk factors in LMICs. INTRODUCTION Community health workers (CHWs) are increasingly being tasked to prevent and manage cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors in underserved populations in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs); however, little is known about the required training necessary for them to accomplish their role. This review aimed to evaluate the training of CHWs for the prevention and management of CVD and its risk factors in LMICs.A search strategy was developed in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, and five electronic databases (Medline, Global Health, ERIC, EMBASE and CINAHL) were searched to identify peer-reviewed studies published until December 2016 on the training of CHWs for prevention or control of CVD and its risk factors in LMICs. Study characteristics were extracted using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and quality assessed using Effective Public Health Practice Project's Quality Assessment Tool. The search, data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two researchers.

Study characteristics were extracted using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and quality assessed using Effective Public Health Practice Project's Quality Assessment Tool. The search, data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two researchers.The search generated 928 articles of which 8 were included in the review. One study was a randomised controlled trial, while the remaining were before-after intervention studies. The training methods included classroom lectures, interactive lessons, e-learning and online support and group discussions or a mix of two or more. All the studies showed improved knowledge level post-training, and two studies demonstrated knowledge retention 6 months after the intervention.

All the studies showed improved knowledge level post-training, and two studies demonstrated knowledge retention 6 months after the intervention.The results of the eight included studies suggest that CHWs can be trained effectively for CVD prevention and management. However, the effectiveness of CHW trainings would likely vary depending on context given the differences between studies (eg, CHW demographics, settings and training programmes) and the weak quality of six of the eight studies. Well-conducted mixed-methods studies are needed to provide reliable evidence about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of training programmes for CHWs.

    "Abstract": "Due to the historical peculiarities of Russia, by the end of the 20th century many temples were destroyed or they lost their iconostases which most often were made of wood. When it became necessary to revive the traditional craft it turned out that it was lost almost completely which negatively affects the quality of the wooden iconostases restoration and their new construction. The article aims to fill the loss of knowledge and skills that make up the content of one of the most interesting types of the architectural and monumental and decorative art through study of the forms of preserved fragments once being a very rich historical and cultural heritage. Similar works on the study of wooden iconostases aimed at the recreation of oak decorative wooden elements and restoration practice have not been performed so far which gives it a character of particular relevance for the architectural science. New and relevant technological improvements are not rejected but skillfully introduced into the arsenal of techniques and means of modern restorers and carvers to facilitate the recovery of iconostasis construction from a crisis state and the transition to the subsequent continuation of the tradition development. The deep knowledge of the research subject allowed one to use oak decorative elements in the manufacture for recreating the iconostasis of the Krestovozdvizhensky temple in the village of Syrostan, the Chelyabinsk region. This material is undoubtedly of a scientific and reference nature as well as economic efficiency for all those who wish to join the noble traditional iconostasis making art.",

    "Abstract": "Learning theories converge on the principles of reflective learning processes and perceive them as fundamental to effective learning. Traditional laboratory education in science and engineering often happens in highly resource-constrained environments that compromise some of the learning objectives. This paper focuses on characterizing three learning attributes associated with reflective learning i.e. metacognition (M), analogical reasoning (A) and transfer of knowledge (T) and assessed college laboratory education blended with ICT-enabled virtual laboratories. Key contributions of this study include: 1) Development of assessment of MAT attributes using a combination of multiple choice questions, True/False statements and descriptive questions 2) assessment of conceptual learning occurring in the laboratory environment and of learning attributes using Virtual Laboratories (VLs) in classroom education. Feedback data indicated using virtual laboratories in classrooms for training students before using physical laboratories demonstrated a significant improvement (>100% change) in learning in comparison to physical laboratories without VLs. We also show using VLs as pre-lab or post-lab exercise augmented reflective learning and information retention among 145 students in this blended learning case study, compared to an independent control group of 45 students who had no virtual laboratory training.",

    "Abstract": "Mindfulness practices improve cognition, emotional balance, and well-being in clinical and non-clinical populations. The bulk of mindfulness research in higher education has focused on improving psychological and cognitive variables, leaving academic performance largely unexplored. We investigated the effects of a brief mindfulness intervention on quiz performance in two sections of an undergraduate upper-level human development class (N = 67). We used a between-group experimental design (waiting control group) and compared student quiz scores. Students assigned to practice mindfulness performed better on the first two quizzes than the control group. When the control group received the mindfulness intervention, there was no significant difference on quiz performance between the two groups. Mindfulness training did not impact state mindfulness or exam scores. Taken together, our results suggest that small doses of mindfulness training can briefly enhance students' knowledge retention of lecture content.",

    "Abstract": "When we teach students steadfast historical narratives (that perpetuate stories of linear progress) we erase multitudes of minoritarian performance practices, and also gloss over critical historiographical training.[...]in addition to deconstructing linear-progress narratives, curative pedagogy in the theatre history classroom encourages metahistorical analysis.Group text messages, for example, allow for its writers to have multiple conversations at once and answer one another through both text and animated graphics (for example, GIFs and emojis).[...]curricular structures that also communicate the fluidity of time, space, and interdisciplinary connection and present history as a collage-multiple constructed narratives that lay bare our relationships to structural powers-both advance learning outcomes and reflect how many students always already curate everyday information and discourse.Deep learning and attention to critical thinking facilitates knowledge retention and sets up an environment wherein students make links between theory and practice.Because curative pedagogy, much like a curated exhibition, privileges meaning-making over required content, I construct theatre history courses thematically rather than by a timeline, theatrical genre, or location.[...]I invite the archivists back in the room and ask them to stand with me at the front.",

    "Abstract": "Mindfulness practices improve cognition, emotional balance, and well-being in clinical and non-clinical populations. The bulk of mindfulness research in higher education has focused on improving psychological and cognitive variables, leaving academic performance largely unexplored. We investigated the effects of a brief mindfulness intervention on quiz performance in two sections of an undergraduate upper-level human development class ( N = 67). We used a between-group experimental design (waiting control group) and compared student quiz scores. Students assigned to practice mindfulness performed better on the first two quizzes than the control group. When the control group received the mindfulness intervention, there was no significant difference on quiz performance between the two groups. Mindfulness training did not impact state mindfulness or exam scores. Taken together, our results suggest that small doses of mindfulness training can briefly enhance students' knowledge retention of lecture content.

    "Abstract": "Learning theories converge on the principles of reflective learning processes and perceive them as fundamental to effective learning. Traditional laboratory education in science and engineering often happens in highly resource-constrained environments that compromise some of the learning objectives. This paper focuses on characterizing three learning attributes associated with reflective learning i.e. metacognition (M), analogical reasoning (A) and transfer of knowledge (T) and assessed college laboratory education blended with ICT-enabled virtual laboratories. Key contributions of this study include: 1) Development of assessment of MAT attributes using a combination of multiple choice questions, True/False statements and descriptive questions 2) assessment of conceptual learning occurring in the laboratory environment and of learning attributes using Virtual Laboratories (VLs) in classroom education. Feedback data indicated using virtual laboratories in classrooms for training students before using physical laboratories demonstrated a significant improvement (>100% change) in learning in comparison to physical laboratories without VLs. We also show using VLs as pre-lab or post-lab exercise augmented reflective learning and information retention among 145 students in this blended learning case study, compared to an independent control group of 45 students who had no virtual laboratory training.",

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility of a grocery store tour for parents and their adolescents being led by adults or adolescent peers.Randomized controlled pilot study with surveys at baseline and post-program, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. DESIGN Randomized controlled pilot study with surveys at baseline and post-program, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up.Midwestern midsized grocery stores. SETTING Midwestern midsized grocery stores.Sixty-one parents and their 71 11- to 14-year-old adolescents. PARTICIPANTS Sixty-one parents and their 71 11- to 14-year-old adolescents.Nutrition education during 1 90-minute grocery store tour. INTERVENTION Nutrition education during 1 90-minute grocery store tour.Process observations and participants' tour perceptions provided fidelity outcomes. Questionnaires quantitatively assessed participants' knowledge, self-efficacy, and tour strategy use. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Process observations and participants' tour perceptions provided fidelity outcomes. Questionnaires quantitatively assessed participants' knowledge, self-efficacy, and tour strategy use.Chi-square and McNemar tests were used to analyze categorical data, and Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and Mann-Whitney U tests were employed for continuous variables (significance at P < .05). ANALYSIS Chi-square and McNemar tests were used to analyze categorical data, and Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and Mann-Whitney U tests were employed for continuous variables (significance at P < .05).Over 90% of tour tasks were rated as completed well for adult and peer leaders. Participants had positive tour perceptions but noted deficiencies in teen leaders' knowledge and leadership skills. Overall, parents and adolescents retained increased self-efficacy from pre-tour to post-tour intervals. Despite limited knowledge retention, parents reported they had increased (6.5 ± 4.19) healthful grocery shopping behaviors in the 6 months after the intervention. RESULTS Over 90% of tour tasks were rated as completed well for adult and peer leaders. Participants had positive tour perceptions but noted deficiencies in teen leaders' knowledge and leadership skills. Overall, parents and adolescents retained increased self-efficacy from pre-tour to post-tour intervals. Despite limited knowledge retention, parents reported they had increased (6.5 ± 4.19) healthful grocery shopping behaviors in the 6 months after the intervention.Peers may feasibly lead grocery store tours but they may need additional resources and support to be highly effective.

    "Abstract": "The Chácobo are a Panoan speaking tribe of about 1000 members (300+ adults) in Beni, Bolivia. Originally nomadic, the Chácabo were relocated to their current main location in the 1960s. Researchers have visited the Chácabo since 1911.

BACKGROUND The Chácobo are a Panoan speaking tribe of about 1000 members (300+ adults) in Beni, Bolivia. Originally nomadic, the Chácabo were relocated to their current main location in the 1960s. Researchers have visited the Chácabo since 1911. A first more detailed anthropological report exists from the late 1960s, and ecological-ethnobotanical studies were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. The presented work represents a complete ethnobotanical inventory of the entire adult Chácobo population, with interviews and plant collection conducted directly by Chácobo counterparts.Based on previous reports and our preliminary studies, we hypothesized that twenty-first century Chácobo plant use centered on income generation, and that traditional plant use related to household utensils, medicine and traditional crop varieties had almost disappeared. To test this hypothesis, we started the \"Chácobo Ethnobotany Project,\" training 10 indigenous Chácobo participants in ethnobotanical interview and plant collection techniques, in order to more fully document Chácobo knowledge and avoid the influence of foreign interviewers. METHODS Based on previous reports and our preliminary studies, we hypothesized that twenty-first century Chácobo plant use centered on income generation, and that traditional plant use related to household utensils, medicine and traditional crop varieties had almost disappeared. To test this hypothesis, we started the \"Chácobo Ethnobotany Project,\" training 10 indigenous Chácobo participants in ethnobotanical interview and plant collection techniques, in order to more fully document Chácobo knowledge and avoid the influence of foreign interviewers.Our study found 331 useful plant species in 241genera of 95 plant families, with leaves, roots and bark being the most commonly used plant parts The comprehensive documentation that these methods enabled completely nullified our initial hypothesis of knowledge loss. Traditional crop varieties are still widely grown and traditional knowledge is alive. Moreover, it is being actively recuperated in certain domains by the younger generation. Most Chácobo know, and can name, traditional utensils and tools, although only the older generation has still the skills to manufacture them. While many Chácobo still know the names and uses of medicinal species, the younger generation is however often unsure how to identify them.

We found that traditional knowledge was only partially affected by the processes of exposure to a market economy, and that different knowledge domains experienced different trends as a result of these changes. Overall knowledge was widely distributed, and we did not observe a directional knowledge loss. We stress the importance to not directly conclude processes of knowledge loss, cultural erosion or acculturation when comparing the knowledge of different age groups.

    "Abstract": "Traditional medicinal plant species documentation is very crucial in Ethiopia for biodiversity conservation, bioactive chemical extractions and indigenous knowledge retention. Having first observed the inhabitants of Gubalafto District (Northern Ethiopia), the author gathered, recorded, and documented the human traditional medicinal plant species and the associated indigenous knowledge. BACKGROUND Traditional medicinal plant species documentation is very crucial in Ethiopia for biodiversity conservation, bioactive chemical extractions and indigenous knowledge retention. Having first observed the inhabitants of Gubalafto District (Northern Ethiopia), the author gathered, recorded, and documented the human traditional medicinal plant species and the associated indigenous knowledge.The study was conducted from February 2013 to January 2015 and used descriptive field survey design. Eighty-four informants were selected from seven study kebeles (sub-districts) in the District through purposive, snowball, and random sampling techniques. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews, guided field walks, demonstrations, and focus group discussions with the help of guided questions. Data were organized and analyzed by descriptive statistics with SPSS version 20 and Microsoft Office Excel 2007. METHODS The study was conducted from February 2013 to January 2015 and used descriptive field survey design. Eighty-four informants were selected from seven study kebeles (sub-districts) in the District through purposive, snowball, and random sampling techniques. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews, guided field walks, demonstrations, and focus group discussions with the help of guided questions. Data were organized and analyzed by descriptive statistics with SPSS version 20 and Microsoft Office Excel 2007.A total of 135 medicinal plant species within 120 genera and 64 families were documented. Among the species, Ocimum lamiifolium and Rhamnus prinoides scored the highest informant citations and fidelity level value, respectively. In the study area, Asteraceae with 8.1% and herbs with 50.4% plant species were the most used sources for their medicinal uses. A total of 65 ailments were identified as being treated by traditional medicinal plants, among which stomachache (abdominal health problems) was frequently reported. Solanum incanum was reported for the treatment of many of the reported diseases. The leaf, fresh parts, and crushed forms of the medicinal plants were the most preferred in remedy preparations. Oral application was the highest reported administration for 110 preparations. A majority of medicinal plant species existed in the wild without any particular conservation effort. Few informants (about 5%) had only brief notes about the traditional medicinal plants. Ninety percent of the respondents have learned indigenous medicinal plants knowledge from their family members and friends secretly. Orthodox Church schools were found the main place for 65% of healer's indigenous knowledge origin and experiences. Elders, aged between 40 and 84 years, gave detailed descriptions about traditional medicinal plants. RESULTS A total of 135 medicinal plant species within 120 genera and 64 families were documented.

    "Abstract": "The growth of Knowledge Economy has transformed human capital to be the vital asset in business organization of the 21 st century. Arguably, due to its white-collar nature, knowledge-based industry is more favorable than traditional manufacturing business. However, over dependency on human capital can also be a major challenge as any workers will inevitably leave the company or retire. This situation will possibly create knowledge gap that may impact business continuity of the enterprise. Knowledge retention in the corporate environment has been of many research interests. Learning Management System (LMS) refers to the system that provides the delivery, assessment and management tools for an organization to handle its knowledge repository. By using the aspirations of a proven LMS implemented in an academic environment, this paper proposes LMS model that can be used to enable peer-to-peer knowledge capture and sharing in the knowledge-based organization. Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), referred to an ERP solution in the internet cloud environment was chosen as the domain knowledge. The complexity of the Cloud ERP business and its knowledge make it very vulnerable to the knowledge retention problem. This paper discusses how the company’s essential knowledge can be retained using the LMS system derived from academic environment into the corporate model.",

    "Abstract": "Educators seek to develop students’ mathematical knowledge retention to increase student efficacy in follow-on classwork, improvement of test scores, attainment of standards, and preparation for careers. Interactive visuals, feedback during problem solving, and incorporation of higher-order thinking skills are known to increase retention, but a comparison of online and face-to-face learning regarding knowledge retention has not been fully explored. The current study tested 38 Caucasian eighth grade students for knowledge retention on ten mathematical topics they had learned in sixth grade during either online or face-to-face conditions. After two years, students were given the same posttest as in 6th grade over the 10 units of which five had been learned online and five face-to-face. Scores for long-term gain scores showed no significant differences between online or face-to-face learning conditions. A TOST calculation was used to show equivalence of middle school student long-term learning across online and face-to-face conditions in mathematics in this study within the limits of the test. The interactive nature of each condition contributed to strong mathematical understanding, which led to the retention being equivalent for both conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Pedagogical agents (PAs) are lifelike characters in virtual environments that help facilitate learning through social interactions and the virtual real relationships with the learners. This study explored whether and how PA gesture design impacts learning and agent social acceptance when used with elementary students learning foreign language grammar. Unlike prior research, this study examined the effects of PA gestures in three conditions: full gesture condition (deictic, iconic, metaphoric, and beat gestures), deictic gesture condition, and no gesture condition. Transfer of knowledge, retention, and agent social acceptance data were collected from 160 South Korean 5 th and 6 th graders learning about using “-er/more” for comparatives in English. Retention and transfer test data revealed no significant differences in learning outcomes across conditions. Regarding social acceptance, the PA in the full gesture condition was perceived as significantly more human-like and engaging than the PA in the no gesture condition. However, a multiple regression revealed that social acceptance factors “human-like” and “engaging” were also negative predictors of learning outcome scores. This finding suggests full gesture PAs may have the ability to increase social perception by learners, but the novelty of PAs with full gestures may also have an initial negative effect on learning outcomes.

Retention and transfer test data revealed no significant differences in learning outcomes across conditions. Regarding social acceptance, PA in the full gesture condition was perceived as significantly more human-like and engaging than PA in the no gesture condition. However, multiple regression revealed that social acceptance factors \"human-like\" and \"engaging\" were also negative predictors of learning outcome scores. This finding suggests full gesture PAs may have the ability to increase social perception by learners, but the novelty of PAs with full gestures may also have an initial negative effect on learning outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "While scholars recognize that digital technology is a major tool employed by contemporary learners to access knowledge, its full capacity is yet to be utilized. This paper investigates opportunities to increase individual learning engagement and knowledge retention in higher education and corporate environments through integrating educational content with innovative digital technology. Currently, within commonly adopted e-learning platforms, the most utilized online content delivery and student progress assessment tools in leadership education appear to be discussion-based instruction, along with written assignments, and research projects (Jenkins, 2016). To inform leadership educators' choice in innovative tools for increased effectiveness of instruction, this paper shares an experience of delivering integrated global leadership education pedagogical content (i.e., cross-cultural competency instruction for graduate management class at a U.S.-based public university) within a gamified real-time multiuser learning platform--\"MyAltis\"--and discusses implications for leadership education.",

    "Abstract": "The verbs savoir and connaître appear in central moments in the Heptaméron . Knowledge - as it appears in the frame narrative and in the novellas - can be a way for men and women to debate, among many other things, the relationship between the sexes. When women use this word, or when they demonstrate that they know something, it creates the space to participate - not always unambiguously - in otherwise male-dominated conversations. How Marguerite writes about the acquisition, possession, fragmentation or loss of knowledge underscores her interest in exploring the role of women in communities of knowledge.",

Researchers implemented owl educational presentations to students using a live owl during each presentation. The control group was given the common name of the owl whereas the treatment group was given only an anthropomorphized name for the owl. Students completed a knowledge questionnaire following the presentation. Findings indicated that the treatment group significantly retained more information on owl adaptations than the control group. Future research should explore the use of anthropomorphized names for animals used in education, particularly with male learners.",

    "Abstract": "Educators seek to develop students’ mathematical knowledge retention to increase student efficacy in follow-on classwork, improvement of test scores, attainment of standards, and preparation for careers. Interactive visuals, feedback during problem solving, and incorporation of higher-order thinking skills are known to increase retention, but a comparison of online and face-to-face learning regarding knowledge retention has not been fully explored. The current study tested 38 Caucasian eighth grade students for knowledge retention on ten mathematical topics they had learned in sixth grade during either online or faceto- face conditions. After two years, students were given the same posttest as in 6th grade over the 10 units of which five had been learned online and five face-to-face. Scores for long-term gain scores showed no significant differences between online or face-to-face learning conditions. A TOST calculation was used to show equivalence of middle school student long-term learning across online and face-to-face conditions in mathematics in this study within the limits of the test. The interactive nature of each condition contributed to strong mathematical understanding, which led to the retention being equivalent for both conditions.

    "Abstract": "Efficacy of games as learning medium is of interest to researchers and the gaming industry. A critical metric for learning is knowledge retention and very few studies have conducted in-depth comparisons of: a) game versus no-game learning, b) collaborative versus individual learning. Towards this, the study reported in this paper will present the findings from an experiment using Asia and world maps, one set cut into pieces as in a jigsaw puzzle. The stimuli were distinctly coloured paper world map with 5 continents and an Asia map with nine major countries labelled A jigsaw puzzle map was selected because it is widely used in classrooms by teachers to teach map concepts. A physical version was opted as it is inexpensive and the test can be administered in a regular classroom. The participants were primary school children (40 students, grade 5) who have not been introduced to map labelling in the classroom. Equal number of students was randomly assigned to the puzzle and no-puzzle group. The task given to the puzzle group was to arrange the pieces and complete the map. For the no-puzzle group, the uncut maps were provided. To understand the role of collaborative interactions in learning, the 20-member group was further subdivided into 10 each. Each group of these 10 either solved the puzzle individually or collaboratively or studied the full map (no-puzzle) individually or collaboratively. Three post-tests were conducted over a period of 10 days. The mean scores and Mann Whitney test shows: a) In the no-puzzle condition, no difference in the average scores of the individual and collaborative groups for both maps was observed, b ) In the puzzle condition, the collaborative group score was slightly more than that of the individual group for Asia map, while the difference was significant for the continent map, and c) Puzzle and no-puzzle individual group scores were comparative for Asia map but the continent map groups showed a major difference. The findings are mixed with collaborative puzzle solving showing higher retention while puzzle solving does not show significant effect on learning and retention.",

BACKGROUND Face-to-face instruction, paper-based case-studies and clinical placements remain the most commonly used teaching methods for therapeutics curricula. Presenting clinical content in a didactic manner presents challenges in engaging learners and developing their clinical reasoning skills which may be overcome by inclusion of the virtual patient (VP). Currently there is limited literature examining the use of the VP in therapeutics teaching and learning. This review aimed to determine the role of VPs in therapeutics education, specifically the impact on student experiences, performance, and clinical skills.A search of primary literature was conducted with search terms including virtual patient, education, health, AND learning. Boolean operators were applied to include studies from health relevant fields with article titles and abstracts vetted. METHODS A search of primary literature was conducted with search terms including virtual patient, education, health, AND learning. Boolean operators were applied to include studies from health relevant fields with article titles and abstracts vetted.Nine of the 21 included studies were control-matched, and all but one compared VPs to traditional teaching. VPs enhanced the learning experience in all 17 studies that measured this outcome. Fourteen studies measured performance and clinical skills and 12 found VPs were beneficial, while two did not. The VP was not superior to traditional teaching in all studies, but the VP appeared beneficial to the student learning experience. Discrepancy was found between the impact of VPs on short- and long-term knowledge. RESULTS Nine of the 21 included studies were control-matched, and all but one compared VPs to traditional teaching.

The VP was not superior to traditional teaching in all studies, but the VP appeared beneficial to the student learning experience. Discrepancy was found between the impact of VPs on short- and long-term knowledge.The VP appears to enhance the student learning experience and has a role in therapeutics education, however a blended-learning (BL) approach may be required to account for individual learning styles. Additional investigation is required to clarify the efficacy of the VP, particularly as a component of BL, on longer-term knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "For over 4 decades, educational researchers have been studying best practices for introducing writing into the curriculum. One successful strategy, a low-stakes writing exercise called \"writing to learn\" (WTL), has been implemented across several disciplines within higher education. In light of a growing interest in the use of technology and social media as an influential tool in the educational environment, we ask this question: \"Does the source material used to prepare for WTL activities impact student learning and knowledge retention?\" To address this question, we studied student performance on WTL exercises (in microbiology and introductory biology) that were based on material presented via (a) media (news videos, Podcasts, or YouTube) or (b) written articles and transcripts. Although our analysis did not indicate a significant effect of media use on students' ability to understand and retain new information, we discuss the implications of our findings and the limitations underscored by the very intent of WTL activities in doing such pedagogical work. This study offers insight into the implementation of WTL activities, particularly in the natural sciences, and demonstrates the value of such practices.",

    "Abstract": "As economies shift from industrial to knowledge-based economies, the importance of effective knowledge management is arising. Nowadays organisations no longer compete on the basis of financial capital and strength. Organisations have to cope with continuous changing, thus focusing on innovation and revolution seems to be inevitable. One basic objective of knowledge management is to support organisations' value-creating activity and to increase efficiency. The significant part of the knowledge - possessed by an organisation - belongs to the knowledge workers. Thus, it is important to understand what encourages - and what holds them back from - sharing their knowledge. Employees' willingness to share knowledge can be influenced by several factors like people behaviours, motives and characteristics or position, time spent at the organisation, size of the organisation, etc. The aim of the research is to better understand the factors that affect decrease or increase participation of employees in the process of knowledge sharing within organisations. This paper analyses various individual and organisational factors that affect knowledge sharing behaviour and its factors: Altruism, Reciprocity, Reputation, Loss of knowledge power and Organisational reward. Individual factors involve general demographic characteristics i.e. gender, age/generation, position, education. Organisational factors that are examined regarding knowledge sharing behaviour are industry, size (number of employees) and tenure (time spent at the organisation). The research has been carried out among 238 Hungarian employees (top managers, middle managers, white-collar workers and blue-collar workers). Results show that among individual factors, differences can be identified regarding generation and position, while gender and education do not seem to influence knowledge sharing behaviour. Regarding organisational factors, differences can be detected according to the size of the organisation. Results have practical implications for the design of managerial and organisational measures that would provide knowledge sharing in a more efficient manner and in accordance with the long-term strategic goals of the organisation.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nursing administrators must provide cost-effective and efficient ways of orientation training. Traditional methods including classroom lecture can be costly with low retention of the information. Gamification engages the user, provides a level of enjoyment, and uses critical thinking skills. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness, during orientation, of 3 different teaching methods: didactic, online modules, and gamification. Specifically, is there a difference in nurses' clinical knowledge postorientation using these learning approaches? METHODS: A quasi-experimental study design with a 115-person convenience sample split nurses into 3 groups for evaluation of clinical knowledge before and after orientation. RESULTS: The gamification orientation group had the highest mean scores postorientation compared with the didactic and online module groups. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate gamification as an effective way to teach when compared with more traditional methods. Staff enjoy this type of learning and retained more knowledge when using gaming elements.",

    "Abstract": "For over 4 decades, educational researchers have been studying best practices for introducing writing into the curriculum. One successful strategy, a low-stakes writing exercise called \"writing to learn\" (WTL), has been implemented across several disciplines within higher education. In light of a growing interest in the use of technology and social media as an influential tool in the educational environment, we ask this question: \"Does the source material used to prepare for WTL activities impact student learning and knowledge retention?\" To address this question, we studied student performance on WTL exercises (in microbiology and introductory biology) that were based on material presented via (a) media (news videos, Podcasts, or YouTube) or (b) written articles and transcripts. Although our analysis did not indicate a significant effect of media use on students ' ability to understand and retain new information, we discuss the implications of our findings and the limitations underscored by the very intent of WTL activities in doing such pedagogical work. This study offers insight into the implementation of WTL activities, particularly in the natural sciences, and demonstrates the value of such practices.",

BACKGROUND Nursing administrators must provide cost-effective and efficient ways of orientation training. Traditional methods including classroom lecture can be costly with low retention of the information. Gamification engages the user, provides a level of enjoyment, and uses critical thinking skills.The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness, during orientation, of 3 different teaching methods: didactic, online modules, and gamification. Specifically, is there a difference in nurses' clinical knowledge postorientation using these learning approaches? PURPOSE The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness, during orientation, of 3 different teaching methods: didactic, online modules, and gamification. Specifically, is there a difference in nurses' clinical knowledge postorientation using these learning approaches?A quasi-experimental study design with a 115-person convenience sample split nurses into 3 groups for evaluation of clinical knowledge before and after orientation. METHODS A quasi-experimental study design with a 115-person convenience sample split nurses into 3 groups for evaluation of clinical knowledge before and after orientation.The gamification orientation group had the highest mean scores postorientation compared with the didactic and online module groups. RESULTS The gamification orientation group had the highest mean scores postorientation compared with the didactic and online module groups.Findings demonstrate gamification as an effective way to teach when compared with more traditional methods. Staff enjoy this type of learning and retained more knowledge when using gaming elements. CONCLUSIONS Findings demonstrate gamification as an effective way to teach when compared with more traditional methods.

    "Abstract": "This systematic literature review was conducted to explore the effectiveness of problem-based and project-based learning (PBL) implemented with students in early elementary to grade 8 (ages 3-14) in mathematics and science classrooms. Nine studies met the following inclusion criteria: (a) focus on PBL, (b) experimental study, (c) kindergarten to grade 8 level, and (d) focus on mathematics or science content. For these studies, we examined: the definitions of PBL used, the components of PBL explicitly identified as salient to student learning, and the effectiveness of PBL. This review found that although there is no consistent definition of PBL, PBL is an effective method for improving K-8 students' science academic achievement, including knowledge retention, conceptual development, and attitudes. Implications and limitations are discussed.",

We explored the use of video-based feedback and low fidelity simulation for training rural healthcare workers along the Thailand-Myanmar border and Papua New Guinea (PNG) to manage medical emergencies effectively. BACKGROUND Video-based feedback has been shown to aid knowledge retention, skills learning and improve team functionality. We explored the use of video-based feedback and low fidelity simulation for training rural healthcare workers along the Thailand-Myanmar border and Papua New Guinea (PNG) to manage medical emergencies effectively.Twenty-four study participants were recruited from three Shoklo Malaria Research Unit clinics along the Thailand-Myanmar border and eight participants from Kudjip Nazarene Hospital, PNG. The teams were recorded on video managing a simulated medical emergency scenario and the video was used to aid feedback and assess performance using Observed Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) scoring and Team Emergency Assessment Measure (TEAM) questionnaire. The process was repeated post-feedback at both sites and at 6 weeks at the Thailand-Myanmar border site. Thailand-Myanmar border participants' individual confidence levels and baseline knowledge (using OSCE scoring) were assessed before team assessment and feedback at week 1 and repeated post-feedback and at 6 weeks. Focus group discussions (FGD) were held at each Thailand-Myanmar border clinic at week 1 (8 participants at each clinic).

There was a trend for increased team OSCE scores compared to baseline at week 1 (p = 0.068) and week 6 (p = 0.109) although not significant. Thailand-Myanmar border TEAM scores demonstrated improvement post-feedback mainly in leadership, teamwork and task management which was sustained up to week 6. PNG showed an improvement mainly in teamwork and task management. The global rating of the teams' non-technical performance at both sites improved post feedback and at week 6 on the Thailand-Myanmar border site. Self-rated confidence scores by Thailand-Myanmar border participants increased significantly from baseline following training at week 1 (p = 0.020), and while higher at 6 weeks follow up than at baseline, this was not significant (p = 0.471). The FGD revealed majority of participants felt that watching the video recording of their performance and the video-based feedback contributed most to their learning.

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG This study explores how indigenous knowledge (IK) might be retained and/or changed among contemporary indigenous peoples. Through semi-structured interviews and quantitative analyses of long-term changes in artistic knowledge among three geographically displaced Kaiabi (Kawaiwete) we found an association between language proficiency and gender with greater IK retention, and formal schooling with IK erosion. Six mechanisms of innovation in knowledge of basketry and textiles among men and women were documented. A mixed mode of collaborative learning and knowledge transmission involving diverse actors emerged from community workshops and group forums. Innovative mechanisms for cultural transmission have taken advantage of media, technology, and non-indigenous support organizations to expand weaving knowledge of basketry designs. Our results illustrate how indigenous peoples actively shape cultural transmission and change, as well as the role that public policies and academic research may play in these processes.",

    "Abstract": "This article aims to study the effect of the interaction between clicker use and pedagogy on learning. The fact that the results of the enhanced control condition mirrored those of the factual clicker condition in both experiments is telling. It suggests that the reason behind clicker effects, or at least a part of the reason, is that they may alert students to important information and thus lead students to focus more on that information, either in class or during study. The present study replicates many prior reports of clicker use, which demonstrated that the technology is effective for supporting factual knowledge retention in lecture-based classrooms, but also demonstrated that the effect does not always generalize to courses employing active learning strategies. It also showed that clicker use alone may not promote conceptual understanding in either lecture-based or problem-oriented courses. It is important to note that we do not suggest instructors using active learning strategies eliminate clickers from their toolbox. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "In a flipped classroom approach, learners view educational content prior to class and engage in active learning during didactic sessions. BACKGROUND In a flipped classroom approach, learners view educational content prior to class and engage in active learning during didactic sessions.We hypothesized that a flipped classroom improves knowledge acquisition and retention for residents compared to traditional lecture, and that residents prefer this approach. OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that a flipped classroom improves knowledge acquisition and retention for residents compared to traditional lecture, and that residents prefer this approach.We completed 2 iterations of a study in 2014 and 2015. Institutions were assigned to either flipped classroom or traditional lecture for 4 weekly sessions. The flipped classroom consisted of reviewing a 15-minute video, followed by 45-minute in-class interactive sessions with audience response questions, think-pair-share questions, and case discussions. The traditional lecture approach consisted of a 55-minute lecture given by faculty with 5 minutes for questions. Residents completed 3 knowledge tests (pretest, posttest, and 4-month retention) and surveys of their perceptions of the didactic sessions. A linear mixed model was used to compare the effect of both formats on knowledge acquisition and retention. METHODS We completed 2 iterations of a study in 2014 and 2015.

    "Abstract": "This study explores how indigenous knowledge (IK) might be retained and/or changed among contemporary indigenous peoples. Through semi-structured interviews and quantitative analyses of long-term changes in artistic knowledge among three geographically displaced Kaiabi (Kawaiwete) we found an association between language proficiency and gender with greater IK retention, and formal schooling with IK erosion. Six mechanisms of innovation in knowledge of basketry and textiles among men and women were documented. A mixed mode of collaborative learning and knowledge transmission involving diverse actors emerged from community workshops and group forums. Innovative mechanisms for cultural transmission have taken advantage of media, technology, and non-indigenous support organizations to expand weaving knowledge of basketry designs. Our results illustrate how indigenous peoples actively shape cultural transmission and change, as well as the role that public policies and academic research may play in these processes.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Early phase trials are essential in drug development, determining appropriate dose levels and assessing preliminary activity. These trials are undertaken by industry and academia, with increasing collaborations between the two. There is pressure to perform these trials quickly, safely, and robustly. However, there are inherent differences between developing and managing early phase, compared to late phase, drug trials. This article describes an approach to establishing an academically led early phase trial portfolio, highlighting lessons learned and sharing experiences. Methods: In 2009, the University of Leeds Clinical Trials Research Unit became the Clinical Trials Coordinating Office for Myeloma UK's phase I and II trials. We embarked on a transition from working extensively in phase III to early phase trials development and conduct. This involved evaluating and revising our well-established standard operating procedures, visiting other academic early phase units, and developing essential new documentation and processes. Results: A core team of trial and data managers and statisticians was established to facilitate expertise and knowledge retention. A detailed training plan was implemented focussing on essential standard practices for early phase. These included pharmacovigilance, recruitment, trial design and set-up, data and site monitoring, and oversight committees. Training in statistical methods for early phase trials was incorporated. Conclusion: Initial scoping of early phase trial management and conduct was essential in establishing this early phase portfolio. Many of the processes developed were successful. However, regular review and evaluation were implemented to enable changes and ensure efficiencies. It is recommended that others embarking on this venture build on the experiences described in this article.",

    "Abstract": "Background Current surgical education relies on simulated educational experiences or didactic sessions to teach low-frequency clinical events such as abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate if simulation would improve performance and knowledge retention of ACS better than a didactic lecture. Methods Nineteen general surgery residents were block randomized by postgraduate year level to a didactic or a simulation session. After 3 months, all residents completed a knowledge assessment before participating in an additional simulation. Two independent reviewers assessed resident performance via audio-video recordings. Results No baseline differences in ACS experience were noted between groups. The observational evaluation demonstrated a significant difference in performance between the didactic and simulation groups: 9.9 vs 12.5,P= .037 (effect size = 1.15). Knowledge retention was equivalent between groups. Conclusions This pilot study suggests that simulation-based education may be more effective for teaching the basic concepts of ACS.",

    "Abstract": "Current surgical education relies on simulated educational experiences or didactic sessions to teach low-frequency clinical events such as abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate if simulation would improve performance and knowledge retention of ACS better than a didactic lecture. BACKGROUND Current surgical education relies on simulated educational experiences or didactic sessions to teach low-frequency clinical events such as abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate if simulation would improve performance and knowledge retention of ACS better than a didactic lecture.Nineteen general surgery residents were block randomized by postgraduate year level to a didactic or a simulation session. After 3 months, all residents completed a knowledge assessment before participating in an additional simulation. Two independent reviewers assessed resident performance via audio-video recordings. METHODS Nineteen general surgery residents were block randomized by postgraduate year level to a didactic or a simulation session. After 3 months, all residents completed a knowledge assessment before participating in an additional simulation. Two independent reviewers assessed resident performance via audio-video recordings.No baseline differences in ACS experience were noted between groups. The observational evaluation demonstrated a significant difference in performance between the didactic and simulation groups: 9.9 vs 12.5, P = .037 (effect size = 1.15). Knowledge retention was equivalent between groups. RESULTS No baseline differences in ACS experience were noted between groups. The observational evaluation demonstrated a significant difference in performance between the didactic and simulation groups: 9.9 vs 12.5, P = .037 (effect size = 1.15). Knowledge retention was equivalent between groups.This pilot study suggests that simulation-based education may be more effective for teaching the basic concepts of ACS. CONCLUSIONS This pilot study suggests that simulation-based education may be more effective for teaching the basic concepts of ACS.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG This paper looks at how knowledge has been communicated within a multi-layered water governance structure in order to manage non-point source (NPS) pollution in South Korea. Since 28,300 ha of wetlands were reclaimed in Saemangeum, on the western side of the country, in 2006, the artificial lake created has suffered from chronic pollution. For the purposes of integrated water management, a water governance structure was formed linking organisations ranging from local to national scales. Despite institutional efforts to implement integrated water management and a governance approach, knowledge of NPS pollution and its management was produced and communicated among certain stakeholders only, such as policy and technical experts. In-depth interview and archival analysis of this research attempt to explain why and how the loss of knowledge communication occurred in this context. The first result of this research illustrates that, while knowledge communication has been smooth at the national and provincial layers, it has not taken place efficiently through to the local layer. When it comes to local farmers and governmental organisations and experts in particular, knowledge nodes have not functioned. Second, the research suggests that non-communication of knowledge has been mobilised as a professional strategy. Actors at the local layer have prioritized their professional interests and intentionally avoided knowledge communication with other department or ministries. Local and community actors have chosen not to provide farmers information. We conclude by discussing policy implications for knowledge communication and inclusive water governance.",

    "Abstract": "Phishing is a type of social engineering cybercrimes in which, phishers try to steal users’ information. Human unawareness and inattention factors are usually exploited by phishers to bypass anti-phishing systems. This impose on anti-phishing solutions to target the vulnerabilities at both of technical and non-technical layers of phishing problem. This paper reviews users’ training approach as a non-technical solution to mitigate security threats in general and phishing problem in particular. Security training methods should be designed to attract users’ attention in order to enhance their awareness and make them retain acquired knowledge for longer time. Training activities therefore, must consider knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and knowledge transfer aspects. Training in addition, should be embedded into something that users are familiar with and continually practice to make training as ongoing activity. Security training as a non-technical solution must be highly considered to complement the performance of anti-phishing technical tools and thus, improve their results.",

Using a unique opportunity to assess three types of course delivery—face-to-face, interactive television (iTV), and purely online delivery—the authors look at both initial knowledge acquisition and the retention of this knowledge. The results indicate that the online class outperformed the face-to-face and iTV sections on the initial performance evaluation; however, knowledge retention was greater in the face-to-face and iTV sections. The authors' findings suggest that diverse educational delivery methods provide unique benefits to students, but these benefits vary in relation to immediate learning outcomes and knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "We designed an educational interactive ebook called Cyberheroes and evaluated it to assess its effectiveness at increasing children’s online privacy knowledge and behaviour, and supporting child–parent privacy-related discussions. We conducted a user study with 22 children (aged 7 to 9) and 22 parents that included usability evaluations and privacy knowledge and behaviour assessments with children pre/post-reading and 1-week later. Cyberheroes considerably increased children’s online privacy knowledge and reported privacy behaviour, and led to superior 1-week knowledge retention compared to the text-only control. Furthermore, Cyberheroes facilitated longer child–parent privacy discussions during co-reading than the control. Children and parents found Cyberheroes engaging, easy to use, and easy to learn. We discuss our interactive ebook’s role in children’s acquisition, retention, and transfer of knowledge, and the role that interactivity, previous knowledge, and parental guidance play in children’s online privacy education.

    "Abstract": "To incorporate and assess the impact of a coordinated practice testing activity on pharmacy student knowledge acquisition, retention, and perception as an effective study technique in a pharmacotherapy course. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE To incorporate and assess the impact of a coordinated practice testing activity on pharmacy student knowledge acquisition, retention, and perception as an effective study technique in a pharmacotherapy course.Students were instructed to individually create, exchange, complete, and discuss solutions to weekly, cumulative practice tests of targeted material during the first unit of the course. Students completed surveys on their perceptions of practice testing. Unit and final examination scores were compared to the previous year. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING Students were instructed to individually create, exchange, complete, and discuss solutions to weekly, cumulative practice tests of targeted material during the first unit of the course. Students completed surveys on their perceptions of practice testing. Unit and final examination scores were compared to the previous year.Comparison of average unit examinations scores showed only minimal improvement in knowledge acquisition, and no impact was detected in knowledge retention. Most students in the course did not perceive practice testing to be beneficial in learning or retaining unit material. FINDINGS Comparison of average unit examinations scores showed only minimal improvement in knowledge acquisition, and no impact was detected in knowledge retention. Most students in the course did not perceive practice testing to be beneficial in learning or retaining unit material.Incorporating a coordinated practice testing activity may have minimally improved knowledge acquisition in our pharmacotherapy course. However, limitations exist which make it difficult to attribute improvement solely to our learning activity. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY Incorporating a coordinated practice testing activity may have minimally improved knowledge acquisition in our pharmacotherapy course. However, limitations exist which make it difficult to attribute improvement solely to our learning activity.",

    "Abstract": "In today's dynamic learning environment, educational delivery methods have become increasingly diverse. Using a unique opportunity to assess three types of course delivery—face-to-face, interactive television (iTV), and purely online delivery—the authors look at both initial knowledge acquisition and the retention of this knowledge. The results indicate that the online class outperformed the face-to-face and iTV sections on the initial performance evaluation; however, knowledge retention was greater in the face-to-face and iTV sections. The authors' findings suggest that diverse educational delivery methods provide unique benefits to students, but these benefits vary in relation to immediate learning outcomes and knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Currently, the curriculum of medical education is compartmentalized which makes achieving the expected outcome, a real challenge. Co-teaching, an existing concept in education, however, may be used in medical education for integrating the applied component while basic concepts are being taught. The hypothesis, “can co-teaching be an alternate for an integrated curriculum?” was explored in this study. Therefore, the present study was designed to compare the outcomes of co-teaching with the existing teaching methodology owing to the absence of integrated curriculum. Methods: Co-teaching and conventional modules of topics Diabetes mellitus (DM) and Alcohol and liver disease (AL), were prepared and validated. 100 under graduate medical students were randomly assigned to groups A and B. Group A was taught DM by Conventional teaching (CT) and AL by Integrated Co-teaching (ICT) and Group B was taught DM by ICT and AL by CT. A knowledge assessment tool of 20 multiple choice items was administered to assess the pre, post and retention knowledge scores. Change between knowledge scores was analyzed using inferential statistics. Results: Both conventional and co-teaching were significantly effective in increasing the knowledge scores ( p = 0.0001) with no significant difference in learning outcomes ( p = 0.59) between the two. However, co-teaching showed better knowledge retention compared to conventional teaching ( p = 0.008). Conclusions: Co-teaching could be considered as a substitute for integrated curriculum as it enabled comparatively better retention of knowledge as revealed by the findings.

This study utilized cluster randomization. In addition to traditional instruction, the intervention group counseled a simulated patient on the use of insulin using the teach-back method. Test score changes from baseline were analyzed via two-sample t-test. The intervention group exhibited a significantly greater increase in knowledge test scores from baseline compared to the control group. Similar changes were seen in post-instruction counseling checklist scores and knowledge retention test scores from baseline. Simulated patient interactions, when added to traditional coursework within a P1 skills lab, improve student counseling aptitude and knowledge retention scores.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this project was to improve birth outcomes for babies in a regional referral hospital in Uganda by strengthening factors that influence the retention and application of neonatal resuscitation skills. Initial training in neonatal resuscitation is not enough on its own. In order to better understand the gap between training and effective practice, an evaluation of a neonatal resuscitation program was carried out. This included practical skill testing of local midwives using a neonatal resuscitation doll pre- and post-training, as well as follow up testing at 1 month and 12 months, followed by focus groups and interviews. Test scores revealed that participants' knowledge grew significantly immediately following the workshop, and remained high after 1 month, but fell by 12 months post-training. Interviews with hospital staff revealed a number of facilitators and barriers to practice, namely knowledge retention and skill application. The most important barrier identified is the lack of refresher training post-workshop. Importantly, the findings demonstrated a need not for refresher training alone, but for improved organizational and administrative support for the newly assigned trainers.",

    "Abstract": "Active instructional approaches have been demonstrated to result in greater student achievement, prompting institutions to transition to more active learning environments. However, little work has been conducted to specifically measure the retention of knowledge gained. The purpose of the research presented here was to test assumptions regarding the effectiveness of reform-based instructional approaches at facilitating knowledge retention in students. We conducted an experimental study of knowledge retention at a midsized community college using a modified Solomon four-group design with control (lecture) and treatment (active) groups and a pre/post assessment protocol. Knowledge retention after approximately 5 months did not differ across groups. Estimated knowledge retention for the control group was slightly higher than that for the treatment group. Similarly, knowledge gains were not different across groups but other metrics such as student retention, final exam scores, and programmatic measures of student success were slightly different. We conclude by discussing the implication of our findings to the broader postsecondary science education reform movement and suggest future research to refine our incipient understanding.",

    "Abstract": "The problem of alegacysoftware system is never ending. Today’s working system will be tomorrow’s legacy. Whatever care a software developer takes to build a state-of-the-art system as per latest available technology today, due to constant improvement/change in technology, the today’s working system may become tomorrows’ legacy.Legacy System is a computer program, typically a database system, which, although critical to an organization’s operations, is in an obsolete format or is installed on an obsolete system. Replacing legacy system or making itwork with new requirements is themost timeconsuming and also economically unviable to the industry. The outdatedsoftware system that may still be in use in an organizationis because its data cannot be changed to newer or standard format, or its application programs cannot be upgraded. There are many legacy software applications that have either no source codes available or require too much effort to port.One of the severeproblems in the evolution of legacy software system is the loss of knowledge about them.Herein a survey of the problems of Legacy Software System is made and arrived at solutions to these problems using the available techniques.",

    "Abstract": "Background Training guidelines state that pediatricians should be able to diagnose, manage, and triage patients with heart disease. Acutely ill cardiac patients present infrequently and with high acuity, yet residents receive less exposure to acute cardiac conditions than previous generations. Trainees must learn to manage these situations despite this gap. Simulation has been used successfully to train learners to provide acute care. We hypothesized that a simulation-based cardiac curriculum would improve residents' ability to manage cardiac patients. Methods Pediatric residents completed 4 simulation cases followed by debriefing and a computer presentation reviewing the learning objectives. Subjects returned at 1 month for postintervention cases and again at 4-6 months to measure knowledge retention. Cases were scored by 2 raters using a dichotomous checklist. We used repeated measure ANOVA and effect size to compare groups and intra-class correlation (ICC) to assess inter-rater reliability. Results Twenty-five participants were enrolled. Scores were low on pretesting but showed significant improvement (P<.05) in all 4 cases. No decay was noted on late testing. Pre-post effect sizes ranged from 1.1 to 2.1, demonstrating meaningful improvement. Inter-rater reliability (ICC) ranged from 0.61 to 0.93 across cases. Conclusions This novel simulation-based curriculum targets a gap in pediatric training and offers an effective way to train pediatricians. We plan to expand this curriculum to new populations of participants and have integrated it into our resident cardiology rotation.",

    "Abstract": "In order to support the mediator for the effective and key business value delivered during the interaction, coordination and facilitation of communication between the transport network and the internet protocol network management system, there is a need for robust design of human workflow and its knowledge management. The previous process was slower as it usually took days, weeks or months instead of seconds or minutes, due to poor workflow design or poor workflow implementation of the human workflow, or poor human interactive management system. In order to add business value to mediator deployment, this paper designed human workflow architecture for the human participation in the business processes of interaction and coordination between two network management systems. This paper looks at human interaction that provides the maximum advantage to the work artifact. The paper posits that some action(s) need human interaction and decisions during the business process. The paper also discusses the economy of scale of human workflow design, reliability and its knowledge retention in the aspect of knowledge management. We believe that an effective human interactive management system with automated business processes would result in a higher economy of scale.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how companies are handling the issue of knowledge retention from old age retiring workers in the oil and gas sector. This is achieved by providing a detailed insight on the challenges and strategies related to knowledge retention through study of companies from different geographical locations across the globe. Design/methodology/approach The study adopts a qualitative research methodology and 20 semi-structured interviews, with open-ended and probing questions, were conducted to gain an in-depth insight into the knowledge retention phenomena. Findings Knowledge retention activities tend to be inconsistent in majority of the oil and gas companies, with not much work being done regarding knowledge loss from old employees, partly because of the fall in oil prices and layoffs. Oil prices turn out to be a decisive factor in oil and gas industry regarding workforce and knowledge retention activities. The political situation and geographical locations of the companies also affect the knowledge retention activities. Moreover, the aging workforce and retirement issue is more acute in the upstream sector. Research limitations/implications The focus of the study was on the oil and gas sector, and thus the research results may lack generalizability. Originality/value This paper fulfills an identified need for investigating the issues and challenges of knowledge retention regarding old age retiring employees by taking into account a global perspective and providing a comparison among different companies in different geographical locations.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Infrastructure adds pace and efficiency into India’s progress. It is a country which has embraced the notion of a knowledge economy of late, and thus raised the importance of infrastructure consulting per se . The study aims to cover the consequent but underexplored role of organizational structure (OS) vis-à-vis knowledge retention (KR) in this sector. Design/methodology/approach For conducting the research, the sampling organization that has been chosen is an infrastructure consulting organization. The researchers had undertaken an exploratory study to find out the dynamics between OS and KR. A qualitative approach has thus been adopted and the application of thematic analysis found place in conducting the research. The themes and sub-themes generated from the research, aligned with the theoretical backdrop, gave rise to a schematic model explaining the relationship between OS and KR. Findings From the above themes and sub-themes along with possible relationships which emerged from the study, the researchers observed that the theme “organizational structure” had a significant relationship with the sub-theme “knowledge retention”. In the order, what was the most noteworthy was that designing of an OS had a refined and somewhat directed influence on KR in the organization. Originality/value This paper tries to uncover the relationship between an organization’s structure formation and the key aspect of knowledge management cycle, which is KR. This shall be helpful for both academics (who can make advancements by testing the relationship in other contexts) and practitioners (who can look forward to minimizing business losses through the concept of KR).",

    "Abstract": "Background Spaced education is a novel method that improves medical education through online repetition of core principles often paired with multiple-choice questions. This model is a proven teaching tool for medical students, but its effect on resident learning is less established. We hypothesized that repetition of key clinical concepts in a “Clinical Pearls” format would improve knowledge retention in medical residents. Methods This study investigated spaced education with particular emphasis on using a novel, email-based reinforcement program, and a randomized, self-matched design, in which residents were quizzed on medical knowledge that was either reinforced or not with electronically-administered spaced education. Both reinforced and non-reinforced knowledge was later tested with four quizzes. Results Overall, respondents incorrectly answered 395 of 1008 questions (0.39; 95% CI, 0.36–0.42). Incorrect response rates varied by quiz (range 0.34–0.49; p = 0.02), but not significantly by post-graduate year (PGY1 0.44, PGY2 0.33, PGY3 0.38; p = 0.08). Although there was no evidence of benefit among residents (RR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.83–1.22; p = 0.95), we observed a significantly lower risk of incorrect responses to reinforced material among interns (RR = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.70–0.99, p = 0.04). Conclusions Overall, repetition of Clinical Pearls did not statistically improve test scores amongst junior and senior residents. However, among interns, repetition of the Clinical Pearls was associated with significantly higher test scores, perhaps reflecting their greater attendance at didactic sessions and engagement with Clinical Pearls. Although the study was limited by a low response rate, we employed test and control questions within the same quiz, limiting the potential for selection bias. Further work is needed to determine the optimal spacing and content load of Clinical Pearls to maximize retention amongst medical residents. This particular protocol of spaced education, however, was unique and readily reproducible suggesting its potential efficacy for intern education within a large residency program.",

    "Abstract": "Active instructional approaches have been demonstrated to result in greater student achievement, prompting institutions to transition to more active learning environments. However, little work has been conducted to specifically measure the retention of knowledge gained. The purpose of the research presented here was to test assumptions regarding the effectiveness of reform-based instructional approaches at facilitating knowledge retention in students. We conducted an experimental study of knowledge retention at a midsized community college using a modified Solomon four-group design with control (lecture) and treatment (active) groups and a pre/post assessment protocol. Knowledge retention after approximately 5 months did not differ across groups. Estimated knowledge retention for the control group was slightly higher than that for the treatment group. Similarly, knowledge gains were not different across groups but other metrics such as student retention, final exam scores, and programmatic measures of student success were slightly different. We conclude by discussing the implication of our findings to the broader postsecondary science education reform movement and suggest future research to refine our incipient understanding.",

[...]the subject teaching is conducted in isolation, which leaves considerably little scope for the students to correlate and integrate the basic subject knowledge during the clinical semesters.1 It also fails to convey the actual relevance of the subject with its applied clinical aspects2 and rarely generates the expected level of interest and curiosity in the learner.3,4 This holds true mainly for subjects in the basic sciences. [...]the above said knowledge contaminating factors were absent in the case of Alcohol and liver disease topic. [...]in this case, knowledge retention in two teaching methodologies revealed significantly higher scores for the ICT group. [...]this finding suggested that integrated teaching was more fruitful in generating interest and hence sustaining attention of students leading to better long term retention. Since students were in a smaller groups (in both cases), more interactive attitude was observed as compared to the whole class attending at a time. [...]teaching in small groups favors better learning was further supported.14 Feedback on suggestion for further improvement in teaching learning also had preference for this innovative approach.",

Against the background of the underdeveloped body of knowledge regarding knowledge retention, the authors selected an explorative (qualitative) research approach. More precisely, they conducted semi-structured interviews with organization members (i.e. executive and regular staff) of five Austrian SMEs operating in the building and construction industry. This study provides fresh insights into knowledge retention in SMEs. The findings advance the limited understanding of knowledge retention in general and regarding SMEs. They also contribute to the further development of the study of knowledge management in the building and construction sector. Based on the study's findings the authors derive suitable measures to better manage the process of knowledge retention in SMEs. These measures may be useful for SMEs operating in other industries as well.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives/Hypothesis E-learning, in its most rudimentary form, is the use of Internet-based resources for teaching and learning purposes. In surgical specialties, this definition encompasses the use of virtual patient cases, digital modeling, and online tutorials, as well as standardized video and imaging. As new technological frontiers rapidly emerge within otolaryngology, e-learning may be an effective alternative to traditional teaching. Here we present a systematic review of the literature assessing the efficacy of e-learning for otolaryngology education and a discussion of the relevance of these programs for both medical students and residents within the field. Study Design Systematic review. Methods A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was conducted according to the guidelines defined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Results Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. These studies measured a range of outcomes from basic science anatomical knowledge to clinically relevant endpoints such as diagnostic accuracy. Nearly all of the studies reported greater satisfaction and/or significantly increased objective knowledge using the e-learning intervention compared to traditional techniques. Conclusions E-learning proves to be a powerful alternative to standard teaching techniques within otolaryngology education for both residents and medical students. Future work should focus on validating specific e-learning programs and accessing long-term knowledge retention using these innovative platforms.

    "Abstract": "Currently, the curriculum of medical education is compartmentalized which makes achieving the expected outcome, a real challenge. Co-teaching, an existing concept in education, however, may be used in medical education for integrating the applied component while basic concepts are being taught. The hypothesis, \"can co-teaching be an alternate for an integrated curriculum?\" was explored in this study. Therefore, the present study was designed to compare the outcomes of co-teaching with the existing teaching methodology owing to the absence of integrated curriculum. PURPOSE Currently, the curriculum of medical education is compartmentalized which makes achieving the expected outcome, a real challenge. Co-teaching, an existing concept in education, however, may be used in medical education for integrating the applied component while basic concepts are being taught. The hypothesis, \"can co-teaching be an alternate for an integrated curriculum?\" was explored in this study. Therefore, the present study was designed to compare the outcomes of co-teaching with the existing teaching methodology owing to the absence of integrated curriculum.Co-teaching and conventional modules of topics Diabetes mellitus (DM) and Alcohol and liver disease (AL), were prepared and validated. 100 under graduate medical students were randomly assigned to groups A and B. Group A was taught DM by Conventional teaching (CT) and AL by Integrated Co-teaching (ICT) and Group B was taught DM by ICT and AL by CT. A knowledge assessment tool of 20 multiple choice items was administered to assess the pre, post and retention knowledge scores. Change between knowledge scores was analyzed using inferential statistics. METHODS Co-teaching and conventional modules of topics Diabetes mellitus (DM) and Alcohol and liver disease (AL), were prepared and validated. 100 under graduate medical students were randomly assigned to groups A and B.

A knowledge assessment tool of 20 multiple choice items was administered to assess the pre, post and retention knowledge scores. Change between knowledge scores was analyzed using inferential statistics.Both conventional and co-teaching were significantly effective in increasing the knowledge scores (p = 0.0001) with no significant difference in learning outcomes (p = 0.59) between the two. However, co-teaching showed better knowledge retention compared to conventional teaching (p = 0.008). RESULTS Both conventional and co-teaching were significantly effective in increasing the knowledge scores (p = 0.0001) with no significant difference in learning outcomes (p = 0.59) between the two. However, co-teaching showed better knowledge retention compared to conventional teaching (p = 0.008).Co-teaching could be considered as a substitute for integrated curriculum as it enabled comparatively better retention of knowledge as revealed by the findings.

Acutely ill cardiac patients present infrequently and with high acuity, yet residents receive less exposure to acute cardiac conditions than previous generations.

Trainees must learn to manage these situations despite this gap. Simulation has been used successfully to train learners to provide acute care. We hypothesized that a simulation-based cardiac curriculum would improve residents' ability to manage cardiac patients.Pediatric residents completed 4 simulation cases followed by debriefing and a computer presentation reviewing the learning objectives. Subjects returned at 1 month for postintervention cases and again at 4-6 months to measure knowledge retention. Cases were scored by 2 raters using a dichotomous checklist. We used repeated measure ANOVA and effect size to compare groups and intra-class correlation (ICC) to assess inter-rater reliability. METHODS Pediatric residents completed 4 simulation cases followed by debriefing and a computer presentation reviewing the learning objectives.

We used repeated measure ANOVA and effect size to compare groups and intra-class correlation (ICC) to assess inter-rater reliability.Twenty-five participants were enrolled. Scores were low on pretesting but showed significant improvement (P < .05) in all 4 cases. No decay was noted on late testing. Pre-post effect sizes ranged from 1.1 to 2.1, demonstrating meaningful improvement. Inter-rater reliability (ICC) ranged from 0.61 to 0.93 across cases.

    "Abstract": "The objective of this project was to improve birth outcomes for babies in a regional referral hospital in Uganda by strengthening factors that influence the retention and application of neonatal resuscitation skills. Initial training in neonatal resuscitation is not enough on its own. In order to better understand the gap between training and effective practice, an evaluation of a neonatal resuscitation program was carried out. This included practical skill testing of local midwives using a neonatal resuscitation doll pre- and post-training, as well as follow up testing at 1 month and 12 months, followed by focus groups and interviews. Test scores revealed that participants' knowledge grew significantly immediately following the workshop, and remained high after 1 month, but fell by 12 months post-training. Interviews with hospital staff revealed a number of facilitators and barriers to practice, namely knowledge retention and skill application. The most important barrier identified is the lack of refresher training post-workshop. Importantly, the findings demonstrated a need not for refresher training alone, but for improved organizational and administrative support for the newly assigned trainers.The objective of this project was to improve birth outcomes for babies in a regional referral hospital in Uganda by strengthening factors that influence the retention and application of neonatal resuscitation skills.

In this study, we have evaluated a peer-education workshop that aims to educate primary and secondary school students on hygiene, the spread of infection and antibiotics. Background Delivering health topics in schools through peer education is known to be beneficial for all students involved. In this study, we have evaluated a peer-education workshop that aims to educate primary and secondary school students on hygiene, the spread of infection and antibiotics.Four schools in south-west England, in a range of localities, took part in peer-education workshops, with students completing before, after and knowledge-retention questionnaires. Mixed-effect logistic regression and mixed-effect linear regression were used to analyse the data. Data were analysed by topic, region and peer/non-peer-educator status. Qualitative interviews and focus groups with students and educators were conducted to assess changes in participants' skills, confidence and behaviour.

There was a significant improvement in knowledge for all topics covered in the intervention, although this varied by region. In the antibiotics topic, peer-educators' knowledge increased in the retention questionnaire, whereas non-peer-educators' knowledge decreased. Knowledge declined in the retention questionnaires for the other topics, although this was mostly not significant.

    "Abstract": "Imparting real world experiences is often a challenge due to both lack of effective active learning tools and effective delivery strategies. This pedagogical requirement is important because graduates are expected to develop software that meets rigorous quality standards in functional and application domains with little to no training. Lack of effective active tools have been addressed by the authors by designing, developing, and delivering, eighteen (18) delivery hours of Case Studies, sixteen (16) delivery hours of Class Exercises, and six (6) delivery hours of Video Case Studies for use in courses that impart knowledge on SV&V topics viz. requirements engineering, software reviews, configuration management, and software testing. Four key skill areas sought after by employers, namely communication skills, applied knowledge of methods, applied knowledge of tools, and research exposure have been used to drive the development funded by a National Science Foundation grant and perfected through an industry-academia partnership. These tools have been successfully disseminated to over 25 universities with many CS, IS, SE programs incorporating the tools in their existing courses and others designing new courses based on these tools. As student learning retention depends on knowledge retention activities delivered in different settings it is important to identify and incorporate delivery strategies that meet course and/or module learning outcomes. In this paper we discuss strategies used to effectively incorporate and deliver the developed Active Learning tools by instructors at three universities. Traditional and flipped classroom delivery strategies are discussed and topics like pre-requisite knowledge preparation prior to class and, course module presentation sequence, homework, team/individual work, collaborative discussions, and assessment tools are deliberated. In addition student feedback and assessment are also presented for each category of active learning tools and strategies that work are summarized.",

    "Abstract": "The need to improve problem solving skills in STEM undergraduates has been widely reported1. This Works in Progress paper seeks to provide additional insight into the role of knowledge structure, knowledge retention, and misconceptions in solving open-ended biomedical engineering design problems. Correlations in problem solving performance to level of metacognitive awareness will also be assessed. As part of a larger multidisciplinary study, we seek to develop a model describing undergraduates’ STEM problem solving performance to serve as a tool to guide support of students’ problem solving skill development. Current study participants are enrolled in a first year introductory biomedical engineering (BME) course aimed to introduce the field through BME specialization introductory lectures, prospective BME career guest lectures, and team-based hands-on design challenges. This two unit course consists of one 50 minute lecture and a 3 hour discussion session focused on engineering design each week. The majority of the 142 enrolled students are first quarter freshman engineering students, of which all BME students are required to take. To gather a baseline of students’ design knowledge, the Comprehensive Assessment of Design Engineering Knowledge (CADEK) diagnostic test2 was administered to all students in the first week of class and will be administered during the last week of class. Upon consent, students were also asked to complete an online Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI)3 during week 2. In addition to the CADEK and MAI, students will also answer an open ended design problem on their first quiz (in Week 5), in which ten high performing and ten low performing students will be identified and asked to participate in one hour think aloud interviews (TAInt). TAInt will be conducted in such a way to encourage participants to speak through their thought processes while asked to solve several open ended BME design problems. Following the TAInt, which will be held during week 7 and 8 of the quarter, participants will be asked to complete a follow up CADEK and participate in a second round of TAInt during the next quarter utilizing the same open ended problems. Level of knowledge retention will be assessed. Several developed instruments will be utilized to analyze the open ended design problems from quiz 1 and transcribed TAInt. The COSINE (Coding System for Investigating Sub-problems and the Network) method in particular, is an in-depth analysis of the difficulties students have during the problem solving process4. In order to utilize the COSINE method, sub-problems, which will correlate to the specific steps of the engineering design process, will be assigned a code based on student performance in a particular task. Quantitative metrics will be developed based on resulting codes to gain insight into where and why students are unsuccessful. MAI and CADEK results will also be assessed and correlated to quantitative metrics generated. Assessing study participants over the course of the BME undergraduate curriculum will also provide insight into strengths and areas for improvement of design instruction across the curriculum.

    "Abstract": "This paper summarizes a longitudinal study of the effects of instructional technology on learning and knowledge retention. Two very different types of software were introduced to students in an undergraduate mechanics course and the effects of this technology use were assessed a number of different times over a twenty-five week period. The study took place in three sections of an undergraduate mechanics course. Students in one section used a tool-type software. In a second section, students used a content-type software. Students in the third section represented a control group and did not use any software. To ensure the study’s validity, demographic data were collected from and compared between each of the three sections and the study was replicated in a subsequent term. Students were assessed immediately following the intervention and five, ten, and twenty-five weeks later. The results of these assessments were compared among groups to determine the effect of the technology use on learning and retention. Results indicated that each of the three groups had very high levels of retention but that there were no differential levels of learning, retention, or long-term retention among the three groups. Students using technology, however, were able to solve a greater number of problems during the special session than those working by hand. It was thus concluded that instructional technology can make the educational process more efficient without hindering learning or long-term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "The global context regarding energy and sustainability evolved rapidly and what we considered to be emerging technologies less than a decade ago became mature technologies nowadays, already implemented at large scales in industry. Moreover, the constant preoccupation regarding green energy manufacturing as a method of reducing the carbon footprint generated not only the path towards new technologies but also to new educational programs and trends. Following these trends and industry demands, the engineering curricula evolved to include more and more courses in the area of energy conversion, green energy and sustainability. However, several “traditional” courses remained more or less the same, mostly in the area of thermal-fluid areas. While there have been reported several attempts to improve these courses by including project-based learning activities, it was concluded that such projects involving industry-like scenarios where lengthy and costly, and eventually were stopped or replaced with traditional lectures. Nonetheless, these studies and attempts had a significant contribution in underlying the importance of practical approaches in conveying knowledge to students in heat transfer and thermodynamics courses, which traditionally are dry-lecture based. Moreover, the contribution of thermal-fluids energy systems performance in global sustainable development is substantial but was not emphasized until recently. Therefore it may not be reflected in the already developed learning modules for these traditional courses. In this paper we aim to present our efforts in re-developing our thermal-fluid related courses in Engineering Technology curricula by including several modules involving industry-like scenarios as laboratory activities performed remotely (through Internet), using four heat exchanger configurations and thermography (using a thermal imaging camera) in teaching fundamental principles and notions of heat transfer as well as teaching more complex aspects of heat exchanger design and performance. The scenarios were inspired from manufacturing industry related energy management applications, focusing on giving the students a more global and interdisciplinary understanding of the applications of the imparted knowledge. This lab-lecture integrated approach, with ”in-lecture” Internet based remotely performed activities, complemented by hands-on laboratory activities, significantly improved the understanding, knowledge retention and also it enhanced student motivation. Students were required to compare results obtained through various methods including thermography to discuss and assess system efficiency and design parameters. As traditional learning methods are time consuming and sometimes impractical, learning through the Internet will significantly increase the access to modern learning tools for all students including minorities and disadvantaged student communities, due to its affordability and ease of use, without curtailing the quality of knowledge conveyed. In recent years due to the Internet advances, the use of virtual and remote distance experiments in engineering education has been well accepted in many different education areas and at many universities. This paper presents an Internet-based remote platform conceived for the study of the thermal energy conversion systems, as well as monitoring using virtual instrumentation. This platform will provide students with enhanced tools of study. The platform was developed as a part of a DOED funded educational research.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG Around year 1890, the technology of using metallic iron (Fe0) for safe drinking water provision was already established in Europe. The science and technology to manufacture suitable Fe0 materials were known and further developed in this period. Scientists had then developed skills to (i) explore the suitability of individual Fe0 materials (e.g. iron filling, sponge iron) for selected applications, and (ii) establish treatment processes for households and water treatment plants. The recent (1990) discovery of Fe0 as reactive agent for environmental remediation and water treatment has not yet considered this ancient knowledge. In the present work, some key aspects of the ancient knowledge are presented together with some contemporised interpretations, in an attempt to demonstrate the scientific truth contained therein. It appears that the ancient knowledge is an independent validation of the scientific concept that in water treatment (Fe0/H2O system) Fe0 materials are generators of contaminant collectors.",

    "Abstract": "To be successful in many undergraduate disciplines, students must retain base knowledge from lower level courses and apply that knowledge in upper level courses. Students may benefit from and realize the importance of mastering basic concepts from the opportunity to utilize base knowledge in a real-world setting. Objectives of this project were to compare students' ability to retain information after completing a real-world learning project (RWLP) to base knowledge retained from exams students took during the semester, and to determine student perception of the RWLP. Incoming freshmen (n=52, 79% female, 96% animal science majors) enrolled in an introductory equine science course worked independently to create a RWLP, specifically an educational bulletin (EB) for eight main topics studied during the course. The main topics were identified by the instructors as the most important topics to learn in an introductory horse science class and included: identification, behavior, health, nutrition, activities, hoof care, parasite/disease, and reproduction. Students completed two content assessments after the course was completed: the regular course exam quiz (REQ) which contained questions (n=16; two questions from each main topic) the students had previously completed on exams, and the educational bulletin quiz (EBQ) which contained questions (n=16; two questions from each main topic) that were generated by the instructors from each student's EB. Students also completed a three-question survey (Likert scale 1-5) regarding the influence of the EB on their understanding of the material, retention of material presented in class, and overall impression of the EB. Student scores on the REQ and EBQ were positively correlated (r=0.54 and r=0.39, respectively) to final course grade, but not to gender (-0.05< r <0.05). Students performed better (P<0.0001) on questions from the EBQ compared to questions from the REQ. Students indicated they enjoyed completing the EB and perceived that they better understood basic information and expected to better retain the material as a direct result (4.5 ± 0.1, 4.72 ± 0.1 and 4.5 ± 0.4 on a 5-point scale, respectively). Students benefited from completing the EB project by better retaining key concepts taught during an introductory equine science course and the project was highly thought of by students. Disciplines that require students to retain key concepts from lower level courses for later use in upper level courses could benefit from a RWLP like the EB.",

    "Abstract": "Observational tutoring has been found to be an effective method for teaching a variety of subjects by reusing dialogue from previous successful tutoring sessions. While it has been shown content can be learned through observational tutoring, it has yet to been examined if a secondary behavior such as goal setting can be influenced. The present study investigated whether observing virtual humans engaging in a tutoring session on a difficult learning topic, rotational kinematics, with embedded positive goal-oriented dialogue would increase knowledge of the material and perpetuate a shift in an observer's goal orientation from performance avoidance goal orientation (PAVGO) to learning goal orientation (LGO). Learning gains were observed in pretest to posttest knowledge retention tests. Significant negative changes from pretest to posttest occurred across conditions for LGO. Additionally, significant increases from PAVGO pretest to posttest were observed in the control condition; however, PAVGO did not significantly change in the experimental condition.",

    "Abstract": "A critical step in promoting academic success among students involves the early identification of those in need of additional support before they fall too far behind. With this aim in mind, the present study investigated whether early and intermediate evaluative feedback on in-class quizzes were predictive of students’ scores on a final cumulative exam in a third year Psychology course at a large North American university. Early feedback was operationally defined as the percentage score that students received on a quiz that took place on the third of 12 classes, whereas intermediate feedback was operationally defined as the percentage score that students received on a quiz that took place on the seventh of 12 classes. The results of a regression analysis showed that early, but not intermediate, evaluative feedback was predictive of students’ scores on the final cumulative exam. The implications of the present findings include a practical, low-cost means of identifying students who could benefit most from additional academic support and resources to help enhance their achievement in a course. Moreover, the present study suggests that it is important for students to adopt effective study habits and learning strategies from the beginning of a course. Adopting these practices could help improve students’ academic success, experience, and retention rates, benefiting both the university and student body.

    "Abstract": "There are inconsistent claims made about the effectiveness of the flipped classroom (FC) in medical education; however, the quality of the empirical evidence used to back up these claims is not evident. The aims of this review are to examine the scope and quality of studies on the FC teaching approach in medical education and to assess the effects of FCs on medical learning. CONTEXT There are inconsistent claims made about the effectiveness of the flipped classroom (FC) in medical education; however, the quality of the empirical evidence used to back up these claims is not evident. The aims of this review are to examine the scope and quality of studies on the FC teaching approach in medical education and to assess the effects of FCs on medical learning.A literature search was conducted using the major electronic databases in 2016. Peer-reviewed papers were screened and reviewed according to explicit inclusion criteria. The scope and quality of all resultant studies were evaluated. Studies identified as using controlled designs were further synthesised to assess the effects of FCs on learning. METHODS A literature search was conducted using the major electronic databases in 2016. Peer-reviewed papers were screened and reviewed according to explicit inclusion criteria. The scope and quality of all resultant studies were evaluated. Studies identified as using controlled designs were further synthesised to assess the effects of FCs on learning.A total of 118 articles were obtained. Full texts of 82 articles were reviewed. Nine of the included 46 articles used a controlled design when examining the effects of the FC. There were generally positive perceptions of the FC approach. However, the effects of FCs on changes in knowledge and skills were less conclusive as the effect sizes ranged from d = -0.27 to 1.21, with a median of 0.08. The varying direction and magnitude of the effect sizes, together with their 95% confidence interval, which contained zero, suggested the lack of strong evidence for the effectiveness of FCs in promoting knowledge acquisition above and beyond the traditional learning methods. RESULTS A total of 118 articles were obtained. Full texts of 82 articles were reviewed. Nine of the included 46 articles used a controlled design when examining the effects of the FC. There were generally positive perceptions of the FC approach. However, the effects of FCs on changes in knowledge and skills were less conclusive as the effect sizes ranged from d = -0.27 to 1.21, with a median of 0.08. The varying direction and magnitude of the effect sizes, together with their 95% confidence interval, which contained zero, suggested the lack of strong evidence for the effectiveness of FCs in promoting knowledge acquisition above and beyond the traditional learning methods.There has been a recent increase of research rigor and variety in measures of effectiveness in studies on the FC in medical education. The FC is a promising teaching approach to increase learners' motivation and engagement. More solid evidence on its effect on changes in knowledge and skills are warranted. Further studies should also examine the long-term effects of FCs with regard to knowledge retention and transfer of knowledge to professional practice and patient care. CONCLUSIONS There has been a recent increase of research rigor and variety in measures of effectiveness in studies on the FC in medical education.

    "Abstract": "Context There are inconsistent claims made about the effectiveness of the flipped classroom (FC) in medical education; however, the quality of the empirical evidence used to back up these claims is not evident. The aims of this review are to examine the scope and quality of studies on the FC teaching approach in medical education and to assess the effects of FCs on medical learning. Methods A literature search was conducted using the major electronic databases in 2016. Peer-reviewed papers were screened and reviewed according to explicit inclusion criteria. The scope and quality of all resultant studies were evaluated. Studies identified as using controlled designs were further synthesised to assess the effects of FCs on learning. Results A total of 118 articles were obtained. Full texts of 82 articles were reviewed. Nine of the included 46 articles used a controlled design when examining the effects of the FC. There were generally positive perceptions of the FC approach. However, the effects of FCs on changes in knowledge and skills were less conclusive as the effect sizes ranged from d = -0.27 to 1.21, with a median of 0.08. The varying direction and magnitude of the effect sizes, together with their 95% confidence interval, which contained zero, suggested the lack of strong evidence for the effectiveness of FCs in promoting knowledge acquisition above and beyond the traditional learning methods. Conclusions There has been a recent increase of research rigor and variety in measures of effectiveness in studies on the FC in medical education. The FC is a promising teaching approach to increase learners' motivation and engagement. More solid evidence on its effect on changes in knowledge and skills are warranted. Further studies should also examine the long-term effects of FCs with regard to knowledge retention and transfer of knowledge to professional practice and patient care.",

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates the impact of pain education group visits on patients with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). The primary outcome of the study was to evaluate patients' functional status and secondary outcomes included knowledge, behavior, and satisfaction, before and after participation in the pain education group visits. OBJECTIVES This study evaluates the impact of pain education group visits on patients with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). The primary outcome of the study was to evaluate patients' functional status and secondary outcomes included knowledge, behavior, and satisfaction, before and after participation in the pain education group visits.Locally produced patient educational videos on chronic non-cancer pain were delivered during patient group visits led by a healthcare provider. Study participants included patients with CNCP pain in an academic general medicine practice. The primary outcome was functional status, measured by the Pain Intensity, Enjoyment of life, and General Activity (PEG) score and the Oswestry Disability Index. Secondary outcomes were evaluated through a pre- and post-intervention knowledge assessment and chart review of opioid use and utilization of emergency and urgent care services. A satisfaction survey was administered after each group visit. METHODS Locally produced patient educational videos on chronic non-cancer pain were delivered during patient group visits led by a healthcare provider. Study participants included patients with CNCP pain in an academic general medicine practice. The primary outcome was functional status, measured by the Pain Intensity, Enjoyment of life, and General Activity (PEG) score and the Oswestry Disability Index. Secondary outcomes were evaluated through a pre- and post-intervention knowledge assessment and chart review of opioid use and utilization of emergency and urgent care services. A satisfaction survey was administered after each group visit.Thirty-five patient-group visits were analyzed and 14 patient charts reviewed. A moderately positive correlation was observed between PEG and Oswestry Disability Index (r = 0.47, p < 0.05). Patient knowledge improved after watching the videos and participating in group discussion. The median amount of daily morphine equivalents for patients (n = 14) was 17.5mg (range 0-120mg) at the first study, and decreased to 12.5mg (range 0-110mg) at the last study visit (p = 0.39). None of the 14 patients utilized emergency or urgent care services for pain during the study. Overall, patient satisfaction scores with the intervention were high.

None of the 14 patients utilized emergency or urgent care services for pain during the study. Overall, patient satisfaction scores with the intervention were high.Group visits providing patient education about CNCP may benefit patients' knowledge about this clinical condition, and was received with high patient satisfaction. Further investigation is needed to evaluate longer-term knowledge retention, sustainability of improvements resulting from the intervention, and longer-term effects of the intervention on functional status. CONCLUSION Group visits providing patient education about CNCP may benefit patients' knowledge about this clinical condition, and was received with high patient satisfaction. Further investigation is needed to evaluate longer-term knowledge retention, sustainability of improvements resulting from the intervention, and longer-term effects of the intervention on functional status.",

    "Abstract": "The Radboud University Medical Center has a problem-based, learner-oriented, horizontally, and vertically integrated medical curriculum. Anatomists and clinicians have noticed students' decreasing anatomical knowledge and the disability to apply knowledge in diagnostic reasoning and problem solving. In a longitudinal cohort, the retention of anatomical knowledge gained during the first year of medical school among second-year medical students was assessed. In May 2011, 346 medical students applied for the second-year gastro-intestinal (GI) tract course. The students were asked to participate in a reexamination of a selection of anatomical questions of an examination from October 2009. The examination consisted of a clinical anatomy case scenario and two computed tomography (CT) images of thorax and abdomen in an extended matching format. A total of 165 students were included for analysis. In 2011, students scored significantly lower for the anatomy examination compared to 2009 with a decline in overall examination score of 14.7% (±11.7%). Decrease in knowledge was higher in the radiological questions, compared to the clinical anatomy cases 17.5% (±13.6%) vs. 7.9% (±10.0%), respectively, d = 5.17. In both years, male students scored slightly better compared to female students, and decline of knowledge seems somewhat lower in male students (13.1% (±11.1%) vs. 15.5% (±12.0%), respectively), d = -0.21. Anatomical knowledge in the problem-oriented horizontal and vertical integrated medical curriculum, declined by approximately 15% 1.5 year after the initial anatomy course.

    "Abstract": "This systematic literature review was conducted to explore the effectiveness of problem-based and project-based learning (PBL) implemented with students in early elementary to grade 8 (ages 3–14) in mathematics and science classrooms. Nine studies met the following inclusion criteria: (a) focus on PBL, (b) experimental study, (c) kindergarten to grade 8 level, and (d) focus on mathematics or science content. For these studies, we examined: the definitions of PBL used, the components of PBL explicitly identified as salient to student learning, and the effectiveness of PBL. This review found that although there is no consistent definition of PBL, PBL is an effective method for improving K–8 students’ science academic achievement, including knowledge retention, conceptual development, and attitudes. Implications and limitations are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "To determine whether team based learning (TBL) is superior to traditional lecture -based learning in confidence and knowledge retention one year later. OBJECTIVES To determine whether team based learning (TBL) is superior to traditional lecture -based learning in confidence and knowledge retention one year later.A survey was administered 17 months after a completion of a required over-the-counter /self-care (OTC) course to two different cohorts of students. The survey assessed confidence and knowledge related to OTC topics. The lecture group had a traditional lecture based classroom experience; the intervention group experienced a TBL format throughout the entire course. DESIGN A survey was administered 17 months after a completion of a required over-the-counter /self-care (OTC) course to two different cohorts of students. The survey assessed confidence and knowledge related to OTC topics. The lecture group had a traditional lecture based classroom experience; the intervention group experienced a TBL format throughout the entire course.One hundred forty-seven students of 283 enrolled (51.9%) in the lecture group and 222 of 305 (72.8%) students in the TBL group participated in the knowledge assessment and survey. Demographic data including student grade point averages (GPA) and confidence were similar in both groups. Mean assessment scores (±SD) on OTC knowledge was significantly higher in the traditional lecture based group versus the TBL group; 62.9±19.3 vs. 54.9±15.7 (p=0.001). ASSESSMENT One hundred forty-seven students of 283 enrolled (51.9%) in the lecture group and 222 of 305 (72.8%) students in the TBL group participated in the knowledge assessment and survey. Demographic data including student grade point averages (GPA) and confidence were similar in both groups. Mean assessment scores (±SD) on OTC knowledge was significantly higher in the traditional lecture based group versus the TBL group; 62.9±19.3 vs. 54.9±15.7 (p=0.001).Although TBL is thought to improve student engagement and mastery of material, after an initial implementation of TBL, knowledge retention in the long term appears to be lower than lecture based learning. CONCLUSION Although TBL is thought to improve student engagement and mastery of material, after an initial implementation of TBL, knowledge retention in the long term appears to be lower than lecture based learning.",

    "Abstract": "Research on problem-based learning (PBL) has tended to focus on the graduate level of education, paying less attention to the primary school level and to what is involved for students during the implementation of PBL. In this paper we take a step towards addressing this need for research by reporting findings from a descriptive, explanatory case study of a one-year PBL intervention in a fifth-grade (ages 10–11) mathematics classroom in Taiwan. We documented and analysed the students’ actions to reveal details in their part in the intervention. We compared the students’ performances on the five researcher-designed written tests, which were conducted at different points in time. Our findings cast light on the level of the students’ participation in PBL. The comparison between the test results shows improvements in students’ understanding of the concepts and supports the idea that PBL has positive effects on long-term knowledge retention.

INTRODUCTION The literature review revealed that nowadays only about 15 cases of bilateral shoulder dislocation associated with the fracture of the upper end of the humerus have been published. The triad of lesional mechanism designated by the triple syndrome E composed of epilepsy, electrocution, and external trauma was the circumstances noted in which these fractures dislocations occur with migration of the two humeral heads either forward or backward.An architect of 36-year-old, right-handed, was admitted in emergency department for loss of knowledge of progressive installation. At admission the blood pressure, pulse, and temperature were normal. There was a right hemiparesis predominantly in brachiofacial side and an aphasia. After intensive resuscitation measures, the cerebral computed tomography scan revealed a left temporoparietal hypodensity area affecting the middle cerebral artery superficial territory with a mass effect compatible with acute ischemic stroke. During the hospitalization, episodes of generalized tonic-clonic convulsions appeared with a fever at 39°C and a leukocytosis at 35 thousand on the 5 th day. These convulsions caused on the right shoulder an anterior dislocation under coracoid, associated with a fracture of the greater tubercle and on the left shoulder, posterior dislocation with much displaced comminuted articular proximal humeral fracture. We did reduction by external maneuvers for the right shoulder and open reduction with internal fixation by anatomical plate of left shoulder lesions. In the immediate aftermath of surgery, he presented episodes of agitation which led to the dismantling of the left shoulder fixation. He was evacuated to the North Country where an ablation of the left shoulder material and stabilization by locked plate were carried out. The sequelae were marked by the occurrence of an osteomyelitis with osteolysis of the entire upper right humerus extremity. It will require an inverted prosthesis.

    "Abstract": "Game-based training may have different characteristics than other forms of instruction. The independent validation of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) Sirius program evaluated game-based cognitive bias training across several games with a common set of control groups. Control groups included a professionally produced video that taught the same cognitive biases and an unrelated video that did not teach any biases. Knowledge was tested immediately after training and after a delay. This article presents the results from the two phases of the Sirius program. Game-based training showed advantages in teaching bias mitigation skills (procedural knowledge) but had no advantage over video instruction in teaching people to answer explicit questions about biases (declarative knowledge). Overall, training effects persisted over time, and games performed as well as and in some cases better than the video-based instruction for knowledge retention. Our results suggest that serious games can be an effective training tool, particularly for teaching procedural knowledge.

    "Abstract": "Remote, rural ethnic-minority communities face greater disaster-related public health risks due to their lack of resources and limited access to health care. The Ethnic Minority Health Project (EMHP) was initiated in 2009 to work with remote, disaster-prone ethnic-minority villages that live in extreme poverty. One of the project's aims is to develop and evaluate bottom-up health risk reduction efforts in emergency and disaster risk management (Health-EDRM). This article shares project updates and describes field intervention results from the Yi ethnic community of Hongyan village in China's Sichuan Province, an area that experiences recurrent floods. It was found that 64% of the village respondents had never considered any form of disaster preparation, even with the recurrent flood risks. Health intervention participants showed sustained knowledge retention and were nine times more likely to know the correct composition of oral rehydration solution (ORS) after the intervention. Participants also retained the improved knowledge on ORS and disaster preparedness kit ownership 12 months after the intervention.",

In 2011, students scored significantly lower for the anatomy examination compared to 2009 with a decline in overall examination score of 14.7% (±11.7%). Decrease in knowledge was higher in the radiological questions, compared to the clinical anatomy cases 17.5% (±13.6%) vs. 7.9% (±10.0%), respectively, d = 5.17. In both years, male students scored slightly better compared to female students, and decline of knowledge seems somewhat lower in male students (13.1% (±11.1%) vs. 15.5% (±12.0%), respectively), d = -0.21. Anatomical knowledge in the problem-oriented horizontal and vertical integrated medical curriculum, declined by approximately 15% 1.5 year after the initial anatomy course. The loss of knowledge in the present study is relative small compared to previous studies.",

    "Abstract": "According to authors Kohn, Corrigan, and Donaldson (2000), up to 98,000 people die each year because of medical errors. After the IOM report, other sources suggested 98,000 deaths as an underestimation; the actual number of deaths from medical errors may be in the hundreds of thousands (James, 2013). Kagan and Barnoy (2013) surveyed 270 registered nurses (90% hospital-based) about their medical error reporting and found the rate at which they reported medical errors was related directly to the perception of a patient safety culture. Qin, Xie, Jiang, Zhen, and Ding (2015) performed a cross-sectional survey of 1,125 nurses in China and found errors were reported more often if staffperceived the environment was safe, stress by the staffwas recognized, and job satisfaction was high. Wagner and co-authors (2013) surveyed 245 nurses in long-term care facilities in Canada and found similar results. Nurse leaders should share error report results with staffto highlight the value and positive impact of completing reports, especially when an improvement in the system leads to a safer environment.

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Podcasts and blog posts are gaining popularity in Free Open Access Medical education (FOAMed). However, there remains a paucity of research comparing the two media for undergraduate medical education. This study aims to investigate if there are differences in medical students' usage conditions, knowledge retention and preferences in the two types of media (podcasts, blog posts). Methods: Medical students were block-randomized to either the podcast or blog post group according to their year of schooling. They completed an online assessment of their baseline knowledge on the subject matter and preferences within the various types of media. Participants then received access to learning materials and were given four weeks to complete the follow-up assessment. Simple descriptive statistical data were used to detail student preferences. Paired samples t-tests and a Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (RM-ANOVA) were conducted to assess knowledge acquisition. A carry forward analysis was used to impute missing data from students lost to follow-up. Results: A total of 65 medical students participated in our study (podcasts n=33, blog posts n=32). The initial survey suggests that students prefer general topic discussion and \"approach-to\" themes (68% and 84%, respectively). 55% of students in the podcast group preferred podcasts that were less than 30 minutes. None of the blog post group preferred a shorter text, and each blog post required a mean of 25 minutes to read. Completion of at least one follow-up assessment was comparable (68% podcasts, 70% blog posts). The podcast listeners tended to engage in multiple activities while using the learning material (e.g. at least 2-3 of the following: driving, eating, chores, taking notes, exercising), while the blog readers tended to do fewer activities (e.g. only 1 of the following: taking notes, eating, only reading). Both groups showed significant improvements in their test scores (Asthma: 22% improvement, Toxicology: 29%; p<0.01 for both), with blog posts demonstrating a larger but non-significant difference (RM-ANOVA, Topic*Modality F(1,59)=0.001, p=0.973). Conclusion: This study suggests that podcasts and blog posts significantly improve medical student knowledge retention to a similar degree, but differ in usage conditions.",

Decrease in knowledge was higher in the radiological questions, compared to the clinical anatomy cases 17.5% (±13.6%) vs. 7.9% (±10.0%), respectively, d=5.17. In both years, male students scored slightly better compared to female students, and decline of knowledge seems somewhat lower in male students (13.1% (±11.1%) vs. 15.5% (±12.0%), respectively), d=-0.21. Anatomical knowledge in the problem-oriented horizontal and vertical integrated medical curriculum, declined by approximately 15% 1.5 year after the initial anatomy course. The loss of knowledge in the present study is relative small compared to previous studies. Anat Sci Educ 10: 242-248. © 2016 American Association of Anatomists.",

    "Abstract": "Previous research has indicated the disconnect between example-based research focusing on worked examples (WEs) and that focusing on modeling examples. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the effect of four different types of examples from the two separate lines of research, including standard WEs, erroneous WEs, expert (masterly) modeling examples, and peer (coping) modeling examples, on student performance (knowledge retention, near transfer, and far transfer), cognitive load, and self-efficacy. One hundred and sixteen students participated in the study by undergoing computer-based instruction in one of the four versions differing in how examples were provided. The results showed that, overall, expert modeling examples were most effective in promoting knowledge retention, near transfer, and far transfer, while peer modeling examples were shown to be superior in fostering self-efficacy among the four different types of examples.",

    "Abstract": "Despite clear evidence that antibiotics do not cure viral infections, the problem of unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics in ambulatory care persists, and in some cases, prescribing patterns have increased. The overuse of antibiotics for treating viral infections has created numerous economic and clinical consequences including increased medical costs due to unnecessary hospitalizations, antibiotic resistance, disruption of gut bacteria, and obesity. Recent research has underscored the importance of collaborative patient-provider communication as a means to reduce the high rates of unnecessary prescriptions for antibiotics. However, most patients and providers do not feel prepared to engage in such challenging conversations. BACKGROUND Despite clear evidence that antibiotics do not cure viral infections, the problem of unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics in ambulatory care persists, and in some cases, prescribing patterns have increased. The overuse of antibiotics for treating viral infections has created numerous economic and clinical consequences including increased medical costs due to unnecessary hospitalizations, antibiotic resistance, disruption of gut bacteria, and obesity. Recent research has underscored the importance of collaborative patient-provider communication as a means to reduce the high rates of unnecessary prescriptions for antibiotics. However, most patients and providers do not feel prepared to engage in such challenging conversations.The aim of this pilot study was to assess the ability of a brief 15-min simulated role-play conversation with virtual humans to serve as a preliminary step to help health care providers and patients practice, and learn how to engage in effective conversations about antibiotics overuse. OBJECTIVES The aim of this pilot study was to assess the ability of a brief 15-min simulated role-play conversation with virtual humans to serve as a preliminary step to help health care providers and patients practice, and learn how to engage in effective conversations about antibiotics overuse.A total of 69 participants (35 providers and 34 patients) completed the simulation once in one sitting. A pre-post repeated measures design was used to assess changes in patients' and providers' self-reported communication behaviors, activation, and preparedness, intention, and confidence to effectively communicate in the patient-provider encounter. Changes in patients' knowledge and beliefs regarding antibiotic use were also evaluated. METHODS A total of 69 participants (35 providers and 34 patients) completed the simulation once in one sitting. A pre-post repeated measures design was used to assess changes in patients' and providers' self-reported communication behaviors, activation, and preparedness, intention, and confidence to effectively communicate in the patient-provider encounter. Changes in patients' knowledge and beliefs regarding antibiotic use were also evaluated.Patients experienced a short-term positive improvement in beliefs about appropriate antibiotic use for infection (F 1,30 =14.10, P=.001). Knowledge scores regarding the correct uses of antibiotics improved immediately postsimulation, but decreased at the 1-month follow-up (F 1,30 =31.16, P .10) Patients with lower levels of activation exhibited positive, short-term benefits in increased intent and confidence to discuss their needs and ask questions in the clinic visit, positive attitudes regarding participation in SDM with their provider, and accurate beliefs about the use of antibiotics (P .10) Patients with lower levels of activation exhibited positive, short-term benefits in increased intent and confidence to discuss their needs and ask questions in the clinic visit, positive attitudes regarding participation in SDM with their provider, and accurate beliefs about the use of antibiotics (P<.10). The results also suggest small immediate gains in providers' attitudes about SDM (mean change 0.20; F1,33= 8.03, P=.01).This pilot study provided preliminary evidence on the efficacy of the use of simulated conversations with virtual humans as a tool to improve patient-provider communication (ie, through increasing patient confidence to actively participate in the visit and physician attitudes about SDM) for engaging in conversations about antibiotic use. Future research should explore if repeated opportunities to use the 15-min simulation as well as providing users with several different conversations to practice with would result in sustained improvements in antibiotics beliefs and knowledge and communication behaviors over time. The results of this pilot study offered several opportunities to improve on the simulation in order to bolster communication skills and knowledge retention. CONCLUSIONS This pilot study provided preliminary evidence on the efficacy of the use of simulated conversations with virtual humans as a tool to improve patient-provider communication (ie, through increasing patient confidence to actively participate in the visit and physician attitudes about SDM) for engaging in conversations about antibiotic use. Future research should explore if repeated opportunities to use the 15-min simulation as well as providing users with several different conversations to practice with would result in sustained improvements in antibiotics beliefs and knowledge and communication behaviors over time.

    "Abstract": "Audience response devices, or \"clickers\", have been used in the education of future healthcare professionals for several years with varying success. They have been reported to improve the learning experience by promoting engagement and knowledge retention. In 2014, our department evaluated the use of \"clickers\" in a newly introduced multidisciplinary approach to teaching large groups of third year medical students clinical cases developed around a microbiology theme. BACKGROUND Audience response devices, or \"clickers\", have been used in the education of future healthcare professionals for several years with varying success. They have been reported to improve the learning experience by promoting engagement and knowledge retention. In 2014, our department evaluated the use of \"clickers\" in a newly introduced multidisciplinary approach to teaching large groups of third year medical students clinical cases developed around a microbiology theme.Six multidisciplinary teaching sessions covering community-acquired pneumonia, tuberculosis, infective endocarditis, peritonitis, bloodstream infection with pyelonephritis and bacterial meningitis were included in the study. Three involved the use of the \"clickers\" and three did not. Consenting undergraduate students attended the designated classes and afterwards answered a short online quiz relating to the session. Students also answered a short questionnaire about the \"clickers\" to gauge their attitudes on the use of these devices. METHODS Six multidisciplinary teaching sessions covering community-acquired pneumonia, tuberculosis, infective endocarditis, peritonitis, bloodstream infection with pyelonephritis and bacterial meningitis were included in the study. Three involved the use of the \"clickers\" and three did not. Consenting undergraduate students attended the designated classes and afterwards answered a short online quiz relating to the session. Students also answered a short questionnaire about the \"clickers\" to gauge their attitudes on the use of these devices.Of 310 students, 294 (94.8%) agreed to participate in the study. Interestingly, the grades of online quizzes after a session where a \"clicker\" was used were slightly lower. Looking only at the grades of students who engaged completely with the process (n = 19), there was no statistical difference to suggest that the devices had a positive or negative impact on knowledge retention. However, student attitudes to using the devices were positive overall. Fifty-five percent strongly agreed and 27% agreed that teaching sessions where the \"clickers\" were used were more engaging. Thirty-four percent strongly agreed and 36% agreed that the \"clickers\" made important concepts more memorable and 54% felt the device enhanced their understanding of the topic being covered. RESULTS Of 310 students, 294 (94.8%) agreed to participate in the study. Interestingly, the grades of online quizzes after a session where a \"clicker\" was used were slightly lower.

    "Abstract": "Spacing of educational material over time has been shown to improve learning efficiency and long-term knowledge retention. We evaluated the impact of adding a spaced education curriculum to a month-long pediatric rotation. OBJECTIVE Spacing of educational material over time has been shown to improve learning efficiency and long-term knowledge retention. We evaluated the impact of adding a spaced education curriculum to a month-long pediatric rotation.This was a randomized controlled educational intervention trial of residents on a rotation in a pediatric emergency department. Participants were randomized to the standard curriculum or the standard curriculum with integrated spaced education. The intervention used an automated platform to electronically deliver questions to user e-mail or mobile devices and provided instant feedback. Our primary outcome was proportion of correctly answered questions following the rotation. Our secondary outcomes included test performance at 3 months, change in clinical confidence, and satisfaction with the spaced learning. Learner opinion of the platform was assessed by postrotation survey. METHODS This was a randomized controlled educational intervention trial of residents on a rotation in a pediatric emergency department.

The intervention used an automated platform to electronically deliver questions to user e-mail or mobile devices and provided instant feedback. Our primary outcome was proportion of correctly answered questions following the rotation. Our secondary outcomes included test performance at 3 months, change in clinical confidence, and satisfaction with the spaced learning. Learner opinion of the platform was assessed by postrotation survey.Of 194 eligible trainees, 122 were enrolled and randomized. A total of 107 of the enrolled residents (88%) completed the immediate postrotation assessment, 48 of whom received spaced education. Sixty residents completed the 3-month follow-up. There were no differences between the control and intervention groups in baseline knowledge. The intervention group performed better than the control group on the postrotation assessment (mean difference = 5.4%, 95% confidence interval = 0.1-10.7) when controlled for didactic attendance and clinical exposure. Change in confidence did not differ between groups. Eighty-seven percent of spaced education learners would participate in a similar model in the future. RESULTS Of 194 eligible trainees, 122 were enrolled and randomized. A total of 107 of the enrolled residents (88%) completed the immediate postrotation assessment, 48 of whom received spaced education. Sixty residents completed the 3-month follow-up.

    "Abstract": "The growing trend of engaging multiple vendors, coupled with the concern over “possible” loss of knowledge in information technology (IT) outsourcing relationships, compels us to investigate organizational learning in multi-vendor outsourcing from a social relation perspective. Social relation has been conceptualized in terms of how organizational relationships with social entities facilitate and/or inhibit organizational learning. In particular, we examine how two different relational structures—single vendor dominant model and multi-vendor dominant model—are associated with two types of organizational learning, namely, exploitative and exploratory. Furthermore, we investigate how three critical dimensions—structural (core vs. non-core functions), affective (partnership vs. transaction), and cognitive (business value vs. IT capability)—in social relation affect the relationships between the two relational structures and the two types of organizational learning in the context of IT outsourcing. The proposed hypotheses were tested using 203 Korean client firms that have adopted the multi-vendor approach in IT outsourcing. Results reveal that the single vendor dominant model exerts a more significant effect on exploitative learning than exploratory learning. By contrast, the multi-vendor dominant model has a more significant effect on the latter than the former. Furthermore, out of the six moderating variables, four (core IT function, non-core IT function, partnership relationship, and transaction relationship) have significant influences on exploitative and exploratory learning. We conclude with theoretical contributions in the area of social relation theory and IT outsourcing literature, and implications for practices on how clients can enhance engagement in exploitative and exploratory learning to reap the benefits of multi-vendor outsourcing.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: PowerPoint (PPT (TM) ) presentation has become an integral part of day-to-day teaching in medicine. Most often, PPT (TM) is used in its default mode which in fact, is known to cause boredom and ineffective learning. Research has shown improved short-term memory by applying multimedia principles for designing and delivering lectures. However, such evidence in medical education is scarce. Therefore, we attempted to evaluate the effect of multimedia principles on enhanced learning of parasitology. Methodology: Second-year medical students received a series of lectures, half of the lectures used traditionally designed PPT (TM) and the rest used slides designed by Mayer's multimedia principles. Students answered pre and post-tests at the end of each lecture (test-I) and an essay test after six months (test-II) which assessed their short and long term knowledge retention respectively. Students' feedback on quality and content of lectures were collected. Results: Statistically significant difference was found between post test scores of traditional and modified lectures (P = 0.019) indicating, improved short-term memory after modified lectures. Similarly, students scored better in test II on the contents learnt through modified lectures indicating, enhanced comprehension and improved long-term memory (P < 0.001). Many students appreciated learning through multimedia designed PPT (TM) and suggested for their continued use. Conclusions: It is time to depart from default PPT (TM) and adopt multimedia principles to enhance comprehension and improve short and long term knowledge retention. Further, medical educators may be trained and encouraged to apply multimedia principles for designing and delivering effective lectures.",

    "Abstract": "The effectiveness of patient education activities conducted within the lenalidomide and thalidomide risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) programs was evaluated by measuring understanding of serious risk and safe-use messages. Results from mandatory knowledge, attitude, and behavior surveys and voluntary patient surveys completed between June 2012 and June 2013 were analyzed, and responses to questions relating to compliance with birth control measures and understanding of safe-use messages are presented by patient risk category. In total, 73,645 patients were enrolled into the REMS programs for lenalidomide and thalidomide and completed mandatory surveys prior to medication dispense. Of these, 2790 (3.8%) completed an additional voluntary survey. Among voluntary survey participants, for all patient pregnancy risk categories, reported compliance with birth control requirements was above 90% when starting therapy and at follow-up. At the beginning of therapy, complete compliance was 96.3%; 3 months later it was 96.4%. Patient understanding of safe-use messages was very high in all pregnancy risk groups, notably for messages repeated at each physician visit. Overall, 98.2% of patients knew that lenalidomide and thalidomide could cause birth defects, which is part of the repeated educational messaging. In contrast, 87.1% recalled that unused product should be returned to their healthcare professional, which is not included in repeated messaging. The lenalidomide and thalidomide REMS programs enhance patient understanding of safe-use messages, resulting in high levels of compliance with the birth control precautions essential to prevent fetal exposure to these known and potential human teratogens. Overall compliance was maintained after 3 months of follow-up and throughout therapy.",

Students answered pre and post-tests at the end of each lecture (test-I) and an essay test after six months (test-II) which assessed their short and long term knowledge retention respectively. Students' feedback on quality and content of lectures were collected.Statistically significant difference was found between post test scores of traditional and modified lectures (P = 0.019) indicating, improved short-term memory after modified lectures. Similarly, students scored better in test II on the contents learnt through modified lectures indicating, enhanced comprehension and improved long-term memory (P < 0.001). Many students appreciated learning through multimedia designed PPT™ and suggested for their continued use. RESULTS Statistically significant difference was found between post test scores of traditional and modified lectures (P = 0.019) indicating, improved short-term memory after modified lectures. Similarly, students scored better in test II on the contents learnt through modified lectures indicating, enhanced comprehension and improved long-term memory (P < 0.001). Many students appreciated learning through multimedia designed PPT™ and suggested for their continued use.It is time to depart from default PPT™ and adopt multimedia principles to enhance comprehension and improve short and long term knowledge retention. Further, medical educators may be trained and encouraged to apply multimedia principles for designing and delivering effective lectures. CONCLUSIONS It is time to depart from default PPT™ and adopt multimedia principles to enhance comprehension and improve short and long term knowledge retention. Further, medical educators may be trained and encouraged to apply multimedia principles for designing and delivering effective lectures.",

    "Abstract": "This study compares the impact of second language (L2) reading and listening on the incidental acquisition and retention of five dimensions of vocabulary knowledge--spoken form, written form, part of speech, syntagmatic association, and form-meaning connection--at the level of recognition (form-meaning connection was measured also at the level of recall). The study also examines the relationship between frequency of word occurrence and vocabulary acquisition through reading versus listening. The participants were 139 pre-intermediate level English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners with Farsi as their first language (L1), who were assigned to two experimental groups (i.e., reading and listening) and one control group. The experimental groups were exposed to the same text containing 16 target words (replaced by 16 non-words). The results on the immediate posttest revealed that readers scored higher than listeners on all five dimensions of word knowledge. Retention scores on a three-week delayed posttest (which due to the presence of testing effects could be measured for only one dimension of vocabulary knowledge, that is, form-meaning connection) were also higher for readers; however, listeners appeared to forget less within three weeks. Moreover, increase in the frequency of word occurrence in the text significantly benefitted incidental vocabulary acquisition through reading, but not through listening.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper intends to propose an approach for formation of the R&D project teams, so that in addition to the selection of the most expert individuals, facilitates the knowledge sharing among people. Design/methodology/approach Mathematical modeling was used to formulate the problem of selecting appropriate members for the project team. As the problem was formulated as a bi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, it was initially transformed from nonlinear to linear problem, and then, the global criterion method was applied to convert the problem into a single-objective problem. To collect the data for exogenous variables, the measurement scales (their validity had been verified in previous research) were adopted. Findings The results of various tests for evaluating the proposed approach in the case study confirmed its effectiveness in selecting the appropriate members of the project team. Practical implications Using the proposed approach, R&D project managers will be able to select the most appropriate members for the project team and, while ensuring the achievement of project objectives, prevent the loss of knowledge gained in the project lifecycle. Originality/value This paper is the first attempt to provide an approach for sharing the knowledge gained by the project team members in the R&D projects.",

    "Abstract": "Recent research highlights the potential benefits of practice without feedback on learner's strategy knowledge. However, most prior work has been conducted in one-on-one settings with short retention intervals. We compared the effects of mathematics practice with and without correct-answer feedback on immediate and 1-week delayed performance in a classroom setting. In a randomized experiment, 243 second- and third-grade children received strategy instruction and then practiced solving relevant problems in small groups within their classroom. During practice, children received immediate feedback (after each problem), summative feedback (after all the problems in the set), or no feedback. During the practice task, immediate feedback led to the best performance. However, practice \"without\" feedback led to higher levels of mastery on the 1-week knowledge retention test. Thus, instructional practices that seem less effective at first can, for some children, ultimately result in more desirable learning.",

    "Abstract": "Previous research has indicated the disconnect between example-based research focusing on worked examples (WEs) and that focusing on modeling examples. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the effect of four different types of examples from the two separate lines of research, including standard WEs, erroneous WEs, expert (masterly) modeling examples, and peer (coping) modeling examples, on student performance (knowledge retention, near transfer, and far transfer), cognitive load, and self-efficacy. One hundred and sixteen students participated in the study by undergoing computer-based instruction in one of the four versions differing in how examples were provided. The results showed that, overall, expert modeling examples were most effective in promoting knowledge retention, near transfer, and far transfer, while peer modeling examples were shown to be superior in fostering self-efficacy among the four different types of examples.

    "Abstract": "To increase patient knowledge about apixaban (Eliquis, Bristol-Myers Squibb) using an educational video delivered in an urban inpatient setting. PURPOSE To increase patient knowledge about apixaban (Eliquis, Bristol-Myers Squibb) using an educational video delivered in an urban inpatient setting.This prospective, quasi-experimental study evaluated knowledge gain and retention in patients receiving apixaban after viewing a short educational video. Knowledge was assessed with a questionnaire immediately before, immediately after, and one month following the educational video. METHODS This prospective, quasi-experimental study evaluated knowledge gain and retention in patients receiving apixaban after viewing a short educational video. Knowledge was assessed with a questionnaire immediately before, immediately after, and one month following the educational video.After 33 patients watched the video, scores increased by 19.7% from the pre-test to the immediate post-test time point (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.5-24.9; P < 0.001). Patients previously receiving apixaban or another anticoagulant were less likely to improve scores compared with new patients ( P < 0.05). Twenty-two of the 33 patients (66.7%) completed the one-month follow-up. No difference in scores from pre-test to one month post-test were noted (6.4%; 95% CI, 1.6-14.5; P = 0.11). RESULTS After 33 patients watched the video, scores increased by 19.7% from the pre-test to the immediate post-test time point (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.5-24.9; P < 0.001). Patients previously receiving apixaban or another anticoagulant were less likely to improve scores compared with new patients (P < 0.05). Twenty-two of the 33 patients (66.7%) completed the one-month follow-up. No difference in scores from pre-test to one month post-test were noted (6.4%; 95% CI, 1.6-14.5; P = 0.11).The apixaban educational video led to improvements in short-term knowledge; however, patients did not retain this knowledge at one month. Future studies should seek ways to improve long-term knowledge retention. CONCLUSION The apixaban educational video led to improvements in short-term knowledge; however, patients did not retain this knowledge at one month. Future studies should seek ways to improve long-term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Recent research highlights the potential benefits of practice without feedback on learner's strategy knowledge. However, most prior work has been conducted in one-on-one settings with short retention intervals. We compared the effects of mathematics practice with and without correct-answer feedback on immediate and 1-week delayed performance in a classroom setting. In a randomized experiment, 243 second- and third-grade children received strategy instruction and then practiced solving relevant problems in small groups within their classroom. During practice, children received immediate feedback (after each problem), summative feedback (after all the problems in the set), or no feedback. During the practice task, immediate feedback led to the best performance. However, practice without feedback led to higher levels of mastery on the 1-week knowledge retention test. Thus, instructional practices that seem less effective at first can, for some children, ultimately result in more desirable learning.",

    "Abstract": "Iron chelation therapy can prevent iron overload for pediatric patients with sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia major; however, adherence is suboptimal. Therefore, we developed an intensive training program (ITP), to improve medication management and disease knowledge. The objectives were to determine feasibility of the ITP and its preliminary impact on adherence, disease knowledge, and health outcomes. Pediatric patients were recruited to participate in the ITP over a 90-day period and were followed for 6 months. The ITP consisted of 3 components: (1) provider-led education modules; (2) patient recording daily videos of at-home medication administration; and (3) provider feedback through video messages through the ITP app. Eleven patients participated (mean=12.4 y). Initially, patients endorsed high satisfaction and ease of use and tracked their medication usage 81% (24 out of 30) of days. At 90 days, adherence rates remained consistent (80%) and disease knowledge retention was high (96%). At 6 months, participants exhibited a clinically relevant decrease in serum ferritin, which trended toward statistical significance (P=0.068). Medication possession ratio did not significantly increase (0.65 to 0.72; not significant). The mobile ITP was feasibly implemented in a clinical setting; in addition, high levels of compliance, disease knowledge retention, and acceptance encourage larger studies evaluating mobile health technology to improve child health parameters.Iron chelation therapy can prevent iron overload for pediatric patients with sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia major; however, adherence is suboptimal.

    "Abstract": "Because reported use of simulation in preclinical basic science courses is limited, the authors describe the design, implementation, and preliminary evaluation of a simulation-based clinical correlation curriculum in an anatomy course for first-year medical students at Perdana University Graduate School of Medicine (in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). PROBLEM Because reported use of simulation in preclinical basic science courses is limited, the authors describe the design, implementation, and preliminary evaluation of a simulation-based clinical correlation curriculum in an anatomy course for first-year medical students at Perdana University Graduate School of Medicine (in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine).The simulation curriculum, with five weekly modules, was a component of a noncadaveric human anatomy course for three classes (n = 81 students) from September 2011 to November 2013. The modules were designed around major anatomical regions (thorax; abdomen and pelvis; lower extremities and back; upper extremities; and head and neck) and used various types of simulation (standardized patients, high-fidelity simulators, and task trainers). Several methods were used to evaluate the curriculum's efficacy, including comparing pre- versus posttest scores and comparing posttest scores against the score on 15 clinical correlation final exam questions. APPROACH The simulation curriculum, with five weekly modules, was a component of a noncadaveric human anatomy course for three classes (n = 81 students) from September 2011 to November 2013. The modules were designed around major anatomical regions (thorax; abdomen and pelvis; lower extremities and back; upper extremities; and head and neck) and used various types of simulation (standardized patients, high-fidelity simulators, and task trainers). Several methods were used to evaluate the curriculum's efficacy, including comparing pre- versus posttest scores and comparing posttest scores against the score on 15 clinical correlation final exam questions.A total of 81 students (response rate: 100%) completed all pre- and posttests and consented to participate. Posttest scores suggest significant knowledge acquisition and better consistency of performance after participation in the curriculum. The comparison of performance on the posttests and final exam suggests that using simulation as an adjunctive pedagogy can lead to excellent short-term knowledge retention. OUTCOMES A total of 81 students (response rate: 100%) completed all pre- and posttests and consented to participate. Posttest scores suggest significant knowledge acquisition and better consistency of performance after participation in the curriculum. The comparison of performance on the posttests and final exam suggests that using simulation as an adjunctive pedagogy can lead to excellent short-term knowledge retention.Simulation-based medical education may prove useful in preclinical basic science curricula. Next steps should be to validate the use of this approach, demonstrate cost-efficacy or the \"return on investment\" for educational and institutional leadership, and examine longer-term knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "The effectiveness of patient education activities conducted within the lenalidomide and thalidomide risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) programs was evaluated by measuring understanding of serious risk and safe-use messages. INTRODUCTION The effectiveness of patient education activities conducted within the lenalidomide and thalidomide risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) programs was evaluated by measuring understanding of serious risk and safe-use messages.Results from mandatory knowledge, attitude, and behavior surveys and voluntary patient surveys completed between June 2012 and June 2013 were analyzed, and responses to questions relating to compliance with birth control measures and understanding of safe-use messages are presented by patient risk category. METHODS Results from mandatory knowledge, attitude, and behavior surveys and voluntary patient surveys completed between June 2012 and June 2013 were analyzed, and responses to questions relating to compliance with birth control measures and understanding of safe-use messages are presented by patient risk category.In total, 73,645 patients were enrolled into the REMS programs for lenalidomide and thalidomide and completed mandatory surveys prior to medication dispense. Of these, 2790 (3.8%) completed an additional voluntary survey. Among voluntary survey participants, for all patient pregnancy risk categories, reported compliance with birth control requirements was above 90% when starting therapy and at follow-up. At the beginning of therapy, complete compliance was 96.3%; 3 months later it was 96.4%. Patient understanding of safe-use messages was very high in all pregnancy risk groups, notably for messages repeated at each physician visit. Overall, 98.2% of patients knew that lenalidomide and thalidomide could cause birth defects, which is part of the repeated educational messaging. In contrast, 87.1% recalled that unused product should be returned to their healthcare professional, which is not included in repeated messaging.

    "Abstract": "Recent research highlights the potential benefits of practice without feedback on learner’s strategy knowledge. However, most prior work has been conducted in one-on-one settings with short retention intervals. We compared the effects of mathematics practice with and without correct-answer feedback on immediate and 1-week delayed performance in a classroom setting. In a randomized experiment, 243 second- and third-grade children received strategy instruction and then practiced solving relevant problems in small groups within their classroom. During practice, children received immediate feedback (after each problem), summative feedback (after all the problems in the set), or no feedback. During the practice task, immediate feedback led to the best performance. However, practice without feedback led to higher levels of mastery on the 1-week knowledge retention test. Thus, instructional practices that seem less effective at first can, for some children, ultimately result in more desirable learning.

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG The progressive loss of knowledge about the use of plants in traditional medicine practices is an issue of major concern with social, economic, and health implications for local communities, especially in developing countries. The Peruvian Amazon is one of the principal scenarios where this phenomenon is occurring at a growing rate. We investigated the case of Piri-Piri (Cyperus articulatus L.), a species of sedge used by native populations of Peru as an antiemetic, an anti-diarrheal, a sedative, an anti-venom, and to treat other symptoms or to conduct ritual practices. In this study, we collected 19 samples of Piri-Piri from different natives' familiar nuclei in four Amazonian villages, and we used the molecular tool DNA barcoding to verify the corrected species identification. The identification performances of four barcode loci (rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA and ITS) were evaluated. RbcL and matK were not able to univocally identify the Piri-Piri samples; however, they indicated that one sample did not match with the expected C. articulatus (local misidentification). This finding was further confirmed at both trnH-psbA and ITS regions. These two loci designated the remaining 18 samples to the correct species, C. articulatus. Based on our results, we propose DNA barcoding as a reliable tool for preserving the genetic identity and the exploitation of Piri-Piri by the local traditional medicine. This universal and fast molecular characterization method should be included in Internet-based Automated Identification Technology systems to enhance the spread of traditional medicine and prevent the erosion of ancient traditional knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG The increasing loss of local ecological knowledge may have negative impacts on the resilience of socio-ecological systems and may also negatively impact bioprospecting efforts, since local ecological knowledge is an important source of information for searching new drugs. Recent studies try to evaluate whether communities are experiencing loss of local ecological knowledge. However, some of them make conclusions which are erroneously based on specific analyses of a single indicator. We propose an integrative analysis of three indicators, namely: number of plants cited by young people and elders, therapeutic choices and people's connectance in terms of medicinal plant learning. The study was carried out in the community of Sucruiuzinho (Bahia, Brazil). We conducted semistructured interviews and a therapeutic recall with 24 local dwellers. We did not find evidence of local ecological knowledge loss in the studied community. Although younger people know fewer plants, they are well connected in terms of knowledge transmission. Moreover, in illness events, young people and adults have similar proportions of choice for plants when compared to allopathy. Concomitant use of the three indicators leads to a more realistic scenario of local ecological knowledge loss than the use of only one of them.",

    "Abstract": "In our medical school, we changed from a lecture-based method to a team-based learning (TBL) method to teach \"polyneuropathies\" in the neurology clerkship starting from the 2014 to 2015 academic year. Real patients were used instead of written scenarios in TBL sessions. This study aimed to compare former lecture-based and the current TBL methods in terms of knowledge retention, in-class learner engagement, and learner reactions. First, we determined in-class engagement and satisfaction of the students for the lectures given in the 2013-2014 academic year. The following year, besides the same criteria, we also determined individual (IRAT) and group readiness test (GRAT) scores in the TBL group. End-of-clerkship exam scores for both groups were recorded. Additionally, opinions of patients about their experiences throughout the TBL process were determined. One year later (2015 for lecture and 2016 for TBL), both groups sat for an MCQ test to determine their knowledge retention levels. We found no difference between groups regarding end-of-clerkship exam scores. The mean knowledge retention test score of the TBL group was significantly higher than that of the lecture group (5.85 1.74 vs. 3.28 1.70). The differences between IRAT, GRAT, and retention test scores in the TBL group were significant. The mean student satisfaction score on a five-point scale was 3.01 0.9 (median 3) in the lecture group and 4.11 1.1 (median 4) in the TBL group. Our results seem encouraging for use of TBL performed with real patients in neurology education to achieve better long-term knowledge retention and higher in-class engagement and student satisfaction.",

    "Abstract": "Compelling interactive stories can be used to get and keep learners' interest in online courses. Interactive storytelling presents information in a manner that involves learners by allowing them to connect with the content. Incorporating interactive storytelling into online education offers the potential to increase student interest and knowledge retention. Interactive storytelling also allows learners to create a personalized experience. By analyzing examples of interactive stories, we identified five features of interactive storytelling: dynamic presentation, data visualization, multisensory media, interactivity, and narration. We explain each feature, and its educational benefits, with illustrations provided from five interactive storytelling examples. We also discuss the implications of interactive storytelling for online course design.",

    "Abstract": "We present the results of an experiment that investigated the effects of stereoscopic 3D viewing on knowledge retention with respect to a spatial interactive task within a serious game that was designed for fire safety training. Participants were trained to identify the safe distance to remain from a (virtual) fire in both stereoscopic 3D and non-stereoscopic 3D contexts. After a 24 h period, they were then tested to determine whether they retained the information that they were taught. Contrary to prior work that suggests stereoscopic 3D has an impact on knowledge retention, our results indicate no significant difference between knowledge retention in a stereoscopic 3D versus a non-stereoscopic 3D interactive environment. Although greater work remains to be done and no firm conclusions can be made regarding the use of stereoscopic 3D, our results have shown that stereoscopic 3D does not always lead to greater performance. Our results have implications for designers of serious games; the discussion and decision to use stereoscopic 3D should be incorporated early in the design phase and there should be some consideration placed on individualized calibration of stereoscopic 3D settings.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of reward type on knowledge contribution behavior. Individual knowledge contribution, which determines the effectiveness of information systems, benefits the organization at the cost of individual advantage as knowledge is usually considered highly private or even a source of individual prestige. Therefore, organizations provide rewards to compensate for their contributors’ knowledge loss. Surprisingly, some scholars report a positive relationship between reward and knowledge contribution, while others find this relationship to be insignificant or even negative. Based on regulatory focus theory, this study proposes and tests that such inconsistencies result from disparity between reward type and knowledge contribution measures. Design/methodology/approach A between-group laboratory experiment with 144 undergraduate student is designed and hierarchical regression is applied to test the hypotheses. Findings An incremental reward (additional reward for attaining outstanding achievements) aroused individual promotion focus, leading to an increase in self-perceived knowledge contribution (self-reported) and knowledge contribution quantity (experiment observers rated), but a decrease in knowledge contribution quality (peer rated). However, a decremental reward (deducted for errors) primed individual prevention focus, leading to an increase in self-perceived knowledge contribution (self-reported) and knowledge contribution quality (peer rated), but a decrease in knowledge contribution quantity (experiment observers rated). Originality/value The findings help explain why previous empirical results on the reward-knowledge contribution relationship were inconsistent and add to extant literature by introducing a new theoretical perspective for understanding motivation in knowledge management research.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this two-year longitudinal study was to examine the performance of veterinary students on exams utilizing crib sheets to determine their effects on exam performance, perceived exam stress, and retention of subject matter knowledge. Scores for individual exams where crib sheets were permitted were compared with exam scores where crib sheets were not permitted utilizing one-sample t-tests. One-sample t-tests were also utilized to determine the influence of crib sheets on subject matter knowledge retention for a cumulative exam. A questionnaire was distributed to capture students' perceptions about the value of crib sheets. Researchers found crib sheet use enhanced student exam performance, but did not improve retention of subject matter knowledge. Results from the questionnaire indicated students perceived crib sheet use as a way decrease exam anxiety and provide support during studying and testing. Disadvantages surfaced by students included that crib sheets could be used as a crutch and could decrease learning. It is recommended that instruction on strategies for use be implemented in any course using crib sheets. Overall, crib sheet use was perceived as positive by students and could be a viable way to combat high levels of anxiety and depression in veterinary students.",

    "Abstract": "We present the results of an experiment that investigated the effects of stereoscopic 3D viewing on knowledge retention with respect to a spatial interactive task within a serious game that was designed for fire safety training. Participants were trained to identify the safe distance to remain from a (virtual) fire in both stereoscopic 3D and non-stereoscopic 3D contexts. After a 24 h period, they were then tested to determine whether they retained the information that they were taught. Contrary to prior work that suggests stereoscopic 3D has an impact on knowledge retention, our results indicate no significant difference between knowledge retention in a stereoscopic 3D versus a non-stereoscopic 3D interactive environment. Although greater work remains to be done and no firm conclusions can be made regarding the use of stereoscopic 3D, our results have shown that stereoscopic 3D does not always lead to greater performance. Our results have implications for designers of serious games; the discussion and decision to use stereoscopic 3D should be incorporated early in the design phase and there should be some consideration placed on individualized calibration of stereoscopic 3D settings.",

    "Abstract": "In our medical school, we changed from a lecture-based method to a team-based learning (TBL) method to teach \"polyneuropathies\" in the neurology clerkship starting from the 2014 to 2015 academic year. Real patients were used instead of written scenarios in TBL sessions. This study aimed to compare former lecture-based and the current TBL methods in terms of knowledge retention, in-class learner engagement, and learner reactions. First, we determined in-class engagement and satisfaction of the students for the lectures given in the 2013-2014 academic year. The following year, besides the same criteria, we also determined individual (IRAT) and group readiness test (GRAT) scores in the TBL group. End-of-clerkship exam scores for both groups were recorded. Additionally, opinions of patients about their experiences throughout the TBL process were determined. One year later (2015 for lecture and 2016 for TBL), both groups sat for an MCQ test to determine their knowledge retention levels. We found no difference between groups regarding end-of-clerkship exam scores. The mean knowledge retention test score of the TBL group was significantly higher than that of the lecture group (5.85 plus or minus 1.74 vs. 3.28 plus or minus 1.70). The differences between IRAT, GRAT, and retention test scores in the TBL group were significant. The mean student satisfaction score on a five-point scale was 3.01 plus or minus 0.9 (median = 3) in the lecture group and 4.11 plus or minus 1.1 (median = 4) in the TBL group. Our results seem encouraging for use of TBL performed with real patients in neurology education to achieve better long-term knowledge retention and higher in-class engagement and student satisfaction.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Older adults with low health literacy are at increased risk of nonadherence, accidental drug exposure, and adverse events. Purpose: This study evaluated older adults' knowledge and awareness of medication safety and poison prevention resources using an interactive educational game compared to a less intensive intervention involving individual review of brochures. Methods: Both groups were given pre- and postintervention surveys to assess change in knowledge. Participants were followed up at 30 days to assess knowledge retention and behavior changes. Results: A total of 101 older adults participated in the study. In the game group, the median improvement in the index score pre- and postintervention was 3, moving from 9 (interquartile range [IQR] 6, 9) to 11 (IQR 9, 12). The brochure group median improvement was 1, moving from 7.5 (IQR 6, 8) to 8 (IQR 5, 10). Comparing postintervention to 30-day follow-up, over 50% of respondents retained the correct responses. Discussion: The interactive game significantly improved knowledge regarding use of child-resistant cap, interpreting a drug facts label, medication list documentation, and who to call for advice. Translation to Health Education Practice: This educational intervention has potential to increase awareness of poison prevention resources and medication safety strategies in older adults with low health literacy.",

Interactive storytelling presents information in a manner that involves learners by allowing them to connect with the content. Incorporating interactive storytelling into online education offers the potential to increase student interest and knowledge retention. Interactive storytelling also allows learners to create a personalized experience. By analyzing examples of interactive stories, we identified five features of interactive storytelling: dynamic presentation, data visualization, multisensory media, interactivity, and narration. We explain each feature, and its educational benefits, with illustrations provided from five interactive storytelling examples. We also discuss the implications of interactive storytelling for online course design.",

PURPOSE Despite the prevalence of oral disease, the subject of oral health historically has been absent from medical education. We have developed an interprofessional curriculum in collaboration with our school of dentistry to teach oral health in the primary care setting to physician assistant (PA) students. The goal was to create and assess the impact of a curricular model that would be adaptable to various academic settings.A blend of classroom, clinical skills lab, observations in the dental clinic, and observed structured clinical examinations was used to teach oral health to first-year (didactic year) PA students. The objectives were created in collaboration between the medical and dental faculties and included topics on general oral health, oral cancer, geriatrics, pediatrics, and fluoride varnish. METHODS A blend of classroom, clinical skills lab, observations in the dental clinic, and observed structured clinical examinations was used to teach oral health to first-year (didactic year) PA students. The objectives were created in collaboration between the medical and dental faculties and included topics on general oral health, oral cancer, geriatrics, pediatrics, and fluoride varnish.A total of 12 hours of instructional time was delivered to 23 students over 3 semesters from 2014 to 2015. Pretesting and posttesting demonstrated long-term knowledge retention that was 14% better than baseline at 8 months (P < .001). Student surveys demonstrated that satisfaction levels were high and that the students felt better prepared and motivated to incorporate oral health into their practice of medicine. Analyses of students' write-ups of the history and the physical examination demonstrated that the students incorporated oral health concepts.

    "Abstract": "In our medical school, we changed from a lecture-based method to a team-based learning (TBL) method to teach \"polyneuropathies\" in the neurology clerkship starting from the 2014 to 2015 academic year.

This study aimed to compare former lecture-based and the current TBL methods in terms of knowledge retention, in-class learner engagement, and learner reactions.

The following year, besides the same criteria, we also determined individual (IRAT) and group readiness test (GRAT) scores in the TBL group. End-of-clerkship exam scores for both groups were recorded. Additionally, opinions of patients about their experiences throughout the TBL process were determined. One year later (2015 for lecture and 2016 for TBL), both groups sat for an MCQ test to determine their knowledge retention levels. We found no difference between groups regarding end-of-clerkship exam scores. The mean knowledge retention test score of the TBL group was significantly higher than that of the lecture group (5.85 ± 1.74 vs. 3.28 ± 1.70). The differences between IRAT, GRAT, and retention test scores in the TBL group were significant. The mean student satisfaction score on a five-point scale was 3.01 ± 0.9 (median = 3) in the lecture group and 4.11 ± 1.1 (median = 4) in the TBL group.

MiHealth is a high-yield, low input program that allows medical students to develop their teaching skills while working in the community to educate adolescents and decreased their risk behaviors. The program resulted in promising trends towards long-term knowledge retention and attitude change in adolescents, and may help mitigate the loss of drive for community service seen as medical students progress through medical school.",

INTRODUCTION Investigators applied simulation to an experimental program that educated, trained, and assessed at-risk, volunteering prisoners on opioid overdose (OD) prevention, recognition, and layperson management with intranasal (IN) naloxone.Consenting inmates were assessed for OD-related experience and knowledge then exposed on-site to standardized didactics and educational DVD (without simulation). Subjects were provided with IN naloxone kits at time of release and scheduled for postrelease assessment. At follow-up, the subjects were evaluated for their performance of layperson opioid OD resuscitative skills during video-recorded simulations. Two investigators independently scored each subject's resuscitative actions with a 21-item checklist; post hoc video reviews were separately completed to adjudicate subjects' interactions for overall benefit or harm. METHODS Consenting inmates were assessed for OD-related experience and knowledge then exposed on-site to standardized didactics and educational DVD (without simulation). Subjects were provided with IN naloxone kits at time of release and scheduled for postrelease assessment. At follow-up, the subjects were evaluated for their performance of layperson opioid OD resuscitative skills during video-recorded simulations. Two investigators independently scored each subject's resuscitative actions with a 21-item checklist; post hoc video reviews were separately completed to adjudicate subjects' interactions for overall benefit or harm.One hundred three prisoners completed the baseline assessment and study intervention and then were prescribed IN naloxone kits. One-month follow-up and simulation data were available for 85 subjects (82.5% of trained recruits) who had been released and resided in the community. Subjects' simulation checklist median score was 12.0 (interquartile range, 11.0-15.0) of 21 total indicated actions. Forty-four participants (51.8%) correctly administered naloxone; 16 additional subjects (18.8%) suboptimally administered naloxone. Nonindicated actions, primarily chest compressions, were observed in 49.4% of simulations. Simulated resuscitative actions by 80 subjects (94.1%) were determined post hoc to be beneficial overall for patients overdosing on opioids.

    "Abstract": "We present ADDSEN middleware as a holistic solution for Adaptive Data processing and dissemination for Drone swarms in urban SENsing. To efficiently process sensed data in the middleware, we have proposed a cyber-physical sensing framework using partially ordered knowledge sharing for distributed knowledge management in drone swarms. A reinforcement learning dissemination strategy is implemented in the framework. ADDSEN uses online learning techniques to adaptively balance the broadcast rate and knowledge loss rate periodically. The learned broadcast rate is adapted by executing state transitions during the process of online learning. A strategy function guides state transitions, incorporating a set of variables to reflect changes in link status. In addition, we design a cooperative dissemination method for the task of balancing storage and energy allocation in drone swarms. We implemented ADDSEN in our cyber-physical sensing framework, and evaluation results show that it can achieve both maximal adaptive data processing and dissemination performance, presenting better results than other commonly used dissemination protocols such as periodic, uniform and neighbor protocols in both single-swarm and multi-swarm cases.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge retention plays an important role in combating organisational knowledge loss. However, some organisations, including mining companies, still lose organisational knowledge due to employees retiring, resigning, downsizing, attrition and so on. This leaves the companies with a shortage of qualified and senior, experienced employees to meet production needs, which has a negative impact on the running of the operational functions on a day-to-day basis. This qualitative study utilised the knowledge-retention model as a theoretical framework to investigate knowledge-retention strategies at a platinum mine in the North West province in South Africa. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 10 employees of the platinum mine in North West province who were chosen purposively, as well as organisational document review. The key findings revealed that although the mine has a knowledge-retention policy, some of the employees are not aware of its existence and there is no enough investment in knowledge-retention initiatives within the organisation. The study concludes by arguing that having knowledge retention policy, strategies and initiatives on paper but failing to implement is as good as not having it. The study recommends that management become involved, support knowledge-retention initiatives, and ensure that knowledge retention policy is implemented in the organisation.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge management (KM) is regarded as a strategic asset and a source of competitive advantage for organisations. While the issues of KM have been widely discussed by many researchers, there is a paucity of studies pertaining to the role of KM in enhancing the performance of universities, especially Ghanaian universities. Similarly, there is the lack of formal strategy that would provide an appropriate framework for these systems to ensure maximum utilisation of available knowledge for competitive advantage. Due to this, Ghanaian universities have been continually reinventing the wheel each time they lose knowledge through expertise leaving the universities. This loss of knowledge through expert staff exiting raises the need to have systems and strategies in place that will help the universities to capture that relevant knowledge. The research thus set out to address these problems by assessing the implementation of KM systems in Ghanaian universities and the strategies that could be adopted to manage and safeguard knowledge as a competitive advantage and for future use. A survey and a mixed method research approach, which encompasses a questionnaire and interview schedules, were used to collect data from the stratified sampled respondents. One hundred and eighteen (80.27%) questionnaires were successfully received from the respondents, while all nine interviewees successfully responded to the interviews. Pattern matching, content analysis and explanation-building were used to analyse the qualitative data. The Microsoft spreadsheet and SPSS software were used to analyse the quantitative data and descriptive statistics in the form of tables, pie charts and histograms were used to present the findings. The findings of this study showed that: the concepts of KM was universally understood by the respondents; KM processes were effective; systems and facilities such as internet, intranet, e-mails, mobile technology and DVD/VCD/CD were used to facilitate KM at the universities; leadership, culture, technologies and strategies were the KM enablers; e-learning, coaching and mentorship, communities of practice, and storytelling were the main strategies used to manage and safeguard knowledge; and KM systems had a positive impact on the universities. The study finally formulated an integrated KM framework to guide the implementation of KM systems in universities.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge management (KM) has become a vital process in all types of institutions in our society, institutions that also include academic libraries. Furthermore, academic libraries have become an integral part of the knowledge system. These institutions and academic libraries contribute to knowledge development in the current digital age. This study sought to investigate knowledge management processes at St Paul’s University library and to suggest ways by which these processes may be enhanced in order to promote efficiency and effectiveness in knowledge management. The study was based on knowledge management processes that include knowledge capture, knowledge acquisition, knowledge organisation, knowledge creation, knowledge retention and knowledge sharing as advanced in existing literature. The context of this study was St. Paul’s University Library, the academic library of St. Paul’s University. St. Paul’s University is an academic institution of higher learning based in Limuru Kenya. St. Paul’s University Library was found to be encountering challenges in the implementation and adoption of formal knowledge management processes such as knowledge creation, knowledge application, knowledge retention, knowledge acquisition, knowledge organisation and knowledge sharing. These challenges affect the library’s ability to manage and disseminate knowledge to its different stakeholders. This research thus set out to address these challenges. This was a case study of St. Paul’s University library which involved the collection of qualitative data from study participants through the use of interview guides. In the study, interviews were used to collect data from 10 library management committee members, 20 faculty staff and 20 library staff. These three groups of study participant were purposively selected as the target population for the study because they play a key role in knowledge management enhancement at St. Paul’s University library. Interviews were conducted for all categories of participants separately through face-to-face interview method based on their pre-determined availability. Out of 50 interviewees, only 32 were successfully interviewed. Qualitative data collected were analysed using content analysis. Findings of this study were then deduced from analysis done. From the study, it emerged that all the knowledge management processes under study were utilised albeit to varied degrees. From the study, varied gaps were noted on the various knowledge management processes and the use of ICT in knowledge management. The study recommends that St. Paul’s University Library should fully incorporate all the knowledge management processes and ensure appropriate policies be in place to support knowledge management and also increase effectiveness and efficiency in the library. The study further recommends a survey study on academic libraries to be undertaken on knowledge management processes in Kenya.",

    "Abstract": "De entre os diversos problemas ambientais que caracterizam a idade contemporânea os do Oceano estão entre os mais preocupantes devido à diversidade e magnitude dos seus impactos. Na verdade estes problemas não são um inconveniente exclusivo dos organismos marinhos mas afectam sim, todas as formas de vida marinha e terrestre que dependem do oceano para a sua subsistência. Os presentes panoramas marinho e terrestre surgem como resultado das actividades humanas e apesar de todos os alertas que têm sido lançados para a consciencialização ambiental oceânica, os comportamentos humanos caminham, na maioria das vezes, numa direcção oposta a estes esforços. Uma vez que os comportamentos possuem uma dupla natureza racional e emocional, baseadas em percepções que levam a interpretações e, por sua vez, a intenções procurou-se clarificar a forma como era representado o oceano. Tendo em conta que o processo de aprendizagem e reconstrução de valores, atitudes e comportamentos exige tempo e trabalho, o foco nas gerações mais jovens é essencial. Para o efeito, no presente estudo, foram seleccionadas 6 escolas de três áreas distintas (Rural, Urbana Recente e Urbana Antiga, dentro de ou próximas de Lisboa). Através de uma visita presencial, foi pedido aos alunos do primeiro ciclo destas escolas que desenhassem aquilo que acreditavam existir no oceano, e as suas criações foram recolhidas e utilizadas como fonte de informação das percepções e conhecimentos prévios. Após um intervalo de aproximadamente duas semanas, 3 das escolas iniciais foram sujeitas a uma pequena sessão educativa sob o formato de PowerPoint e no mesmo dia, imediatamente após a sessão, foi pedido aos seus alunos que elaborassem novamente um desenho com base no mesmo enunciado da primeira visita e recolhidos os seus trabalhos. Esta segunda recolha efectuou-se tanto nas escolas que participaram na sessão, como também nas restantes. As 3 escolas que não assistiram a qualquer apresentação funcionaram como controlo para termos de comparação. A apresentação incidiu sobre dois tópicos essenciais, um natural e descritivo das características do oceano e de todos os seus atributos e um antropocêntrico, referente aos impactos a relação entre o Homem e o oceano. Com a análise dos desenhos correspondentes às duas visitas pretendeu-se averiguar o sucesso da transmissão e captação de conhecimentos, confirmado pela representação de novos elementos na segunda visita, e este sucesso mostrou-se evidente nas turmas submetidas à sessão educativa. Este trabalho detectou pequenas tendências em alguns dos elementos desenhados pelos géneros e registou também pequenas diferenças entre as áreas urbanas e rural. Dos temas abordados durante a apresentação, aquele cujo impacto nos desenhos das crianças registou maiores diferenças entre visitas foi o do lixo marinho. As crianças revelaram ter uma elevada sensibilidade para com os temas ambientais e comprovaram que abordagens visuais de causa-efeito produzem resultados imediatos numa fase precoce da idade. Alternate abstract: Among the various environmental problems that characterize the contemporary age, those concerning the ocean are among the most concerning due to the diversity and magnitude of its impacts. In fact, these problems are not only an inconvenience for marine organisms but they affect all forms of marine and terrestrial life that depend on the ocean for their subsistence. The present seascape and landscape emerges as a result of human activities, and despite all the warnings that have been raised for ocean environmental awareness, human behaviours are often towards the opposite direction of these efforts. Since the behaviors are under a dual rational and emotional nature, based on perceptions that lead to interpretations and intentions, it was sought to clarify the way the ocean was seen and represented. Since the process of learning and rebuilding values, attitudes, and behaviors takes time and work, a focus on the younger generation is essential. With this scope, in the present study, six schools of three distinct areas were selected (countryside, urban recent and urban old areas, within or nearby Lisbon). Through a in person visit, students in the first cycle of these schools were asked to draw what they believed existed in the ocean, and their creations were collected and used as a source of information on perceptions and previous knowledge. After an interval of approximately two weeks, 3 of the initial schools were subjected to a small educational session in PowerPoint format and on the same day, immediately after the session, their students were asked to produce a drawing based on the same principle from first visit and their work was collected. This second collection took place both in the schools participating in the session and in the others. The 3 schools that did not attend any presentation functioned as controls for terms of comparison. The presentation focused on two essential topics, a natural and descriptive of the characteristics of the ocean and all its attributes and an anthropocentric one, concerning the impacts of the relation between mankind and the ocean. The analysis of the drawings corresponding to the two visits was intended to verify the success of the transmission and knowledge retention, confirmed by the representation of new elements in the second visit, and this success was evident in the classes submitted to the training session. This work detected small trends in some elements drawn by the genders and also revealed small differences between urban and rural areas. Of the topics covered during the presentation, the one whose impact on children's drawings recorded the greatest differences between visits was marine litter.

    "Abstract": "While scholars recognize that digital technology is a major tool employed by contemporary learners to access knowledge, its full capacity is yet to be utilized. This paper investigates opportunities to increase individual learning engagement and knowledge retention in higher education and corporate environments through integrating educational content with innovative digital technology. Currently, within commonly adopted e-learning platforms, the most utilized online content delivery and student progress assessment tools in leadership education appear to be discussion-based instruction, along with written assignments, and research projects (Jenkins, 2016). To inform leadership educators’ choice in innovative tools for increased effectiveness of instruction, this paper shares an experience of delivering integrated global leadership education pedagogical content (i.e., cross-cultural competency instruction for graduate management class at a U.S.-based public university) within a gamified real-time multiuser learning platform— MyAltis —and discusses implications for leadership education.",

    "Abstract": "Problem-based Learning (PBL) is one of the most effective methods of instruction that helps Visual Effects (VFX) students to be more adaptable at encountering career challenges in Malaysia. These challenges are; lack of several important requirements such as, the basic and fundamental knowledge of VFX concepts, the ability to understand real-world problems and to convert ideas into VFX solutions, the ability to attain and retain up-to-date knowledge of VFX concepts, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to come up with solutions to real-world problems. Its role in helping students; thus, encompasses improving the level of meaningfulness of their learning experience, and their skills in terms of comprehension, knowledge retention, problem-solving, self-directed learning, as well as interpersonal skills. The use of PBL helps VFX students to cope with the encounters of the career challenges in Malaysia that may be enhanced by focusing on a faculty-wide approach as compared to applying it on a course at a time. Moreover, such methods of enhancing VFX education delivery in Malaysia are to encourage reflective practices and PBL based dialogues on VFX, and to increase the level of VFX competence of instructors through improved training methods.",

    "Abstract": "This article discusses how leakage of knowledge can occur in value creation networks embedded in knowledge-intensive firms, and how a collaborative approach can be utilized to minimize risk and increase sustainability. For knowledge to be preserved from unintentional outflow, its confidential nature and description must be understood at all levels. Loss of knowledge can occur at any point; whether it is through the process of consultation or when employees do their work. Forfeiture of information can be unintended or a planned effort. To prevent such unintended leakage, it is important to develop a shared mindset among employees to minimize the risk. The socio-technical system design is a philosophical framework that enables companies to simultaneously consider both ethical and technical systems in order to best match the technology and the people involved. History has shown through a number of situations that firms that failed to comprehend new opportunities were often limited by stakeholders' thoughts and actions.",

Results: Most medical students preferred the BIL approach over TT with respect to 'practically applying basic sciences to a patient case' and 'knowledge retention in the subject' (53% versus 30%, and 51% versus 35%, respectively). However, most medical students preferred TT with respect to 'level of interaction with other students and lecturers while reviewing teaching materials' (78% versus 11%), 'overall enjoyment of learning' (54% versus 32%), and 'understanding the lecture content faster' (49% versus 39%). Focus groups identified what did and did not work with the BIL approach and brain-stormed specific improvement strategies.

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to increase our understanding of how SMEs retain critical knowledge. Against the background of the underdeveloped body of knowledge regarding knowledge retention, the authors selected an explorative (qualitative) research approach. More precisely, they conducted semi-structured interviews with organization members (i.e. executive and regular staff) of five Austrian SMEs operating in the building and construction industry. This study provides fresh insights into knowledge retention in SMEs. The findings advance the limited understanding of knowledge retention in general and regarding SMEs. They also contribute to the further development of the study of knowledge management in the building and construction sector. Based on the study's findings the authors derive suitable measures to better manage the process of knowledge retention in SMEs. These measures may be useful for SMEs operating in other industries as well.",

    "Abstract": "Introdução: Nos últimos anos, os métodos de aprendizagem ativa têm ganho especial atenção na prática do ensino da Medicina, tendo também Portugal apostado na sua aplicação. Com a criação da Faculdade de Ciências da Saúde da Universidade da Beira Interior, investiu-se numa metodologia que substitui o sistema de ensino “tradicional” por um sistema de ensino integrado, segundo a metodologia de aprendizagem por problemas ( problem-based learning ). Com o intuito de atuar na vertente prática do ensino pré-graduado, surge o Laboratório de Competências, inserido na Faculdade de Ciências da Saúde, utilizando métodos como, por exemplo, a simulação. Assim, este estudo pretende avaliar o impacto destes métodos na retenção de conhecimentos e no grau de satisfação, a fim de adaptar as metodologias de ensino aos estilos de aprendizagem dos alunos. Materiais e métodos: Investigação realizada com 17 de 30 alunos voluntários do 3ºano do Mestrado Integrado em Medicina, divididos entre sessões de simulação de alta-fidelidade e discussão de casos clínicos em formato problem-based learning , acerca de sépsis. Foi feita a avaliação da retenção de conhecimentos através de um pré-teste e de um pós-teste (um mês após as sessões) através de um questionário de 10 perguntas e o grau de satisfação por um questionário avaliando 3 domínios (nível de realismo, qualidade de instrução e satisfação geral). A análise estatística foi feita através do software Statistical Package for Social Sciences versão 24.0® e do Microsoft Excel ®. Resultados: Todos os alunos melhoraram as suas classificações no teste de retenção, sendo este aumento significativo para ambas as condições. O aumento das classificações segundo o método problem-based learning foi maior em relação à simulação (41,0 > 35,5, p-value >0,05), portanto os alunos sujeitos a simulação de alta-fidelidade não apresentam uma retenção de conhecimentos superior aos alunos sujeitos a sessões de casos clínicos em formato problem-based learning . Para ambos os métodos, o grau de satisfação foi elevado, contudo a simulação de alta-fidelidade não se mostrou superior comparativamente às sessões de casos clínicos em formato problem-based learning. Conclusões: A simulação de alta-fidelidade acarreta custos elevados, devido aos vários recursos utilizados, devendo por isso ser utilizada apenas quando as evidências demonstrarem que é superior a outras metodologias e cuja eficácia permite atingir os objetivos de aprendizagem. Para isso, a escolha das metodologias deve ser sustentada em estudos científicos e na experiência dos docentes nelas envolvidos, para que o currículo contemple o estilo de aprendizagem dos alunos. Alternate abstract: Introduction: In recent years, active learning methods have gained special attention in the practice of medical education, and Portugal has also focused on its application. With the creation of the Faculty of Health Sciences of University of Beira Interior, research is being carried out on a methodology that replaces the \"traditional\" teaching system with an integrated teaching system. With the intention of acting in the practical aspect of under-graduate education, the Laboratório de Competências , inserted in the Faculty of Health Sciences, is introduced, using methods such as simulation. Thus, this study intends to evaluate the impact of these methods on the knowledge retention and on the degree of satisfaction, to elaborate a curriculum as suitable as possible. Materials and methods: Research performed with 17 of 30 volunteer students from the 3rd year of medical school, divided between high-fidelity simulation sessions and discussion of clinical cases in problem-based learning format, about sepsis. The evaluation of retention was carried out in two phases - before and one month later - through a questionnaire of 10 questions and the degree of satisfaction by a questionnaire evaluating 3 domains (level of realism, quality of instruction and general satisfaction). Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software version 24.0® and Microsoft Excel®. Results: All students improved their scores in the retention test, where the improvement was significant for both conditions. The increase in classifications based on the problem-based learning method was higher in relation to the simulation, so students who participated in high fidelity simulation did not have a higher knowledge retention compared to students who participated in clinical case sessions in problem-based learning format. For both methods, the degree of satisfaction was high, so the high-fidelity simulation did not prove superior when compared to clinical case sessions in problem-based learning method format. Conclusions: High-fidelity simulation entails high costs due to the various resources used and should only be used when the evidence shows that it is superior to other methodologies and whose effectiveness allows the attainment of the learning objectives. Thus, the choice of methodologies should be supported by scientific studies and the experience of the teachers involved, so that the curriculum contemplates the students' learning style.",

    "Abstract": "Nos últimos anos a reabilitação de edifícios antigos em Portugal começa a ter relevância no volume de negócios do setor da construção civil. Nas últimas décadas o setor focou-se e vocacionou-se para a construção de edifícios novos, que conduziu ao abandono dos edifícios antigos, considerados como obsoletos e desadequados às exigências da sociedade contemporânea. O abandono dos edifícios antigos conduziu à degradação dos centros das cidades, em particular das zonas históricas, à redução das relações socioeconómicas e perda de valor patrimonial. Tornou-se senso comum entre a maioria dos agentes intervenientes no setor, que a reabilitação de edifícios antigos era dispendiosa, com dificuldade extrema em satisfazer as atuais exigências de mercado e que o ideal seria demolir para construir de novo. O paradigma tem-se vindo a alterar nos últimos anos, fruto do forte incentivo por parte do poder político, do crescente aumento de interesse da sociedade em manter a identidade das cidades e do seu património edificado e da pressão turística que se vem sentido nos últimos anos. O desafio, porém, mantêm-se difícil e concretizar pela perda de conhecimento de técnicas antigas de construção e da falta de pessoal com formação adequada à natureza própria dos trabalhos de reabilitação. Com o presente projeto pretende-se demonstrar que, embora seja um processo complexo, sujeito a variáveis imprevisíveis tais como, o real estado do edifício quando sujeito à intrusão que o processo de obra implica, a reabilitação de um edifício pode conduzir ao sucesso do empreendimento. Para tal é necessário que a sua viabilidade seja estudada com base em diagnósticos aprofundados do real estado do edifício e em estudos de mercado nas áreas da construção, comercialização ou exploração do empreendimento. Outro aspeto de extrema importância que se pretende demonstrar, é a importância da elaboração de projetos pensados em sintonia entre os projetistas intervenientes. Uma boa coordenação em projeto, permite a previsão da ocorrência de incompatibilidades entre as diversas especialidades e tomada de medidas de resolução. Pretende-se também elaborar peças desenhadas que permitam leitura clara e esclarecedora por parte dos executantes da obra de reabilitação, quanto à constituição dos materiais e forma de execução. Alternate abstract: In recent years the rehabilitation of old buildings in Portugal begins to have relevance in the turnover of the construction sector. In the last decades, the sector focused and it was directed to the construction of new buildings, which led to the abandonment of old buildings, considered obsolete and inadequate to the demands of contemporary society. The abandonment of old buildings led to the degradation of city centres, in particular historical areas, the reduction of socio-economic relations and loss of asset value. It has become common sense among most stakeholders involved in the industry that the rehabilitation of old buildings was costly, with extreme difficulty in meeting the current market demands and that the ideal would be to demolish to build again. The paradigm has changed in the last years, as a result of the strong incentive on the part of the political power and the increasing interest of society in maintaining the identity of the cities and their built patrimony and the tourist pressure of the past years. However, the challenge remains difficult to achieve by the loss of knowledge of old construction techniques and the lack of trained personnel to do the rehabilitation work. With the present project it is intend to demonstrate that, although it is a complex process, susceptible of unforeseeable variables such as the real state of the building when subject to the intrusion that the work process implies, the rehabilitation of a building can lead to the success of the enterprise. In order to do this, it is necessary to study its sustainability based on in-depth diagnoses of the real state of the building and market studies of construction areas, commercialization or exploitation of the enterprise. Another aspect of extreme significance is the importance of the elaboration of projects designed in harmony with stakeholders. A good coordination in design allows the prediction of the occurrence of incompatibilities between the different projects and measures of resolution. It is also intended to elaborate pieces that allow a clear and enlightening reading through the performers of the rehabilitation work, as to the constitution of the materials and form of execution.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Despite clear evidence that antibiotics do not cure viral infections, the problem of unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics in ambulatory care persists, and in some cases, prescribing patterns have increased. The overuse of antibiotics for treating viral infections has created numerous economic and clinical consequences including increased medical costs due to unnecessary hospitalizations, antibiotic resistance, disruption of gut bacteria, and obesity. Recent research has underscored the importance of collaborative patient-provider communication as a means to reduce the high rates of unnecessary prescriptions for antibiotics. However, most patients and providers do not feel prepared to engage in such challenging conversations. Objectives: The aim of this pilot study was to assess the ability of a brief 15-min simulated role-play conversation with virtual humans to serve as a preliminary step to help health care providers and patients practice, and learn how to engage in effective conversations about antibiotics overuse. Methods: A total of 69 participants (35 providers and 34 patients) completed the simulation once in one sitting. A pre-post repeated measures design was used to assess changes in patients’ and providers’ self-reported communication behaviors, activation, and preparedness, intention, and confidence to effectively communicate in the patient-provider encounter. Changes in patients’ knowledge and beliefs regarding antibiotic use were also evaluated. Results: Patients experienced a short-term positive improvement in beliefs about appropriate antibiotic use for infection ( F 1,30 =14.10, P =.001). Knowledge scores regarding the correct uses of antibiotics improved immediately postsimulation, but decreased at the 1-month follow-up ( F 1,30 =31.16, P .10) Patients with lower levels of activation exhibited positive, short-term benefits in increased intent and confidence to discuss their needs and ask questions in the clinic visit, positive attitudes regarding participation in SDM with their provider, and accurate beliefs about the use of antibiotics ( P <.10). The results also suggest small immediate gains in providers’ attitudes about SDM (mean change 0.20; F 1,33 = 8.03, P =.01). Conclusions: This pilot study provided preliminary evidence on the efficacy of the use of simulated conversations with virtual humans as a tool to improve patient-provider communication (ie, through increasing patient confidence to actively participate in the visit and physician attitudes about SDM) for engaging in conversations about antibiotic use. Future research should explore if repeated opportunities to use the 15-min simulation as well as providing users with several different conversations to practice with would result in sustained improvements in antibiotics beliefs and knowledge and communication behaviors over time. The results of this pilot study offered several opportunities to improve on the simulation in order to bolster communication skills and knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "The importance of self-regulated learning (SRL) during studying has been heavily researched. Yet, self-report and lab-based designs limit our understanding of how students regulate their learning during authentic study tasks. Recently, calls have been made to further examine how students self-regulate during studying through the use of trace data on real learning content. Additionally, research on study tactics and strategies suggests learners can benefit from utilizing certain tactics over others, with relations to improved knowledge retention and positive academic outcomes. In this dissertation, we first conduct a comprehensive literature review that identifies and defines common terminology within the study domain. Through the defining of terms, a taxonomy is proposed that assists in synthesizing prior research. Additionally, two key frameworks (SRL and approaches to learning) commonly used to investigate studying are discussed. Suggestions for advancing the field include: adhering to defined study terms; matching measurement types to study terms; and utilizing trace-based data to capture self-regulated learning in authentic learning environments. Based on our literature review, two manuscripts are presented that aim to address these gaps. The first manuscript builds on prior research in SRL and proposes the design of a mobile application with the goal of supporting SRL in authentic learning environments. The second manuscript empirically tests the impact of the mobile app on students' self-regulation, study tactic and strategy use using self-report, log-files, and open response data. Results suggest the mobile app is effective at encouraging self-regulation of study behaviors and increases study tactic use. The findings have implications for using a mobile platform to investigate and support informal learning in higher education. Alternate abstract: De nombreuses recherches démontrent l'importance de l'apprentissage autorégulé (AAR) lors d'une séance d'étude. Pourtant, l'utilisation de mesures auto-rapportées ainsi que des recherches menées en laboratoire limitent notre compréhension de la façon dont les étudiants régulent leur apprentissage lors de séances d'étude authentiques. Récemment, des chercheurs ont demandé à ce que l'on examine de plus près la manière dont les étudiants autorégulent leurs séances d'étude à l'aide de données sous forme de traces et de matériel d'étude authentique. En outre, la recherche sur les tactiques et stratégies d'étude des étudiants suggère que certaines tactiques sont plus bénéfiques à l'apprentissage que d'autres, et suggère l'existence de relations significatives entre ces tactiques et l'amélioration de connaissances et des résultats scolaires positifs. Cette thèse comporte d'abord une recension exhaustive des écrits nous permettant d'identifier et de définir une terminologie commune au domaine de l'étude. Une taxonomie est ensuite proposée dans le but de synthétiser les recherches existantes. Puis, les deux cadres conceptuels ayant guidés cette thèse (l'AAR et les approches d'apprentissage) sont présentés. Dans l'optique de faire avancer la recherche dans le domaine, des suggestions sont émises, incluant: le nécessité d'adhérer à une terminologie définie, employer des mesures correspondant aux termes utilisés et utiliser des données sous forme de traces pour capturer l'apprentissage autorégulé dans des environnements d'apprentissage authentiques. En s'appuyant sur la littérature recensée, nous présentons deux articles visant à remédier à ces lacunes. Le premier article s'appuie sur des recherches antérieures sur l'AAR et propose la conception d'une application mobile dans le but de soutenir l'AAR dans des environnements d'apprentissage authentiques. Le deuxième article présente une étude où sont testés l'impact de l'application mobile sur l'autorégulation des étudiants et l'utilisation des tactiques et stratégies d'étude. Des mesures auto-rapportées, des fichiers journaux et des données provenant de réponses à des questions ouvertes sont employés. Les résultats suggèrent que l'application mobile est efficace pour encourager l'autorégulation des comportements à l'étude ainsi qu'une augmentation de l'utilisation des tactiques d'étude. Les implications de ces résultats pour l'utilisation d'une plateforme mobile pour étudier et soutenir l'apprentissage informel en enseignement supérieur sont discutés.",

    "Abstract": "Medical students require a strong foundation in normal histology. However, current trends in medical school curricula have diminished time devoted to histology. Thus, there is a need for more efficient methods of teaching histology. We have developed a novel software program (Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource; https://pcs-webtest0.pathology.washington.edu/academics/pattern/) that uses annotated whole slide images to teach normal histology. Whole slide images of a wide variety of tissues were annotated by a trainee and validated by an experienced pathologist. Still images were extracted and transferred to the Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource web application. In Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource, an image was displayed briefly and the user was forced to identify the tissue type. The display time changed inversely based on cumulative accuracy to challenge the user and maintain engagement. A total of 129 second-year medical students completed the 30-minute Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource module. Surveys showed an increase in confidence from premodule (0% extremely confident, 4% very, 47% somewhat, and 49% not) to postmodule (9% extremely confident, 57% very, 32% somewhat, and 2% not), P < .0001. Accuracy increased from 72.6% pretest to 95.7% posttest, P < .002. The effect size (Cohen d = 2.30) was very large, where 0.2 is a small effect, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large. Ninety-six percent of students would recommend Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource to other medical students, and 98% would use Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource to further enhance their histology knowledge. Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource drastically improved medical student accuracy in classifying normal histology and improved confidence. Additional study is needed to determine knowledge retention, but Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource has great potential for efficient teaching of histology given the curriculum time constraints in medical education.",

    "Abstract": "Competitive advantage does not depend solely on the creation and storage of existing and new knowledge. Rather, it requires sustained exploitation and production. The challenge becomes driven towards maintaining some mechanisms to help in producing new, and sharing existing knowledge. Harnessing the power of managing and sharing knowledge enabled companies like Apple and IBM to gain competitive advantage over their competitors. While such challenges have been closely examined in the extant literature, the context of knowledge management and sharing in higher education institutions (HEI) has only been lightly considered. However, considering the highly unique features of HEIs context in terms of autonomy, climate, distinct leadership and role of academics as knowledge workers, it can be argued that examining knowledge-sharing in the context of higher education is greatly needed. The literature has shown fragmented nature of examining academics' KS determinants in contemporary research. Thus, the need to comprehensively examine those influencers is essential. This thesis seeks to address the research gaps and contribute to the literature by asking What antecedents influence the process of knowledge-sharing (KS) between academics in HEIs, and how can the process of KS in HEIs be improved? Through the use of a quantitative research methodology, the research has developed eleven hypotheses to investigate the above-mentioned question. The findings in this study revealed to a very great extent that academics themselves can contribute towards influencing knowledge production and management, and determine the levels to which the universities will be able to share knowledge internally. The research reveals that organizational factors (affiliation, innovativeness, fairness represented by organizational climate and HEI leadership) were stronger predictors of academics' knowledge-sharing than individual (perceived loss of knowledge power, knowledge self-efficacy, perceived reciprocal benefits and trust) or technological ones.",

    "Abstract": "A good understanding of nutrition concepts enables a person to convert basic knowledge into the ability to take action. At the time of this study a game testing nutrition education concepts in English among isiZulu speaking learners had not been investigated. The objective of the study was to determine the effectiveness of an English Food-Based Dietary Guideline (FBDG) nutrition education game on the retention of nutrition knowledge among isiZulu speaking learners. An intervention using a pre-test post-test design. A five part questionnaire was administered to determine levels of nutrition knowledge before and six weeks after a nutrition education board game intervention. A total of 169 Grade 5 learners from two schools in Sweetwaters, KwaZulu-Natal, participated in this study. Baseline results showed that the learners had very poor knowledge of the basic FBDG. The question regarding the food fortification logo showed most improvement overall, with statistical significance ( p = 0.000). The pictorial representation of information in the game helped the learners improve their knowledge retention for certain questions. While there was very little improvement in the retention of knowledge as a whole, the control group experienced a significant increase in their post-test knowledge score ( p = 0.011). Poor English proficiency may have influenced the effectiveness of the intervention. Nutrition education games have the potential to improve nutrition knowledge. Priority should be given to increasing English language proficiency among isiZulu speaking learners to improve their ability to retain nutrition information taught at school.",

    "Abstract": "By the year 2025, 75% of the workforce will consist of Generation Y (Kim, 2017). With the major shift in the workforce, organizations must consider the different learning styles and expectations of the Y generation, as compared to the previous, dominant generations (Tulgan, 2009). In order to determine if there is a difference in short-term and long-term retention levels when deploying two different modalities of training within an organizational training program specific to the Y Generation, a quantitative quasi-experimental study was used. The study consisted of 40 subjects who were administered pretest, immediate post and long-term posttests in conjunction with a training module. The findings from this study demonstrate that although knowledge retention decreases over time, knowledge retention scores were higher on the short-term assessments compared to the scores on the long-term assessments. However, there was a sharper decline in knowledge retention among employees who participated in computer-based training compared to employees who participated in face-to-face training. Based on these findings, all null hypotheses can be rejected. In sum, these findings provide support for the use of face-to-face training modalities for employees who fall within Generation Y. The results support the need for training programs to use face-to-face training modalities for employees who fall within Generation Y. Despite exciting new technology, it can be stated that computers should not replace classrooms and teachers, for training purposes, in the immediate future.

    "Abstract": "Introduction Community health workers (CHWs) are increasingly being tasked to prevent and manage cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors in underserved populations in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs); however, little is known about the required training necessary for them to accomplish their role. This review aimed to evaluate the training of CHWs for the prevention and management of CVD and its risk factors in LMICs. Methods A search strategy was developed in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, and five electronic databases (Medline, Global Health, ERIC, EMBASE and CINAHL) were searched to identify peer-reviewed studies published until December 2016 on the training of CHWs for prevention or control of CVD and its risk factors in LMICs. Study characteristics were extracted using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and quality assessed using Effective Public Health Practice Project’s Quality Assessment Tool. The search, data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two researchers. Results The search generated 928 articles of which 8 were included in the review. One study was a randomised controlled trial, while the remaining were before–after intervention studies. The training methods included classroom lectures, interactive lessons, e-learning and online support and group discussions or a mix of two or more. All the studies showed improved knowledge level post-training, and two studies demonstrated knowledge retention 6 months after the intervention. Conclusion The results of the eight included studies suggest that CHWs can be trained effectively for CVD prevention and management. However, the effectiveness of CHW trainings would likely vary depending on context given the differences between studies (eg, CHW demographics, settings and training programmes) and the weak quality of six of the eight studies. Well-conducted mixed-methods studies are needed to provide reliable evidence about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of training programmes for CHWs.",

This case study aims to highlight the criteria for imputability of PTAPI to a cranial trauma as well as the specific principles of legal redress in relation to this disease. We conducted a forensic study of a patient with diagnosed PTAPI followed up in the Division of Endocrinology and Legal Medicine at the University Hospital, Sousse (Tunisia). The patient included in the study was a 45-year old woman with no particular past medical history. (6 gynaecological procedures, 4 parities and 2 abortions) having regular menstrual cycles, without a history of hemorrhagic childbirth, who had been involved in a road accident (pedestrian got hit by a car) causing occipital trauma without initial knowledge loss. She developed hypothyroidism three years after the accident. The hormonal assessment showed the involvement of all the other axes. Neuroradiological examination objectified pituitary gland and pituitary stalk integrity. The definitive diagnosis of PTAPI was made. Medical examination (performed 4 years after the accident) concluded that PTAPI was imputable to the accident. Permanent partial disability rate according to ordinary law has been assessed at 25%. PTAPI diagnosis is made by elimination. The evaluation of physical injury should be based on residual symptoms, on therapeutic constraints and on its impact on daily and professional activity. Patient's evolution under hormone replacement therapy is often favorable, however, complications may occur, hence the necessity to establish these complications in order to preserve the right of the patient to underwent new treatments.Post-traumatic anterior pituitary insufficiency (PTAPI) is a rare but established disease caused by ischemic lesions after severe cranial trauma.

    "Abstract": "Chronic stress is a major problem in organisations and police are at particular risk due to regular exposure to traumatic stressors on the job. This research was initiated by the New South Wales Police Force (NSWPF) to address this problem. It focuses on the development and evaluation of resilience-training programs. Resilience training aims to equip participants with coping skills that can help them to “bounce back from adversity” and be resilient. Key research questions included: Can a brief training course enhance the long-term resilience of police recruits and prevent future psychological injuries? What is the most appropriate resilience training design? What factors are related to better outcomes for resilience training? Drawing on a broad literature review covering stress, policing, coping, emotion regulation, developmental psychopathology and occupational health psychology, we designed a resilience-training program that was universal (to be provided to all officers), preventative (designed to prevent future injuries), and targeted to address transdiagnostic factors that were related to the development of a range of stress-related pathology (especially PTSD and depression). The program was informed by an understanding of risk and protective mechanisms that shape the impact of stressors together with the literature on stress interventions. In order to reduce experiential avoidance and promote coping flexibility, the program incorporated content from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The research program involved three studies. Studies 1 and 2 were conducted with recruits at the NSWPF Academy while study 3 was conducted with 3rd year psychology students. The program design was updated between the studies to address issues that were identified, and to explore study-specific hypotheses. In line with the existing literature, in study 1 we found that the targeted mechanisms of change accounted for a large amount of variance in the mental health outcome measures indicating that the intervention was directed at important factors that serve to build resilience. However, findings of high levels of attrition, poor training engagement and poor knowledge retention demonstrated problems with training transfer. Program changes were made to address these problems in study 2, with an emphasis on motivating practice through coaching calls and a focus on stages of change. Key findings were that participants who practised the skills during the coaching period experienced significant reductions in stress, t(14) = 3.25, p < .01, PTSD symptoms, t(14) = 2.46, p < .05, and a significant increase in mindfulness, t(14) = -3.05, p < .01. Study 3 built on studies 1 and 2 with a particular focus on homework, stages of change and the replacement of coaching calls with performance aids (in the form of both a Smartphone App and traditional workbook). There were some promising findings, with improvements across time, including a reduction in experiential avoidance, t(53) = -2.01, p = .05, and increases in values progress, t(53) = 2.06, p < .05, and instrumental support , t(53) = 2.09, p < .05. The participants’ change pathway was found to significantly moderate the impact of the training program on practice amount, F(2,49) = 7.17, p < .05, anxiety, F(2, 49) = 4.04, p < .05, perceived stress, F(2,49) = 3.95, p < .05, resilience, F(2,49) = 6.05, p < .01, values progress, F(2,49) = 4.10, p < .05, with the biggest improvements in wellbeing mainly found for participants who were already in an action stage of change for stress management, followed by participants who moved into progress. While practice method was not found to impact on well-being scores, it was found to impact practice quality, t(35.11) = -2.65, p < .05. In conclusion, it appears as if a brief training course can have positive outcomes but more work needs to be done to investigate long-term resilience; the resilience training design needs to be focused on the core constructs of coping and emotion regulation, protective mechanisms and training transfer; and better outcomes are achieved when the training motivates participants to progress along the stages of change and practice the skills. While there is more work to be done the research outlined in this thesis has contributed to moving resilience training forward.",

    "Abstract": "The orchid species richness of Sichuan Province is second highest in China, but price speculation and overharvest have led to significant population collapses in recent years. Though the integral link between biological and cultural diversity is well documented, understanding of the cultural impact of biological extinction events is limited. This dissertation tested the hypothesis that the loss of biodiversity results in an associated loss of cultural knowledge in relation to the orchid biocultural diversity in Sichuan. It was divided into four parts. 1) A knowledge survey to test the relationship between orchid biodiversity decline and cultural knowledge loss on four different orchid knowledge types in eight villages in rural Sichuan. 2) A complementary knowledge survey to test how the impacts of urbanization on people’s orchid knowledge differed based on knowledge type, with interviews conducted in three jurisdictions in Sichuan with differing levels of urbanization. 3) A social network analysis of the same 8 villages from part 1, tested how an individual’s social position within a community and a network’s overall structure might mitigate the loss of knowledge resulting from local species extinction. 4) An in-depth literature review and case study analysis of six key Chinese botanical gardens to identify which model(s) are most effective at orchid biocultural diversity conservation. Results revealed species extinction drives significant cultural knowledge loss, across all types of knowledge. Social network structure and rural proximity to natural areas are not sufficient by themselves to preserve a community’s knowledge following species extinction. Comprehensive botanical gardens are uniquely positioned to effectively maintain ex situ collections of threatened plant species and cultural knowledge, manage in situ populations, work to restore natural ecosystems, and reintroduce species back into the wild and traditional knowledge back into local communities. However, the current botanical garden institutional capacity within Sichuan is inadequate to address these conservation goals, with the need for three to five new BG in the province. These findings help advance our understanding of how biodiversity loss affects cultural knowledge loss, with implications for biocultural diversity conservation more generally.",

    "Abstract": "We evaluated the effects of a nutrition education program using HyperMirror, a video-mediated communication system, on the acquisition of appropriate food and dietary choice skills among Japanese and Thai schoolchildren, and the applicability of HyperMirror for a nutrition education program. HyperMirror uses composite video images and mirrored self-images to make geographically remote individuals feel as if they are in the same room. The nutrition program, assessed using a pre-post study design, was conducted in 2006 (wherein the target was food choices based on food groups) and 2007 (wherein the target was planning a well-balanced breakfast). Periodic newsletters were distributed between the yearly sessions to ensure knowledge retention. Subjects were students (aged 9-10 years in 2006) from urban areas of Japan (n=70) and Thailand (n=21) who participated in both the lectures in 2006 and 2007. The study environment was evaluated after every year’s distance lecture. We also assessed program impact in terms of changes in nutritional knowledge, attitudes and behaviors towards appropriate food and dietary choice. The following behavioral objectives were assessed; (1) making appropriate diet choices, (2) understanding and being interested in foreign dietary/food cultures, and (3) being concerned about their own nutrition after three weeks of distance learning in 2007. The mean study environment scores were high overall for both sessions (3.8 for Japanese students, 4.4 for Thai), and changes in nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were observed. Over 50% of Japanese and Thai students agreed on behavioral objective (1), while agreement rates for behavioral objectives (2) and (3) were greater among Thai than among Japanese students, partly because the periodical newsletters helped maintain students’ learning interest and retention. Our study showed that a distance-learning nutritional education program using HyperMirror effectively induced behavioral channges and improved knowledge of food culture. We also confirmed HyperMirror’s applicability to such programs. Alternate abstract: 本研究は，日本・タイ国児童を対象に「適切な食品・食事の選択・組み合わせ」スキルの向上を目指した，視覚対話システムの超鏡（HyperMirror）活用の食育プログラムの教育効果と超鏡の食育への適用性を検討することであった．超鏡は，遠隔地の相手像と自己の鏡像とを合成し，同一画面上に表示して相手と同室感覚を作りだすことができる． 食育プログラムは，前後比較デザインを用いて，2006年（テーマ：食品群から食品を選択する）と2007年（テーマ：食品群から食品選択し，栄養バランスの良い朝食を計画する）に実施した．また，初回の食育の学習内容を対象児童に保持させるために教育支援教材（ニュースレター）を，2回目の食育授業実施前まで定期的に配布した．対象者は，2006年と2007年の両年とも食育授業に参加した日本都市部（70名）とタイ国都市部（21名）の児童（2006年時9歳から10歳の小学生5年生）である． 各年の食育授業終了後に学習環境調査を実施した．また，2007年の遠隔食育授業の約3週間後に食育プログラムの“影響評価＂（適切な食品・食事選択に関する知識，意識，および行動の変容）と“行動目標評価＂（目標1：適切な量と食品の組合せの食事を摂取できる，目標2：外国の食環境・食文化を理解し，興味・関心をもつことができる，目標3：自分の食生活に関心をもつことができる）を実施し，検討をおこなった． 超鏡の学習環境については両年平均で日本3.8，タイ国4.4で児童の評価は高値であった．また両国の児童に適切な食品・食事選択に関する知識，意識，および行動の変容が確認された．行動目標1は両国の児童の50％以上が「できる」と回答した．行動目標2と3はタイ児童のほうが日本児童より「できる」の回答率が高く，教育支援教材による効果もみられた． 本報告では超鏡による食育の教育効果と適用性が確認できた．",

    "Abstract": "Problem: Prediabetes is an increasingly prevalent condition, involving the recognition of elevated blood glucose levels through a diagnostic hemoglobin A1C reading between 5.7% and 6.4%; if left unaddressed, severe complications may occur (American Diabetes Association [ADA], 2016; Menke, Casagrande, Geiss & Cowie, 2015). While research has shown that successful incorporation of the lifestyle modifications of diet and exercise can lower the risk for these complications by up to 58%, the utilization of beneficial modifications has not been reported by all of those with this condition (ADA, 2016; Dorsey & Songer, 2011). Project Aim: The purpose of this project was to distinguish if newly diagnosed adults with prediabetes who were provided with both verbal and written education, compared to those who only received verbal education, would experience an improved retention of information regarding necessary lifestyle modifications, and demonstrate a willingness to change in a one-month follow-up survey. Project Method: The theoretical framework for this project is the Transtheoretical Model of behavior change (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). The project took place across four local, urban primary care clinics. Participants were separated into two groups at the time of agreeing to project involvement using consecutive assignment. Group A received verbal instructions from their healthcare provider regarding prediabetes, and then participated in a teach-back session with the DNP student to further review the ADA’s (2016) recommendations for lifestyle modifications. Group B received the same verbal education, but was also provided with an educational leaflet from the ADA (2016) during their teach-back session. Research has shown that more than half of the education patients receive during office visits is either forgotten or incorrect (AHRQ, 2015). To enhance knowledge retention, emphasis was placed on utilizing the validated Teach Back Method (AHRQ, 2015) for all participants. One-month Likert scale follow-up surveys were electronically delivered to all participants for evaluation and assessment of the project’s outcomes. Project Findings: Follow-up surveys were sent electronically to the 13 project participants, 12 completed surveys were returned. Data were gathered and analyzed. The Mann Whitney U Test (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) was used to calculate statistical significance ( p =<0.05). Significant improvement was noted with Group B’s responses to how often they felt the verbal instructions they received regarding their condition were easy to understand ( U =5, p <0.0455). Significant findings were also noted with Group B’s responses quantifying how often anyone in their healthcare practice asked them to describe how they were going to follow their specific health instructions ( U = 3.5, p <0.0251). There were no significant findings seen in the prediabetes management portion of the electronic survey: overall feeling well managing prediabetes ( p =0.689), would like to do better with exercising ( p =0.873), would like to improve with eating better foods ( p =0.749), currently doing well with exercising ( p =0.749), currently doing well with eating better foods ( p =0.936). No significance was noted on the last health literacy question in the electronic survey regarding how often participants felt their health care providers and staff had spent time with them ( p =0.093). Conclusion: Including written materials, along with verbal instruction, regarding the new diagnosis of prediabetes and necessary lifestyle modifications can improve ease of patient learning and foster opportunities for health care workers to utilize the validated teach-back method. Further research is recommended to evaluate the relationship between verbal and written education and retention of prediabetes management instruction and willingness to change by incorporating recommended lifestyle modifications.",

    "Abstract": "More than 38% of the U.S. public workforce will likely retire by 2030, which may result in a labor shortage. Business leaders may adopt strategies to mitigate knowledge loss within their organizations by capturing knowledge in a knowledge management system (KMS). The purpose of this single case study was to explore strategies that information technology (IT) managers use to develop and implement a KMS. The target population consisted of IT managers in a small-sized organization located in northwestern Florida who had implemented a KMS successfully. The conceptual framework for this study was organizational knowledge creation theory. The collection of public documents, execution of semistructured interviews with 5 qualified participants, literature on the topic, and member checking formed the determination of the findings of the study. Using triangulation and coding the data for emergent themes, 6 themes emerged from the data analysis: (a) training, (b) customer focus, (c) policy and governance, (d) leadership and management support, (e) communication and marketing, and (f) business process management. The application of the findings may contribute to social change by identifying strategies that leaders and IT managers from communities and government agencies use in implementing a KMS that may facilitate transparency and open flow of information to citizens, and allow access to timely, civic, and potentially life-enhancing information.

    "Abstract": "Problem-based Learning (PBL) is one of the most effective methods of instruction that helps Visual Effects (VFX) students to be more adaptable at encountering career challenges in Malaysia. These challenges are; lack of several important requirements such as, the basic and fundamental knowledge of VFX concepts, the ability to understand real-world problems and to convert ideas into VFX solutions, the ability to attain and retain up-to-date knowledge of VFX concepts, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to come up with solutions to real-world problems. Its role in helping students; thus, encompasses improving the level of meaningfulness of their learning experience, and their skills in terms of comprehension, knowledge retention, problem-solving, self-directed learning, as well as interpersonal skills. The use of PBL helps VFX students to cope with the encounters of the career challenges in Malaysia that may be enhanced by focusing on a faculty-wide approach as compared to applying it on a course at a time. Moreover, such methods of enhancing VFX education delivery in Malaysia are to encourage reflective practices and PBL based dialogues on VFX, and to increase the level of VFX competence of instructors through improved training methods.",

    "Abstract": "This dissertation investigated the effects of temporal distribution of practice (relatively massed vs. distributed) on the learning and retention of oral Mandarin tonal word production by native English-speaking adults within the theoretical framework of skill acquisition and retention theories. The present study focused on oral production of Mandarin two-syllable words as a function of temporal distribution of practice. It also explored whether the effects of this distribution differ depending on the type of knowledge to be acquired or retained (declarative word knowledge vs. skills in oral production) and on individual differences in cognitive aptitudes (including working memory, phonological short-term memory, declarative memory, procedural memory, and musical aptitude). Eighty native English-speaking adults who did not have any prior knowledge of a tonal language completed all sessions of the study and provided data for analysis. These participants were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions, i.e., Condition A with a 1-day ISI (intersession interval) and a 1-week RI (retention interval), Condition B with a 1-day ISI and a 4-week RI, Condition C with a 1-week ISI and a 1-week RI, and Condition D with a 1-week ISI and a 4-week RI. Each participant came in for five sessions. All participants completed a set of cognitive aptitude tests and underwent the same number and content of training sessions, which differed only on training or testing schedules. The results showed that the effects of ISI and RI differed depending on the type of knowledge/skill to be retained, declarative versus procedural. For the retention of declarative knowledge, RI had a robust effect: the longer the RI, the worse the retention. Spacing, or distributed practice seemed to improve long-term retention of declarative knowledge; however, this ISI effect was much weaker. With regard to procedural knowledge retention, ISI seems to play a role, but not RI, and it was massed practice that had an advantage over distributed practice. Musical aptitude, working memory, and declarative memory ability were found to play facilitative roles in L2 learning of Mandarin tonal word productions. Procedural memory ability was found to interact with ISI and RI for various RT outcome measures.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of interactive learning technology in the classroom can impact knowledge retention among students as compared to classrooms where interactive learning technology was not utilized. Through a quasi-experimental design, the study explored non-cognitive factor relationships to knowledge retention and post-test scores, comparing the results in undergraduate courses where instructors integrated interactive learning technology with undergraduate courses where instructors did not integrate learning technology. Descriptive, ANOVA, and ANCOVA statistical analyses were used to analyze knowledge retention and post-test scores as well as covariates from 215 students in undergraduate courses at one academic institution. The results revealed several important findings. First, there was a significant effect on both post-test scores and knowledge retention when audience response systems were integrated into the classroom. Second, the integration of audience response systems in the classroom effect on knowledge retention and post-test scores was significantly different from students in the online classroom who did not use audience response systems, despite having access to supplementary material when they took pre- and post-tests. Course topic and student status had no significant effect post-test scores or knowledge retention when audience response systems were integrated into the classroom. Finally, faculty status did have a significant effect on post-test scores and knowledge retention when audience response systems were integrated into the classroom. By understanding the non-cognitive factors that contribute to improve knowledge retention and post-test scores, institutions can improve their faculty members' effectiveness and success in the classroom.

    "Abstract": "The developing synergy of legislation and research throughout recent history points to the current momentum behind college and career readiness for every student. Researchers have found that embedding academic content into career education improves student learning. Integrated learning can vary in approach and style and can be adjusted to fit into a multitude of environment designs. The purpose of this study was to investigate and corroborate the relationship between mathematical instructional design and student achievement. A mixed methods research design was utilized for collecting data. Qualitative data was collected from an electronic survey administered to 23 students taking a Geometry in Construction class at a Central Texas high school followed by a semi-structured interview with a focus group from the student sample. Classroom observation data was recorded from both a traditional geometry classroom and the Geometry in Construction classroom in order to provide additional insight into student perspectives related to course design. The convergent parallel design of the study included quantitative data that was collected during the same time period using pretest and posttest data sets from a traditional geometry class (control group) and the Geometry in Construction class (experimental group). Both data sets were brought together in an interpretive phase to analyze how student perceptions on learning align with student achievement scores. Results from this study revealed students who learn in an integrated learning environment where academic content is taught in a real-world context using hands-on, project-based learning perform better on academic achievement measures than do students who learn in a traditional classroom setting. While this study focused on one integrated learning model at one Central Texas high school, results indicated college and career readiness dimensions as identified by Conley (2010) are overall likely to be more naturally embedded in an instructional design geared toward rigorous and relevant knowledge application.

    "Abstract": "This study examined the effect of naming animals used in education on the knowledge retention of college students. Researchers implemented owl educational presentations to students using a live owl during each presentation. The control group was given the common name of the owl whereas the treatment group was given only an anthropomorphized name for the owl. Students completed a knowledge questionnaire following the presentation. Findings indicated that the treatment group significantly retained more information on owl adaptations than the control group. Future research should explore the use of anthropomorphized names for animals used in education, particularly with male learners.",

    "Abstract": "Educators seek to develop students' mathematical knowledge retention to increase student efficacy in follow-on classwork, improvement of test scores, attainment of standards, and preparation for careers. Interactive visuals, feedback during problem solving, and incorporation of higher-order thinking skills are known to increase retention, but a comparison of online and face-to-face learning regarding knowledge retention has not been fully explored. The current study tested 38 Caucasian eighth grade students for knowledge retention on ten mathematical topics they had learned in sixth grade during either online or faceto-face conditions. After two years, students were given the same posttest as in 6th grade over the 10 units of which five had been learned online and five face-to-face. Scores for long-term gain scores showed no significant differences between online or face-to-face learning conditions. A TOST calculation was used to show equivalence of middle school student long-term learning across online and face-to-face conditions in mathematics in this study within the limits of the test. The interactive nature of each condition contributed to strong mathematical understanding, which led to the retention being equivalent for both conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Podcasts have become increasingly popular as a medium for free open access medical education (FOAM). However, little research has examined the use of these extracurricular audio podcasts as tools in undergraduate medical education. We aimed to examine knowledge retention, usage conditions, and preferences of undergraduate medical students at a Canadian university interacting with extracurricular podcasts. Methods Students enrolled in the undergraduate medical program at McMaster University volunteered to participate in this study. Two podcasts were created specifically for the purposes of this study, and online tests and surveys were sent to participants to gather data regarding user preferences of podcasts. In addition, we recorded changes in topic test scores before and after podcast exposure. Results Forty-two students were recruited to this study. Participants who completed the assessments demonstrated an effect of learning. Podcasts of 30 minutes or less were preferred in the majority of participants who had a preference in duration. The top three activities participants were engaged in while listening to the podcasts were driving (46%), completing chores (26%), and exercising (23%). A large number of participants who did not complete the study in its entirety cited a lack of time and podcast length to be the top two barriers to completion. Conclusion This is one of the first studies to examine extracurricular podcast-usage data and preferences in a Canadian undergraduate medical student population. This information may help educators and FOAM producers to optimize educational tools for medical education.",

    "Abstract": "By the year 2025, 75% of the workforce will consist of Generation Y (Kim, 2017). With the major shift in the workforce, organizations must consider the different learning styles and expectations of the Y generation, as compared to the previous, dominant generations (Tulgan, 2009). In order to determine if there is a difference in short-term and long-term retention levels when deploying two different modalities of training within an organizational training program specific to the Y Generation, a quantitative quasi-experimental study was used. The study consisted of 40 subjects who were administered pretest, immediate post and long-term posttests in conjunction with a training module. The findings from this study demonstrate that although knowledge retention decreases over time, knowledge retention scores were higher on the short-term assessments compared to the scores on the long-term assessments. However, there was a sharper decline in knowledge retention among employees who participated in computer-based training compared to employees who participated in face-to-face training. Based on these findings, all null hypotheses can be rejected. In sum, these findings provide support for the use of face-to-face training modalities for employees who fall within Generation Y. The results support the need for training programs to use face-to-face training modalities for employees who fall within Generation Y. Despite exciting new technology, it can be stated that computers should not replace classrooms and teachers, for training purposes, in the immediate future.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Mobile learning (mLearning) and gamification are two potential pedagogical tools that are continuously evolving in Higher Education. Their efficiency as learning tools is not fully understood and their use by staff is sporadic and sometimes viewed poorly compared to traditional methods. Aim: To determine a framework of best practice for the integration of mLearning app based quiz-games into the Higher Education (HE) teaching of anatomical sciences. This thesis presents three studies, which aim to 1) evaluate mLearning quiz-games as a revision tool for an anatomy online examination 2) and 3) investigate the effect of pre-seminar mLearning quiz gameplay on knowledge acquisition, retention and engagement in anatomy. Method: The data collection was performed over a two year period in a level 4 anatomy module for Sport and Exercise Science students. All three studies employed an experimental mixed methods approach within an action research framework to allow the development of the project in a naturalistic way. Study One was completed over two cohorts, 2014-15 (n=125) and 2015-16 (n=121). The module has four assessment points, A1, A2, A3, A4 where A1-3 are online assessments with a mixture of Multiple Choice Questions, labelling and matching questions and A4 is a viva voce. Students did A1, A2 and A4 as normal but at A3 they were offered a choice to revise as normal, the control group (n= 164) or to play mLearning games (n=87) for 15 minutes prior to the assessment on a tablet or smartphone device. All students completed a modified Study Process Questionnaire (SPQ) post-assessment and then for triangulation of data online focus groups were completed (n=84) as well as extended semi-structured interviews (n=9). Study Two was completed in 2015-16 using the same module as Study One. Over two consecutive weeks students were videoed in a two hour seminar session where in week one they did 15 minutes of no formal class preparation (n=87) and in week two they did 15 minutes of mLearning games (n=87). Students did a plenary and recap class Socrative quiz every week where the plenary scores indicate knowledge acquisition and the difference between the plenary and recap scores of subsequent weeks indicates knowledge retention. Observational behavioural engagement analysis was completed using an adapted coding system and students completed the National Survey of Student Engagement following each seminar. Study Three was completed on the same cohort in semester two using a randomised repeated measures design for the knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention scores over three weeks with three 15 minute interventions; Games, Control and Games plus question generation before class. Results: Study One found that the Games group performed better at A3 with no difference at A2 or A1 (p < 0.0.01) but no differences were found in the SPQ surface and deep learning motives and strategies. Students revealed reasons for using mLearning quiz-games were primarily the fun, visual stimulation, instant feedback and accessibility. Study Two found that playing quiz-games prior to class increased on-task behaviours and peer interaction and improved knowledge acquisition and retention scores (p < 0.01). Study Three agreed but found no difference in the Games-plus questions group compared to the control or games groups. Conclusions: The studies reveal the positive effect that mLearning quiz-games can have on achievement and engagement both in class and as a revision tool prior to assessment. The results of all three studies have been used to inform the proposed Mobigames framework for the integration of mLearning quiz-games in HE teaching. The framework has four key aspects: Information, Facilitation, Learning and Timing.",

    "Abstract": "Safeguarding assets, especially information, is a common challenge complicated by advancing technology and human interaction. The human factor is the most vulnerable element posing threats to the security of information, data, and digital assets. The problem is, little is known about whether training reinforcement improves knowledge retention. In order to enhance preparedness, a quantitative study was needed to remove the potential for employee self-evaluation bias, or over-estimation of capabilities and determine the need for training reinforcement. The purpose of this quantitative design study was to compare groups (one control and one test group) to determine the effect of training reinforcement intervention on a population of 379 West Virginia university faculty, adjunct faculty, and staff. This researcher used an online training program, followed by online post-test exams. A quantitative study was the best approach because numerical data answers the research question, meets the purpose and addresses the problem. This researcher used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test the null hypothesis and compare the means between groups. The system randomly assigned participants only one group. The same dependent variable was measures for each group. A between-group variance identified the amount of variation between the different data sets. There was a significant effect in training reinforcement on participants’ scores at the p<.05 level for the F(1, 72) = 29.365, p = .000. The finding of this study leads the researcher to recommend employee preparedness training reinforcement. The part-time participants scored lower than full-time participants, also suggesting a need for additional training. Additional research into potential reasons part-time employees scored lower will support the organization’s efforts to enhance preparedness.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the effectiveness of matching learners’ optimal learning styles to their overall knowledge retention. The study attempted to determine if learners who are placed in an online learning environment that matches their optimal learning styles will retain the information at a higher rate than those learners who are not in an adapted learning environment. There were 56 participants that took one of two lessons; the first lesson was textual based, had no hypertext, and was not influenced heavily by the coherence principle, while the second lesson was multimedia based utilizing hypermedia guided by the coherence principle. Each participant took Felder and Soloman’s (1991, 2000) Index of Learning Styles (ILS) questionnaire and was classified using the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM; 1998) into four individual categories. Groups were separated using the Visual/Verbal section of the FSLSM with 55% ( n = 31) of participants going to the adapted group, and 45% ( n =25) of participants going to the non-adapted group. Each participant completed an immediate posttest directly after the lesson and a retention posttest a week later. Several repeated measures MANOVA tests were conducted to measure the significance of differences in the tests between groups and within groups. Repeated measures MANOVA tests were conducted to determine if significance existed between the immediate posttest results and the retention posttest results. Also, participants were asked their perspectives if the lesson type they received was beneficial to their perceived learning of the material. Of the 56 students who took part in this study, 31 students were placed in the adapted group and 25 in the non-adapted group based on outcomes of the ILS and the FLSSM. No significant differences were found between groups taking the multimedia lesson and the textual lesson in the immediate posttest. No significant differences were found between the adapted and the non-adapted groups on the immediate posttest. No significant difference was found between the adapted and the non-adapted groups on the retention posttest. However, results also revealed that the adapted group scored significantly higher on the retention posttest when compared with the immediate posttest. Interestingly, the non-adapted group scored significantly higher on the immediate posttest when compared with the retention posttest. When queried about the perception of benefit of the lesson style, 42% of the adapted group replied in the affirmative following the immediate posttest, yet that percentage grew to 81% following the retention posttest. The non-adapted group had 28% reply in the affirmative following the immediate posttest, and that percentage grew to 48% following the retention posttest. Both groups found benefit, yet the numbers associated with the adapted group were higher. Overall perceptions of benefit corresponded to higher test scores as opposed to those who did not find benefit, who had a lower score.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how companies are handling the issue of knowledge retention from old age retiring workers in the oil and gas sector. This is achieved by providing a detailed insight on the challenges and strategies related to knowledge retention through study of companies from different geographical locations across the globe. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a qualitative research methodology and 20 semi-structured interviews, with open-ended and probing questions, were conducted to gain an in-depth insight into the knowledge retention phenomena. Findings: Knowledge retention activities tend to be inconsistent in majority of the oil and gas companies, with not much work being done regarding knowledge loss from old employees, partly because of the fall in oil prices and layoffs. Oil prices turn out to be a decisive factor in oil and gas industry regarding workforce and knowledge retention activities. The political situation and geographical locations of the companies also affect the knowledge retention activities. Moreover, the aging workforce and retirement issue is more acute in the upstream sector. Research limitations/implications: The focus of the study was on the oil and gas sector, and thus the research results may lack generalizability. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need for investigating the issues and challenges of knowledge retention regarding old age retiring employees by taking into account a global perspective and providing a comparison among different companies in different geographical locations.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Infrastructure adds pace and efficiency into India’s progress. It is a country which has embraced the notion of a knowledge economy of late, and thus raised the importance of infrastructure consulting per se. The study aims to cover the consequent but underexplored role of organizational structure (OS) vis-à-vis knowledge retention (KR) in this sector. Design/methodology/approach: For conducting the research, the sampling organization that has been chosen is an infrastructure consulting organization. The researchers had undertaken an exploratory study to find out the dynamics between OS and KR. A qualitative approach has thus been adopted and the application of thematic analysis found place in conducting the research. The themes and sub-themes generated from the research, aligned with the theoretical backdrop, gave rise to a schematic model explaining the relationship between OS and KR. Findings: From the above themes and sub-themes along with possible relationships which emerged from the study, the researchers observed that the theme “organizational structure” had a significant relationship with the sub-theme “knowledge retention”. In the order, what was the most noteworthy was that designing of an OS had a refined and somewhat directed influence on KR in the organization. Originality/value: This paper tries to uncover the relationship between an organization’s structure formation and the key aspect of knowledge management cycle, which is KR. This shall be helpful for both academics (who can make advancements by testing the relationship in other contexts) and practitioners (who can look forward to minimizing business losses through the concept of KR).

    "Abstract": "Processes of environmental dispossession have had dramatic consequences for dietary quality, cultural identity, and the integrity of traditional food systems (TFS) in many Indigenous populations. These transitions have not been documented among First Nation people in southwestern Ontario, and virtually no studies have investigated TFS in southern or urban regions of Canada. Nested within a larger community-centred project designed to better understand the social and spatial determinants of food choice and patterns of food security, the objective of this paper was to explore First Nation mothers' knowledge about access, availability, and practices relating to traditional foods in the city of London, Ontario, and nearby First Nation reserves. In 2010, twenty-five women participated in semi-structured interviews that were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed with input from community partners. Our results centre on the women's stories about access, preferences, knowledge, and sharing of traditional foods. Those living on a reserve relied more consistently on traditional foods, as proximity to land, family, and knowledge permitted improved access. Urban mothers faced transportation and economic barriers alongside knowledge loss related to the use and preparation of traditional foods. Overall our results demonstrate uneven geographic challenges for First Nation engagement in TFS, with urban mothers experiencing uniquely greater challenges than those residing on a reserve.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to emphasize the importance of feedback in the knowledge and learning processes and the central role that it can play through smart-device technologies.The contribution is aimed at analyzing some issues arising from theoretical backgrounds and guidelines for innovative instructional design to enhance the experience in digital interaction. The research conducted at the University Parthenope of Naples, with a group of 149 students enrolled in different courses of study, used game-based technologies and a platform called Kahoot which offered the possibility to create a single response quiz-game. In light of the theoretical framework analyzed, the experience and the results, it is reasonable to argue that game-based technologies enable a more effective engagement, improving overall learning processes and optimizing knowledge retention. Didattiche partecipative e ruolo del feedback attraverso tecnologie game-based Lo scopo di questo articolo è sottolineare l’importanza del feedback nei processi di conoscenza e di apprendimento ed il ruolo centrale che esso può svolgere tramite l’ausilio di tecnologie smart-device. Il contributo tratteggia gli orientamenti prevalenti per una progettazione didattica che preveda l’utilizzo di tecnologie digitali. A tale proposito l’analisi si è avvantaggiata di evidenze empiriche acquisite nell’ambito di un’esperienza svolta presso l’Università Parthenope di Napoli, con la partecipazione di 149 studenti di diversi corsi di studio, che ha previsto l’uso di tecnologie game-based per la realizzazione di un quiz-game tramite la piattaforma Kahoot. Alla luce del quadro teorico, dell’esperienza e dei risultati, è ragionevole ritenere che le tecnologie game-based contribuiscano a migliorare complessivamente i processi di apprendimento consentendo un più efficace engagement ottimizzando l'acquisizione delle conoscenze.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge retention and learning transfer are important to organizations. The topics of knowledge retention and learning transfer are consistently researched individually. However, there is a gap in the existing literature on the relationship between employee perception of facilitating knowledge retention learning transfer. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between employee perception of facilitating knowledge retention and employee perception of learning transfer. A quantitative methodology was used to examine knowledge retention and learning transfer from the employee perception. The Learning Transfer System Inventory ([LTSI]), (Bates, Holton, & Hatala, “A Revised Learning Transfer System Inventory: Factorial Replication and Validation”, 2012) was the instrument used to measure the employee perception. Current employees of the Middle Atlantic government who were members of a selected professional association and have attended at least one training program offered by the government were the targeted population. Findings of the study support that a transfer design had a high correlation with the opportunity to use and perceived content validity. The lowest correlation was the opportunity to use and personal capacity for transfer. Based on the statistical data, there is a significant relationship between environmental and motivational factors and employee perception of learning transfer and facilitating knowledge retention; and there is no relationship between individual factors and employee perception of learning transfer and facilitating knowledge retention. This study is important, as it may be a valuable addition to the existing body of knowledge in the field of human resource management, by contributing new or additional knowledge on facilitating knowledge retention and learning transfer. The study is also valuable to the field of business by providing relevant information that will allow organizations to develop effective training programs that will equip employees with the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to contribute to the success of the organization.",

    "Abstract": "Problem-based Learning (PBL) is one of the most effective methods of instruction that helps Visual Effects (VFX) students to be more adaptable at encountering career challenges in Malaysia. These challenges are; lack of several important requirements such as, the basic and fundamental knowledge of VFX concepts, the ability to understand real-world problems and to convert ideas into VFX solutions, the ability to attain and retain up-to-date knowledge of VFX concepts, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to come up with solutions to real-world problems. Its role in helping students; thus, encompasses improving the level of meaningfulness of their learning experience, and their skills in terms of comprehension, knowledge retention, problem-solving, self-directed learning, as well as interpersonal skills. The use of PBL helps VFX students to cope with the encounters of the career challenges in Malaysia that may be enhanced by focusing on a faculty-wide approach as compared to applying it on a course at a time.

    "Abstract": "This dissertation is a qualitative investigation of the phenomenon of flow states and peak experiences encountered by four participants from a 16-day river trip through the Grand Canyon. In contemporary society, a troubling dichotomy exists between an unprecedented access to information, with a simultaneous loss of knowledge and appreciation of the restorative benefits of nature. The purpose of this research was to explore the capacity of remote environments to facilitate flow states, peak experiences, and transpersonal meaning. The study utilized the heuristic research method to systematically explore the phenomenology and assigned meaning of a singular human experience. Data was collected through retrospective phone interviews and e-mail correspondences. The six-stage research process identified parallel themes in the participants reported encounters with flow states, peak experiences, and assigned transpersonal meaning, which included positive influences on physical and emotional well-being, and a deeper appreciation for the natural world. The results of this research supported the existing relevant literature and highlighted the potential of immersive nature encounters to promote personal growth, happiness, self-understanding, social connectedness, and respect for nature and the greater circle of life. The study’s findings may be useful in developing nature-based continuing education curriculum for healthcare providers, designing therapeutic interventions for clinical and sub-clinical adult and adolescent populations, and promoting awareness and dissemination of information about the restorative value of the natural world to human health and well-being.",

The transfer of viable knowledge from science to market needs to be better bridged. To enhance this transfer, a methodology is designed which integrates engineering design and subject-actionobject (SAO) text mining. The methodology is used to find, select and evaluate appropriate nanotechnologies for solving industrial problems using scientific abstracts. A case study is conducted whereby engineering design methods are used to structure a technical innovation problem in the manufacturing industry. 1.2 million abstracts from nanotechnology related articles are retrieved from the Web of Science and indexed using SAOparsing of the title and abstract. The performance of this novel methodology is measured using precision and recall, an approach common to the field of information retrieval. The methodology is further evaluated on the basis of structured interviews conducted with two engineering managers. The results demonstrate that the SAO methodology is a valuable assist to innovation and design within the firm. Significant challenges which are addressed in this article-- for example knowledge loss due to SAO-parsing, and also the phenomena of information stickiness.",

    "Abstract": "Using tax accrual quality as a proxy for audit quality, I investigate whether companies that significantly decreased APTS surrounding the effective date of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s 2006 Rules on Ethics, Independence, and Tax Services experienced an improvement in audit quality after the change. Given the specific target of the PCAOB 2006 restrictions is companies aggressively avoiding taxes with the assistance of APTS, I also investigate whether companies associated with tax aggressive services are also more likely to experience an improvement in audit quality following the reductions in APTS. Results suggest an increase in audit quality due to a reduction in economic bonding following APTS restrictions. Consistent with the economic bonding theory, companies that significantly reduced APTS experienced a larger improvement in audit quality after the change compared to companies that did not significantly reduce APTS. For tax aggressive companies, those that reduced APTS did experience a significant increase in audit quality after the change compared to tax aggressive companies that did not significantly reduce APTS. Moreover, companies considered important tax clients by their audit firms that significantly reduced APTS did experience a marginally greater increase in audit quality after the change compared to other important tax clients that did not significantly reduce APTS. Overall, my results indicate that the PCOAB 2006 restrictions were effective in decreasing APTS and economic bonding, thereby leading to improved audit quality, especially among companies associated with tax aggressive services. Accordingly, concerns for loss of knowledge spillover seem to be minimal. There are few studies that investigate the effectiveness of the PCAOB 2006 restrictions on audit quality. Therefore, my study fills this void by using a tax specific measure of audit quality, tax accrual quality, to specifically examine the target of the restrictions— audit clients that are associated with aggressive tax services. My study confirms and expands APTS, economic bonding, audit quality, tax accrual quality, and tax aggressive research, and also provides insight into and support for current policy debates concerning APTS and tax aggressive services.",

    "Abstract": "Finding ways to help nursing students understand the application of didactic content can be challenging for faculty. One challenge faculty face is motivating students with thought provoking and memorable content using traditional methods. Educational games and gaming attributes have been shown to affect student motivation and support learning. The aim of this study was to gain knowledge, filling a knowledge gap, regarding which gaming attributes motivate nursing students to become engaged in course content that is not graded. Badges were used as a reward system to examine if nursing students would complete an increased number of non-graded case studies, and have a higher score on the posttest than when badges were not used. Data was collected using an A-B single group design during two consecutive specialty courses. A one-tailed dependent t-test was used to compare the average scores of case study posttests and the average number of case studies completed during both phases. All participants were nursing students in a three-year accelerated baccalaureate degree program attending a college of nursing located in the southwest. There was no significant difference with the use of badges on the average scores of case studies t(24) = -1.332, p = 0.1. However, there was a significant difference with the use of badges on the number of completed case studies t(24) = -2.5, p = 0.01. This study adds empirical evidence to the literature that gamification attributions positively influences student motivation and continued engagement in course content. Findings demonstrated a significant difference in the engagement of nursing students in non-graded coursework during the course where badges were offered as rewards as opposed to the course where badges were not offered as rewards. As technology savvy Millennials fill the classrooms and nursing faculty search for new teaching strategies to engage their students, the results of this study promotes the use of badging as a way to actively engage nursing students in course content. Additional research with a larger sample is recommended to support the findings and examine the effect gamification attributions have on knowledge retention.

The experiential learning, the experimental group in this research, took two lecture styles. One was a classroom-styled lecture that a lecturer teaches basic knowledge of cyber security to learners. The other one was practical exercises that learners made groups and experientially implemented their products with security protection. The non-experiential learning, the control group in this research, took an e-learning-styled lecture using a video educational material containing the same contents of the classroom-styled lecture in the experimental group but the contents about any practical exercise were removed. The learning effectiveness of the two learning groups were evaluated by comparing several metrics of pre-/post-test scores and delayed-test scores. The evaluation result indicates that learners who took the experiential learning could keep retaining knowledge they learned than learner who took the non-experiential learning.",

    "Abstract": "With the globalization of the knowledge economy, knowledge management appears especially important for firms, and has been applied in more and more companies. Knowledge resource has become the key point of the firm’s core competence, while knowledge loss is the problem that can be easily ignored, and has a great effect on firms. In this paper, we define the concept of knowledge loss, the main risks of the firm faced in knowledge loss at first, and then analyze the causes of firm knowledge loss from the internal factors and the external factors. The internal factors include employee turnover, internal staff changes, performance evaluation and salary structure. The external factors consist of the external imitation, corporate strategic alliance and social environment. And finally we put forward corresponding risk control strategies.",

    "Abstract": "This research explored the experiences of volunteers connected to organizations through the non-profit organization Volunteer Victoria. The study investigated the perceived and experienced intergenerational communication challenges of volunteers, and the volunteers’ ensuing needs and expectations. Through an online survey and semi-structured interviews, volunteers discussed their perceptions and experiences with volunteer organizations in the Greater Victoria Region. Guided by the frameworks of generational and communication theories, and held within the principles, tools, and practices of an exploratory case study methodology, this mixed-methods study addressed the research question, In what ways can Volunteer Victoria best support its member agencies in fostering intergenerational communication for volunteers? This study reinforced scholarly and industry knowledge that the generations have differing communication needs and that there is value, for all organizational stakeholders, in fulfilling those needs in the non-profit sector. If intergenerational communication is not fostered, there are many implications. Among the highest-risk implications are: the loss of knowledge that could be transferred from senior volunteers to younger and emerging generations of volunteers, and the impact on the organization’s reputation associated with poor engagement of volunteers. Included in the design of this research is an intention to follow up, with organizations that are willing, in order to learn of any outcomes or impacts of the disseminated research.",

    "Abstract": "Embodied interactions and learning have garnered a lot of interest among researchers and game designers in past years, especially with the recent development of consumer-level body sensory devices like the Microsoft Kinect. This study focused on examining whether embodied interactions, enabled by the Kinect, could lead to greater knowledge acquisition compared to traditional mouse-based interactions working with STEM-related (numeric systems) and language-related (Chinese character) learning in a virtual learning environment for adult learners. Embodied cognition, body movements and learning, cognitive processing theories were discussed as a theoretical framework for this study. A 3D virtual learning environment was designed, in which learners could interact with the instructional materials through either their body movements, or a mouse. The study utilized an experimental, two-group, pre- and posttest design. The experimental group used the Kinect-enabled embodied interactions and the control group used the traditional mouse-based interactions during an on-site learning intervention. Fifty-three adult participants were recruited and randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. Scores from immediate posttest and delayed posttest between the two groups were compared with ANCOVA using pretest score as the covariate. Statistical results informed that embodied interactions enabled by the Kinect facilitated learning in numeric systems and Chinese characters for the participating adult learners. However, compared with the mouse interaction, the embodied interaction enabled by the Kinect did not lead to significantly better knowledge retention and application results in both immediate posttest and delayed posttest in numeric systems learning. And for Chinese characters learning, compared with the mouse interaction, the embodied interaction enabled by the Kinect did not lead to significantly better knowledge retention results in the immediate posttest either, but achieved significantly better performance in the delayed posttest. The study outcome implies that Kinect-based embodied interactions do not necessarily lead to better learning performances over traditional mouse-based interactions for adult learners. The performances may depend on subject areas, and at what time learners’ knowledge retrieval were evaluated. When designing computer-mediated learning modules, researchers and practitioners should not only look at the new technology and novel approaches to interacting with the computers, but also take the subject areas, learners, and time issues into consideration as well.",

Although for many reasons in practice, the process of learning today to avoid making the same mistake tomorrow does not necessarily take place throughout the project's lifecycle. This paper is based on research aimed at examining the measurable impact of systematic Lessons Learned, on Project Reviews. Multiple semi-structured interviews were conducted in-depth with project managers working in various industries and with different levels of experience. The focus was on gathering practical savoir-faire and knowledge within projects and understanding their nature, timeframe, barriers and implications for developing a systematic approach for future projects. Generally, the nature of lessons occurring in projects converges from one to another but generate different situational impacts. Despite Lessons Learned being fundamental in avoiding reinventing the wheel, preventing knowledge loss and capitalizing knowledge, literature does not suggest a clear integrated model to help project leaders with theses. Given the nature of systematic Lessons Learned, as explored in this paper, results have shown contradicting practices compared to past studies, regarding realistic timeframes to initiate project learning reviews. Although the knowledge fragmentation paradigm persists in existing, the results validate practical learning paradoxes and attempt to fill the gaps in literature for a greater understanding of how to systematically learn from projects. Ultimately, this paper develops a model to support systematic learning from projects. The research also led to several recommendations to be adopted in order to improve Lessons Learned processes in projects.",

When a developer leaves the project, their knowledge may be lost if the other developers do not understand the design decisions made by the leaving developer. Understanding the source code written by leaving developers thus becomes a burden for their successors.In a previous paper, Rigby et al. reported on a case study of turnover-induced knowledge loss in two large projects, Chromium and a project at Avaya, using risk evaluation methods usually applied to financial systems. They found that the two projects were susceptible to large knowledge losses that are more than three times the average loss. We report on a replication of their study on the Chromium project, as well as seven other large and medium-sized open source projects. We also extended theirwork by studying two variations of the knowledge loss metric, as well as the location and persistence of abandoned files.We found that all projects had a similar knowledge loss probability distribution, but extreme knowledge loss can be more severe than those originally discovered in Chromium and the project at Avaya. We also found that, in the systems under study, abandoned files often remained in the system for long periods.",

    "Abstract": "The problem was the lack of effective succession planning strategies to facilitate the transfer of technical expertise from retiring employees to younger employees. A rebound of oil exploration activities in Nigeria would adversely affect the drilling sector due to lack of preparation and succession planning to meet the demand for technical expertise. The purpose of this case study was to explore how a succession planning program contributes to knowledge transfer and development of expertise for business continuity and prevents loss of knowledge in the oil-drilling sector in Nigeria. Twenty-four participants from one oil-drilling contractor in Nigeria participated in the study. The conceptual framework was guided by knowledge creation theory, succession planning concepts, and transformational leadership theory. Data collection included semistructured face-to-face interviews supplemented with document review. Data analysis involved a traditional text method where data coder pace each piece of data into various categories by hand. This study revealed 4 themes: individual development program, mentoring, on-the-job training, and 360-degree communication. Findings may affect oil-drilling practices by contributing to enhanced succession planning and knowledge transfer initiatives. The implication for positive social change may include the development of individuals for leadership roles and could add to the organization talent bench, and reduce knowledge gaps while ensuring business continuity.",

    "Abstract": "More than 38% of the U.S. public workforce will likely retire by 2030, which may result in a labor shortage. Business leaders may adopt strategies to mitigate knowledge loss within their organizations by capturing knowledge in a knowledge management system (KMS). The purpose of this single case study was to explore strategies that information technology (IT) managers use to develop and implement a KMS. The target population consisted of IT managers in a small-sized organization located in northwestern Florida who had implemented a KMS successfully. The conceptual framework for this study was organizational knowledge creation theory. The collection of public documents, execution of semistructured interviews with 5 qualified participants, literature on the topic, and member checking formed the determination of the findings of the study. Using triangulation and coding the data for emergent themes, 6 themes emerged from the data analysis: (a) training, (b) customer focus, (c) policy and governance, (d) leadership and management support, (e) communication and marketing, and (f) business process management. The application of the findings may contribute to social change by identifying strategies that leaders and IT managers from communities and government agencies use in implementing a KMS that may facilitate transparency and open flow of information to citizens, and allow access to timely, civic, and potentially life-enhancing information.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The Chácobo are a Panoan speaking tribe of about 1000 members (300+ adults) in Beni, Bolivia.Originally nomadic, the Chácabo were relocated to their current main location in the 1960s. Researchers have visited the Chácabo since 1911. A first more detailed anthropological report exists from the late 1960s, and ecological–ethnobotanical studies were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. The presented work represents a complete ethnobotanical inventory of the entire adult Chácobo population, with interviews and plant collection conducted directly by Chácobo counterparts.Methods: Based on previous reports and our preliminary studies, we hypothesized that twenty-first century Chácobo plant use centered on income generation, and that traditional plant use related to household utensils,medicine and traditional crop varieties had almost disappeared. To test this hypothesis, we started the “Chácobo Ethnobotany Project,” training 10 indigenous Chácobo participants in ethnobotanical interview and plant collection techniques, in order to more fully document Chácobo knowledge and avoid the influence of foreign interviewers.Results: Our study found 331 useful plant species in 241 genera of 95 plant families, with leaves, roots and bark being the most commonly used plant parts The comprehensive documentation that these methods enabled completely nullified our initial hypothesis of knowledge loss. Traditional crop varieties are still widely grown and traditional knowledge is alive. Moreover, it is being actively recuperated in certain domains by the younger generation. Most Chácobo know, and can name, traditional utensils and tools, although only the older generation has still the skills to manufacture them. While many Chácobo still know the names and uses of medicinal species,the younger generation is however often unsure how to identify them.Conclusions: In this paper we illustrate the complexity of perspectives on knowledge at different ages, and the persistence of knowledge over almost a century. We found that traditional knowledge was only partially affected by the processes of exposure to a market economy, and that different knowledge domains experienced different trends as a result of these changes. Overall knowledge was widely distributed, and we did not observe a directional knowledge loss.We stress the importance to not directly conclude processes of knowledge loss, cultural erosion or acculturation when comparing the knowledge of different age groups.",

    "Abstract": "The developing synergy of legislation and research throughout recent history points to the current momentum behind college and career readiness for every student. Researchers have found that embedding academic content into career education improves student learning. Integrated learning can vary in approach and style and can be adjusted to fit into a multitude of environment designs. The purpose of this study was to investigate and corroborate the relationship between mathematical instructional design and student achievement. A mixed methods research design was utilized for collecting data. Qualitative data was collected from an electronic survey administered to 23 students taking a Geometry in Construction class at a Central Texas high school followed by a semi-structured interview with a focus group from the student sample. Classroom observation data was recorded from both a traditional geometry classroom and the Geometry in Construction classroom in order to provide additional insight into student perspectives related to course design. The convergent parallel design of the study included quantitative data that was collected during the same time period using pretest and posttest data sets from a traditional geometry class (control group) and the Geometry in Construction class (experimental group). Both data sets were brought together in an interpretive phase to analyze how student perceptions on learning align with student achievement scores. Results from this study revealed students who learn in an integrated learning environment where academic content is taught in a real-world context using hands-on, project-based learning perform better on academic achievement measures than do students who learn in a traditional classroom setting. While this study focused on one integrated learning model at one Central Texas high school, results indicated college and career readiness dimensions as identified by Conley (2010) are overall likely to be more naturally embedded in an instructional design geared toward rigorous and relevant knowledge application.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of reward type on knowledge contribution behavior. Individual knowledge contribution, which determines the effectiveness of information systems, benefits the organization at the cost of individual advantage as knowledge is usually considered highly private or even a source of individual prestige. Therefore, organizations provide rewards to compensate for their contributors’ knowledge loss. Surprisingly, some scholars report a positive relationship between reward and knowledge contribution, while others find this relationship to be insignificant or even negative. Based on regulatory focus theory, this study proposes and tests that such inconsistencies result from disparity between reward type and knowledge contribution measures. Design/methodology/approach: A between-group laboratory experiment with 144 undergraduate student is designed and hierarchical regression is applied to test the hypotheses. Findings: An incremental reward (additional reward for attaining outstanding achievements) aroused individual promotion focus, leading to an increase in self-perceived knowledge contribution (self-reported) and knowledge contribution quantity (experiment observers rated), but a decrease in knowledge contribution quality (peer rated). However, a decremental reward (deducted for errors) primed individual prevention focus, leading to an increase in self-perceived knowledge contribution (self-reported) and knowledge contribution quality (peer rated), but a decrease in knowledge contribution quantity (experiment observers rated). Originality/value: The findings help explain why previous empirical results on the reward-knowledge contribution relationship were inconsistent and add to extant literature by introducing a new theoretical perspective for understanding motivation in knowledge management research.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This randomized, prospective cohort study evaluated the long-term effects of text messaging oral health information and appointment scheduling reminders to parents of new patients at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Pediatric Dentistry Clinic. Six months after cessation of receiving the text messages, periodic oral exam (POE) appointment attendance, parental dental knowledge retention and behavior were compared to a control group who did not receive text messages. Furthermore, this study performed a program evaluation of the UCSF Pediatric Dentistry Clinic to identify factors influencing patients to not return for their POE appointments. Methods: Upon presenting for a new patient examination at the UCSF Pediatric Dentistry clinic, a convenience sample of 95 parent/child pairs was recruited. To qualify, patients needed to be aged between 1 and 6 years and be generally healthy with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of 1 or 2, and the parents had to be able to read and give consent in either English or Spanish. The parent-child pairs were randomized into two groups based upon order of presentation. The experimental group parents received text messages with oral health information every 3 weeks for one year and reminders to schedule 6-month POE appointments as well as (per clinic policy) a postcard reminding them to schedule 6-month POEs. The control group did not receive text messages with educational information or appointment reminders and instead only received the standard clinic policy postcard reminding them to schedule 6-month POE appointments. Data was collected regarding appointment attendance, oral health knowledge, and oral health behaviors at baseline, 6-month, 12-month, and 18-month appointments. Those who did not return for their 18-month appointments were sent an anonymous, single question survey via text message to determine what factors influenced their not returning for a POE appointment. Results: A significant difference in parent knowledge about when a child can brush his/her teeth by him/herself was noted over time in longitudinal models run within each group, but no significant difference was detected between the control and experimental groups over time. A longitudinal analysis of the behavioral data collected over time was not appropriate due to the low number of responses in multiple categories, but a trend toward more parental supervision when brushing was noted in the experimental group with statistically significant results reported between the two groups at both 6 months and 18 months. The factors found to most frequently influence POE appointment non-attendance were being unable to get through to the clinic phone to schedule an appointment, leaving a voice message and not receiving a return phone call, and moving away from the area. Conclusions: Although text messaging has become a common mode of communication in society today, text messaging oral health information did not result in significant differences in parental oral health knowledge or behavior over time. To improve patient POE appointment return rate, clinic telephone response protocols should be examined further to ensure that parents can easily schedule appointments over the phone directly or with a voicemail message. Further research must be completed using a larger sample size and higher study participant retention rate to determine if significant long-term differences exist between those who receive oral health text messages and appointment reminders versus those who do not.",

    "Abstract": "Background Traditional medicinal plant species documentation is very crucial in Ethiopia for biodiversity conservation, bioactive chemical extractions and indigenous knowledge retention. Having first observed the inhabitants of Gubalafto District (Northern Ethiopia), the author gathered, recorded, and documented the human traditional medicinal plant species and the associated indigenous knowledge. Methods The study was conducted from February 2013 to January 2015 and used descriptive field survey design. Eighty-four informants were selected from seven study kebeles (sub-districts) in the District through purposive, snowball, and random sampling techniques. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews, guided field walks, demonstrations, and focus group discussions with the help of guided questions. Data were organized and analyzed by descriptive statistics with SPSS version 20 and Microsoft Office Excel 2007. Results A total of 135 medicinal plant species within 120 genera and 64 families were documented. Among the species, Ocimum lamiifolium and Rhamnus prinoides scored the highest informant citations and fidelity level value, respectively. In the study area, Asteraceae with 8.1% and herbs with 50.4% plant species were the most used sources for their medicinal uses. A total of 65 ailments were identified as being treated by traditional medicinal plants, among which stomachache (abdominal health problems) was frequently reported. Solanum incanum was reported for the treatment of many of the reported diseases. The leaf, fresh parts, and crushed forms of the medicinal plants were the most preferred in remedy preparations. Oral application was the highest reported administration for 110 preparations. A majority of medicinal plant species existed in the wild without any particular conservation effort. Few informants (about 5%) had only brief notes about the traditional medicinal plants. Ninety percent of the respondents have learned indigenous medicinal plants knowledge from their family members and friends secretly. Orthodox Church schools were found the main place for 65% of healer’s indigenous knowledge origin and experiences. Elders, aged between 40 and 84 years, gave detailed descriptions about traditional medicinal plants. Conclusions Traditional medicinal plants and associated indigenous knowledge are the main systems to maintain human health in Gubalafto District. But minimal conservation measures were recorded in the community. Thus, in-situ and ex-situ conservation practices and sustainable utilization are required in the District.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of interactive learning technology in the classroom can impact knowledge retention among students as compared to classrooms where interactive learning technology was not utilized. Through a quasi-experimental design, the study explored non-cognitive factor relationships to knowledge retention and post-test scores, comparing the results in undergraduate courses where instructors integrated interactive learning technology with undergraduate courses where instructors did not integrate learning technology. Descriptive, ANOVA, and ANCOVA statistical analyses were used to analyze knowledge retention and post-test scores as well as covariates from 215 students in undergraduate courses at one academic institution. The results revealed several important findings. First, there was a significant effect on both post-test scores and knowledge retention when audience response systems were integrated into the classroom. Second, the integration of audience response systems in the classroom effect on knowledge retention and post-test scores was significantly different from students in the online classroom who did not use audience response systems, despite having access to supplementary material when they took pre- and post-tests. Course topic and student status had no significant effect post-test scores or knowledge retention when audience response systems were integrated into the classroom. Finally, faculty status did have a significant effect on post-test scores and knowledge retention when audience response systems were integrated into the classroom. By understanding the non-cognitive factors that contribute to improve knowledge retention and post-test scores, institutions can improve their faculty members’ effectiveness and success in the classroom. Keywords: audience response system, knowledge retention, interactive learning techniques, pedagogy, student learning, course design.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Strong leadership and teaching skills are essential traits for faculty being trained as the first emergency medicine (EM) providers in their country. In Uganda, EM is not established as a specialty and the only EM providers are non-physician clinicians (NPCs) being trained by a foreign NGO, Global Emergency Care (GEC). The curriculum focuses on clinical knowledge and skills and there is no leadership or teacher training component. Methods: A week long course on leadership and teaching is described and evaluated for success using Kirkpatrick’s framework for learner-centered outcomes. The course was proposed by GEC and implemented as continuing education for professional development purposes. Course participants consisted of all 15 of the current NPCs trained in Uganda by GEC. Participants attended the week-long course which consisted of lectures, role-playing, and small group discussions, as well as completion and analysis of a personality self-assessment. The evaluation process consisted of an immediate post-course survey to measure learner satisfaction, a retrospective, pre/post self-assessment with a Likert-type scoring tool to measure knowledge gains, and a three-month follow up survey and structured interviews to measure knowledge retention and behavior change in practice. Results: All 15 NPCs participated in the course and evaluation process. Learner satisfaction was high with an average rating of 9.3 (on a 1–10 scale) for course content, amount learned, and use of time. The difference in pre-course and post-course scores were positive for all 23 competencies measured demonstrating positive knowledge gains across all content presented. Lastly, all 15 participants shared detailed examples of using different competencies in practice three months after the course finished. The most frequently mentioned themes were “giving and receiving feedback,” “delegating and assigning tasks,” and “communication.” Discussion/Conclusion: This course was a successful CE intervention in this setting as measured by Kirkpatrick’s framework. The most frequently mentioned concepts being used in practice point to the NPCs ability to take on leadership roles in this setting and shift the department away from the traditional physician-led culture. Further research and evaluation methods focused on the influence of culture and personalities on leadership education and translation into practice in an EM setting is needed.",

    "Abstract": "In today's dynamic learning environment, educational delivery methods have become increasingly diverse. Using a unique opportunity to assess three types of course delivery--face-to-face, interactive television (iTV), and purely online delivery--the authors look at both initial knowledge acquisition and the retention of this knowledge. The results indicate that the online class outperformed the face-to-face and iTV sections on the initial performance evaluation; however, knowledge retention was greater in the face-to-face and iTV sections. The authors' findings suggest that diverse educational delivery methods provide unique benefits to students, but these benefits vary in relation to immediate learning outcomes and knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Background Video-based feedback has been shown to aid knowledge retention, skills learning and improve team functionality. We explored the use of video-based feedback and low fidelity simulation for training rural healthcare workers along the Thailand-Myanmar border and Papua New Guinea (PNG) to manage medical emergencies effectively. Methods Twenty-four study participants were recruited from three Shoklo Malaria Research Unit clinics along the Thailand-Myanmar border and eight participants from Kudjip Nazarene Hospital, PNG. The teams were recorded on video managing a simulated medical emergency scenario and the video was used to aid feedback and assess performance using Observed Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) scoring and Team Emergency Assessment Measure (TEAM) questionnaire. The process was repeated post-feedback at both sites and at 6 weeks at the Thailand-Myanmar border site. Thailand-Myanmar border participants’ individual confidence levels and baseline knowledge (using OSCE scoring) were assessed before team assessment and feedback at week 1 and repeated post-feedback and at 6 weeks. Focus group discussions (FGD) were held at each Thailand-Myanmar border clinic at week 1 (8 participants at each clinic). Results Individual paired tests of OSCE scores showed significant improvement post-feedback at week 1 (p < 0.001) and week 6 (p < 0.001) compared to baseline OSCE scores. There was a trend for increased team OSCE scores compared to baseline at week 1 (p = 0.068) and week 6 (p = 0.109) although not significant. Thailand-Myanmar border TEAM scores demonstrated improvement post-feedback mainly in leadership, teamwork and task management which was sustained up to week 6. PNG showed an improvement mainly in teamwork and task management. The global rating of the teams’ non-technical performance at both sites improved post feedback and at week 6 on the Thailand-Myanmar border site. Self-rated confidence scores by Thailand-Myanmar border participants increased significantly from baseline following training at week 1 (p = 0.020), and while higher at 6 weeks follow up than at baseline, this was not significant (p = 0.471). The FGD revealed majority of participants felt that watching the video recording of their performance and the video-based feedback contributed most to their learning. Conclusion Video-assisted feedback resulted in an improvement in clinical knowledge, confidence and quality of teamwork for managing medical emergencies in two low resource medical facilities in South East Asia and the South Pacific.",

    "Abstract": "Software ecosystems can be viewed as socio-technical networks consisting of technical components (software packages) and social components (communities of developers) that maintain the technical components. Ecosystems evolve over time through socio-technical changes that may greatly impact the ecosystem’s sustainability. Social changes like developer turnover may lead to technical degradation. This motivates the need to identify those factors leading to developer abandonment, in order to automate the process of identifying developers with high abandonment risk. This paper compares such factors for two software package ecosystems, RubyGems and npm. We analyse the evolution of their packages hosted on GitHub, considering development activity in terms of commits, and social interaction with other developers in terms of comments associated to commits, issues or pull requests. We analyse this socio-technical activity for more than 30 and 60k developers for RubyGems and npm, respectively. We use survival analysis to identify which factors coincide with a lower survival probability. Our results reveal that developers with a higher probability to abandon an ecosystem: do not engage in discussions with other developers; do not have strong social and technical activity intensity; communicate or commit less frequently; and do not participate to both technical and social activities for long periods of time. Such observations could be used to automate the identification of developers with a high probability of abandoning the ecosystem and, as such, reduce the risks associated to knowledge loss.",

    "Abstract": "Technology is constantly changing the way employees work and interact with one another. As society moves from mechanical to digital technology, the way employees think and act in business will change by design. Using technology in training has become an important part of employee processes. While the employee pool is becoming more dependent on digital technology, researchers do not have a validated tool to assess this dependence or understand how such employees can be better accommodated. Furthermore, the training procedures for on-boarding employees have not changed to meet their new digital needs. New generations in the workforce will create a larger margin of difference in digital use at work. Younger generations have made use of digital technology for their entire lives. This changes the way they perceive technology and work processes. One such digital technology is the digital game. Digital games are being utilized with increasing frequency in educational settings, consumer products, and rewards programs; they are also beginning to make their way into the corporate training room. However, there is little to no research as to how effective they are with regard to employee performance or perceived efficacy. A new measurement instrument called the \"Digital Orientation\" Scale was developed herein (Study 1) in order to assess the digital affinity, dependence, and comfort of employees by assessing their usage and preferences in digital technology. This research outlines the scale development process for this measure, and provides evidence supporting the validity of the measure for the usage herein. Once a final version of the measure was created, the measure was used (Study 2) within an experiment attempting to assess potential differences in \"Digital Orientation\" in varied methods of training. With technologically savvy generations---specifically, Generations X and Y---now in the workplace, it is imperative that trainers learn how to train them in the most effective way. The current within-subjects 2 x 3 design tests the effects of Traditional, Digital, and Game-Based Training on participants with varying levels of \"Digital Orientation.\" Participants were subject to three different trainings for the on-boarding processes of three fictitious organizations. These varied in their level of digital participation, from Traditional Training to Digital Training and Game-Based Training. Participants were then given posttests after each training to assess their knowledge of the company, as well as a new assessment tool, the \"Digital Orientation\" Scale to measure their affinity, comfort, and dependency on technology. The researcher hypothesized relationships between \"Digital Orientation\" and other variables such as age and short-term knowledge retention during certain types of training (specifically Game-Based Training). Relationships with \"Digital Orientation\" and gender, education level, and preference in training type were also investigated. These were measured during and after the training modules. Results were analyzed using ANOVAs and Linear Regression tests. No relationship was found between high levels of \"Digital Orientation\" and short-term knowledge retention during Game-Based Training. Those with higher levels of \"Digital Orientation\" did prefer Game-Based Training, but no other relationships were found between \"Digital Orientation\" and training preferences. Those with higher \"Digital Orientation\" tend to be younger in age. Game-Based Training increased engagement for all participants. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "Educational Institutions are consistently looking for ways to prepare students for the competitive workforce. Various methods have been utilized to interpret human differences, such as learning preferences and motivation, in order to make the curriculum more valuable. The objective of this research was to determine the impact of new teaching methods on students' comprehension and knowledge retention within an undergraduate course. New technology and techniques tailored to the student's individual learning preferences were introduced into the course. The teaching methods utilized in the research included: 1) traditional face-to-face lectures, 2) TED-Ed videos, 3) Quizlet, 4) Scoop.It, 5) group project, and 6) homework assignments. The study surveyed students at the beginning and end of a semester to determine the impact on the student's experience. The survey assessed if implementing tools that catered to the student's specific learning preference would have an impact on his/her motivation. An analysis was performed using the Chi-Square test to examine how the student's educational experience improved through the application of the new course tools. The results showed the tools had a positive impact on the student's learning experience. The analysis also suggests that students experienced a change in motivation throughout the semester. This shows that more investigation is required in order to identify causes for the motivational shifts.",

    "Abstract": "The potential knowledge loss from Baby Boomer generation employee retirements can negatively affect information systems organizations. The purpose of this hermeneutic phenomenology study was to explore the lived experiences of the leaders and managers of information systems organizations as they tried to maintain operational continuity after Baby Boomer worker retirements. The impact of this issue was the operational continuity after the Baby Boomer worker retirement. The social impact of this issue was the knowledge loss events that might result in business loss or even bankruptcy. McElroy's knowledge life cycle model was the conceptual framework for this study that included knowledge production and knowledge integration processes within a feedback loop. The lived experiences of 20 knowledgeable participants who had experienced institutional knowledge loss from retired Baby Boomer generation employees were captured through purposeful sampling. Data were collected through individual interviews using either face-to-face or a web conferencing tool such as Skype and analyzed through a modified Van Kaam. Five themes were identified: business climate, delivery practices, work processes, camaraderie, and management response. Significant attributes that added to the body of knowledge were workplace navigation, alternate focus, and outsourcing management. The results of the study may enable organizations to be better able to understand and manage the Baby Boomer knowledge loss effects and subsequently create systems to help maintain their competitive edge and avoid knowledge loss that might result in business loss or even bankruptcy.

    "Abstract": "Spaced education is a novel method that improves medical education through online repetition of core principles often paired with multiple-choice questions. This model is a proven teaching tool for medical students, but its effect on resident learning is less established. We hypothesized that repetition of key clinical concepts in a \"Clinical Pearls\" format would improve knowledge retention in medical residents. BACKGROUND Spaced education is a novel method that improves medical education through online repetition of core principles often paired with multiple-choice questions. This model is a proven teaching tool for medical students, but its effect on resident learning is less established. We hypothesized that repetition of key clinical concepts in a \"Clinical Pearls\" format would improve knowledge retention in medical residents.This study investigated spaced education with particular emphasis on using a novel, email-based reinforcement program, and a randomized, self-matched design, in which residents were quizzed on medical knowledge that was either reinforced or not with electronically-administered spaced education. Both reinforced and non-reinforced knowledge was later tested with four quizzes. METHODS This study investigated spaced education with particular emphasis on using a novel, email-based reinforcement program, and a randomized, self-matched design, in which residents were quizzed on medical knowledge that was either reinforced or not with electronically-administered spaced education. Both reinforced and non-reinforced knowledge was later tested with four quizzes.Overall, respondents incorrectly answered 395 of 1008 questions (0.39; 95% CI, 0.36-0.42). Incorrect response rates varied by quiz (range 0.34-0.49; p = 0.02), but not significantly by post-graduate year (PGY1 0.44, PGY2 0.33, PGY3 0.38; p = 0.08). Although there was no evidence of benefit among residents (RR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.83-1.22; p = 0.95), we observed a significantly lower risk of incorrect responses to reinforced material among interns (RR = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.70-0.99, p = 0.04). RESULTS Overall, respondents incorrectly answered 395 of 1008 questions (0.39; 95% CI, 0.36-0.42). Incorrect response rates varied by quiz (range 0.34-0.49; p = 0.02), but not significantly by post-graduate year (PGY1 0.44, PGY2 0.33, PGY3 0.38; p = 0.08). Although there was no evidence of benefit among residents (RR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.83-1.22; p = 0.95), we observed a significantly lower risk of incorrect responses to reinforced material among interns (RR = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.70-0.99, p = 0.04).Overall, repetition of Clinical Pearls did not statistically improve test scores amongst junior and senior residents. However, among interns, repetition of the Clinical Pearls was associated with significantly higher test scores, perhaps reflecting their greater attendance at didactic sessions and engagement with Clinical Pearls. Although the study was limited by a low response rate, we employed test and control questions within the same quiz, limiting the potential for selection bias. Further work is needed to determine the optimal spacing and content load of Clinical Pearls to maximize retention amongst medical residents. This particular protocol of spaced education, however, was unique and readily reproducible suggesting its potential efficacy for intern education within a large residency program.

    "Abstract": "Medical students require a strong foundation in normal histology. However, current trends in medical school curricula have diminished time devoted to histology. Thus, there is a need for more efficient methods of teaching histology. We have developed a novel software program (Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource; https://pcs-webtest0.pathology.washington.edu/academics/pattern/) that uses annotated whole slide images to teach normal histology. Whole slide images of a wide variety of tissues were annotated by a trainee and validated by an experienced pathologist. Still images were extracted and transferred to the Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource web application. In Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource, an image was displayed briefly and the user was forced to identify the tissue type. The display time changed inversely based on cumulative accuracy to challenge the user and maintain engagement. A total of 129 second-year medical students completed the 30-minute Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource module. Surveys showed an increase in confidence from premodule (0% extremely confident, 4% very, 47% somewhat, and 49% not) to postmodule (9% extremely confident, 57% very, 32% somewhat, and 2% not), P < .0001. Accuracy increased from 72.6% pretest to 95.7% posttest, P < .002. The effect size (Cohen d = 2.30) was very large, where 0.2 is a small effect, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 large. Ninety-six percent of students would recommend Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource to other medical students, and 98% would use Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource to further enhance their histology knowledge. Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource drastically improved medical student accuracy in classifying normal histology and improved confidence. Additional study is needed to determine knowledge retention, but Novel Diagnostic Educational Resource has great potential for efficient teaching of histology given the curriculum time constraints in medical education.Medical students require a strong foundation in normal histology.

Waste is any activity that produces no value for the customer or user. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to identify and describe different types of waste in software development. Method: Following Constructivist Grounded Theory, we conducted a two-year five-month participant-observation study of eight software development projects at Pivotal, a software development consultancy. We also interviewed 33 software engineers, interaction designers, and product managers, and analyzed one year of retrospection topics. We iterated between analysis and theoretical sampling until achieving theoretical saturation. Results: This paper introduces the first empirical waste taxonomy. It identifies nine wastes and explores their causes, underlying tensions, and overall relationship to the waste taxonomy found in Lean Software Development. Limitations: Grounded Theory does not support statistical generalization. While the proposed taxonomy appears widely applicable, organizations with different software development cultures may experience different waste types. Conclusion: Software development projects manifest nine types of waste: building the wrong feature or product, mismanaging the backlog, rework, unnecessarily complex solutions, extraneous cognitive load, psychological distress, waiting/multitasking, knowledge loss, and ineffective communication.",

Over the past 5 years we have gone on a journey starting with a very small group of electricians focused on creating and delivering training to their peers. In 2015 this had blossomed to 160 electricians across four different areas in our plant attending our electrical safety training course and a plan to have all 300+ electricians' plant wide attend the training in 2016. This paper will discuss some of the roadblocks that were faced, such as a large knowledge gap due to hiring freezes and attrition, along with a major shift in the company moving away from both senior electrical leadership, as well as direct electrical front line supervision. We will also discuss the successes along the road and how we were able to engage all the employees across several different age demographics and bring them together to reach a common understanding when it comes to electrical safety and the standards we are held to.",

    "Abstract": "A leadership and quality improvement project was undertaken in order to assist undergraduate baccalaureate nursing students in knowledge retention for medication administration during their senior semester in nursing school. Specific changes in curriculum were implemented to assist these undergraduate baccalaureate nursing students at a suburban private university in New York. It was found that by changing two specific learning strategies in the spring semester of junior year, there was increased knowledge retention during the fall semester of the senior year. This article discusses the advantages and challenges of using technology, how change occurred in the nursing program and how nursing leadership was demonstrated to help implement change.

    "Abstract": "Many teachers create multimedia resources for their students, but most are uncertain as to what factors to consider regarding the design of multimedia instructional materials. Prior research identified instructional design principles for multimedia including the coherence principle and voice principle. The purpose of this study was to test the coherence principle in a realistic setting using a heterogeneous group of ninth grade students in a humanities course to determine the effect of seductive details on retention and problem-solving transfer. To extend understanding of the voice principle, this study examined the effect of the teacher's voice on student learning as measured by retention and problem-solving transfer. Additionally, the study explored the relationship between prior knowledge, retention, and problem-solving transfer. Accordingly, the study, a 2 x 2 factorial design used a convenience sample of 134 ninth grade students enrolled in a Christian Sexuality course in an urban, co-ed high school in the San Francisco Bay Area. Students were randomly assigned to one of four groups for the four multimedia packages delivered over a month: No Seductive Details/Teacher Voice, No Seductive Details/Different Teacher Voice, Seductive Details/ Teacher Voice, or Seductive Details/ Different Teacher Voice. Students completed a prior knowledge inventory first and a retention inventory and problem-solving transfer inventory after each multimedia package. Eight two-way ANOVAs were conducted to determine differences in performance between the groups. One statistically significant main effect for the seductive details condition, F(1, 121) = 4.32, p < .05 , d = 0.36 , was observed for problem-solving transfer in Video 1. In contrast to prior research conducted in laboratory settings, there was no seductive details effect observed. No statistically significant differences for voice were observed, but the descriptive statistics revealed a trend of improving scores for both retention and transfer for different teacher voice suggesting that social agency theory does not explain previous voice principle research. Prior knowledge was positively associated with transfer for teacher's voice and with retention with different teacher's voice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Enhanced knowledge retention and a preference towards a deep learning approach are desirable pedagogical outcomes of case-based learning (CBL). The CBL literature is sparse with respect to these outcomes, and this is especially so in the area of biochemistry. The present study determined the effect of CBL vs. non CBL on knowledge retention in an undergraduate biochemistry course; it also investigated associations of learning approach, age and gender. Methods: We used the Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire, a retention test, final exam grades and other demographic information to statistically compare academic outcomes of students subjected to either CBL or non-CBL active learning techniques. Results: We showed that students exposed to CBL in a second year course performed significantly better on a retention test conducted nine months after the final exam, and that there was a positive correlation between a deep learning approach and higher retention scores. We did not find an association between gender and age with the retention of biochemistry concepts. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that use of CBL in undergraduate biochemistry education may confer benefits in terms of retention of knowledge of key concepts.",

    "Abstract": "Research on problem-based learning (PBL) has tended to focus on the graduate level of education, paying less attention to the primary school level and to what is involved for students during the implementation of PBL. In this paper we take a step towards addressing this need for research by reporting findings from a descriptive, explanatory case study of a one-year PBL intervention in a fifth-grade (ages 10-11) mathematics classroom in Taiwan. We documented and analysed the students' actions to reveal details in their part in the intervention. We compared the students' performances on the five researcher-designed written tests, which were conducted at different points in time. Our findings cast light on the level of the students' participation in PBL. The comparison between the test results shows improvements in students' understanding of the concepts and supports the idea that PBL has positive effects on long-term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Educational institutions are consistently looking for ways to prepare students for the competitive workforce. Various methods have been utilized to interpret human differences, such as learning preferences and motivation, in order to make the curriculum more valuable. The objective of this research was to determine the impact of new teaching methods on students' comprehension and knowledge retention within an undergraduate course. New technology and techniques tailored to the student's individual learning preferences were introduced into the course. The teaching methods utilized in the research included: 1) traditional face-to-face lectures, 2) TEDEd videos, 3) Quizlet, 4) Scoop.It, 5) group project, and 6) homework assignments. The study surveyed students at the beginning and end of a semester to determine the impact on the student's experience. The survey assessed if implementing tools that catered to the student's specific learning preference would have an impact on his/her motivation. An analysis was performed using the Chi-Square test to examine how the student's educational experience improved through the application of the new course tools. The results showed the tools had a positive impact on the student's learning experience. The analysis also suggests that students experienced a change in motivation throughout the semester. This shows that more investigation is required in order to identify causes for the motivational shifts.",

    "Abstract": "This paper provides a critical appraisal of the influence of examinations oriented approaches on quality education in primary schools in Kenya. The purpose of the study was to determine effects of examination oriented teaching approaches on learning achievement among primary school pupils in Kakamega County, Kenya. It explored the assumptions underlying pedagogical approaches as well as the negative influences of exam-oriented approaches in Kenyan schools. Examination oriented approaches don't address acquisition of practical skills, values, and attitudes in learners. The approaches merely concentrate on passing of national examinations by pupils. Globally, primary education is recognized as the pillar of any country that is expected to have the stable economy. Due to the role played by education in economic development and promotion of peace development, the United Nations (UN) general assembly in 1948 endorsed education as a fundamental human right. The purpose of the study is to interrogate the influence of examinations oriented approaches on quality education in primary schools. The paper examined the advances of United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in defining and actualizing quality education. The paper further assessed the role played by examinations in determining teaching approaches in schools. Instructional approaches play the crucial role in learning achievement of pupils. Appropriate approaches enhance achievement of competencies during the learning process. However, inappropriate methods affect knowledge retention negatively and lead to rote learning.The study was guided by transactional analysis theory as advanced Eric Berne in 1950. Transactional analysis is a method that facilitates communication between learners and teachers in a classroom environment. The theory illustrates how people have developed and how they treat themselves. It further outlines how people relate and communicate among themselves. This is actualized in the provision of suggestions and interventions which enable people to change and adjust to the environment. Flanders (1970), notes that teachers as initiators of communication adopt teaching methods based on their cognitive orientation. Through the pedagogy selected, the teacher communicates to learners in the classroom. Pupils are stimulated in order to achieve learning objectives. Flanders further developed a system of interaction analysis on the transaction that goes on in the classroom. The analysis came up with teacher-centered and learner-centered approaches. This study adopted by transactional analysis theory in order to analyze the influence exam oriented model of education on the use of convectional approaches by teachers in Kenyan primary schools. The qualitative property to be acquired is quality oriented model in primary school education. Inputs which lead to quality education in primary schools are the independent variables of this study. The outputs which culminate into outcomes of quality education are realized in quality indicators. The study had to examine the challenges of educational quality that arise due to pressure from examinations excellence. The study further examined how enrolment in primary schools influences examinations oriented approaches. Particular attention was given to the crises in inputs and processes that affect the output of quality primary education. These crises are reflected in class size, teacher establishment and physical resources that influence quality education. The study, therefore, focused on teaching approaches practiced by teachers in primary schools. The study adopted mixed methods of study. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches to research were used. Descriptive survey design was therefore adopted. It targeted a population of 536000 in Kakamega County, Kenya. The target population comprised of head teachers, teachers, and pupils. Purposive and simple random sampling was adopted to obtain the desired sample size. Using the descriptive survey design, data was collected using three sets of questionnaires. The reliability was estimated through use of Cranach's Alpha Coefficient using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19.0. Findings of the study revealed that examinations oriented approach negatively affect pupils' learning achievement. It is therefore anticipated that this study is significant as findings of the study may help in the formulation of education policies and legal framework which are geared towards curbing inequalities leading to the qualitative approach to primary school education. The policy implementers would also understand and appreciate education policies within which they are supposed to operate in providing effective leadership and management practices in the implementation of quality-based education at primary level. The study is also significant to the field of comparative and International education as it provides data on what the Kenyan government is doing in addressing equality and inequality in education leading to the development of quality based approach to primary school education. The study suggests moderate pressure to excel in school, as exam oriented approach can stifle a student's imagination, creativity and ultimate success the learning process. Inefficiency has infiltrated primary schools due to exam oriented system. It is there recommended that the government should come up with clear policy to redress inefficiency in primary schools to entrench quality education.",

    "Abstract": "With low levels of physical activity being linked to 6% of deaths worldwide (WHO, 2014), a change is needed. Students enrolled in colleges and universities are in a point of transition and of change in their lives. This change has resulted in a decrease in physical activity as focus shifts to academics and as interest in physical activity decreases. An intervention was created to provide a possible alternative to becoming inactive. The intervention consisted of a number of physical activity activities that were incorporated as homework assignments for students enrolled in a college wide general education wellness course. The physical activities were designed to vary in intensity to meet the challenges often expressed by students including a lack of time or equipment. All activities were approximately 20 minutes in length and required little to no equipment perfect for completion in a residence hall room. The results were examined using a repeated measures ANOVA examining not only physical activity levels by also physical activity knowledge retention at three points over a 23 week period. Of the three problem statements examined only the main problem could be evaluated as a result of low participation rates in certain demographics. Examining physical activity rates between groups lead to no significant differences based on intervention or non-intervention group. Similar results were found when comparing the two groups regarding physical activity knowledge retention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "Educators are continually searching for techniques to improve knowledge retention in the classroom. This research makes a case for employing agile techniques in pedagogical practices. The premise for the research is that poor knowledge retention exists because teaching typically follows a traditional waterfall approach, which studies show to be ineffective in software development. Agile software development, on the other hand, has gained acceptance due to its flexible approach and lightweight methodologies. The need for a flexible approach that adapts to students' needs and focuses on value should be the new norm in the classroom. The \"learn and forget\" style of rote learning should be discouraged. This research proposes that delivering the course in order of importance, constant stakeholder collaboration, and adapting the delivery based on feedback can improve learning and knowledge retention. Through a test-driven development approach, continuous planning and frequent feedback, the research further proposes that students feel valued and because of this iterative planning and feedback loop, can continuously align course objectives to desired learning throughout the process. The research focuses on agile principles to enhance the teaching delivery methods and student learning in the classroom. This research does not focus on agile practices such as Scrum or eXtreme Programming (XP). The main objective of the research is to determine if incorporating agile principles provides any benefits to knowledge retention. The researcher proposes that an agile approach will improve students' learning, retention, and satisfaction. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "Background: Knowledge sharing has been identified as the core process of knowledge management for institutions which are interested in the retention of knowledge invested in their human capital in the event of their departure from the institutions. To this end, knowledge sharing has been the focus of research institution-wide, and less focus has been paid to communities of practice (CoPs) within the South African public service. Objectives: This study aimed to explore factors that motivated knowledge sharing practices in a South African public service CoP. Method: This study used the mixed methods design through the lens of the motivational theory. Primary quantitative data were collected by means of self-administered questionnaires returned by 23 of the 31 KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Provincial Human Resource Development Forum (PHRDF) members to whom the questionnaires were distributed. In addition, primary qualitative data were collected from the senior managers of Human Resource Development (HRD) units from 10 different KZN Provincial Departments of the 14 managers requested. The quantitative analysis was established using SPSS software, whereas qualitative analysis was established using thematic codes with the NVIVO software. Results: The findings from the results revealed that PHRDF members were intrinsically motivated to share their knowledge rather than extrinsically motivated. Conclusion: Although literature confirmed the main barrier to knowledge sharing in organisations as being the unwillingness to share, CoPs were likely to reduce the extent to which knowledge sharing was hindered. Members of a CoP ultimately related to one another as homogeneous groups despite representing different departments. To this end, hedonic intrinsic motivation occurred as members shared knowledge for the good of the whole regardless of the absence of extrinsic motivation. Departmental silos fell away, and there was no anticipation of rewards or incentives for knowledge sharing. It is, therefore, imperative that the South African public service strategically positions CoPs as knowledge sharing platforms to curb the loss of knowledge when employees leave its employ for whatever reason.",

    "Abstract": "This article discusses how leakage of knowledge can occur in value creation networks embedded in knowledge-intensive firms, and how a collaborative approach can be utilized to minimize risk and increase sustainability. For knowledge to be preserved from unintentional outflow, its confidential nature and description must be understood at all levels. Loss of knowledge can occur at any point; whether it is through the process of consultation or when employees do their work. Forfeiture of information can be unintended or a planned effort. To prevent such unintended leakage, it is important to develop a shared mindset among employees to minimize the risk. The socio-technical system design is a philosophical framework that enables companies to simultaneously consider both ethical and technical systems in order to best match the technology and the people involved. History has shown through a number of situations that firms that failed to comprehend new opportunities were often limited by stakeholders' thoughts and actions.",

    "Abstract": "This study adopts the theory of planned behavior to understand and influence auditors’ knowledge-sharing behavior. Ajzen (1991) indicates that persuasive communications, such as belief-targeted messages, can be used as behavioral interventions to alter intentions and behaviors. Thus, this study develops and evaluates the effectiveness of behavioral interventions (belief-targeted messages) in encouraging auditors’ knowledge-sharing behavior. This study uses a 2×2 between-participants design. Arguments targeting behavioral beliefs and arguments targeting normative beliefs are manipulated. Consistent with expectations, the results of this study were that (1) auditors exposed to an intervention share more knowledge, compared to auditors not exposed to any interventions; (2) auditors share the most knowledge when exposed to an intervention that includes arguments targeting both behavioral and normative beliefs; (3) the effects of behavioral interventions on knowledge-sharing intention are mediated by auditors’ attitudes and perceived norms related to knowledge sharing; and (4) the influences of attitude and perceived norms on knowledge-sharing behavior are mediated by the intention to share knowledge. The findings of this study have implications for literature and practice. It extends the theory of planned behavior to the auditing setting and examines auditors’ knowledge-sharing behavior with the firm’s knowledge management systems (KMS). Knowledge sharing with the firm’s KMS could potentially mitigate knowledge loss for public accounting firms. The findings of this study provide guidelines to firms regarding how they can encourage knowledge sharing among auditors.",

    "Abstract": "Web-based learning resources have been criticized as being developed with minimal consideration as to the effectiveness of the design principles or guidelines used to create them. Extraneous material is oftentimes present and necessary for learners to engage in effective learning with multimedia learning material. Signaling learners towards important information between images and corresponding text has been shown to be an effective method for providing learners a way to quickly find information between the two parts of the learning material. However, not all signaling methods are equally effective in all applications. This study investigates a novel signaling method, using spatial isolation of text, as a way to signal learners in a web-based format compared to a traditional highlighting method and a non-signaled control group. Improved learning performance was observed for knowledge retention using text isolation as the signaling method, but no other significant effects were observed between the other conditions. Additionally, transfer of knowledge across all conditions showed no significant differences either. While minimal support for the effectiveness of isolated text signaling was demonstrated, the statistical means trend across all post-test knowledge assessments suggest that further evaluation of the novel signaling method is justified.",

    "Abstract": "This dissertation defines a new executive role of The Data Narrativist to address the emerging leadership needs of analytics organizations practicing data science. The Data Narrativist is designed to be an executive storyteller with expertise in the humanization of data driven communication. The Data Narrative Process provides an approach for managing exploratory analysis, analytics research, story creation and execution of data narratives. A new profile for this role is defined by a review of existing profiles from similar executive roles, a definition of emerging administrative roles, and an assessment of complementary methodologies. This thesis proceeds with an investigation into the structure and techniques of documentary film applied to the practice of creating narrative data visualization in video. Structural elements in documentary video are identified to engage a broad audience not formally trained in data visualization. An empirical analysis is performed using matched pairs of narrative visualization videos highlighting particular documentary techniques. With the accumulation of user preferences, voice over audio and the participatory mode are recommended to improve audience engagement of the analytical content. This work provides guidance for the construction of effective documentary narrative visualization videos as a form of enhanced data narrative. Documentary Data Narrative is incorporated into an evaluation of three unique types of enhanced data narrative to determine their effectiveness in knowledge transfer. Two examples of enhanced data narrative using data visualization are defined as Visual Data Narrative and Documentary Data Narrative. Another is defined as Computer Generated Text Data Narrative, constructed using Natural Language Generation (NLG) technology from the field of artificial intelligence. Together the three defined forms of enhanced data narrative are evaluated along with a traditional Human Generated Text Data Narrative. Each of the four types of data narrative is constructed from a common set of quantitative data measures regarding an earnings announcement for an established technology company. Based on the results of a set of knowledge retention questions, we perform a statistical analysis to determine the knowledge transfer performance for each form of data narrative. With this analysis we make observations about the effectiveness of the four discrete forms of data narrative. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "Background: Older adults with low health literacy are at increased risk of nonadherence, accidental drug exposure, and adverse events. Purpose: This study evaluated older adults' knowledge and awareness of medication safety and poison prevention resources using an interactive educational game compared to a less intensive intervention involving individual review of brochures. Methods: Both groups were given pre- and postintervention surveys to assess change in knowledge. Participants were followed up at 30 days to assess knowledge retention and behavior changes. Results: A total of 101 older adults participated in the study. In the game group, the median improvement in the index score pre- and postintervention was 3, moving from 9 (interquartile range [IQR] 6, 9) to 11 (IQR 9, 12). The brochure group median improvement was 1, moving from 7.5 (IQR 6, 8) to 8 (IQR 5, 10). Comparing postintervention to 30-day follow-up, over 50% of respondents retained the correct responses. Discussion: The interactive game significantly improved knowledge regarding use of child-resistant cap, interpreting a drug facts label, medication list documentation, and who to call for advice. Translation to Health Education Practice: This educational intervention has potential to increase awareness of poison prevention resources and medication safety strategies in older adults with low health literacy.",

    "Abstract": "Previous research has indicated the disconnect between example-based research focusing on worked examples (WEs) and that focusing on modeling examples. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the effect of four different types of examples from the two separate lines of research, including standard WEs, erroneous WEs, expert (masterly) modeling examples, and peer (coping) modeling examples, on student performance (knowledge retention, near transfer, and far transfer), cognitive load, and self-efficacy. One hundred and sixteen students participated in the study by undergoing computer-based instruction in one of the four versions differing in how examples were provided. The results showed that, overall, expert modeling examples were most effective in promoting knowledge retention, near transfer, and far transfer, while peer modeling examples were shown to be superior in fostering self-efficacy among the four different types of examples.",

    "Abstract": "This study has two primary objectives. The first one is preparation of an efficient review book including a series of activities, which will help fourth grade students exercise what they learned in the elementary science course in a year. The second objective is examination of the prepared book in the framework of student and teacher opinions. In this study, 10 classroom teachers are interviewed at the initial stage. As a result of these interviews, a significant need is determined for a review book for elementary science course, particularly. In the study, qualitative research methods, such as observation, interviews, document analysis and focus group discussion, are used. Data collection tools compose of review book for elementary science course, teacher interview forms, student focus group discussion form and forms, in which students evaluate all activities in the book. The review book prepared by the researchers consists of 38 activities. This book was applied to 25 fifth grade students. These interviews are supported with data of observation and document analysis. The obtained data are analyzed with the content analysis. The review book is considered efficient by teacher and students. This is because it can be applied within a short time and contains whole elementary science topics of fourth grade. Furthermore, teacher can specify students' prior knowledge at the beginning of the academic year and adjust the level and teaching methods in the course accordingly. It can also be used effectively throughout the term.",

Member loss and knowledge loss are the severe challenges for the KCN stability. This study explores the stability of KCN facing the member and knowledge loss based on the super-network model. Considering there mainly are two types of factors in KCN: members and their knowledge, a weighted super-network model for KCN is proposed by integrating the two types of node firstly. Based on the weighted super-network model, some stability metrics are proposed pertinently. Case study is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed model and stability analysis method.",

    "Abstract": "Background Audience response devices, or “clickers”, have been used in the education of future healthcare professionals for several years with varying success. They have been reported to improve the learning experience by promoting engagement and knowledge retention. In 2014, our department evaluated the use of “clickers” in a newly introduced multidisciplinary approach to teaching large groups of third year medical students clinical cases developed around a microbiology theme. Methods Six multidisciplinary teaching sessions covering community-acquired pneumonia, tuberculosis, infective endocarditis, peritonitis, bloodstream infection with pyelonephritis and bacterial meningitis were included in the study. Three involved the use of the “clickers” and three did not. Consenting undergraduate students attended the designated classes and afterwards answered a short online quiz relating to the session. Students also answered a short questionnaire about the “clickers” to gauge their attitudes on the use of these devices. Results Of 310 students, 294 (94.8%) agreed to participate in the study. Interestingly, the grades of online quizzes after a session where a “clicker” was used were slightly lower. Looking only at the grades of students who engaged completely with the process (n = 19), there was no statistical difference to suggest that the devices had a positive or negative impact on knowledge retention. However, student attitudes to using the devices were positive overall. Fifty-five percent strongly agreed and 27% agreed that teaching sessions where the “clickers” were used were more engaging. Thirty-four percent strongly agreed and 36% agreed that the “clickers” made important concepts more memorable and 54% felt the device enhanced their understanding of the topic being covered. Conclusions Overall, it appears that “clickers” help in improving student engagement in large classroom environments, enhance the learning experience, and are received positively by medical students but their impact on knowledge retention is variable.",

    "Abstract": "Higher student enrollment rates and evolving student expectations are current challenges for many universities. Today’s students expect teaching pedagogy that integrates technology and offers flexibility. Blended course designs provide both of these things because they include both face-to-face and online learning opportunities. Utilizing web-based learning platforms, now offered by many college textbook publishers, can also enhance a student’s online learning experience and performance. This research focuses on a blended-design general education nutrition course offered at Utah State University (USU). Prior to Fall2015, “Mastering” (Pearson Publishing) was the web-based learning platform being used in this course. A separate study, completed in 2015, assessed the efficacy of Mastery over two consecutive semester periods and concluded that it was ineffective in increasing students’ final letter grade or improving knowledge retention. As a result, Mastering was replaced by anew web-based learning platform, called “Connect” (McGraw Hill Publishing). One of the purposes of this study was to evaluate Connect. Students who used Connect earned higher final grades and showed increased knowledge retention rates at the end of the semester compared to students who had used the old platform (Mastering). When below-average and above-average pre-test score groups were compared, there was no statistical difference between Mastering and Connect on students' knowledge retention rates on a post-test administered 4 months after course completion. We also found that, like Mastering, the knowledge retention rate for students who used Connect increased the most among the students who scored the lowest on an initial assessment of nutrition-related knowledge. One complaint of blended courses that students often report is a feeling of disconnection or decreased engagement. A second part of this research measured self-reported rates of student satisfaction and engagement to determine the effect, if any, of additional technological tools (Google+, for example) and greater interaction and support from a graduate-level teaching assistant (TA). Compared to the class without the additional tools and TA support, final grade, course satisfaction level, and student attendance rate improved in the classes that did incorporate these things. A student engagement survey was given at the beginning and end of the semester to measure the change in the engagement level during the semester. Interestingly, freshman students earned higher final grades than upper class men and student engagement rates decreased as the semester progressed. Overall, the Connect platform and the additional tools and TA support had desirable effects, including greater student-reported levels of course satisfaction and improved academic performance. Also, it appears that these additional components helped at-risk students the most–especially freshmen students and students who scored low on the pre-test that measured existing nutrition knowledge at the beginning of the course.",

It is important to pass on the cultural knowledge to the next generation. Intangible Cultural Heritage like traditional dances, or folk dance is a valuable cultural knowledge to be maintained and passed on by transferring tacit knowledge, and even explicit knowledge such as books, or video presentations. Issues of passing on the knowledge can be the loss of knowledge from time to time by the reduction of the number of dance masters, unreliable sources, and low quality. To retrieve such valuable knowledge, there is a widely-used tool in Europe, in the United States, Asia and Southeast Asia, called “Labanotation” which is about recording and analyzing the dance movement. This paper focuses on proposing a framework for a traditional Thai dance knowledge archive creating an ontology using knowledge engineering based on Labanotation by transferring notation scores to represent the dance in 3D Animation. The framework assists dancers, notators, knowledge engineers, software engineers to successfully communicate with each other.",

    "Abstract": "Problem-based Learning (PBL) is one of the most effective methods of instruction that helps Visual Effects (VFX) students to be more adaptable at encountering career challenges in Malaysia. These challenges are; lack of several important requirements such as, the basic and fundamental knowledge of VFX concepts, the ability to understand real-world problems and to convert ideas into VFX solutions, the ability to attain and retain up-to-date knowledge of VFX concepts, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to come up with solutions to real-world problems. Its role in helping students; thus, encompasses improving the level of meaningfulness of their learning experience, and their skills in terms of comprehension, knowledge retention, problem-solving, self-directed learning, as well as interpersonal skills. The use of PBL helps VFX students to cope with the encounters of the career challenges in Malaysia that may be enhanced by focusing on a faculty-wide approach as compared to applying it on a course at a time. Moreover, such methods of enhancing VFX education delivery in Malaysia are to encourage reflective practices and PBL based dialogues on VFX, and to increase the level of VFX competence of instructors through improved training methods.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine which academic and affective student factors were significant to student success in a mastery learning program in developmental mathematics and to determine if the mastery learning program led to increased mathematical knowledge retention and success in the subsequent math course. The first phase of the study involved 298 students in developmental mathematics. Using binary logistic regression, the researcher found that placement test score, previous experience with mastery learning, and gender were statistically significant factors related to student success in the mastery learning program. The second phase of the study involved 529 students in the subsequent course intermediate algebra. Using one-way analysis of variance and chi-square methods, the researcher found that mastery learning students retained significantly more mathematical content knowledge and succeeded at significantly higher rates in the subsequent course intermediate algebra as compared to students who took developmental mathematics through traditional methods and those who opted out of placement testing. Results of the study showed that the mastery learning approach in developmental mathematics which incorporated the affective student domain offered advantages for assisting students to overcome math background and self-efficacy barriers.

    "Abstract": "The single most important role of the security function within an organization is to protect property, people, and assets. While this protection is one of the most expensive countermeasures in an organization, it is critical to every organizational security system. An important decision of security management is whether to hire proprietary security officers or to contract out these services to a security services agency. Among the factors considered in this decision process are costs, flexibility, and the level of commitment of the officers. Since security departments do not generate revenue there are advantages to using contract security officers to reduce costs, however, this can lead to major obstacles within the profession. Organizational leaders looking to make a profit may opt for the lowest priced security solutions which can elicit underpaid, undertrained, and under supervised security officers. These factors combined can increase turnover because more qualified staff leave for better job opportunities. Not only is employee turnover expensive, but turnover is linked to loss of knowledge capital and weakens the organization's reputation. The problem addressed in this study was turnover intention among contract security officers. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships of key work-related attitudes and turnover intention among contract security officers. The population studied was security officers employed by a contract organization and located at a client organization within the United States. Data was collected through a custom online survey using previously validated scales. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationships among the variables using Pearson product moment correlations and step wise regression analysis. To conduct a linear or multiple regression the differences between actual values and predicted values (residuals) must be independent. Independence of residuals was confirmed for all hypotheses using the Durbin-Watson test. The Durbin-Watson has a scale range from 0.0 to 4.0, with a value of 2.0 indicating no autocorrelation between actual and predicted values. The results of this Durbin-Watson value for hypothesis one was 2.11, for hypothesis two was1.89, for hypothesis three was 1.91, and for hypothesis four was 2.19; which meets the assumption.

    "Abstract": "If a dictator or an external invader fails to restore order with the force of arms, the only remedy Providence provides is the return to a condition analogous to the primitive barbarity in which the fear and shame first instilled an ethical consciousness.81 Even though Williams may not subscribe to Vico's fear that scepticism would bring about the imminent destruction of civilization, he shares with Vico the conviction that reflection upon ethical knowledge is not only unable to construct stable principles but inevitably serves to destroy the knowledge that had been acquired with pre-reflective states.82 The anxiety that ensues from this loss of knowledge spurs Vico to insist in the closing lines of the Scienza nuova on the cultivation of piety; as it is only religion, even in an age of philosophic reflection, that can provide the necessary security for the state.83 Since religious virtue is founded upon the emotions of fear and shame, these emotions continue to function as the basis of ethical knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "Software development is a highly intensive knowledge process. Information, data, knowledge and experiences are accumulated daily and it is crucial that they are managed appropriately for the purpose of sharing and future reuse. Today, software development has spread across geographical boundaries; therefore, the need for knowledge retention has risen, and the need for collaboration among the community of practice has been further in demand. Based on this motivation, we posit a model of managing the experiences of software development process by using experience based factory approach. An initial conceptual model has been constructed based on relevant theoretical frameworks which include knowledge management, experience factory, software development process, community of practice, technology and infrastructure, and influences from managerial and organizational levels. Based on the literature review, questionnaire items have been designed to form the identified latent constructs. A pilot survey has been conducted to verify the questionnaire items and the results are tested against Rasch measurement analysis. By using Rash logit measures, the items' quality is ensured. Findings indicate that the item fitness is good (0.73), outfit and infit mean square values are very much close to 1, and Z-standardized value is within the expected range. Unidimensionality shows that there is no visible secondary dimension even though the scale category structure is rather high. Nonetheless, there are several misfitting items which are further calibrated and revised for future study. The initial model will be the basis of the future model development.",

    "Abstract": "Finding ways to help nursing students understand the application of didactic content can be challenging for faculty. One challenge faculty face is motivating students with thought provoking and memorable content using traditional methods. Educational games and gaming attributes have been shown to affect student motivation and support learning. The aim of this study was to gain knowledge, filling a knowledge gap, regarding which gaming attributes motivate nursing students to become engaged in course content that is not graded. Badges were used as a reward system to examine if nursing students would complete an increased number of non-graded case studies, and have a higher score on the posttest than when badges were not used. Data was collected using an A-B single group design during two consecutive specialty courses. A one-tailed dependent t-test was used to compare the average scores of case study posttests and the average number of case studies completed during both phases. All participants were nursing students in a three-year accelerated baccalaureate degree program attending a college of nursing located in the southwest. There was no significant difference with the use of badges on the average scores of case studies t (24) = -1.332, p =0.1. However, there was a significant difference with the use of badges on the number of completed case studies t (24) = -2.5, p =0.01. This study adds empirical evidence to the literature that gamification attributions positively influences student motivation and continued engagement in course content. Findings demonstrated a significant difference in the engagement of nursing students in non-graded coursework during the course where badges were offered as rewards as opposed to the course where badges were not offered as rewards. As technology savvy Millennials fill the classrooms and nursing faculty search for new teaching strategies to engage their students, the results of this study promotes the use of badging as a way to actively engage nursing students in course content. Additional research with a larger sample is recommended to support the findings and examine the effect gamification attributions have on knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "The paper aims to identify the individuals who influence the knowledge sharing processes from an internal social network and to forecast the future knowledge flows that may cross it. Exploratory research is employed, and a four-phase methodology is developed which combines a social network analysis with structural modeling. This is applied to the internal enterprise social network used by a British insurance company. The main results emphasize the most influential groups, their relationships, future knowledge flows, and the connection between the networks heterogeneity and structure, and employees' future knowledge sharing intention. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications. The theory is extended by proving that a social network analysis can be used as a tool for evaluating and predicting future knowledge flows. At the same time, a solution is offered to decision-makers so they will be able to: (I) identify the potential knowledge loss; (ii) determine leaders; (iii) establish who is going to act as a knowledge diffuser, by sharing what they know with their coworkers, and who is going to act as a knowledge repository, by focusing on acquiring increasingly more knowledge; (iv) identify the elements that influence employees' future knowledge sharing intention.",

    "Abstract": "As medical knowledge grows exponentially and healthcare systems continue to utilize interdisciplinary care, it is essential that physical therapy (PT) graduates be prepared to practice efficiently and effectively on healthcare teams. Team-based learning (TBL) is a teaching pedagogy used in medicine to improve academic performance and teamwork skills. However TBL's use in physical therapy education has not been well documented. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of TBL in a Gross Anatomy laboratory using the following outcome measures: active learning, deep learning, teamwork, academic performance, and knowledge retention. TBL was substituted for one half of cadaveric prosection time during the laboratory portion of a DPT (Doctor of Physical Therapy) Gross Anatomy course. Comparisons were made between the traditional laboratory group (n = 101) and the TBL laboratory group (n = 109). Academic performance was assessed both in the Gross Anatomy course and in subsequent coursework (Kinesiology). Student surveys were used to make comparisons between groups, and interviews evaluated student and faculty perceptions of TBL and teamwork. The substitution of TBL for prosection time was effective for improving scores on mean unit examinations (p = 0.006), and on Kinesiology questions (p = 0.049), but knowledge retention on a one-year retention test did not improve. TBL was most effective for students with the lowest undergraduate science and cumulative GPA scores (p <0.001 and p = 0.02 respectively). TBL improved student attitudes towards working with peers and towards collaboration as a means for success both as students and as professionals (p < 0.001). Interview information supported the survey findings. Data from this study indicate that using TBL in a Gross Anatomy laboratory is effective in generating an active learning environment, elevating academic performance, deepening learning, and improving perceptions of teamwork.

    "Abstract": "The paper aims to identify the individuals who influence the knowledge sharing processes from an internal social network and to forecast the future knowledge flows that may cross it. Exploratory research is employed, and a four-phase methodology is developed which combines a social network analysis with structural modeling. This is applied to the internal enterprise social network used by a British insurance company. The main results emphasize the most influential groups, their relationships, future knowledge flows, and the connection between the network's heterogeneity and structure, and employees' future knowledge sharing intention. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications. The theory is extended by proving that a social network analysis can be used as a tool for evaluating and predicting future knowledge flows. At the same time, a solution is offered to decision-makers so they will be able to: (i) identify the potential knowledge loss; (ii) determine leaders; (iii) establish who is going to act as a knowledge diffuser, by sharing what they know with their coworkers, and who is going to act as a knowledge repository, by focusing on acquiring increasingly more knowledge; (iv) identify the elements that influence employees' future knowledge sharing intention.",

We fear there may be a loss of knowledge and awareness of detecting TB in the new generation of medical specialists. As medical specialists a great challenge lies before us in maintaining the quality of TB control in the Netherlands.

Here we describe how, in the region of Arnhem, we work closely with these medical specialists based on structural multidisciplinary meetings. We also describe two of the quality indicators - doctor's delay and HIV testing policy - which are included in the national plan for TB control for 2016-2020.

    "Abstract": "Objective. To compare the effectiveness of face-to-face and online team-based learning (TBL) to teach phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Design. A TBL format was used to teach an online cohort of 222 pharmacy students and two face-to-face cohorts (Tampa and Las Vegas) of pharmacy students. Students in all cohorts completed individual and team readiness tests (iRATs and tRATs), and a self-assessment survey to determine teamwork and content understanding. Knowledge retention questions also were added to the final examination. Assessment. Mean scores on iRATs were: 54% for the Tampa group; 72% for the Las Vegas group; and 58% for the online. Mean tRAT scores were 78.5% for the Tampa cohort and 82.2% for the Las Vegas cohort, compared to 89.5% for the online cohort. The mean tRAT scores for the online cohorts were significantly higher than those of the face-to-face cohorts. Data from the teamwork survey provided evidence of positive interactions among teams for all cohorts. Conclusion. Team-based learning can be an effective method for teaching applied pharmacokinetics in both face-to-face and online classes.Objective.

    "Abstract": "Knowledge reduction is one of the key issues in knowledge discovery and data mining. During the construction of a concept lattice, it has been recognized that computational complexity is a major obstacle in deriving all the concept from a database. In order to improve the computational efficiency, it is necessary to preprocess the database and reduce its size as much as possible. Focusing on formal fuzzy contexts, we introduce in the paper the notions of granular consistent sets and granular reducts and propose granular reduct methods in the sense of reducing the attributes. With the proposed approaches, the attributes that are not essential to all the object concepts can be removed without loss of knowledge and, consequently, the computational complexity of constructing the concept lattice is reduced. Furthermore, the relationship between the granular reducts and the classification reducts in a formal fuzzy context is investigated.

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG BACKGROUND: Indigenous populations are undergoing rapid ethnobiological, nutritional and socioeconomic transitions while being increasingly integrated into modernizing societies. To better understand the dynamics of these transitions, this article aims to characterize the cultural domain of food plants and analyze its relation with current day diets, and the local perceptions of changes given amongst the Ngäbe people of Southern Conte-Burica, Costa Rica, as production of food plants by its residents is hypothesized to be drastically in recession with an decreased local production in the area and new conservation and development paradigms being implemented. METHODS: Extensive freelisting, interviews and workshops were used to collect the data from 72 participants on their knowledge of food plants, their current dietary practices and their perceptions of change in local foodways, while cultural domain analysis, descriptive statistical analyses and development of fundamental explanatory themes were employed to analyze the data. RESULTS: Results show a food plants domain composed of 140 species, of which 85 % grow in the area, with a medium level of cultural consensus, and some age-based variation. Although many plants still grow in the area, in many key species a decrease on local production–even abandonment–was found, with much reduced cultivation areas. Yet, the domain appears to be largely theoretical, with little evidence of use; and the diet today is predominantly dependent on foods bought from the store (more than 50 % of basic ingredients), many of which were not salient or not even recognized as ‘food plants’ in freelists exercises. While changes in the importance of food plants were largely deemed a result of changes in cultural preferences for store bought processed food stuffs and changing values associated with farming and being food self-sufficient, Ngäbe were also aware of how changing household livelihood activities, and the subsequent loss of knowledge and use of food plants, were in fact being driven by changes in social and political policies, despite increases in forest cover and biodiversity. CONCLUSIONS: Ngäbe foodways are changing in different and somewhat disconnected ways: knowledge of food plants is varied, reflecting most relevant changes in dietary practices such as lower cultivation areas and greater dependence on food from stores by all families. We attribute dietary shifts to socioeconomic and political changes in recent decades, in particular to a reduction of local production of food, new economic structures and agents related to the State and globalization.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG BACKGROUND: The Republic of Georgia (Sakartvelo in Georgian language) is part of the Caucasus biodiversity hotspot, and human agricultural plant use dates bat at least 6000 years. However, little ethnobiological research has been published from the region since the 1940s. Given the lack of recent research in the region, the present study we report on plant uses in Skartvelo (Republic of Georgia), Caucasus. We hypothesized that, (1) given the long tradition of plant use, and the isolation under Soviet rule, plant use both based on homegardens and wild harvesting would be more pronounced in Georgia than in the wiser region, (2) the Soviet occupation would have had broad influence on plant use, and (3) there would still be incidence of knowledge loss despite wide plant use. METHODS: Fieldwork was conducted in Khevsureti, Samtskhe-Javakheti, Tusheti, Svaneti, and Racha in July–August 2013, July–August 2014, and September–October 2015. Interviews using semi-structured questionnaires were conducted with 170 participants (80 women and 90 men) after obtaining their oral prior informed consent. All interviews were carried out in the participants’ homes and gardens by native speakers of Georgian and its local dialects (Svan, Tush, Khevsur, Psav), or, where participants spoke these as their native language, Armenian, Russian, or Greek. RESULTS: In the present study we encountered 480 plant species belonging to 249 genera of 95 families being used in the research region. The highest number of species and of unique species were reported from the remote Tusheti-Khevsureti region. Informant consensus and number of use reports were highest for each region in the food and medicinal use categories. Of the 480 plants being used in the research region 282 species were exclusively wild-harvested, 103 were grown in homegardens, and 84 were both grown in gardens and sourced in the wild. CONCLUSIONS: Plant species, and uses, found in our study, both for Georgia in general, as well as for its regions, showed clear relations to the wider Caucasus - Asia Minor - Balkans cultural complex. However, plant use in Georgia was much more diverse than reported in other studies from Eurasia.",

    "Abstract": "The use of games in education represents a promising tool to motivate and engage students in their learning process. Most of previous research on the topic has focused to develop theoretical frameworks or to conduct experiments as a means to analyse learning outcomes such as knowledge retention, problem-solving skills gains or attitudes toward game-based learning. Nevertheless, little research has focused on providing a comprehensive literature review, which will help researchers to better understand how this stream of research has evolved over the last years. In this study, we use a bibliometric, social network and text mining analysis in order to provide useful up-to-date information to picture the state of the art about current research and evolution of the topic. Analysis on a sample of 139 articles published in top journals over the last 5 years (2010-2014) allowed identifying relevant authors and institutions, key constructs and themes involved, and trends of knowledge development. Main findings suggest an increasing academic interest on the topic over the last 5 years and a wide variety of constructs that were clustered in four main themes that we named: (i) \"effectiveness,\" (ii) \"acceptance,\" (iii) \"engagement\" and (iv) \"social interactions.\" Future research lines are also addressed.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyse knowledge retention strategies at selected banks in South Africa. A comparative analysis of knowledge retention strategies at two leading South African banks underpinned the focus of this study. The importance of retaining organizational knowledge assets is highlighted in this study. A survey research design was used to collect quantitative data from middle-level managers at selected banks. All usable quantitative data were collected from middle-level managers through the use of Survey Monkey and Zoomerang - an online survey platform. The quantitative data were analysed through the use of Microsoft Excel 2010. One of the shortcomings of using the quantitative research methodology was failure to ask probing questions where questionnaires were used. The study established that selected banks did not have formal knowledge retention strategies. From the findings, there was no specific knowledge management (KM) policy guideline to inform selected banks on how to retain organizational knowledge; however, there is was an acknowledgement of the presence of communities of practice, mentoring and apprenticeship, subject matter experts, leveraging retirees, knowledge portals and storytelling. In this study, originality was premised on setting down a major piece of new information utilizing the General Knowledge Model premised on four KM practices, namely, CREATION, SHARING, TRANSFER and RETENTION. These four KM practices should be recognized as fundamental pillars of KM.",

    "Abstract": "Background Point-of-care ultrasound (POC-US) is gaining importance in almost all specialties. E-learning has been used to teach theoretical knowledge and pattern recognition. As social media are universally available, they can be utilized for educational purposes. We wanted to evaluate the utility of the sandwich e - learning approach defined as a pre-course e-learning and a post-course learning activity using Facebook after a one-day point-of-care ultrasound (POC-US) course and its effect on the retention of knowledge. Methods A total of 62 medial students were recruited for this study and randomly assigned to one of four groups. All groups received an identical hands-on training and performed several tests during the study period. The hands-on training was performed in groups of five students per instructor with the students scanning each other. Group 1 had access to pre-course e-learning, but not to post-course e-learning. Instead of a pre-course e-learning, group 2 listened to presentations at the day of the course (classroom teaching) and had access to the post-course learning activity using Facebook. Group 3 had access to both pre- and post-course e-learning ( sandwich e - learning) activities, while group 4 listened classroom presentations only (classroom teaching only). Therefore only groups 2 and 3 had access to post-course learning via Facebook by joining a secured group. Posts containing ultrasound pictures and videos were published to this group. The students were asked to “like” the posts to monitor attendance. Knowledge retention was assessed 6 weeks after the course. Results After 6 weeks, group 3 achieved comparable results when compared to group 2 (82.2 % + −8.2 vs. 84.3 + −8.02) ( p  = 0.3). Students who participated in the post-course activity were more satisfied with the overall course than students without post-course learning (5.5 vs. 5.3 on a range from 1 to 6). Conclusions In this study, the sandwich e - learning approach led to equal rates of knowledge retention compared to classroom lectures and post-course learning. Students appreciate new media for learning experiences and are more satisfied with their learning activity. The sandwich e-learning can be used to maximize hands-on training during courses.",

    "Abstract": "The use of games in education represents a promising tool to motivate and engage students in their learning process. Most of previous research on the topic has focused to develop theoretical frameworks or to conduct experiments as a means to analyse learning outcomes such as knowledge retention, problem-solving skills gains or attitudes toward game-based learning. Nevertheless, little research has focused on providing a comprehensive literature review, which will help researchers to better understand how this stream of research has evolved over the last years. In this study, we use a bibliometric, social network and text mining analysis in order to provide useful up-to-date information to picture the state of the art about current research and evolution of the topic. Analysis on a sample of 139 articles published in top journals over the last 5years (2010-2014) allowed identifying relevant authors and institutions, key constructs and themes involved, and trends of knowledge development. Main findings suggest an increasing academic interest on the topic over the last 5years and a wide variety of constructs that were clustered in four main themes that we named: (i) effectiveness, (ii) acceptance, (iii) engagement and (iv) social interactions. Future research lines are also addressed. Lay Description What is currently known about the use of games in education: * Games can increase students' intrinsic motivation to learn. * Games support active learning. * Games facilitate scaffolded instruction based on each individual student's needs. What this paper adds to this:* This study identifies the most relevant researchers in this research area. * This study identifies the most relevant institutions involved in this research area. * This study identifies the main topics and themes researched by researchers. * This study identifies the main methodological approach used by researchers. Findings for practitioners:* Relevant researchers and institutions to collaborate with. * Topics and themes under research. * Methods used to research the use of games in education.",

DESIGN Prospective, randomized study.Patients undergoing an initial IVFA investigation. PARTICIPANTS Patients undergoing an initial IVFA investigation.Three groups of 26 patients (N = 78) naïve to the IVFA procedure were included. Groups 1 and 2 consisted of patients undergoing IVFA for diagnostic purposes. Group 1 received the IVFA information via standard physician-patient interaction to obtain standard consent. Group 2 received IVFA information by watching an nWBA explaining the purpose, method, and risks of the diagnostic test to obtain informed consent. Group 3 comprised patients who were not scheduled to undergo IVFA. This group was exposed to both the standard and nWBA consent. All groups completed a 6-question knowledge quiz to assess retained information and a survey to reflect on the consent experience.

    "Abstract": "Five essential elements have been identified as critical components of successful cooperative learning: 1) positive interdependence; 2) individual accountability; 3) promotive interaction; 4) small group skills; and 5) group processing. Cooperative learning has been studied in formal and informal educational and organizational settings around the world and has been found to be an effective means for improving: higher-level reasoning, knowledge transfer, knowledge retention, persistence to succeed, networking relationships and social support.",

    "Abstract": "English ENG English Background: Patient self-management after organ transplant surgery is complex and requires a high degree of knowledge to prevent complications. The teach-back technique can be used to confirm patient knowledge and clarify misunderstandings when preparing patients for discharge, but it requires practice in order for it to be effective. Standardized patient simulation can be an effective way to train registered nurses to provide patient education such as teach-back. Method: Authentic learning theory guided the design of education that allowed registered nurses who care for kidney transplant patients to practice and demonstrate the teach-back process in a simulation center using standardized patients. Results: Outcomes included learner satisfaction, learners viewing the activity as useful to the real-work environment, knowledge retention three months after the event, a statistically significant increase in confidence with teach-back, high levels of self-reported application of teach-back in clinical practice, and a decrease in kidney transplant 30-day readmission rates. Conclusions: Standardized patient simulation for teach-back education with registered nurses was effective and should be considered in the educational design for topics that require communication.

    "Abstract": "This study investigated the effects of problem-based learning (PBL) on knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention in a controlled experiment in a lab setting. Eighty-eight first-year psychology students were randomly assigned to either a PBL condition, a lecture condition, or a self-study condition. All participants had the opportunity to study the same text. Their knowledge acquisition was tested on both an immediate post-test and a delayed post-test, one week later. The results showed beneficial effects for the PBL group on the immediate and the delayed test compared to the lecture group. There were no differences between knowledge acquisition scores for the self-study condition and either of the other conditions. Moreover, no differences on knowledge retention were shown, because the decline in performance over time was equal in all conditions. In conclusion, the present study provides experimentally based evidence of the disadvantageous effects of instruction through lectures compared to PBL.",

    "Abstract": "The use of games in education represents a promising tool to motivate and engage students in their learning process. Most of previous research on the topic has focused to develop theoretical frameworks or to conduct experiments as a means to analyse learning outcomes such as knowledge retention, problem-solving skills gains or attitudes toward game-based learning. Nevertheless, little research has focused on providing a comprehensive literature review, which will help researchers to better understand how this stream of research has evolved over the last years. In this study, we use a bibliometric, social network and text mining analysis in order to provide useful up-to-date information to picture the state of the art about current research and evolution of the topic. Analysis on a sample of 139 articles published in top journals over the last 5years (2010-2014) allowed identifying relevant authors and institutions, key constructs and themes involved, and trends of knowledge development. Main findings suggest an increasing academic interest on the topic over the last 5years and a wide variety of constructs that were clustered in four main themes that we named: (i) effectiveness, (ii) acceptance, (iii) engagement and (iv) social interactions. Future research lines are also addressed. Lay Description What is currently known about the use of games in education: Games can increase students' intrinsic motivation to learn. Games support active learning. Games facilitate scaffolded instruction based on each individual student's needs. What this paper adds to this: This study identifies the most relevant researchers in this research area. This study identifies the most relevant institutions involved in this research area. This study identifies the main topics and themes researched by researchers. This study identifies the main methodological approach used by researchers. Findings for practitioners: Relevant researchers and institutions to collaborate with. Topics and themes under research. Methods used to research the use of games in education.",

    "Abstract": "E-learning is the use of internet-based resources in education. In the field of surgical education, this definition includes the use of virtual patient cases, digital modeling, online tutorials, as well as video recordings of surgical procedures and lectures. In recent years, e-learning has increasingly been considered a viable alternative to traditional teaching within a number of surgical fields. Here we present (1) a systematic review of literature assessing the efficacy of e-learning modules for orthopedic education and (2) a discussion of their relevance. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was conducted according to the guidelines defined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA). The search yielded a total of 255 non-duplicate citations that were screened using predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. A total of 9 full text articles met inclusion criteria, which included the use of an objective outcome measure to evaluate an orthopedic e-learning module. Six studies assessed knowledge using a multiple-choice test and 4 assessed skills using a clinical exam. All studies showed positive score improvement pre- to post-intervention, and a majority showed greater score improvement than standard teaching methods in both knowledge (4/6 studies) and clinical skills (3/4 studies). E-learning represents an effective supplement or even alternative to standard teaching techniques within orthopedic education for both medical students and residents. Future work should focus on validating specific e-learning programs using standardized outcome measures and assessing long-term knowledge retention using e-learning platforms.E-learning is the use of internet-based resources in education.

    "Abstract": "The use of games in education represents a promising tool to motivate and engage students in their learning process. Most of previous research on the topic has focused to develop theoretical frameworks or to conduct experiments as a means to analyse learning outcomes such as knowledge retention, problem‐solving skills gains or attitudes toward game‐based learning. Nevertheless, little research has focused on providing a comprehensive literature review, which will help researchers to better understand how this stream of research has evolved over the last years. In this study, we use a bibliometric, social network and text mining analysis in order to provide useful up‐to‐date information to picture the state of the art about current research and evolution of the topic. Analysis on a sample of 139 articles published in top journals over the last 5 years (2010–2014) allowed identifying relevant authors and institutions, key constructs and themes involved, and trends of knowledge development. Main findings suggest an increasing academic interest on the topic over the last 5 years and a wide variety of constructs that were clustered in four main themes that we named: (i) effectiveness , (ii) acceptance , (iii) engagement and (iv) social interactions . Future research lines are also addressed. Lay Description What is currently known about the use of games in education: Games can increase students' intrinsic motivation to learn. Games support active learning. Games facilitate scaffolded instruction based on each individual student's needs. What this paper adds to this: This study identifies the most relevant researchers in this research area. This study identifies the most relevant institutions involved in this research area. This study identifies the main topics and themes researched by researchers. This study identifies the main methodological approach used by researchers. Findings for practitioners: Relevant researchers and institutions to collaborate with. Topics and themes under research. Methods used to research the use of games in education.

    "Abstract": "Point-of-care ultrasound (POC-US) is gaining importance in almost all specialties. E-learning has been used to teach theoretical knowledge and pattern recognition. As social media are universally available, they can be utilized for educational purposes. We wanted to evaluate the utility of the sandwich e-learning approach defined as a pre-course e-learning and a post-course learning activity using Facebook after a one-day point-of-care ultrasound (POC-US) course and its effect on the retention of knowledge. A total of 62 medial students were recruited for this study and randomly assigned to one of four groups. All groups received an identical hands-on training and performed several tests during the study period. The hands-on training was performed in groups of five students per instructor with the students scanning each other. Group 1 had access to pre-course e-learning, but not to post-course e-learning. Instead of a pre-course e-learning, group 2 listened to presentations at the day of the course (classroom teaching) and had access to the post-course learning activity using Facebook. Group 3 had access to both pre- and post-course e-learning (sandwich e-learning) activities, while group 4 listened classroom presentations only (classroom teaching only). Therefore only groups 2 and 3 had access to post-course learning via Facebook by joining a secured group. Posts containing ultrasound pictures and videos were published to this group. The students were asked to \"like\" the posts to monitor attendance. Knowledge retention was assessed 6 weeks after the course. After 6 weeks, group 3 achieved comparable results when compared to group 2 (82.2 % + -8.2 vs. 84.3 + -8.02) (p = 0.3). Students who participated in the post-course activity were more satisfied with the overall course than students without post-course learning (5.5 vs. 5.3 on a range from 1 to 6). In this study, the sandwich e-learning approach led to equal rates of knowledge retention compared to classroom lectures and post-course learning. Students appreciate new media for learning experiences and are more satisfied with their learning activity. The sandwich e-learning can be used to maximize hands-on training during courses.",

    "Abstract": "The optimal design of pedagogical strategies for e-learning in graduate and postgraduate medical education remains to be determined. Video-based e-learning use is increasing, with initial research suggesting that taking short breaks while watching videos (independent of answering test questions) may improve learning by focusing attention on the content presented. Interspersed test questions may also improve knowledge acquisition and retention. BACKGROUND The optimal design of pedagogical strategies for e-learning in graduate and postgraduate medical education remains to be determined. Video-based e-learning use is increasing, with initial research suggesting that taking short breaks while watching videos (independent of answering test questions) may improve learning by focusing attention on the content presented. Interspersed test questions may also improve knowledge acquisition and retention.To examine the effect of interspersed test questions and periodic breaks on immediate knowledge acquisition and retention at 6 months by pediatric residents engaged in video-based e-learning. OBJECTIVE To examine the effect of interspersed test questions and periodic breaks on immediate knowledge acquisition and retention at 6 months by pediatric residents engaged in video-based e-learning.First- and second-year pediatric residents were randomized to 1 of the following 3 groups: viewing the complete video uninterrupted (full video), viewing the video interrupted with unrelated logic puzzles (logic puzzles), or viewing the video interrupted with brief comprehension test questions (short answer questions). Residents answered pre- and post-tests before and after video viewing, followed by a retention test at 6 months. Primary outcome included comparison of the change in test scores between groups. METHODS First- and second-year pediatric residents were randomized to 1 of the following 3 groups: viewing the complete video uninterrupted (full video), viewing the video interrupted with unrelated logic puzzles (logic puzzles), or viewing the video interrupted with brief comprehension test questions (short answer questions). Residents answered pre- and post-tests before and after video viewing, followed by a retention test at 6 months. Primary outcome included comparison of the change in test scores between groups.A total of 49 residents completed the initial testing session. All 3 learning groups had comparable mean increases in immediate knowledge gain, but with no significant differences between groups (F 2,46 =0.35, P=.71). Thirty-five residents completed retention testing with comparable degrees of knowledge retention in the full video and short answer test questions groups (P<.001), but no significant change in the logic puzzles group (F 1,32 =2.44, P=.13). RESULTS A total of 49 residents completed the initial testing session. All 3 learning groups had comparable mean increases in immediate knowledge gain, but with no significant differences between groups (F2,46=0.35, P=.71). Thirty-five residents completed retention testing with comparable degrees of knowledge retention in the full video and short answer test questions groups (P<.001), but no significant change in the logic puzzles group (F1,32=2.44, P=.13).Improved knowledge gain was not demonstrated among residents answering interspersed questions or completing logic puzzles during interrupted online video viewing when compared with residents viewing uninterrupted video content. However, residents who either participated in uninterrupted video viewing or answered interspersed questions during interrupted video viewing demonstrated significant knowledge retention at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS Improved knowledge gain was not demonstrated among residents answering interspersed questions or completing logic puzzles during interrupted online video viewing when compared with residents viewing uninterrupted video content. However, residents who either participated in uninterrupted video viewing or answered interspersed questions during interrupted video viewing demonstrated significant knowledge retention at 6 months.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The optimal design of pedagogical strategies for e-learning in graduate and postgraduate medical education remains to be determined. Video-based e-learning use is increasing, with initial research suggesting that taking short breaks while watching videos (independent of answering test questions) may improve learning by focusing attention on the content presented. Interspersed test questions may also improve knowledge acquisition and retention. Objective: To examine the effect of interspersed test questions and periodic breaks on immediate knowledge acquisition and retention at 6 months by pediatric residents engaged in video-based e-learning. Methods: First- and second-year pediatric residents were randomized to 1 of the following 3 groups: viewing the complete video uninterrupted (full video), viewing the video interrupted with unrelated logic puzzles (logic puzzles), or viewing the video interrupted with brief comprehension test questions (short answer questions). Residents answered pre- and post-tests before and after video viewing, followed by a retention test at 6 months. Primary outcome included comparison of the change in test scores between groups. Results: A total of 49 residents completed the initial testing session. All 3 learning groups had comparable mean increases in immediate knowledge gain, but with no significant differences between groups ( F 2,46 =0.35, P =.71). Thirty-five residents completed retention testing with comparable degrees of knowledge retention in the full video and short answer test questions groups ( P <.001), but no significant change in the logic puzzles group ( F 1,32 =2.44, P =.13). Conclusions: Improved knowledge gain was not demonstrated among residents answering interspersed questions or completing logic puzzles during interrupted online video viewing when compared with residents viewing uninterrupted video content. However, residents who either participated in uninterrupted video viewing or answered interspersed questions during interrupted video viewing demonstrated significant knowledge retention at 6 months.",

BACKGROUND Each year new undergraduate courses are emerging in Mozambique, and with them the number of students has been increasing exponentially. In higher education institutions, particularly in the health sciences, knowledge retention becomes essential for learning and for efficient and effective training of capable health professionals.This is a prospective cohort study, conducted at the Lurio University, Mozambique. To evaluate the assimilation and retention of knowledge, a theoretical lesson was taught. The class time was 90 minutes divided into a theoretical stageand the other was a discussion stage (30 minutes) for clarification of doubts. Questionnaire was administered in the pretest, post-test and after six months. METHODOLOGY This is a prospective cohort study, conducted at the Lurio University, Mozambique. To evaluate the assimilation and retention of knowledge, a theoretical lesson was taught. The class time was 90 minutes divided into a theoretical stageand the other was a discussion stage (30 minutes) for clarification of doubts. Questionnaire was administered in the pretest, post-test and after six months.Of all students ( n = 241), enrolled in the second semester of the first year of the course, 190 students did the pretest, 187 did the post-test and 183 students did the test after six months. Before the lecture none of the course managed to achieve the satisfactory percentage of 75% of correct answers ( p <0,001). Assimilation of knowledge in the post-test performance there has been a significant increase in knowledge, in all questions the students reached the recommended percentage as \"satisfactory knowledge\" ( p < 0.001). The post-test suggests that participants in this study had a significant capacity of memorization which is essential in the retention of knowledge.

    "Abstract": "Background/context Average retention rates for passive teaching rates range from 5% for lectures to 30% for demonstrations. This dramatically increases when participatory teaching methods are employed to 75% for simulation (Attr. National Training Laboratories). Although these figures are often quoted in literature and form the learning pyramid they are unsubstantiated. Methodology Three groups of staff undertaking core training for blood transfusion were selected and taught identical content but using increasing levels of technology. The control group had the organisations standard didactic lecture. The second group received the lecture but were engaged (Draper, 2004) by an interactive handset. The final group lecture was based around a simulated patient who required a blood transfusion. Treatment decisions and actions were decided by the class. A volunteer nurse completed the actions voted for by the learners via the handsets, even if they were incorrect. Small micro teaches would follow each action to ensure knowledge of correct procedure was reinforced. At the end of the lesson, the learners were invited to complete an evaluation form. A month later they were contacted via email to undertake a short online questionnaire to demonstrate knowledge recall. Results Although all three groups rated the lessons with little difference in scores. The interesting results were found in the post lesson questionnaire. The control group scored lower averages than the technology-enhanced groups. Conclusion There seems to be a strong link between knowledge retention and the use of technology enhanced learning. Although small, it would be interesting to repeat this study with more participants over a longer term, looking for a reduction in blood transfusion related errors. However a lot of research into TEL aims for high level translational outcome data, but proving the learning has taken place should support a change in practice and ultimately safer patient care.

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to design a one-hour brain dissection protocol for a medical neuroscience course and evaluate the short and long-term effects of its implementation on medical students. First-year medical students (n = 166) participated in a brain dissection activity that included dissection of the basal nuclei and associated deep brain structures. Short-term retention was assessed by administering identical pre- and post-activity tests involving identification of brain structures. Following the brain dissection, the students' posttest scores were significantly higher (68.8% ± 17.8%; mean percent score ± SD) than their pretest scores (35.8% ± 20.0%) (P = 0.0001). Long-term retention was evaluated by conducting an identical assessment five months after completion of the course. Students who participated in the dissection activity (n = 80) had significantly higher scores (46.6% ± 23.8%) than the students who did not participate in the dissection activity (n = 85) (38.1% ± 23.9%) (P = 0.05). In addition to the long-term retention assessment, the NBME® Subject Examination scores of students who participated in the dissection activity were significantly higher than the students who did not participate in the dissection activity (P = 0.01). Results suggest that this succinct brain dissection activity may be a practical addition to an undergraduate medical neuroscience course for increasing the effectiveness of neuroanatomy training. This effect may have long-term benefits on knowledge retention and may be correlated with higher performance levels on standardized subject examinations.",

    "Abstract": "A destination management organization looking to integrate technology into its tourism offering tasked a living lab with engaging tourists and tourism providers in the process. At the end of the two-year initial funding period for an action research project, the process is a success and stakeholders are engaged in the innovation ecosystem. But what is next? By observing participants and gathering feedback from stakeholders through a Policy Delphi panel, the outcomes of the project and the intentions and actions of the tourism providers and other parties were identified. Innovation capacity has increased: spin-offs were created and stakeholders have embraced open and collaborative innovation. Now, stakeholders are determined to make the process sustainable by finding other funding sources. But what should be the level of cooperation and intervention? What level can best foster innovation and knowledge retention? A case study combining a grid of characteristics and levels of analysis for living labs was used to identify one key question: for a living lab in tourism, does scale matter? This article will explore that question and will contribute to the understanding of the living lab as a model of socio-territorial action.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The optimal design of pedagogical strategies for e-learning in graduate and postgraduate medical education remains to be determined. Video-based e-learning use is increasing, with initial research suggesting that taking short breaks while watching videos (independent of answering test questions) may improve learning by focusing attention on the content presented. Interspersed test questions may also improve knowledge acquisition and retention. Objective: To examine the effect of interspersed test questions and periodic breaks on immediate knowledge acquisition and retention at 6 months by pediatric residents engaged in video-based e-learning. Methods: First- and second-year pediatric residents were randomized to 1 of the following 3 groups: viewing the complete video uninterrupted (full video), viewing the video interrupted with unrelated logic puzzles (logic puzzles), or viewing the video interrupted with brief comprehension test questions (short answer questions). Residents answered pre- and post-tests before and after video viewing, followed by a retention test at 6 months. Primary outcome included comparison of the change in test scores between groups. Results: A total of 49 residents completed the initial testing session. All 3 learning groups had comparable mean increases in immediate knowledge gain, but with no significant differences between groups ( F 2,46 = 0.35, P = .71). Thirty-five residents completed retention testing with comparable degrees of knowledge retention in the full video and short answer test questions groups ( P < .001), but no significant change in the logic puzzles group ( F 1,32 = 2.44, P = .13). Conclusions: Improved knowledge gain was not demonstrated among residents answering interspersed questions or completing logic puzzles during interrupted online video viewing when compared with residents viewing uninterrupted video content. However, residents who either participated in uninterrupted video viewing or answered interspersed questions during interrupted video viewing demonstrated significant knowledge retention at 6 months.

    "Abstract": "This study investigated the effects of problem-based learning (PBL) on knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention in a controlled experiment in a lab setting. Eighty-eight first-year psychology students were randomly assigned to either a PBL condition, a lecture condition, or a self-study condition. All participants had the opportunity to study the same text. Their knowledge acquisition was tested on both an immediate post-test and a delayed post-test, one week later. The results showed beneficial effects for the PBL group on the immediate and the delayed test compared to the lecture group. There were no differences between knowledge acquisition scores for the self-study condition and either of the other conditions. Moreover, no differences on knowledge retention were shown, because the decline in performance over time was equal in all conditions. In conclusion, the present study provides experimentally based evidence of the disadvantageous effects of instruction through lectures compared to PBL.

Analysis was performed according to the intention to treat principle.We included 90 patients, 45 in each group; 27.8% had incomplete primary education. There were no differences between groups in the baseline. After orientation, IG scored 7.20 (±1.56) and scored CG 2.71 (±1.96, p<0,001). The topic \"surgical room\" had the lowest proportion of correct answers in CG (6.7%), compared to IG (68.9%). The question about \"postoperative unit\" was the one with the highest proportion of correct answers in IG (93.3%), while in CG the proportion was 22.2%. \"Ventilatory support\" had a low proportion of correct answers in IG (60%), but still much higher than the correct answers in CG (17.8%). RESULTS: We included 90 patients, 45 in each group; 27.8% had incomplete primary education. There were no differences between groups in the baseline. After orientation, IG scored 7.20 (±1.56) and scored CG 2.71 (±1.96, p<0,001). The topic \"surgical room\" had the lowest proportion of correct answers in CG (6.7%), compared to IG (68.9%). The question about \"postoperative unit\" was the one with the highest proportion of correct answers in IG (93.3%), while in CG the proportion was 22.2%. \"Ventilatory support\" had a low proportion of correct answers in IG (60%), but still much higher than the correct answers in CG (17.8%).Orientation performed with the aid of video resources is more effective for knowledge retention in preoperative patients, compared to verbal orientation alone. CONCLUSION: Orientation performed with the aid of video resources is more effective for knowledge retention in preoperative patients, compared to verbal orientation alone.",

    "Abstract": "English ENG English Background: High-fidelity simulation (HFS) is becoming an integral component in healthcare education programs. There is considerable evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of HFS on satisfaction and learning outcomes within undergraduate nursing programs; however, there are few studies that have investigated its use and effectiveness within nurse practitioner (NP) programs. Objective: To synthesize the best available evidence about the effectiveness of HFS within NP education programs worldwide. The specific review question was: what is the effect of HFS on learner satisfaction, knowledge, attitudes, and skill performance in NP education? Methods: Joanna Briggs Institute systematic review methodology was utilized. The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Epistemonikos, PROSPERO, HealthSTAR, AMED, Cochrane, Global Health and PsycINFO. Studies were included if they were quantitative in nature and reported on any aspect HFS within a NP program. Results: Ten studies were included in the review. All studies were conducted in the United States and published between 2007 and 2014. Outcomes explored included: knowledge, attitudes, skills and satisfaction. The majority of studies compared HFS to online learning or traditional classroom lecture. Most study scenarios featured high acuity, low frequency events within acute care settings; only two studies utilized scenarios simulated within primary care. Conclusions: There is limited evidence supporting the use of HFS within NP programs. In general, HFS increases students' knowledge and confidence, and students are more satisfied with simulation-based teaching in comparison to other methods. Future studies should explore the effectiveness of simulation training within NP programs in reducing the theory to practice gap, and evaluate knowledge retention, transferability to real patient situations, and impact of simulation on patient outcomes.

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to design a one-hour brain dissection protocol for a medical neuroscience course and evaluate the short and long-term effects of its implementation on medical students. First-year medical students (n=166) participated in a brain dissection activity that included dissection of the basal nuclei and associated deep brain structures. Short-term retention was assessed by administering identical pre- and post-activity tests involving identification of brain structures. Following the brain dissection, the students' posttest scores were significantly higher (68.8%±17.8%; mean percent score±SD) than their pretest scores (35.8%±20.0%) (P≤0.0001). Long-term retention was evaluated by conducting an identical assessment five months after completion of the course. Students who participated in the dissection activity (n=80) had significantly higher scores (46.6%±23.8%) than the students who did not participate in the dissection activity (n=85) (38.1%±23.9%) (P≤0.05). In addition to the long-term retention assessment, the NBME Subject Examination scores of students who participated in the dissection activity were significantly higher than the students who did not participate in the dissection activity (P≤0.01). Results suggest that this succinct brain dissection activity may be a practical addition to an undergraduate medical neuroscience course for increasing the effectiveness of neuroanatomy training. This effect may have long-term benefits on knowledge retention and may be correlated with higher performance levels on standardized subject examinations.

Studies were included if they were quantitative in nature and reported on any aspect HFS within a NP program. Results: Ten studies were included in the review. All studies were conducted in the United States and published between 2007 and 2014. Outcomes explored included: knowledge, attitudes, skills and satisfaction. The majority of studies compared HFS to online learning or traditional classroom lecture. Most study scenarios featured high acuity, low frequency events within acute care settings; only two studies utilized scenarios simulated within primary care. Conclusions: There is limited evidence supporting the use of HFS within NP programs. In general, HFS increases students' knowledge and confidence, and students are more satisfied with simulation-based teaching in comparison to other methods. Future studies should explore the effectiveness of simulation training within NP programs in reducing the theory to practice gap, and evaluate knowledge retention, transferability to real patient situations, and impact of simulation on patient outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to design a one-hour brain dissection protocol for a medical neuroscience course and evaluate the short and long-term effects of its implementation on medical students. First-year medical students (n = 166) participated in a brain dissection activity that included dissection of the basal nuclei and associated deep brain structures. Short-term retention was assessed by administering identical pre- and post-activity tests involving identification of brain structures. Following the brain dissection, the students' posttest scores were significantly higher (68.8% ± 17.8%; mean percent score ± SD) than their pretest scores (35.8% ± 20.0%) (P ≤ 0.0001). Long-term retention was evaluated by conducting an identical assessment five months after completion of the course. Students who participated in the dissection activity (n = 80) had significantly higher scores (46.6% ± 23.8%) than the students who did not participate in the dissection activity (n = 85) (38.1% ± 23.9%) (P ≤ 0.05). In addition to the long-term retention assessment, the NBME ® Subject Examination scores of students who participated in the dissection activity were significantly higher than the students who did not participate in the dissection activity (P ≤ 0.01). Results suggest that this succinct brain dissection activity may be a practical addition to an undergraduate medical neuroscience course for increasing the effectiveness of neuroanatomy training. This effect may have long-term benefits on knowledge retention and may be correlated with higher performance levels on standardized subject examinations.

    "Abstract": "Objective This goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of team-based learning (TBL) on knowledge retention compared to traditional lectures with small break-out group discussion (teaching as usual (TAU)) using a randomized controlled trial. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted during a daylong conference for psychiatric educators on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and the research literacy topic of efficacy versus effectiveness trials. Learners ( n  = 115) were randomized with concealed allocation to either TBL or TAU. Knowledge was measured prior to the intervention, immediately afterward, and 2 months later via multiple-choice tests. Participants were necessarily unblinded. Data enterers, data analysts, and investigators were blinded to group assignment in data analysis. Per-protocol analyses of test scores were performed using change in knowledge from baseline. The primary endpoint was test scores at 2 months. Results At baseline, there were no statistically significant differences between groups in pre-test knowledge. At immediate post-test, both TBL and TAU groups showed improved knowledge scores compared with their baseline scores. The TBL group performed better statistically on the immediate post-test than the TAU group (Cohen’s d  = 0.73; p  < 0.001), although the differences in knowledge scores were not educationally meaningful, averaging just one additional test question correct (out of 15). On the 2-month remote post-test, there were no group differences in knowledge retention among the 42 % of participants who returned the 2-month test. Conclusions Both TBL and TAU learners acquired new knowledge at the end of the intervention and retained knowledge over 2 months. At the end of the intervention day and after 2 months, knowledge test scores were not meaningfully different between TBL and TAU completers. In conclusion, this study failed to demonstrate the superiority of TBL over TAU on the primary outcome of knowledge retention at 2 months post-intervention.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Pediatric obesity is a significant public health problem with a prevalence of 16.9% among US children. School-based obesity interventions show promise for reducing adiposity in elementary age children. This pilot study evaluated the impact of the Let’s Go! 5-2-1-0 pediatric obesity intervention program in an elementary school setting. Methods: This was a cluster randomized controlled field trial comprising 8 classrooms of second- and third-grade children. The impact of implementation of a standardized 5-2-1-0 curriculum was evaluated in the classrooms by looking at health behavior (self-reported fruit and vegetable and sugar-containing beverage intake, and screen time), physical activity (steps measured by pedometer), and body mass index (BMI). Half of the classrooms were given 5-2-1-0 teaching over a 4-month period. Results: There was no statistical difference in improvement of healthy habits, BMI, or physical activity in the intervention group compared with the control group. Conclusions: The 5-2-1-0 intervention used in this study was feasible. There was no significant change in healthy habits, likely due to the small number of participants in the study. The intervention and control sites were in different classrooms and there could be factors such as teacher enthusiasm, socioeconomic factors, and individual traits affecting habits. Future studies could use pre- and post-intervention quizzes to assess healthy habits knowledge retention, involving the environments the child participates in outside of school, using research-grade pedometers or accelerometers for measuring activity data collection, and recruiting larger samples to ensure adequate statistical power.",

    "Abstract": "Enhanced podcasts increase learning, but evidence is lacking on how they should be designed to optimize their effectiveness. This study assessed the impact two learning instructional design methods (mental practice and modeling), either on their own or in combination, for teaching complex cognitive medical content when incorporated into enhanced podcasts. Sixty-three medical students were randomised to one of four versions of an airway management enhanced podcast: (1) control: narrated presentation; (2) modeling: narration with video demonstration of skills; (3) mental practice: narrated presentation with guided mental practice; (4) combined: modeling and mental practice. One week later, students managed a manikin-based simulated airway crisis. Knowledge acquisition was assessed by baseline and retention multiple-choice quizzes. Two blinded raters assessed all videos obtained from simulated crises to measure the students’ skills using a key-elements scale, critical error checklist, and the Ottawa global rating scale (GRS). Baseline knowledge was not different between all four groups ( p  = 0.65). One week later, knowledge retention was significantly higher for (1) both the mental practice and modeling group than the control group ( p  = 0.01; p  = 0.01, respectively) and (2) the combined mental practice and modeling group compared to all other groups (all p s = 0.01). Regarding skills acquisition, the control group significantly under-performed in comparison to all other groups on the key-events scale (all p s ≤ 0.05), the critical error checklist (all p s ≤ 0.05), and the Ottawa GRS (all p s ≤ 0.05). The combination of mental practice and modeling led to greater improvement on the key events checklist ( p  = 0.01) compared to either strategy alone. However, the combination of the two strategies did not result in any further learning gains on the two other measures of clinical performance (all p s > 0.05). The effectiveness of enhanced podcasts for knowledge retention and clinical skill acquisition is increased with either mental practice or modeling. The combination of mental practice and modeling had synergistic effects on knowledge retention, but conveyed less clear advantages in its application through clinical skills.",

    "Abstract": "To be successful in many undergraduate disciplines, students must retain base knowledge from lower level courses and apply that knowledge in upper level courses. Students may benefit and realize the importance of mastering basic concepts from the opportunity to utilize base knowledge in a real-world setting. Objectives of this project were to compare students ability to retain information after completing a real-world learning project (RWLP) to base knowledge retained from exams students took during the semester, and finally to determine student's perception of the RWLP. Incoming freshmen (n = 52, 79% female, 96% animal science majors) enrolled in an introductory equine science course worked independently to create a RWLP, specifically an educational bulletin (EB) for eight main topics studied during the course. The main topics were identified by the instructors as the most important topics to learn in an introductory horse science class, and included: identification, behavior, health, nutrition, activities, hoof care, parasite/disease, and reproduction. Students completed two assessments after the course was completed, the regular course exam quiz (REQ) which contained questions (n = 16; 2 questions from each main topic) the students had previously completed on exams and the educational bulletin quiz (EBQ) which contained questions (n = 16; 2 questions from each main topic) that were generated by the instructors from each student's EB. Students also completed a 3-question survey (Likert scale 1-5) regarding the influence of the EB on their understanding of the material, retention of material presented in class, and overall impression of the EB. Student scores on the REQ and EBQ were correlated (r = 0.54 and r = 0.39, respectively) to final course grade, but not to gender (-0.05 < r < 0.05). Students performed better (P < 0.0001) on questions from the EBQ compared to questions from the REQ. Students indicated they enjoyed completing the EB and perceived that they better understood basic information and expected to better retain the material as a direct result (4.5 ± 0.1, 4.72 ± 0.1, and 4.5 ± 0.4 on a 5 point scale, respectively). Students benefited from completing the EB project by better retaining key concepts taught during an introductory equine science course and the project was highly thought of by students. Disciplines that require students to retain key concepts from lower level courses for later use in upper level courses could benefit from a RWLP like the EB.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Traditionally, medical students on clinical rotations receive instruction on principles of mental health only during the psychiatry clerkship. We used emails to insert teaching of psychiatric concepts beyond the psychiatry clerkship into other rotations using the method of spaced learning, the delivery of brief morsels of information repeated over time intervals. We predicted that the intervention would improve attitudes and confidence towards the integration of psychiatry and knowledge retention. Methods: We developed and distributed a series of emails relating key psychiatric concepts targeted to the other core clerkships. Results: In a cluster-randomized trial over one academic year (intervention group n = 71, control group n = 61), scores on the Attitudes and Confidence in the Integration of Psychiatry scale and on the knowledge quiz did not differ significantly. Students who actively engaged with the emails demonstrated significantly higher scores on the knowledge test. Email users valued the timing, format of delivery and application of psychiatric principles outside the psychiatric setting. Participants recommended simplifying the format and previewing the benefits of spaced learning to increase utilization. Conclusion: Delivering spaced learning through emails, within a curriculum designed to foster engagement, may provide an efficient means of addressing the widely-recognized but elusive goal of integrating teaching across medical disciplines.

    "Abstract": "Background: Continuing education of health professionals is important for delivery of quality health care. Surgical nurses are often required to understand surgical procedures. Nurses need to be aware of the expected outcomes and recognize potential complications of such procedures during their daily work. Traditional educational methods, such as conferences and tutorials or informal education at the bedside, have many drawbacks for delivery of this information in a universal, standardized, and timely manner. The rapid uptake of portable media devices makes portable video media (PVM) a potential alternative to current educational methods. Objective: To compare PVM to standard verbal communication (SVC) for surgical information delivery and educational training for nurses and evaluate its impact on knowledge acquisition and participant satisfaction. Design: Prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled crossover trial. Setting: Two hospitals: Gosford District Hospital and Wyong Hospital. Participants: Seventy-two nursing staff (36 at each site). Intervention: Information delivery via PVM—7-minute video compared to information delivered via SVC. Outcome Measures: Knowledge acquisition was measured by a 32-point questionnaire, and satisfaction with the method of education delivery was measured using the validated Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). Results: Knowledge acquisition was higher via PVM compared to SVC 25.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.2-26.6) versus 24.3 (95% CI 23.5-25.1), p = .004. Participant satisfaction was higher with PVM 29.5 (95% CI 28.3-30.7) versus 26.5 (95% CI 25.1-27.9), p = .003. Following information delivery via SVC, participants had a 6% increase in knowledge scores, 24.3 (95% CI 23.5-25.1) versus 25.7 (95% CI 24.9-26.5) p = .001, and a 13% increase in satisfaction scores, 26.5 (95% CI 25.1-27.9) versus 29.9 (95% CI 28.8-31.0) p < .001, when they crossed-over to information delivery via PVM. Linking Evidence to Action: PVM provides a novel method for providing education to nurses that improves knowledge retention and satisfaction with the educational process.

    "Abstract": "Enhanced podcasts increase learning, but evidence is lacking on how they should be designed to optimize their effectiveness. This study assessed the impact two learning instructional design methods (mental practice and modeling), either on their own or in combination, for teaching complex cognitive medical content when incorporated into enhanced podcasts. Sixty-three medical students were randomised to one of four versions of an airway management enhanced podcast: (1) control: narrated presentation; (2) modeling: narration with video demonstration of skills; (3) mental practice: narrated presentation with guided mental practice; (4) combined: modeling and mental practice. One week later, students managed a manikin-based simulated airway crisis. Knowledge acquisition was assessed by baseline and retention multiple-choice quizzes. Two blinded raters assessed all videos obtained from simulated crises to measure the students' skills using a key-elements scale, critical error checklist, and the Ottawa global rating scale (GRS). Baseline knowledge was not different between all four groups (p = 0.65). One week later, knowledge retention was significantly higher for (1) both the mental practice and modeling group than the control group (p = 0.01; p = 0.01, respectively) and (2) the combined mental practice and modeling group compared to all other groups (all ps = 0.01). Regarding skills acquisition, the control group significantly under-performed in comparison to all other groups on the key-events scale (all ps = 0.05), the critical error checklist (all ps = 0.05), and the Ottawa GRS (all ps = 0.05). The combination of mental practice and modeling led to greater improvement on the key events checklist (p = 0.01) compared to either strategy alone. However, the combination of the two strategies did not result in any further learning gains on the two other measures of clinical performance (all ps > 0.05). The effectiveness of enhanced podcasts for knowledge retention and clinical skill acquisition is increased with either mental practice or modeling. The combination of mental practice and modeling had synergistic effects on knowledge retention, but conveyed less clear advantages in its application through clinical skills.",

    "Abstract": "The paper describes the design of a coherence model of instruction, which aims at a better understanding of curriculum in context and knowledge retention in long-term memory. The coherence model is built on four pillars: cooperative learning, activating teaching methods, instruction in authentic environment, or more precisely in educational expositions and spatial learning strategies. These strategies use a nonlinear representation of knowledge, such as dynamic semantic networks. Based on the principles of a coherence model of instruction an educational application for tablets was designed, developed and evaluated. This application serves as a virtual guide through the Ostrava Zoo and contains the following features: navigating through an educational exposition, multimedia and interactive information board, visualization of dynamic semantic networks, electronic worksheets and continuous testing of the pupil's contextual understanding of the actual curriculum. The evaluation of the coherence model of instruction and the virtual guide was carried out by three methods: observing the pupils' behaviour and work, a pedagogical experiment and evaluation questionnaires. This paper presents the results of the third method, evaluation questionnaire. One of the conclusions suggests that mobile technologies and mobile learning are not yet a completely ideal medium of instruction in outdoor educational expositions. These deficiencies can be partially overcome by specialized static devices installed directly at the place of the individual educational activities, wearable technology, the Internet of things, devices for augmented or virtual reality and finally ubiquitous learning.",

    "Abstract": "English ENG English Background. Continuing education of health professionals is important for delivery of quality health care. Surgical nurses are often required to understand surgical procedures. Nurses need to be aware of the expected outcomes and recognize potential complications of such procedures during their daily work. Traditional educational methods, such as conferences and tutorials or informal education at the bedside, have many drawbacks for delivery of this information in a universal, standardized, and timely manner. The rapid uptake of portable media devices makes portable video media (PVM) a potential alternative to current educational methods. Objective. To compare PVM to standard verbal communication (SVC) for surgical information delivery and educational training for nurses and evaluate its impact on knowledge acquisition and participant satisfaction. Design. Prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled crossover trial. Setting. Two hospitals: Gosford District Hospital and Wyong Hospital. Participants. Seventy-two nursing staff (36 at each site). Intervention. Information delivery via PVM?7-minute video compared to information delivered via SVC. Outcome Measures. Knowledge acquisition was measured by a 32-point questionnaire, and satisfaction with the method of education delivery was measured using the validated Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). Results. Knowledge acquisition was higher via PVM compared to SVC 25.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.2-26.6) versus 24.3 (95% CI 23.5-25.1), p = .004. Participant satisfaction was higher with PVM 29.5 (95% CI 28.3-30.7) versus 26.5 (95% CI 25.1-27.9), p = .003. Following information delivery via SVC, participants had a 6% increase in knowledge scores, 24.3 (95% CI 23.5-25.1) versus 25.7 (95% CI 24.9-26.5) p = .001, and a 13% increase in satisfaction scores, 26.5 (95% CI 25.1-27.9) versus 29.9 (95% CI 28.8-31.0) p",

    "Abstract": "The University Library Service (ULS) operates in a climate of static subject librarian numbers against ever-increasing student intakes. Their drive to increase higher-level IL input into student curricula, where subject librarian expertise is particularly called upon, is leading them to seek ways to 'automate' some of the more basic and repetitive IL teaching they offer, in order to free up time. Constraints also offer up opportunities however, and we see the current climate as a chance to 'do more with less' and to enhance the student experience at Cardiff. Supporting this move by providing evidence of its success is key to our approach. A systematic review of literature from around the world was undertaken at Cardiff in 2015, to measure the effectiveness of online versus face-to-face information literacy teaching. Papers from evaluations in HE institutions over the last 20 years were analysed to discover that student satisfaction and knowledge retention are indeed comparable between the two formats.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: This goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of team-based learning (TBL) on knowledge retention compared to traditional lectures with small break-out group discussion (teaching as usual (TAU)) using a randomized controlled trial. Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted during a daylong conference for psychiatric educators on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and the research literacy topic of efficacy versus effectiveness trials. Learners ( n = 115) were randomized with concealed allocation to either TBL or TAU. Knowledge was measured prior to the intervention, immediately afterward, and 2 months later via multiple-choice tests. Participants were necessarily unblinded. Data enterers, data analysts, and investigators were blinded to group assignment in data analysis. Per-protocol analyses of test scores were performed using change in knowledge from baseline. The primary endpoint was test scores at 2 months. Results: At baseline, there were no statistically significant differences between groups in pre-test knowledge. At immediate post-test, both TBL and TAU groups showed improved knowledge scores compared with their baseline scores. The TBL group performed better statistically on the immediate post-test than the TAU group (Cohen’s d = 0.73; p < 0.001), although the differences in knowledge scores were not educationally meaningful, averaging just one additional test question correct (out of 15). On the 2-month remote post-test, there were no group differences in knowledge retention among the 42 % of participants who returned the 2-month test. Conclusions: Both TBL and TAU learners acquired new knowledge at the end of the intervention and retained knowledge over 2 months. At the end of the intervention day and after 2 months, knowledge test scores were not meaningfully different between TBL and TAU completers. In conclusion, this study failed to demonstrate the superiority of TBL over TAU on the primary outcome of knowledge retention at 2 months post-intervention.

    "Abstract": "In this work, the development of a recommender system that aims to facilitate the indirect materials selection task for the creation of spare parts is proposed. In the industrial sector there are spare parts manufacturing companies, where there is a high rotation of staff and this leads to loss of knowledge as new users do not know what indirect materials they should select in the warehouse to create certain parts. The proposed system aims to integrate an indirect materials recommender system to assist this warehouse task. The proposed system is based on the non-personalized approach and similar order circumstances, to perform the recommendation process. From the evaluation of the proposed system, we could conclude that the indirect materials selection process for producing auto parts was improved.",

Although TBL curricula have been implemented for residents, no published systematic reviews or guidelines exist for the development and use of TBL in graduate medical education (GME). BACKGROUND Team-based learning (TBL) promotes problem solving and teamwork, and has been applied as an instructional method in undergraduate medical education with purported benefits. Although TBL curricula have been implemented for residents, no published systematic reviews or guidelines exist for the development and use of TBL in graduate medical education (GME).To review TBL curricula in GME, identify gaps in the literature, and synthesize a framework to guide the development of TBL curricula at the GME level. OBJECTIVE To review TBL curricula in GME, identify gaps in the literature, and synthesize a framework to guide the development of TBL curricula at the GME level.We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and ERIC databases from 1990 to 2014 for relevant articles. References were reviewed to identify additional studies. The inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed publications in English that described TBL curriculum implementation in GME. Data were systematically abstracted and reviewed for consensus. Based on included publications, a 4-element framework-system, residents, significance, and scaffolding-was developed to serve as a step-wise guide to planning a TBL curriculum in GME. METHODS We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and ERIC databases from 1990 to 2014 for relevant articles. References were reviewed to identify additional studies. The inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed publications in English that described TBL curriculum implementation in GME. Data were systematically abstracted and reviewed for consensus. Based on included publications, a 4-element framework-system, residents, significance, and scaffolding-was developed to serve as a step-wise guide to planning a TBL curriculum in GME.Nine publications describing 7 unique TBL curricula in residency met inclusion criteria. Outcomes included feasibility, satisfaction, clinical behavior, teamwork, and knowledge application. RESULTS Nine publications describing 7 unique TBL curricula in residency met inclusion criteria. Outcomes included feasibility, satisfaction, clinical behavior, teamwork, and knowledge application.TBL appears feasible in the GME environment, with learner reactions ranging from positive to neutral. Gaps in the literature occur within each of the 4 elements of the suggested framework, including: system , faculty preparation time and minimum length of effective TBL sessions; residents , impact of team heterogeneity and inconsistent attendance; significance , comparison to other instructional methods and outcomes measuring knowledge retention, knowledge application, and skill development; and scaffolding , factors that influence the completion of preparatory work.

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Traditionally, medical students on clinical rotations receive instruction on principles of mental health only during the psychiatry clerkship. We used emails to insert teaching of psychiatric concepts beyond the psychiatry clerkship into other rotations using the method of spaced learning, the delivery of brief morsels of information repeated over time intervals. We predicted that the intervention would improve attitudes and confidence towards the integration of psychiatry and knowledge retention. Methods: We developed and distributed a series of emails relating key psychiatric concepts targeted to the other core clerkships. Results: In a cluster-randomized trial over one academic year (intervention group n = 71, control group n = 61), scores on the Attitudes and Confidence in the Integration of Psychiatry scale and on the knowledge quiz did not differ significantly. Students who actively engaged with the emails demonstrated significantly higher scores on the knowledge test. Email users valued the timing, format of delivery and application of psychiatric principles outside the psychiatric setting. Participants recommended simplifying the format and previewing the benefits of spaced learning to increase utilization. Conclusion: Delivering spaced learning through emails, within a curriculum designed to foster engagement, may provide an efficient means of addressing the widely-recognized but elusive goal of integrating teaching across medical disciplines.",

    "Abstract": "Continuing education of health professionals is important for delivery of quality health care. Surgical nurses are often required to understand surgical procedures. Nurses need to be aware of the expected outcomes and recognize potential complications of such procedures during their daily work. Traditional educational methods, such as conferences and tutorials or informal education at the bedside, have many drawbacks for delivery of this information in a universal, standardized, and timely manner. The rapid uptake of portable media devices makes portable video media (PVM) a potential alternative to current educational methods. BACKGROUND Continuing education of health professionals is important for delivery of quality health care. Surgical nurses are often required to understand surgical procedures. Nurses need to be aware of the expected outcomes and recognize potential complications of such procedures during their daily work. Traditional educational methods, such as conferences and tutorials or informal education at the bedside, have many drawbacks for delivery of this information in a universal, standardized, and timely manner. The rapid uptake of portable media devices makes portable video media (PVM) a potential alternative to current educational methods.To compare PVM to standard verbal communication (SVC) for surgical information delivery and educational training for nurses and evaluate its impact on knowledge acquisition and participant satisfaction. OBJECTIVE To compare PVM to standard verbal communication (SVC) for surgical information delivery and educational training for nurses and evaluate its impact on knowledge acquisition and participant satisfaction.Prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled crossover trial. DESIGN Prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled crossover trial.Two hospitals: Gosford District Hospital and Wyong Hospital. SETTING Two hospitals: Gosford District Hospital and Wyong Hospital.Seventy-two nursing staff (36 at each site). PARTICIPANTS Seventy-two nursing staff (36 at each site).Information delivery via PVM--7-minute video compared to information delivered via SVC. INTERVENTION Information delivery via PVM--7-minute video compared to information delivered via SVC.Knowledge acquisition was measured by a 32-point questionnaire, and satisfaction with the method of education delivery was measured using the validated Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). OUTCOME MEASURES Knowledge acquisition was measured by a 32-point questionnaire, and satisfaction with the method of education delivery was measured using the validated Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8).Knowledge acquisition was higher via PVM compared to SVC 25.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.2-26.6) versus 24.3 (95% CI 23.5-25.1), p = .004. Participant satisfaction was higher with PVM 29.5 (95% CI 28.3-30.7) versus 26.5 (95% CI 25.1-27.9), p = .003. Following information delivery via SVC, participants had a 6% increase in knowledge scores, 24.3 (95% CI 23.5-25.1) versus 25.7 (95% CI 24.9-26.5) p = .001, and a 13% increase in satisfaction scores, 26.5 (95% CI 25.1-27.9) versus 29.9 (95% CI 28.8-31.0) p < .001, when they crossed-over to information delivery via PVM. RESULTS Knowledge acquisition was higher via PVM compared to SVC 25.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.2-26.6) versus 24.3 (95% CI 23.5-25.1), p = .004. Participant satisfaction was higher with PVM 29.5 (95% CI 28.3-30.7) versus 26.5 (95% CI 25.1-27.9), p = .003. Following information delivery via SVC, participants had a 6% increase in knowledge scores, 24.3 (95% CI 23.5-25.1) versus 25.7 (95% CI 24.9-26.5) p = .001, and a 13% increase in satisfaction scores, 26.5 (95% CI 25.1-27.9) versus 29.9 (95% CI 28.8-31.0) p < .001, when they crossed-over to information delivery via PVM.PVM provides a novel method for providing education to nurses that improves knowledge retention and satisfaction with the educational process. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION PVM provides a novel method for providing education to nurses that improves knowledge retention and satisfaction with the educational process.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to (1) generate a valid questionnaire to determine immunology knowledge, (2) compare immunology knowledge across 3 different cohorts of chiropractic students that had already studied immunology, (3) examine the attitudes of chiropractic students to the study of immunology, and (4) examine whether students' attitudes affected their knowledge levels. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to (1) generate a valid questionnaire to determine immunology knowledge, (2) compare immunology knowledge across 3 different cohorts of chiropractic students that had already studied immunology, (3) examine the attitudes of chiropractic students to the study of immunology, and (4) examine whether students' attitudes affected their knowledge levels.Factor analysis was used to refine an immunology knowledge and perceptions questionnaire that was generated by a group of experts that was then completed by 90 students. Immunology knowledge level of each of the cohorts was compared using a 1-way analysis of variance. Kappa statistics were used to measure agreement between 2 statements, and logistic regression was used to determine whether students' attitudes were associated with their knowledge levels. METHODS Factor analysis was used to refine an immunology knowledge and perceptions questionnaire that was generated by a group of experts that was then completed by 90 students. Immunology knowledge level of each of the cohorts was compared using a 1-way analysis of variance. Kappa statistics were used to measure agreement between 2 statements, and logistic regression was used to determine whether students' attitudes were associated with their knowledge levels.There was a significant difference in the immunology knowledge levels across the 3 year groups (F[2, 87] = 4.78, p = .011). Fifth-year students (n = 26) demonstrated 25% less immunology knowledge than third-year students (n = 35; p = .005). Of 90 students, 64 agreed that immunology knowledge was important to chiropractors, and 53 agreed that immunology knowledge was important for the average person. No relationship existed between their value of immunology knowledge and their score on the multiple-choice questions.

    "Abstract": "In this work, the development of a recommender system that aims to facilitate the indirect materials selection task for the creation of spare parts is proposed. In the industrial sector there are spare parts manufacturing companies, where there is a high rotation of staff and this leads to loss of knowledge as new users do not know what indirect materials they should select in the warehouse to create certain parts. The proposed system aims to integrate an indirect materials recommender system to assist this warehouse task. The proposed system is based on the non-personalized approach and similar order circumstances, to perform the recommendation process. From the evaluation of the proposed system, we could conclude that the indirect materials selection process for producing auto parts was improved.",

    "Abstract": "Pediatric obesity is a significant public health problem with a prevalence of 16.9% among US children. School-based obesity interventions show promise for reducing adiposity in elementary age children. This pilot study evaluated the impact of the Let's Go! 5-2-1-0 pediatric obesity intervention program in an elementary school setting. BACKGROUND Pediatric obesity is a significant public health problem with a prevalence of 16.9% among US children. School-based obesity interventions show promise for reducing adiposity in elementary age children. This pilot study evaluated the impact of the Let's Go! 5-2-1-0 pediatric obesity intervention program in an elementary school setting.This was a cluster randomized controlled field trial comprising 8 classrooms of second- and third-grade children. The impact of implementation of a standardized 5-2-1-0 curriculum was evaluated in the classrooms by looking at health behavior (self-reported fruit and vegetable and sugar-containing beverage intake, and screen time), physical activity (steps measured by pedometer), and body mass index (BMI). Half of the classrooms were given 5-2-1-0 teaching over a 4-month period. METHODS This was a cluster randomized controlled field trial comprising 8 classrooms of second- and third-grade children. The impact of implementation of a standardized 5-2-1-0 curriculum was evaluated in the classrooms by looking at health behavior (self-reported fruit and vegetable and sugar-containing beverage intake, and screen time), physical activity (steps measured by pedometer), and body mass index (BMI). Half of the classrooms were given 5-2-1-0 teaching over a 4-month period.There was no statistical difference in improvement of healthy habits, BMI, or physical activity in the intervention group compared with the control group. RESULTS There was no statistical difference in improvement of healthy habits, BMI, or physical activity in the intervention group compared with the control group.The 5-2-1-0 intervention used in this study was feasible. There was no significant change in healthy habits, likely due to the small number of participants in the study. The intervention and control sites were in different classrooms and there could be factors such as teacher enthusiasm, socioeconomic factors, and individual traits affecting habits. Future studies could use pre- and post-intervention quizzes to assess healthy habits knowledge retention, involving the environments the child participates in outside of school, using research-grade pedometers or accelerometers for measuring activity data collection, and recruiting larger samples to ensure adequate statistical power. CONCLUSIONS The 5-2-1-0 intervention used in this study was feasible. There was no significant change in healthy habits, likely due to the small number of participants in the study.

    "Abstract": "Enhanced podcasts increase learning, but evidence is lacking on how they should be designed to optimize their effectiveness. This study assessed the impact two learning instructional design methods (mental practice and modeling), either on their own or in combination, for teaching complex cognitive medical content when incorporated into enhanced podcasts. Sixty-three medical students were randomised to one of four versions of an airway management enhanced podcast: (1) control: narrated presentation; (2) modeling: narration with video demonstration of skills; (3) mental practice: narrated presentation with guided mental practice; (4) combined: modeling and mental practice. One week later, students managed a manikin-based simulated airway crisis. Knowledge acquisition was assessed by baseline and retention multiple-choice quizzes. Two blinded raters assessed all videos obtained from simulated crises to measure the students' skills using a key-elements scale, critical error checklist, and the Ottawa global rating scale (GRS). Baseline knowledge was not different between all four groups (p = 0.65). One week later, knowledge retention was significantly higher for (1) both the mental practice and modeling group than the control group (p = 0.01; p = 0.01, respectively) and (2) the combined mental practice and modeling group compared to all other groups (all ps = 0.01). Regarding skills acquisition, the control group significantly under-performed in comparison to all other groups on the key-events scale (all ps ≤ 0.05), the critical error checklist (all ps ≤ 0.05), and the Ottawa GRS (all ps ≤ 0.05). The combination of mental practice and modeling led to greater improvement on the key events checklist (p = 0.01) compared to either strategy alone. However, the combination of the two strategies did not result in any further learning gains on the two other measures of clinical performance (all ps > 0.05). The effectiveness of enhanced podcasts for knowledge retention and clinical skill acquisition is increased with either mental practice or modeling. The combination of mental practice and modeling had synergistic effects on knowledge retention, but conveyed less clear advantages in its application through clinical skills.Enhanced podcasts increase learning, but evidence is lacking on how they should be designed to optimize their effectiveness.

Two blinded raters assessed all videos obtained from simulated crises to measure the students’ skills using a key-elements scale, critical error checklist, and the Ottawa global rating scale (GRS). Baseline knowledge was not different between all four groups ( p = 0.65). One week later, knowledge retention was significantly higher for (1) both the mental practice and modeling group than the control group ( p = 0.01; p = 0.01, respectively) and (2) the combined mental practice and modeling group compared to all other groups (all ps = 0.01). Regarding skills acquisition, the control group significantly under-performed in comparison to all other groups on the key-events scale (all ps ≤ 0.05), the critical error checklist (all ps ≤ 0.05), and the Ottawa GRS (all ps ≤ 0.05). The combination of mental practice and modeling led to greater improvement on the key events checklist ( p = 0.01) compared to either strategy alone. However, the combination of the two strategies did not result in any further learning gains on the two other measures of clinical performance (all ps > 0.05). The effectiveness of enhanced podcasts for knowledge retention and clinical skill acquisition is increased with either mental practice or modeling. The combination of mental practice and modeling had synergistic effects on knowledge retention, but conveyed less clear advantages in its application through clinical skills.

    "Abstract": "The Republic of Georgia (Sakartvelo in Georgian language) is part of the Caucasus biodiversity hotspot, and human agricultural plant use dates bat at least 6000 years. However, little ethnobiological research has been published from the region since the 1940s. Given the lack of recent research in the region, the present study we report on plant uses in Skartvelo (Republic of Georgia), Caucasus. We hypothesized that, (1) given the long tradition of plant use, and the isolation under Soviet rule, plant use both based on homegardens and wild harvesting would be more pronounced in Georgia than in the wiser region, (2) the Soviet occupation would have had broad influence on plant use, and (3) there would still be incidence of knowledge loss despite wide plant use.

Interviews using semi-structured questionnaires were conducted with 170 participants (80 women and 90 men) after obtaining their oral prior informed consent. All interviews were carried out in the participants' homes and gardens by native speakers of Georgian and its local dialects (Svan, Tush, Khevsur, Psav), or, where participants spoke these as their native language, Armenian, Russian, or Greek. METHODS Fieldwork was conducted in Khevsureti, Samtskhe-Javakheti, Tusheti, Svaneti, and Racha in July-August 2013, July-August 2014, and September-October 2015. Interviews using semi-structured questionnaires were conducted with 170 participants (80 women and 90 men) after obtaining their oral prior informed consent.

The highest number of species and of unique species were reported from the remote Tusheti-Khevsureti region. Informant consensus and number of use reports were highest for each region in the food and medicinal use categories. Of the 480 plants being used in the research region 282 species were exclusively wild-harvested, 103 were grown in homegardens, and 84 were both grown in gardens and sourced in the wild.

    "Abstract": "The primary objective of the study reported herein is to empirically test the implicit, positive relationships between ERP-related Knowledge Management Competence (KM-competence; knowledge creation, knowledge retention, knowledge transfer, and knowledge application) dimensions and the extended Enterprise Resource Planning System Success construct (ERP system success; individual impact, workgroup impact, organisational impact, information quality, system quality, and vender/consultant quality). Data were collected from 173 of business and IT managers in 455 organisations in Jordan. Statistical techniques employed included confirmatory factor analysis to examine validity of the measurement model, and structural equation modelling using AMOS 16.0 is also utilised to test the hypotheses. The results of analysis show there is a positive significant impact of ERP knowledge creation on ERP success. Also, ERP knowledge retention positively and significantly affects ERP system success. Moreover, ERP knowledge transfer positively and significantly influence ERP system success. Furthermore, ERP knowledge application has positive effect on ERP system success. The results also indicate that ERP success construct is robust since all six observed variables are strongly loaded to the latent variable. Research limitations as well as implications for practice and research are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Background: It generally is accepted that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on learning. But literatures show the use of concept mapping is not benefit all learners. The present study explored the effects of incorporating computer-based concept mapping in physics instruction. Material and methods: A total of 61 9th-grade students participated in this study. By using a quasi-experimental research approach, 31 students were assigned to a group that received computer-based concept mapping assisting instruction (CBCM), and 30 students were assigned to a constructive activities group that received “Work, Power, and Energy Curriculum” instruction without concept mapping assistance (NCM). Both groups participated for eight weeks, with four sessions per week and 45 minutes per session. A pre test-post test control group design was employed. Results: The findings revealed that the CBCM group students scored higher than the NCM group students on the cognition understanding and higher order thinking subtests. No significant differences were found in the conception memorization subtest. In the retention test, the students in the CBCM group outperformed the students in the NCM group on all subtests. Conclusions: The results of the current study revealed that concept mapping activities effectively promote higher order thinking abilities and knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives. To evaluate the effectiveness of Pono Choices, a culturally responsive adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention program targeting middle school youths in Hawai'i. Methods. We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial with the school as the unit of random assignment over 3 semesters between 2012 and 2013.The sample consisted of 36 middle schools and 2203 students. We administered student surveys to collect baseline outcomes, student demographic data, and outcomes at 12 months after baseline. Results. We found statistically significant effects forthe knowledge assessment, which focused on basic understanding of adolescent pregnancy and STI prevention. The average percentage of correct responses was 73.6 for the treatment group and 60.4 forthe control group (P < .001).

    "Abstract": "Introduction The aim of this study was to assess variation in prostate contouring 12 months following a structured interactive educational intervention ( EI ) and to test the hypothesis that EI s positively impact on prostate contouring accuracy and consistency long term. Methods A common set of computed tomography ( CT ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data sets were used to assess prostate contouring consistency before, immediately after and 12 months following an EI . No further EI s were provided after the initial EI . Contour variation was assessed using the volume ratio ( VR ), defined as the ratio of the encompassing volume to common volume. Results Of the original five radiation oncologists ( RO s) at baseline, four completed all assessments, and one was unavailable at 12 months follow‐up. At 12 months, mean VR deteriorated by 3.2% on CT and 1.9% on MRI compared to immediately post EI . Overall, compared to the pre‐ EI baseline VR , an improvement of 11.4% and 10.8% was demonstrated on CT and MRI , respectively. Conclusion Good retention of applied knowledge 12 months following an EI on prostate contouring was demonstrated. This study advocates for EI s to be included as part of continuing medical education to reduce contour variation among RO s and improve knowledge retention long term.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Medication errors are the second most frequently reported hospital incident in Australia and are a global concern. A “Medication Calculation and Administration” workshop followed by a “hurdle” assessment (compulsory task mandating a minimum level of performance as a condition of passing the course) was introduced into Year 2 of the James Cook University medical curriculum to decrease dosage calculation and administration errors among graduates. This study evaluates the effectiveness of this educational activity as a long-term strategy to teach medical students' essential skills in calculating and administering medications. Methods: This longitudinal study used a pre- and post-test design to determine whether medical students retained their calculation and administration skills over a period of 4 years. The ability to apply basic mathematical skills to medication dose calculation, principles of safe administration (Part 1), and ability to access reference materials to check indications, contraindications, and writing the medication order with correct abbreviations (Part 2) were compared between Year 2 and 6 assessments. Results: Scores for Parts 1, 2 and total scores were nearly identical from Year 2 to Year 6 (P = 0.663, 0.408, and 0.472, respectively), indicating minimal loss of knowledge by students in this period. Most Year 6 students (86%) were able to recall at least 5 of the “6 Rights of Medication Administration” while 84% reported accessing reference material and 91% reported checking their medical calculations. Discussion: The “Medication Calculation and Administration” workshop with a combined formative and summative assessment – a “hurdle” – promotes long-term retention of essential clinical skills for medical students. These skills and an awareness of the problem are strategies to assist medical graduates in preventing future medication-related adverse events.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of Pono Choices, a culturally responsive adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention program targeting middle school youths in Hawai‘i. Methods: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial with the school as the unit of random assignment over 3 semesters between 2012 and 2013. The sample consisted of 36 middle schools and 2203 students. We administered student surveys to collect baseline outcomes, student demographic data, and outcomes at 12 months after baseline. Results: We found statistically significant effects for the knowledge assessment, which focused on basic understanding of adolescent pregnancy and STI prevention. The average percentage of correct responses was 73.6 for the treatment group and 60.4 for the control group ( P < .001). We did not find statistically significant effects on behavioral outcomes (initiation of sexual activity or engagement in high-risk sexual behavior) or on other nonbehavioral outcomes (attitudes, skills, intentions). Conclusions: Pono Choices had a statistically significant impact on knowledge of adolescent pregnancy and STI prevention among middle school students at 12 months after baseline, though it did not lead to detectable changes in behavioral outcomes within the 1-year observation period.

    "Abstract": "It generally is accepted that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on learning. But literatures show the use of concept mapping is not benefit all learners. The present study explored the effects of incorporating computer-based concept mapping in physics instruction. A total of 61 9th-grade students participated in this study. By using a quasi-experimental research approach, 31 students were assigned to a group that received computer-based concept mapping assisting instruction (CBCM), and 30 students were assigned to a constructive activities group that received “Work, Power, and Energy Curriculum” instruction without concept mapping assistance (NCM). Both groups participated for eight weeks, with four sessions per week and 45 minutes per session. A pre test-post test control group design was employed. The findings revealed that the CBCM group students scored higher than the NCM group students on the cognition understanding and higher order thinking subtests. No significant differences were found in the conception memorization subtest. In the retention test, the students in the CBCM group outperformed the students in the NCM group on all subtests. The results of the current study revealed that concept mapping activities effectively promote higher order thinking and knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "Medication errors are the second most frequently reported hospital incident in Australia and are a global concern. A \"Medication Calculation and Administration\" workshop followed by a \"hurdle\" assessment (compulsory task mandating a minimum level of performance as a condition of passing the course) was introduced into Year 2 of the James Cook University medical curriculum to decrease dosage calculation and administration errors among graduates. This study evaluates the effectiveness of this educational activity as a long-term strategy to teach medical students' essential skills in calculating and administering medications. BACKGROUND Medication errors are the second most frequently reported hospital incident in Australia and are a global concern. A \"Medication Calculation and Administration\" workshop followed by a \"hurdle\" assessment (compulsory task mandating a minimum level of performance as a condition of passing the course) was introduced into Year 2 of the James Cook University medical curriculum to decrease dosage calculation and administration errors among graduates. This study evaluates the effectiveness of this educational activity as a long-term strategy to teach medical students' essential skills in calculating and administering medications.This longitudinal study used a pre- and post-test design to determine whether medical students retained their calculation and administration skills over a period of 4 years. The ability to apply basic mathematical skills to medication dose calculation, principles of safe administration (Part 1), and ability to access reference materials to check indications, contraindications, and writing the medication order with correct abbreviations (Part 2) were compared between Year 2 and 6 assessments. METHODS This longitudinal study used a pre- and post-test design to determine whether medical students retained their calculation and administration skills over a period of 4 years. The ability to apply basic mathematical skills to medication dose calculation, principles of safe administration (Part 1), and ability to access reference materials to check indications, contraindications, and writing the medication order with correct abbreviations (Part 2) were compared between Year 2 and 6 assessments.Scores for Parts 1, 2 and total scores were nearly identical from Year 2 to Year 6 (P = 0.663, 0.408, and 0.472, respectively), indicating minimal loss of knowledge by students in this period. Most Year 6 students (86%) were able to recall at least 5 of the \"6 Rights of Medication Administration\" while 84% reported accessing reference material and 91% reported checking their medical calculations. RESULTS Scores for Parts 1, 2 and total scores were nearly identical from Year 2 to Year 6 (P = 0.663, 0.408, and 0.472, respectively), indicating minimal loss of knowledge by students in this period. Most Year 6 students (86%) were able to recall at least 5 of the \"6 Rights of Medication Administration\" while 84% reported accessing reference material and 91% reported checking their medical calculations.The \"Medication Calculation and Administration\" workshop with a combined formative and summative assessment - a \"hurdle\" - promotes long-term retention of essential clinical skills for medical students. These skills and an awareness of the problem are strategies to assist medical graduates in preventing future medication-related adverse events.

    "Abstract": "Human capital (HC) stands out as a substantial driver of the constant growth of organisations. It is also a key source to develop a sustainable competitive advantage in the current knowledge-based economy. HC, a core component of Intellectual Capital (IC), combines knowledge, skills, and abilities of employees to conduct useful activities in the business context. Forward-thinking organisations tend to formulate their core strategies using effective planning and management of their resources especially the HC. Human Capital Planning (HCP) has recently emerged as an important area of interest for both researchers and practitioners. The planning process includes the identification of the organisation's key strategic priorities and then the human planning takes place to ensure the optimal allocation of intellectual and knowledge resources to achieve business objectives. Organisations are recently alerted to the implications of HCP on minimising knowledge loss, developing knowledge resources, achieving enhanced performance, and fostering innovation. In recent study conducted by IBM, HCP was ranked as one of the top strategic priorities of global leading companies. This paper aims to provide a literature review on the development of the human capital planning process within organisations. The study also highlights major contributions of the prominent HCP frameworks and models used to assist in human capital management in order to leverage the existing knowledge within the organisation. In conclusion, understanding of the principles of HCP will have a its critical contribution in supporting effective Knowledge Management (KM) and equally enhancing organisational performance.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to explore the topic of knowledge safety, defined as the state of knowledge being safe from loss, attrition, oblivion or theft. The paper first presents a theoretical background and review of previous studies on knowledge loss and retention and then illustrates the topic of knowledge safety with ten case studies from the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector. Methodology: The paper is based on the analysis of KM literature devoted to knowledge retention and knowledge loss in companies and on the results of case study research. Knowledge safety has been firstly defined and contrasted with other terms (i.e. knowledge loss and knowledge retention) and then examined in 10 selected SMEs. The examination resulted in the clarification of what SMEs understand by the term \"knowledge safety\" and what kind of actions they undertake to provide it. Findings: As the analysis shows, examined SMEs attribute diversified significance to the issue of knowledge safety. For some of them, such a problem does not exist at all and they state that they can provide knowledge safety in all the aspects of their operations. Some companies perceive it mainly through the safety of the knowledge stored in electronic databases, while others link it with the human factor only. Research limitations: Research results are limited to ten companies operating in Poland. As such, they cannot illustrate the whole picture of existing small or medium-sized companies. Research implications: The findings of both literature review and case study analysis indicate that there is a need to further examine the issue of knowledge safety by analysing potential factors which may endanger knowledge safety and the methods to eliminate these risks. Practical implications: The paper examines important aspects of knowledge safety and provides guidelines how it can be provided by managers or owners of SMEs. Originality/value: The term of knowledge safety has been absent in the literature so far. The paper defines it and explores both the theoretical and practical aspects. The paper also suggests further research possibilities in this area.",

    "Abstract": "In the era of knowledge economy, knowledge is increasingly seen as the most important strategic asset. A significant part of the knowledge possessed by an organization is within the knowledge workers. Thus, it is important to understand what encourages and what holds back individuals from sharing knowledge. Employees' willingness to share knowledge can be influenced by individual factors like people behaviours, motives and characteristics. Emotional intelligence can be one of the individual factors that can play an important role in forming their knowledge sharing endeavours. The paper aims to reveal the relationship between emotional intelligence and knowledge sharing of employees of Hungarian organizations. More specifically the relationship between the factors of emotional intelligence such as Well-being, Self-control, Sociability and Emotionality with the factors of knowledge sharing Altruism, Reciprocity, Reputation, Loss of Knowledge and Organizational reward have been investigated. Furthermore the study sheds light on the role of individual characteristics such as gender, generation, qualification and tenure considering size of the organization. The research has been carried out among more than 200 Hungarian employees from different industries. Significant positive relationship can be identified between employees' emotional intelligence and knowledge sharing behaviour. Well-being, Emotionality, Self-control and Sociability as emotional intelligence factors show relation to Altruism, Loss of knowledge and Reputation. Among individual factors, differences can be identified regarding generation and position, while gender and education do not seem to play a significant role in this relationship. Regarding organizational characteristics, differences can be detected according to the size of the organization. The outcome of the research can help companies, managers and HR specialists to learn how to trigger knowledge sharing behaviour according to gender and position while taking the size of the organisation into consideration. The paper reviews the results of the empirical study and concludes with a discussion of a potential new research direction and practical implications.",

    "Abstract": "The loss of technological knowledge is an important contributing factor to a major accident occurs. This article analyzed several major accident reports to corroborate to this premise. The more an organization moves further away from a known technology, the risk of an accident occurring considerably increases. This work discusses three ways in which technological knowledge can be lost: (1) new technology; (2) loss of knowledge due to inadequate training, procedures, and information; and (3) the failure to incorporate new knowledge (e.g., the lessons learned). For each means of technological knowledge loss, this article refers to an important major accident and shows how it contributed to the accident. It also addresses the types of failures and the concept of independent protection layers to help explain how to reduce the possibility of a major accident occurs. copyright 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Process Saf Prog 35: 253-257, 2016",

    "Abstract": "To evaluate the effectiveness of Pono Choices, a culturally responsive adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention program targeting middle school youths in Hawai'i. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of Pono Choices, a culturally responsive adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention program targeting middle school youths in Hawai'i.We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial with the school as the unit of random assignment over 3 semesters between 2012 and 2013. The sample consisted of 36 middle schools and 2203 students. We administered student surveys to collect baseline outcomes, student demographic data, and outcomes at 12 months after baseline. METHODS We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial with the school as the unit of random assignment over 3 semesters between 2012 and 2013. The sample consisted of 36 middle schools and 2203 students. We administered student surveys to collect baseline outcomes, student demographic data, and outcomes at 12 months after baseline.We found statistically significant effects for the knowledge assessment, which focused on basic understanding of adolescent pregnancy and STI prevention. The average percentage of correct responses was 73.6 for the treatment group and 60.4 for the control group (P < .001). We did not find statistically significant effects on behavioral outcomes (initiation of sexual activity or engagement in high-risk sexual behavior) or on other nonbehavioral outcomes (attitudes, skills, intentions). RESULTS We found statistically significant effects for the knowledge assessment, which focused on basic understanding of adolescent pregnancy and STI prevention. The average percentage of correct responses was 73.6 for the treatment group and 60.4 for the control group (P < .001). We did not find statistically significant effects on behavioral outcomes (initiation of sexual activity or engagement in high-risk sexual behavior) or on other nonbehavioral outcomes (attitudes, skills, intentions).Pono Choices had a statistically significant impact on knowledge of adolescent pregnancy and STI prevention among middle school students at 12 months after baseline, though it did not lead to detectable changes in behavioral outcomes within the 1-year observation period. These results call for an exploration of longer-term outcomes to assess effects on knowledge retention and behavioral changes. CONCLUSIONS Pono Choices had a statistically significant impact on knowledge of adolescent pregnancy and STI prevention among middle school students at 12 months after baseline, though it did not lead to detectable changes in behavioral outcomes within the 1-year observation period. These results call for an exploration of longer-term outcomes to assess effects on knowledge retention and behavioral changes.",

    "Abstract": "It generally is accepted that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on learning. But literatures show the use of concept mapping is not benefit all learners. The present study explored the effects of incorporating computer-based concept mapping in physics instruction. A total of 61 9th-grade students participated in this study. By using a quasi-experimental research approach, 31 students were assigned to a group that received computer-based concept mapping assisting instruction (CBCM), and 30 students were assigned to a constructive activities group that received \"Work, Power, and Energy Curriculum\" instruction without concept mapping assistance (NCM). Both groups participated for eight weeks, with four sessions per week and 45 minutes per session. A pre test-post test control group design was employed. The findings revealed that the CBCM group students scored higher than the NCM group students on the cognition understanding and higher order thinking subtests. No significant differences were found in the conception memorization subtest. In the retention test, the students in the CBCM group outperformed the students in the NCM group on all subtests. The results of the current study revealed that concept mapping activities effectively promote higher order thinking and knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess variation in prostate contouring 12 months following a structured interactive educational intervention (EI) and to test the hypothesis that EIs positively impact on prostate contouring accuracy and consistency long term. INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to assess variation in prostate contouring 12 months following a structured interactive educational intervention (EI) and to test the hypothesis that EIs positively impact on prostate contouring accuracy and consistency long term.A common set of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets were used to assess prostate contouring consistency before, immediately after and 12 months following an EI. No further EIs were provided after the initial EI. Contour variation was assessed using the volume ratio (VR), defined as the ratio of the encompassing volume to common volume. METHODS A common set of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets were used to assess prostate contouring consistency before, immediately after and 12 months following an EI. No further EIs were provided after the initial EI. Contour variation was assessed using the volume ratio (VR), defined as the ratio of the encompassing volume to common volume.Of the original five radiation oncologists (ROs) at baseline, four completed all assessments, and one was unavailable at 12 months follow-up. At 12 months, mean VR deteriorated by 3.2% on CT and 1.9% on MRI compared to immediately post EI. Overall, compared to the pre-EI baseline VR, an improvement of 11.4% and 10.8% was demonstrated on CT and MRI, respectively. RESULTS Of the original five radiation oncologists (ROs) at baseline, four completed all assessments, and one was unavailable at 12 months follow-up. At 12 months, mean VR deteriorated by 3.2% on CT and 1.9% on MRI compared to immediately post EI. Overall, compared to the pre-EI baseline VR, an improvement of 11.4% and 10.8% was demonstrated on CT and MRI, respectively.Good retention of applied knowledge 12 months following an EI on prostate contouring was demonstrated. This study advocates for EIs to be included as part of continuing medical education to reduce contour variation among ROs and improve knowledge retention long term. CONCLUSION Good retention of applied knowledge 12 months following an EI on prostate contouring was demonstrated. This study advocates for EIs to be included as part of continuing medical education to reduce contour variation among ROs and improve knowledge retention long term.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction The aim of this study was to assess variation in prostate contouring 12 months following a structured interactive educational intervention (EI) and to test the hypothesis that EIs positively impact on prostate contouring accuracy and consistency long term. Methods A common set of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets were used to assess prostate contouring consistency before, immediately after and 12 months following an EI. No further EIs were provided after the initial EI. Contour variation was assessed using the volume ratio (VR), defined as the ratio of the encompassing volume to common volume. Results Of the original five radiation oncologists (ROs) at baseline, four completed all assessments, and one was unavailable at 12 months follow-up. At 12 months, mean VR deteriorated by 3.2% on CT and 1.9% on MRI compared to immediately post EI. Overall, compared to the pre-EI baseline VR, an improvement of 11.4% and 10.8% was demonstrated on CT and MRI, respectively. Conclusion Good retention of applied knowledge 12 months following an EI on prostate contouring was demonstrated. This study advocates for EIs to be included as part of continuing medical education to reduce contour variation among ROs and improve knowledge retention long term.",

    "Abstract": "The operating room is an exciting learning environment. With growing curriculum limitations and increasing complexity of care, existing education opportunities need to be optimized.

OBJECTIVE The operating room is an exciting learning environment. With growing curriculum limitations and increasing complexity of care, existing education opportunities need to be optimized. Rehearsal has benefits for surgeon performance in the operating room, but its role for enhancing operative learning remains unclear. This pilot study aimed to differentiate the effects of physical rehearsal (PR) and cognitive rehearsal (CR) modalities on surgical trainee technical knowledge retention.Participants took part in a 2-day (sequential Fridays), instructed operative workshop performing midline laparotomy, splenectomy, left nephrectomy, and hand-sewn, side-to-side small bowel anastomosis (SBA). Participants were randomized to 10 minutes of either a (PR; n = 5) or (CR; n = 5) activity each day before operating. PR consisted of practicing SBA on a felt bowel model. CR entailed viewing narrated operative footage detailing the steps of SBA. Participants' technical knowledge of all procedures was assessed at 1 and 12 weeks postworkshop using a 31-question test.

Participants' technical knowledge of all procedures was assessed at 1 and 12 weeks postworkshop using a 31-question test.Animal operative suites at an academic medical center. SETTING Animal operative suites at an academic medical center.A total of 10 general surgery postgraduate year 1 interns participated in the workshop; all completed the study. Participants had similar levels of operative exposure at the time of study participation. PARTICIPANTS A total of 10 general surgery postgraduate year 1 interns participated in the workshop; all completed the study. Participants had similar levels of operative exposure at the time of study participation.At 1-week postworkshop, mean assessment scores for CR were higher than PR (Mean ± Standard Deviation) (CR = 24.7 ± 1.6 vs. PR = 21.8 ± 1.7, p = 0.02). After 12 weeks, there was no difference in mean scores (CR = 23.3 ± 2 vs. PR = 21.7 ± 1.8, p = 0.22). Knowledge decay for the 12-week period was similar between groups (CR = -1.4 ± 1.6 vs. PR = -0.1 ± 2.4, p = 0.36). Study participants performed better on SBA-related questions than unrelated questions (laparotomy, splenectomy, and nephrectomy) at 1-week (related = 81.5% ± 11.3 vs. unrelated = 71.9% ± 6.6, p = 0.03) and 12 weeks (related = 81% ± 13.1 vs. unrelated = 68.6% ± 8.8, p = 0.02). RESULTS At 1-week postworkshop, mean assessment scores for CR were higher than PR (Mean ± Standard Deviation) (CR = 24.7 ± 1.6 vs. PR = 21.8 ± 1.7, p = 0.02).

Participants did score higher on questions related to the rehearsal topic, indicating a potential supplementary role for rehearsal activities.

Education of staff in participating centres is an important aspect of a successful clinical trial. In the multicentre study of fractionated versus single fraction stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy in lung oligometastases (TROG 13.01), knowledge transfer of stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy techniques to the local multidisciplinary team is intended as part of the credentialing process. In this study, a web-based learning platform was developed to provide education and training for the multidisciplinary trial teams at geographically distinct sites.A web-based platform using eLearning software consisting of seven training modules was developed. These modules were based on extracranial stereotactic theory covering the following discrete modules: Clinical background; Planning technique and evaluation; Planning optimisation; Four-dimensional computed tomography simulation; Patient-specific quality assurance; Cone beam computed tomography and image guidance; Contouring organs at risk. Radiation oncologists, medical physicists and radiation therapists from hospitals in Australia and New Zealand were invited to participate in this study. Each discipline was enrolled into a subset of modules (core modules) and was evaluated before and after completing each module. The effectiveness of the eLearning training will be evaluated based on (i) knowledge retention after participation in the web-based training and (ii) confidence evaluation after participation in the training. Evaluation consisted of a knowledge test and confidence evaluation using a Likert scale.

    "Abstract": "The primary objective of the study reported herein is to empirically test the implicit, positive relationships between ERP-related Knowledge Management Competence (KM-competence; knowledge creation, knowledge retention, knowledge transfer, and knowledge application) dimensions and the extended Enterprise Resource Planning System Success construct (ERP system success; individual impact, workgroup impact, organisational impact, information quality, system quality, and vender/consultant quality). Data were collected from 173 of business and IT managers in 455 organisations in Jordan. Statistical techniques employed included confirmatory factor analysis to examine validity of the measurement model, and structural equation modelling using AMOS 16.0 is also utilised to test the hypotheses. The results of analysis show there is a positive significant impact of ERP knowledge creation on ERP success. Also, ERP knowledge retention positively and significantly affects ERP system success. Moreover, ERP knowledge transfer positively and significantly influence ERP system success. Furthermore, ERP knowledge application has positive effect on ERP system success. The results also indicate that ERP success construct is robust since all six observed variables are strongly loaded to the latent variable. Research limitations as well as implications for practice and research are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Sixty percent of the 10.9 million under-5 deaths every year are related to malnutrition. More than two thirds of malnutrition is caused by inappropriate infant feeding practice. Only 35 % of mothers worldwide provide 4 months of exclusive breast-feeding, while complementary feeding is often untimely, nutritionally inadequate, hygienically poor, and improperly delivered. The existing pediatric nutrition module in our institution does not include proper delivery of food that involves oral-motor skills and feeding behavior. To scale up the knowledge and skill of medical students regarding evidence-based infant feeding practice, we designed a new module composed of comprehensive and integrated lectures with additional multidisciplinary lectures on oral-motor skill development and feeding behavior. BACKGROUND Sixty percent of the 10.9 million under-5 deaths every year are related to malnutrition. More than two thirds of malnutrition is caused by inappropriate infant feeding practice. Only 35 % of mothers worldwide provide 4 months of exclusive breast-feeding, while complementary feeding is often untimely, nutritionally inadequate, hygienically poor, and improperly delivered. The existing pediatric nutrition module in our institution does not include proper delivery of food that involves oral-motor skills and feeding behavior. To scale up the knowledge and skill of medical students regarding evidence-based infant feeding practice, we designed a new module composed of comprehensive and integrated lectures with additional multidisciplinary lectures on oral-motor skill development and feeding behavior.A quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the new module compared to the previous module. Fifth year medical students of Universitas Indonesia were divided into intervention and control groups. The control group received lectures and a paper-based workshop. The intervention group received comprehensive and integrated interactive lectures with additional multidisciplinary lectures on oral-motor skill development and behavioral approaches to feeding problems. A hands-on workshop using real cases shown on recorded video and role-play sessions was also presented to the intervention group. A pre-/post-test, 3-month retention test, and Observed Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) were performed to evaluate understanding, knowledge retention, and counseling skills.

A pre-/post-test, 3-month retention test, and Observed Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) were performed to evaluate understanding, knowledge retention, and counseling skills.A linear mixed effect model with a random intercept analysis for pre-test, post-test, and retention test scores showed significant higher result for intervention group compared to control group (p < 0.001). Comprehensive knowledge and counselling skills were better in the intervention group than in the control group as shown by the OSCE score (68.6 vs 59.3, p < 0.001). RESULTS A linear mixed effect model with a random intercept analysis for pre-test, post-test, and retention test scores showed significant higher result for intervention group compared to control group (p < 0.001). Comprehensive knowledge and counselling skills were better in the intervention group than in the control group as shown by the OSCE score (68.6 vs 59.3, p < 0.001).Our comprehensive integrated infant feeding practice module, which incorporates multidisciplinary learning processes and an interactive hands-on workshop with a role-play session yields better knowledge understanding and counseling skills compared with the existing module. Comprehensive knowledge and good counseling skills of medical students as future doctors are a pre-requisite to provide effective education to parents to support successful infant feeding practices.

BACKGROUND As consumer health information technology (IT) becomes more thoroughly integrated into patient care, it is critical that these tools are appropriate for the diverse patient populations whom they are intended to serve. Cultural differences associated with ethnicity are one aspect of diversity that may play a role in user-technology interactions.Our aim was to evaluate the current scope of consumer health IT interventions targeted to the US Spanish-speaking Latino population and to characterize these interventions in terms of technological attributes, health domains, cultural tailoring, and evaluation metrics. OBJECTIVE Our aim was to evaluate the current scope of consumer health IT interventions targeted to the US Spanish-speaking Latino population and to characterize these interventions in terms of technological attributes, health domains, cultural tailoring, and evaluation metrics.A narrative synthesis was conducted of existing Spanish-language consumer health IT interventions indexed within health and computer science databases. Database searches were limited to English-language articles published between January 1990 and September 2015. Studies were included if they detailed an assessment of a patient-centered electronic technology intervention targeting health within the US Spanish-speaking Latino population. Included studies were required to have a majority Latino population sample. The following were extracted from articles: first author's last name, publication year, population characteristics, journal domain, health domain, technology platform and functionality, available languages of intervention, US region, cultural tailoring, intervention delivery location, study design, and evaluation metrics.

Most of the studies were published between 2009 and 2015 and had a majority percentage of female study participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 15 to 68. Interventions most commonly focused on urban population centers and within the western region of the United States. Of articles specifying a technology domain, computer was found to be most common; however, a fairly even distribution across all technologies was noted. Cancer, diabetes, and child, infant, or maternal health were the most common health domains targeted by consumer health IT interventions. More than half of the interventions were culturally tailored. The most frequently used evaluation metric was behavior/attitude change, followed by usability and knowledge retention. RESULTS We included 42 studies in the review.

Second, preliminary steps have been taken to culturally tailor consumer health IT interventions for the US Spanish-speaking Latino population; however, focus must expand beyond intervention content. Finally, the field should work to promote long-term evaluation of technology efficacy, moving beyond intermediary measures toward measures of health outcomes.

    "Abstract": "Purpose - Knowledge loss impact on the performance of management information system (MIS) departments due to its influence on absorptive capacity. Furthermore, knowledge retention in human resource management and information system application is also included in the research model, in order to examine their effectiveness in mitigating knowledge loss. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Survey method and hypotheses are tested with the collected data from 191 Taiwanese IS personnel. Findings - The results not only indicate knowledge loss has impacts on the absorptive capacity and performance of MIS departments while information systems could mitigate knowledge loss, but also provide deeper understanding of knowledge loss and potential issues for academics; as for practitioners, this study could serve as a reference to design and adopt knowledge management (KM) mechanisms. Originality/value - KM is an important issue for organizations since it is the source of competitive advantages and excellent performance, although the investment in KM is not necessary effective in retaining knowledge. This study conducts survey to examine the influences of knowledge loss in MIS departments, since the high turnover rate of employees and the rapid environmental changes in technical world may worsen the situation. According to dynamic capability theory, absorptive capacity is a critical ability to have while facing turbulent environment.",

In this study, two presentation methods to increase awareness of lexical bundles through explicit noticing are explored and compared with incidental exposure.

Immediate learning gains were significantly greater for the schematic linguistic representation method; however, no significant difference in gains between the conditions appeared in the two week delayed post-test.

    "Abstract": "Background: As consumer health information technology (IT) becomes more thoroughly integrated into patient care, it is critical that these tools are appropriate for the diverse patient populations whom they are intended to serve. Cultural differences associated with ethnicity are one aspect of diversity that may play a role in user-technology interactions. Objective: Our aim was to evaluate the current scope of consumer health IT interventions targeted to the US Spanish-speaking Latino population and to characterize these interventions in terms of technological attributes, health domains, cultural tailoring, and evaluation metrics. Methods: A narrative synthesis was conducted of existing Spanish-language consumer health IT interventions indexed within health and computer science databases. Database searches were limited to English-language articles published between January 1990 and September 2015. Studies were included if they detailed an assessment of a patient-centered electronic technology intervention targeting health within the US Spanish-speaking Latino population. Included studies were required to have a majority Latino population sample. The following were extracted from articles: first author’s last name, publication year, population characteristics, journal domain, health domain, technology platform and functionality, available languages of intervention, US region, cultural tailoring, intervention delivery location, study design, and evaluation metrics. Results: We included 42 studies in the review. Most of the studies were published between 2009 and 2015 and had a majority percentage of female study participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 15 to 68. Interventions most commonly focused on urban population centers and within the western region of the United States. Of articles specifying a technology domain, computer was found to be most common; however, a fairly even distribution across all technologies was noted. Cancer, diabetes, and child, infant, or maternal health were the most common health domains targeted by consumer health IT interventions. More than half of the interventions were culturally tailored. The most frequently used evaluation metric was behavior/attitude change, followed by usability and knowledge retention. Conclusions: This study characterizes the existing body of research exploring consumer health IT interventions for the US Spanish-speaking Latino population. In doing so, it reveals three primary needs within the field. First, while the increase in studies targeting the Latino population in the last decade is a promising advancement, future research is needed that focuses on Latino subpopulations previously overlooked. Second, preliminary steps have been taken to culturally tailor consumer health IT interventions for the US Spanish-speaking Latino population; however, focus must expand beyond intervention content. Finally, the field should work to promote long-term evaluation of technology efficacy, moving beyond intermediary measures toward measures of health outcomes.

This study aimed to compare knowledge and skill acquisition for a basic neurologic examination between OB nurses who participated in simulation and those who participated in an online self-study module. Short- and long-term knowledge retention and skill transfer between groups were evaluated. INTRODUCTION Obstetric (OB) nurses must be proficient in performing a basic neurologic examination to assess and detect changes in a patients' neurologic status. This study aimed to compare knowledge and skill acquisition for a basic neurologic examination between OB nurses who participated in simulation and those who participated in an online self-study module. Short- and long-term knowledge retention and skill transfer between groups were evaluated.Nurses were randomized to either simulation or online self-study module and assessed by direct observation and completion of a standardized instrument by the observer at 3 time points: baseline (time 1), within 7 days of baseline in the clinical setting (time 2), and at 2 months (time 3) using a validated12-item Neurologic Knowledge Assessment and a 14-item performance skill checklist. METHODS Nurses were randomized to either simulation or online self-study module and assessed by direct observation and completion of a standardized instrument by the observer at 3 time points: baseline (time 1), within 7 days of baseline in the clinical setting (time 2), and at 2 months (time 3) using a validated12-item Neurologic Knowledge Assessment and a 14-item performance skill checklist.Among OB nurses, those in the simulation group demonstrated higher levels in both short-term (time 2) [mean (SD), 67.6 (20.2) vs. 29.6 (19.0); P < 0.001] and long-term (time 3) [mean (SD), 46.1 (17.6) vs. 27.5 (15.9); P < 0.001] skill performance compared with nurses in the online self-study module. Nurses in the simulation and online self-study module groups had similar mean levels on Neurologic Knowledge Assessment scores at time 2 (P = 0.86) and time 3 (P = 0.59), but these mean scores were not significant. RESULTS Among OB nurses, those in the simulation group demonstrated higher levels in both short-term (time 2) [mean (SD), 67.6 (20.2) vs. 29.6 (19.0); P < 0.001] and long-term (time 3) [mean (SD), 46.1 (17.6) vs. 27.5 (15.9); P < 0.001] skill performance compared with nurses in the online self-study module. Nurses in the simulation and online self-study module groups had similar mean levels on Neurologic Knowledge Assessment scores at time 2 (P = 0.86) and time 3 (P = 0.59), but these mean scores were not significant.The greater transfer of skills by nurses who received simulation education is an important finding because few studies have addressed this level of translation with practicing nurses. There was a lack of differences in short- and long-term knowledge acquisition between nurses in the simulation and online self-study module groups. More research is needed to determine the timing of simulation-based education repetition over time to aid in knowledge and skills retention.

    "Abstract": "To examine the effectiveness of a \"cardiopulmonary resuscitation song\" in improving the basic life support skills of secondary school students. OBJECTIVES To examine the effectiveness of a \"cardiopulmonary resuscitation song\" in improving the basic life support skills of secondary school students.This pre-test/post-test control design study enrolled secondary school students from two middle schools randomly chosen in Córdoba, Andalucia, Spain. The study included 608 teenagers. A random sample of 87 students in the intervention group and 35 in the control group, aged 12-14 years were selected. The intervention included a cardiopulmonary resuscitation song and video. A questionnaire was conducted at three-time points: pre-intervention, one month and eight months post-intervention. METHODS This pre-test/post-test control design study enrolled secondary school students from two middle schools randomly chosen in Córdoba, Andalucia, Spain. The study included 608 teenagers. A random sample of 87 students in the intervention group and 35 in the control group, aged 12-14 years were selected. The intervention included a cardiopulmonary resuscitation song and video. A questionnaire was conducted at three-time points: pre-intervention, one month and eight months post-intervention.On global knowledge of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, there were no significant differences between the intervention group and the control group in the trial pre-intervention and at the month post-intervention. However, at 8 months there were significant differences with a p-value = 0.000 (intervention group, 95% CI: 6.39 to 7.13 vs. control group, 95% CI: 4.75 to 5.92), F(1,120)=16.644, p=0.000). In addition, significant differences about students' basic life support knowledge about chest compressions at eight months post-intervention (F(1,120)=15.561, p=0.000) were found. RESULTS On global knowledge of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, there were no significant differences between the intervention group and the control group in the trial pre-intervention and at the month post-intervention. However, at 8 months there were significant differences with a p-value = 0.000 (intervention group, 95% CI: 6.39 to 7.13 vs. control group, 95% CI: 4.75 to 5.92), F(1,120)=16.644, p=0.000). In addition, significant differences about students' basic life support knowledge about chest compressions at eight months post-intervention (F(1,120)=15.561, p=0.000) were found.Our study showed that incorporating the song component in the cardiopulmonary resuscitation teaching increased its effectiveness and the ability to remember the cardiopulmonary resuscitation algorithm. Our study highlights the need for different methods in the cardiopulmonary resuscitation teaching to facilitate knowledge retention and increase the number of positive outcomes after sudden cardiac arrest. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that incorporating the song component in the cardiopulmonary resuscitation teaching increased its effectiveness and the ability to remember the cardiopulmonary resuscitation algorithm. Our study highlights the need for different methods in the cardiopulmonary resuscitation teaching to facilitate knowledge retention and increase the number of positive outcomes after sudden cardiac arrest.",

    "Abstract": "Deficits in retention of anatomy knowledge from the preclinical years to clinical application on the wards have been well documented in the medical education literature. We developed and evaluated a web and laboratory-based curriculum to address deficits in anatomy knowledge retention and to increase anatomy knowledge recall through repetition and application of clinical concepts during the obstetrics and gynecology (Ob/Gyn) core clinical clerkship. Using principles of adult learning and instructional design, a curriculum was designed consisting of (1) interactive, case-based e-modules reviewing clinically relevant anatomical topics and (2) a hands-on laboratory session reinforcing the content of the e-modules, with the practice of clinical techniques using anatomical cadaveric dissections. The curriculum's effectiveness was evaluated by using multiple choice testing and comparing baseline and final test scores. For questions testing content directly covered in this curriculum, mean final scores increased by 14.3% (P < 0.001). In contrast, for questions not directly addressed in this curriculum, mean final scores did not increase significantly, only by 6.0% (P = 0.31). Questions related to the uterus showed the greatest gains in final scores (30.3% improvement, P = 0.002). A curriculum with web-based preparatory material and a hands-on gross anatomy laboratory session effectively addresses deficits in anatomy retention and improves anatomical knowledge recall for medical students on a clinical clerkship. In the future, the authors plan to conduct a multicenter study to further evaluate the ability of this curriculum to improve clinically relevant anatomical knowledge.

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we show how the Aboriginal people in the south-west of Australia (the Nyungar) developed systems of knowledge, of caring for country and of family relations that enabled them to survive for tens of thousands of years and continue to have importance today. The impacts of British colonisation on cultural continuity and knowledge in the south-west have been significant and include loss of land, break-up of families and massacre. These practices led to a loss of knowledge of language and culture in some cases. However, Nyungar culture is alive and dynamic, constantly being reclaimed, re-energised and rebuilt through the interaction of contemporary and traditional research praxis. Focusing on Derbal Nara (Cockburn Sound) on the coast in the southern metropolitan area of Perth, we provide case examples of the action-research-learning methodologies used by Whadjuk Nyungar Traditional Owners. We also provide examples of stories about Derbal Nara that are still alive and being recounted up to the present day, including those that account for the recent ice age and the end of the ice age 8000 years BC when sea levels rose, drowning land in the area of Derbal Nara. Finally, we argue that Whadjuk Nyungar experiences and world views based on relationality and reflexivity are central to sustainable coastal management and that in some respects there has already been a convergence of Indigenous and Western coastal management. We present a set of principles that support the development of this \"third space\" for coastal sustainability.",

    "Abstract": "We document that immigrants in the United States differ from natives in several aspects relevant for their financial decision making. Based on these differences, we designed novel financial education materials targeted at US immigrants and their children and evaluated their effectiveness using a randomized control trial. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous evaluation of financial education programs targeted at this population. Compared to a control group, the groups that received the one-time educational intervention were more likely to correctly answer financial knowledge questions immediately after the intervention. The estimated effects of this one-time intervention on knowledge were large, but most of them faded away after six months. Moreover, we find little effect of the treatments on intended financial behavior measures, both immediately and six months later. Our results point to the efficacy of this type of educational material in informing immigrants and their children about important financial information that they are unfamiliar with, including information related to their immigrant status. However, they also suggest that a priority for future research should be to test whether repeated opportunities for learning can increase financial knowledge retention and lead to behavior change.We document that immigrants in the United States differ from natives in several aspects relevant for their financial decision making.

    "Abstract": "Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the services management literature by identifying a sequence of the different processes of knowledge management (KM) to create customer service value. Design/methodology/approach – The context for the research hypotheses is the Spanish banking industry. The authors conducted a study including 76 banks and 1,832 customers of these banks. This paper uses the partial least squares method to conduct the data analysis. Findings – The authors find support for all the hypotheses proposed in the model. The results show that service firms that are able to apply more knowledge or apply knowledge more effectively are likely to generate more benefits for their customers, and/or reduce their sacrifices, contributing significantly to a higher perception of service value. Research limitations/implications – The study focusses on one particular industry in a single point in time. A longitudinal analysis of a variety of service industries would enrich the study. Practical implications – It is argued that KM constitutes a key capability for service firms for the delivery of service value. According to the research, if service firms want to improve the application of knowledge, it is important to focus on knowledge retention while they create new knowledge.

    "Abstract": "The aim of the research was to determine the relationship between knowledge sharing and knowledge loss through creation of a conceptual model of factors affecting knowledge sharing and a conceptual toolkit, able to be used by managers as an analysis tool. A theoretical, constructive approach was taken to the research through the use of a theory-building methodology to create the conceptual model of factors affecting knowledge sharing in organisations. Empirical research was carried out using a case study at an energy infrastructure organisation in the UK through questionnaires and formal interviews to validate the model. A new conceptual model of factors affecting knowledge sharing was developed and evaluated, further improving the model. The empirical research showed validation of past literature and created additional elements to the model. The main limitation is that only one industry case study was used for empirical validation. This was due to the limited timeframe of the research, which suggests that further research should involve multiple case studies, covering a wide variety of industries. The model of factors affecting knowledge sharing allows managers to analyse their knowledge management strategies and offers suggestions of ways to reduce any risk of knowledge loss. There is a lack of conceptual models based on knowledge loss, and this paper aims to solve this issue. This will be useful to businesses, helping them to improve their knowledge management initiatives, retain knowledge and gain competitive advantage over competitors.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we show how the Aboriginal people in the south-west of Australia (the Nyungar) developed systems of knowledge, of caring for country and of family relations that enabled them to survive for tens of thousands of years and continue to have importance today. The impacts of British colonisation on cultural continuity and knowledge in the south-west have been significant and include loss of land, break-up of families and massacre. These practices led to a loss of knowledge of language and culture in some cases. However, Nyungar culture is alive and dynamic, constantly being reclaimed, re-energised and rebuilt through the interaction of contemporary and traditional research praxis. Focusing on Derbal Nara (Cockburn Sound) on the coast in the southern metropolitan area of Perth, we provide case examples of the action-research-learning methodologies used by Whadjuk Nyungar Traditional Owners. We also provide examples of stories about Derbal Nara that are still alive and being recounted up to the present day, including those that account for the recent ice age and the end of the ice age 8000 years BC when sea levels rose, drowning land in the area of Derbal Nara. Finally, we argue that Whadjuk Nyungar experiences and world views based on relationality and reflexivity are central to sustainable coastal management and that in some respects there has already been a convergence of Indigenous and Western coastal management. We present a set of principles that support the development of this \"third space\" for coastal sustainability. Reprinted by permission of Carfax Publishing, Taylor & Francis Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "English ENG English A study was conducted to determine if using bingo would facilitate learning and knowledge retention following diabetes education for adult learners. Results showed the interactive style promoted learning and retention while being interactive, fun, reinforcing, competitive, and engaging. Game-based learning has been applied for more than a decade to shift nursing education from conventional lecture delivery, often characterized as passive learning that does not facilitate critical thinking, to an active learning paradigm with increased learner engagement (Tedesco-Schneck, 2013). Authors sought a more patient-centered, learner-driven educational delivery methodology for patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), a disease that could reach epidemic proportions in the current century (Nanditha et al., 2016).",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to propose that knowledge management (KM) could be a way to nurture job satisfaction and examine how KM can increase individual employees’ job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach A theoretical model concerning the connections between five facets of KM (knowledge acquisition, knowledge sharing, knowledge creation, knowledge codification and knowledge retention) and job satisfaction is proposed. It is then empirically tested with a structural equation modelling partial least squares analysis of a survey data set of 824 observations, collected from the members of a Finnish municipal organisation. Findings Existence of KM processes in one’s working environment is significantly linked with high job satisfaction. Especially intra-organisational knowledge sharing seems to be a key KM process, promoting satisfaction with one’s job in most employee groups. Interestingly, significant knowledge-based promoters of job satisfaction differ as a function of job characteristics. Practical implications KM has a strong impact on employee job satisfaction, and therefore, managers are advised to implement KM activities in their organisations, not only for the sake of improving knowledge worker performance but also for improving their well-being at work. Originality/value This paper produces knowledge on a type of consequence of KM that has been largely unexplored in previous research, individual job satisfaction. Also, it promotes moving the KM literature to the next stage where the impact of KM practices is not explored as a “one size fits all” type of a phenomenon, but rather as a contingent and contextual issue.",

    "Abstract": "Problem-based learning (PBL) has been shown to be effective in biomedical engineering education, particularly in motivating student learning, increasing knowledge retention, and developing problem solving, communication, and teamwork skills. However, PBL adoption remains limited by real challenges in effective implementation. In this paper, we review the literature on advantages and challenges of PBL and present our own experiences. We also provide practical guidelines for implementing PBL, including two examples of PBL modules from biomechanics courses at two different institutions. Overall, we conclude that the benefits for both professors and students support the use of PBL in biomedical engineering education.",

    "Abstract": "In the cloud computing environment, since data owners worry about private information in their data being disclosed without permission, they try to retain the knowledge within the data, while applying privacy-preserving techniques to the data. In the past, a data perturbation approach was commonly used to modify the original data content, but it also results in data distortion, and hence leads to significant loss of knowledge within the data. To solve this problem, this study introduced the concept of reversible integer transformation in the image processing domain and developed a Reversible Data Transform (RDT) algorithm that can disrupt and restore data. In the RDT algorithm, using an adjustable weighting mechanism, the degree of data perturbation was adjusted to increase the flexibility of privacy-preserving. In addition, it allows the data to be embedded with a watermark, in order to identify whether the perturbed data has been tampered with. Experimental results show that, compared with the existing algorithms, RDT has better knowledge reservation and is better in terms of effectively reducing information loss and privacy disclosure risk. In addition, it has a high watermark payload.",

    "Abstract": "We document that immigrants in the United States differ from natives in several aspects relevant for their financial decision-making. Based on these differences, we designed novel financial education materials targeted at US immigrants and their children and evaluated their effectiveness using a randomized control trial. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous evaluation of financial education programs targeted at this population. Compared to a control group, the groups that received the one-time educational intervention were more likely to correctly answer financial knowledge questions immediately after the intervention. The estimated effects of this one-time intervention on knowledge were large, but most of them faded away after six months. Moreover, we find little effect of the treatments on intended financial behavior measures, both immediately and six months later. Our results point to the efficacy of this type of educational material in informing immigrants and their children about important financial information that they are unfamiliar with, including information related to their immigrant status.

    "Abstract": "English ENG English The Advanced Trauma Care for Nurses (ATCN) course was designed to help nurses increase their knowledge in management of the multiple trauma patient. To determine whether the trauma-related knowledge of ATCN course takers differed from nontakers, assess the factors associated with ATCN content knowledge among course takers, and explore the extent to which the ATCN content was used by course takers in their clinical practice. A cross-sectional online survey of 78 ATCN takers (nurses who had successfully completed the ATCN course within the previous 3 years) and 58 ATCN nontakers (a control group of nurses who had not taken the course but who worked in comparable clinical settings) was conducted. The survey consisted of demographic questions and a 15-item knowledge test spanning the ATCN course content. ATCN takers were also asked about the frequency with which a specific ATCN content had been used in their practice since taking the course. ATCN takers had a significantly higher (mean ± SD = 10.6 ± 2.2) total score on the study test than the ATCN nontakers (mean ± SD = 6.4 ± 2.6); t(134) = -10.0, p",

    "Abstract": "The aim of the research was to determine the relationship between knowledge sharing and knowledge loss through creation of a conceptual model of factors affecting knowledge sharing and a conceptual toolkit, able to be used by managers as an analysis tool. A theoretical, constructive approach was taken to the research through the use of a theory‐building methodology to create the conceptual model of factors affecting knowledge sharing in organisations. Empirical research was carried out using a case study at an energy infrastructure organisation in the UK through questionnaires and formal interviews to validate the model. A new conceptual model of factors affecting knowledge sharing was developed and evaluated, further improving the model. The empirical research showed validation of past literature and created additional elements to the model. The main limitation is that only one industry case study was used for empirical validation. This was due to the limited timeframe of the research, which suggests that further research should involve multiple case studies, covering a wide variety of industries. The model of factors affecting knowledge sharing allows managers to analyse their knowledge management strategies and offers suggestions of ways to reduce any risk of knowledge loss. There is a lack of conceptual models based on knowledge loss, and this paper aims to solve this issue. This will be useful to businesses, helping them to improve their knowledge management initiatives, retain knowledge and gain competitive advantage over competitors.

    "Abstract": "The Advanced Trauma Care for Nurses (ATCN) course was designed to help nurses increase their knowledge in management of the multiple trauma patient. To determine whether the trauma-related knowledge of ATCN course takers differed from nontakers, assess the factors associated with ATCN content knowledge among course takers, and explore the extent to which the ATCN content was used by course takers in their clinical practice. A cross-sectional online survey of 78 ATCN takers (nurses who had successfully completed the ATCN course within the previous 3 years) and 58 ATCN nontakers (a control group of nurses who had not taken the course but who worked in comparable clinical settings) was conducted. The survey consisted of demographic questions and a 15-item knowledge test spanning the ATCN course content. ATCN takers were also asked about the frequency with which a specific ATCN content had been used in their practice since taking the course. ATCN takers had a significantly higher (mean ± SD = 10.6 ± 2.2) total score on the study test than the ATCN nontakers (mean ± SD = 6.4 ± 2.6); t(134) = -10.0, p < .001. A shorter time since course completion was associated with higher knowledge scores. ATCN takers rated the clinical relevance and applicability of the course content as high. The findings suggest that completing the ATCN course increases knowledge levels of trauma patient management and that the ATCN course content is clinically relevant to the nurses. However, higher knowledge scores were observed for the most recent study participants, suggesting that booster sessions for ATCN course participants may be warranted.The Advanced Trauma Care for Nurses (ATCN) course was designed to help nurses increase their knowledge in management of the multiple trauma patient.

    "Abstract": "We document that immigrants in the United States differ from natives in several aspects relevant for their financial decision making. Based on these differences, we designed novel financial education materials targeted at US immigrants and their children and evaluated their effectiveness using a randomized control trial. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous evaluation of financial education programs targeted at this population. Compared to a control group, the groups that received the one-time educational intervention were more likely to correctly answer financial knowledge questions immediately after the intervention. The estimated effects of this one-time intervention on knowledge were large, but most of them faded away after six months. Moreover, we find little effect of the treatments on intended financial behavior measures, both immediately and six months later. Our results point to the efficacy of this type of educational material in informing immigrants and their children about important financial information that they are unfamiliar with, including information related to their immigrant status. However, they also suggest that a priority for future research should be to test whether repeated opportunities for learning can increase financial knowledge retention and lead to behavior change.",

The majority strongly agreed that safety culture education was critical to performing their jobs well.Full course compliance was achieved despite the sizable number of personnel and treatment centers. Periodic assessments demonstrated high knowledge retention, which significantly improved over time in nearly all department divisions. Additionally, our AHRQ patient safety grade remains high and continues to improve. These results will be used to further enhance ongoing internal safety initiatives and to inform future innovative efforts.

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we show how the Aboriginal people in the south-west of Australia (the Nyungar) developed systems of knowledge, of caring for country and of family relations that enabled them to survive for tens of thousands of years and continue to have importance today. The impacts of British colonisation on cultural continuity and knowledge in the south-west have been significant and include loss of land, break-up of families and massacre. These practices led to a loss of knowledge of language and culture in some cases. However, Nyungar culture is alive and dynamic, constantly being reclaimed, re-energised and rebuilt through the interaction of contemporary and traditional research praxis. Focusing on Derbal Nara (Cockburn Sound) on the coast in the southern metropolitan area of Perth, we provide case examples of the action-research-learning methodologies used by Whadjuk Nyungar Traditional Owners. We also provide examples of stories about Derbal Nara that are still alive and being recounted up to the present day, including those that account for the recent ice age and the end of the ice age 8000 years BC when sea levels rose, drowning land in the area of Derbal Nara. Finally, we argue that Whadjuk Nyungar experiences and world views based on relationality and reflexivity are central to sustainable coastal management and that in some respects there has already been a convergence of Indigenous and Western coastal management. We present a set of principles that support the development of this \"third space\" for coastal sustainability.",

    "Abstract": "In the cloud computing environment, since data owners worry about private information in their data being disclosed without permission, they try to retain the knowledge within the data, while applying privacy-preserving techniques to the data. In the past, a data perturbation approach was commonly used to modify the original data content, but it also results in data distortion, and hence leads to significant loss of knowledge within the data. To solve this problem, this study introduced the concept of reversible integer transformation in the image processing domain and developed a Reversible Data Transform (RDT) algorithm that can disrupt and restore data. In the RDT algorithm, using an adjustable weighting mechanism, the degree of data perturbation was adjusted to increase the flexibility of privacy-preserving. In addition, it allows the data to be embedded with a watermark, in order to identify whether the perturbed data has been tampered with. Experimental results show that, compared with the existing algorithms, RDT has better knowledge reservation and is better in terms of effectively reducing information loss and privacy disclosure risk. In addition, it has a high watermark payload.",
