    "Abstract": "Deficits in retention of anatomy knowledge from the preclinical years to clinical application on the wards have been well documented in the medical education literature. We developed and evaluated a web and laboratory‐based curriculum to address deficits in anatomy knowledge retention and to increase anatomy knowledge recall through repetition and application of clinical concepts during the obstetrics and gynecology (Ob/Gyn) core clinical clerkship. Using principles of adult learning and instructional design, a curriculum was designed consisting of (1) interactive, case‐based e‐modules reviewing clinically relevant anatomical topics and (2) a hands‐on laboratory session reinforcing the content of the e‐modules, with the practice of clinical techniques using anatomical cadaveric dissections. The curriculum's effectiveness was evaluated by using multiple choice testing and comparing baseline and final test scores. For questions testing content directly covered in this curriculum, mean final scores increased by 14.3% ( P < 0.001). In contrast, for questions not directly addressed in this curriculum, mean final scores did not increase significantly, only by 6.0% ( P = 0.31). Questions related to the uterus showed the greatest gains in final scores (30.3% improvement, P = 0.002). A curriculum with web‐based preparatory material and a hands‐on gross anatomy laboratory session effectively addresses deficits in anatomy retention and improves anatomical knowledge recall for medical students on a clinical clerkship. In the future, the authors plan to conduct a multicenter study to further evaluate the ability of this curriculum to improve clinically relevant anatomical knowledge.

    "Abstract": "The efficient feature selection for predictive and accurate classification is highly desirable in many application domains. Most of the attempts to neuro-fuzzy classifier lose information to build interpretable neuro-fuzzy classification model. This paper proposes an interpretable neuro-fuzzy classification model with significant features without loss of knowledge, which is an extension of an existing interpretable neuro-fuzzy classification model. The proposed model is designed based on the consideration of feature importance that is determined by frequency of linguistic features. The rules are then made based on important features. Therefore, the knowledge acquired in network can be comprehended to logical rules using only important features. The proposed model finally performs classification task by rule-based approach. The average accuracy calculated by 10-fold cross validation finds that the proposed model can increase performance of the already proven neuro-fuzzy system for classification tasks.",

    "Abstract": "Client-contact employee attrition can negatively affect client-supplier relationships, a problem all the more obvious within the knowledge-intensive service industry in which the untimely loss of employees adversely affects client relationships. From the client's perspective, employee attrition increases uncertainty over the perceived quality of service and results in the loss of valuable tacit knowledge from the provider. Drawing on case study materials, this paper seeks to develop a framework for understanding how firms can successfully manage client relationships despite threats of employee attrition. This paper suggests that relationship transparency based on the active transfer of information, knowledge retention and sharing, the implementation of succession plans, and timely intervention by the management, can reduce clients' perceived uncertainty, thereby fortifying a trusted relationship with their provider. This study offers a transparency-based conceptual framework that contributes to the business-to-business relationship literature within the knowledge-intensive service industry and discusses managerial implications.

    "Abstract": "At a time when companies are downsizing, with periods often ensuing where there are few if any semisubmersible design and construction projects underway, the need to support the industry with knowledge retention is a key requirement. This has acted as a driver for the recent publication of a procedure for the strength and fatigue assessments of semisubmersible units as well as updates to Lloyd's Register's \"Rules for Offshore Units,\" which cover classification requirements for semisubmersible units. This year's depressed offshore market also has produced a situation in which double digit numbers of semisubmersible drilling rigs have been unable to pick up profitable contracts and are being cold-stacked as a result. The semisubmersible unit lends itself well to change of use because ship motions are favorable and there is a good amount of deck space to work with. Drilling units can become floating production units, accommodation facilities and dive support vessels.",

    "Abstract": "Problem-based learning (PBL) has been shown to be effective in biomedical engineering education, particularly in motivating student learning, increasing knowledge retention, and developing problem solving, communication, and teamwork skills. However, PBL adoption remains limited by real challenges in effective implementation. In this paper, we review the literature on advantages and challenges of PBL and present our own experiences. We also provide practical guidelines for implementing PBL, including two examples of PBL modules from biomechanics courses at two different institutions.

    "Abstract": "Deficits in retention of anatomy knowledge from the preclinical years to clinical application on the wards have been well documented in the medical education literature. We developed and evaluated a web and laboratory-based curriculum to address deficits in anatomy knowledge retention and to increase anatomy knowledge recall through repetition and application of clinical concepts during the obstetrics and gynecology (Ob/Gyn) core clinical clerkship. Using principles of adult learning and instructional design, a curriculum was designed consisting of (1) interactive, case-based e-modules reviewing clinically relevant anatomical topics and (2) a hands-on laboratory session reinforcing the content of the e-modules, with the practice of clinical techniques using anatomical cadaveric dissections. The curriculum's effectiveness was evaluated by using multiple choice testing and comparing baseline and final test scores. For questions testing content directly covered in this curriculum, mean final scores increased by 14.3% (P<0.001). In contrast, for questions not directly addressed in this curriculum, mean final scores did not increase significantly, only by 6.0% (P=0.31). Questions related to the uterus showed the greatest gains in final scores (30.3% improvement, P=0.002). A curriculum with web-based preparatory material and a hands-on gross anatomy laboratory session effectively addresses deficits in anatomy retention and improves anatomical knowledge recall for medical students on a clinical clerkship. In the future, the authors plan to conduct a multicenter study to further evaluate the ability of this curriculum to improve clinically relevant anatomical knowledge.

    "Abstract": "English ENG English Background: Evidence suggests that human patient simulation can dramatically enhance nursing education; however, educators face substantial time barriers to facilitate multiple simulation experiences into their curriculum. Method: Using quasi-experimental design, the intervention group (n = 29) received eight large-group simulations in place of lecture, whereas the control group (n = 31) received traditional teaching strategies. Results: A one-way between-group multivariate analysis of covariance revealed statistically significant differences, whereby students who received the intervention performed significantly better (p = .01) on knowledge retention?related simulation content, whereas there were no differences in knowledge retention between intervention and control groups on nonsimulation content. Within the intervention group, differences in participants' and observers' knowledge retention levels were not statistically significant. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study support large-group simulation as an effective alternative to lecture. This may allow for increased integration of simulation within nursing curricula.

    "Abstract": "The importance of knowledge appliance process is based on the fact that it is related to effective appliance of existing knowledge to solve problems, manage business processes and knowledge about adequate working environment appliance creation. Knowledge appliance process is described as knowledge management implementation stage when knowledge is transformed into specific organizational results. Organizations in order to implement effectively and coordinate the knowledge appliance process often encounter problems of psychological, functional type or loss of knowledge value. To solve this type of problems knowledge appliance process is used, in which it is important not only to know about internal and external knowledge, where is knowledge, who has this knowledge but also to apply existing knowledge to complete work functions and to create value of organization. To solve these problems effective knowledge appliance process is necessary, during which new or existing knowledge has to be suitable to use and apply to increase working performance. In order to implement effectively the knowledge appliance process for organizations, it is necessary to assess this process efficiency affecting factors. The article looks into theoretical evaluation aspects of knowledge appliance process, which are practically evaluated by the example of pre-school education model example. Research methods are scientific literature analysis, survey, expert and multiple criteria evaluation.",

    "Abstract": "Medicalization was the theme of the 29th European Conference on Philosophy of Medicine and Health Care that included a panel session on the DSM and mental health. Philosophical critiques of the medical model in psychiatry suffer from endemic assumptions that fail to acknowledge the real world challenges of psychiatric nosology. The descriptive model of classification of the DSM 3-5 serves a valid purpose in the absence of known etiologies for the majority of psychiatric conditions. However, a consequence of the \"atheoretical\" approach of the DSM is rampant epistemological confusion, a shortcoming that can be ameliorated by importing perspectives from the work of Jaspers and McHugh. Finally, contemporary psychiatry's over-reliance on neuroscience and pharmacotherapy has led to a reductionist agenda that is antagonistic to the inherently pluralistic nature of psychiatry.  As a result,  the field has suffered a loss of knowledge that may be difficult to recover.",

What challenges face public sector organizations in sub-Saharan Africa in capturing and retaining knowledge? What is the current status of knowledge retention in the public sector in sub-Saharan Africa? The results reveal that public sector organizations are using various strategies such as codification, personalization, training, education, workshops, seminars, storytelling, mentoring and apprenticeship to capture and retain knowledge. The ICT infrastructure available for capturing and retaining knowledge in the public sector includes institutional repositories, emails, global networks databases, portals, accounting and financial systems, human resource systems, knowledge route-maps knowledge networks and discussions forums. The challenges for managing knowledge assets in public sector organizations include limited understanding of KM benefits; shortage of skill; lack of incentives or rewards to share knowledge; lack of appropriate technology; limited commitment from senior management, lack of appropriate models to learn from and brain drain. The implementation of e-government initiatives across the continent was starting to institutionalize and promote knowledge management strategies in public sector organizations. The results from this article provide a foundation for knowledge management policy formulation to enhance efficiency and service delivery in public agencies.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge management helps to avoid loss of knowledge, focuses on expertise and allows to accumulate knowledge of the work processes in its different forms, ensuring its permanence. The term benchmarking originates from a term used by surveyors, serving to designate a mark or reference a standard. Benchmarking can be considered as a science with five different generations and have produced significant changes in the scope of its objectives. There is a relationship between knowledge management and benchmarking, as through benchmarking practice, companies/organizations can improve their management skills in order to achieve equal or better results than its competitors.",

    "Abstract": "Even if knowledge exchange in general generates benefits, it may have opposite effects if it happens unintentionally from the knowledge holder's point of view. Knowledge leaving may cause knowledge loss if it involves key employees, and in the hands of outsiders, some knowledge assets may hurt competitiveness of the firm. As the overall knowledge mobility related dynamics are rather abstract and difficult to grasp, this study tries to dissolve some of the debates that exist especially in open innovation literature, around the relevance of knowledge protection for innovation management. The study aims at showing that sharing and protection are two sides of the same coin. We approach the identification of dimensions by the questions: how and why knowledge moves, what kind of knowledge moves, and where and how knowledge flows happen. Through theoretical and qualitative empirical investigation we develop a categorization of dimensions of knowledge mobility.",

    "Abstract": "Medicalization was the theme of the 29th European Conference on Philosophy of Medicine and Health Care that included a panel session on the DSM and mental health. Philosophical critiques of the medical model in psychiatry suffer from endemic assumptions that fail to acknowledge the real world challenges of psychiatric nosology. The descriptive model of classification of the DSM 3-5 serves a valid purpose in the absence of known etiologies for the majority of psychiatric conditions. However, a consequence of the \"atheoretical\" approach of the DSM is rampant epistemological confusion, a shortcoming that can be ameliorated by importing perspectives from the work of Jaspers and McHugh. Finally, contemporary psychiatry's over-reliance on neuroscience and pharmacotherapy has led to a reductionist agenda that is antagonistic to the inherently pluralistic nature of psychiatry.  As a result,  the field has suffered a loss of knowledge that may be difficult to recover.Medicalization was the theme of the 29th European Conference on Philosophy of Medicine and Health Care that included a panel session on the DSM and mental health.

    "Abstract": "Compliance by residents in pediatrics to pediatric resuscitation guidelines is low. In many French faculties, a 1-h traditional lecture is still used to educate medical students about pediatric cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). We developed an innovative pedagogic course combining a 23-min video and 3-h simulation exercises to improve knowledge and skills of medical students. A prospective controlled study was conducted. Medical student knowledge was tested before, just after, and 6-12 months after the innovative course and compared to that of a cohort who attended the traditional lecture. A high-fidelity mannequin simulator simulating cardiopulmonary arrest was used to assess and compare the skills of the study and control groups. Costs of the courses were evaluated; 809 of 860 (94 %) medical students were assessed for knowledge. Six to 12 months after the courses, the median score was significantly higher for the innovative group than that for the traditional lecture group (p < 0.001). In terms of skills, student in the innovative group scored higher on the performance score than the control group (p < 0.01). The innovative course was 24 times more expensive.

    "Abstract": "Contemporary education of physics in primary and secondary schools are very well organized but still not perfect. Learning materials, multimedia learning objects, knowledge testing and grading is driven to the details in Slovenia but the drill seems to be forgotten. Knowledge retention positively correspond with the amount and duration of the drills. Drill should not increase costs of education for students. In Slovenia a project E-va (electronic drill book) produced publically available e-drills for primary and secondary schools [1]. Article present the test of efficiency of e-drills on the population of 1st year students of undergraduate study program of elementary education. Those students are interdisciplinary in nature and knows physics from secondary schools. Two random groups were formed to be tested with the paper drill questions and e-drill questions. We do not expect the difference between groups since both groups are going to have three drills of each type. Differences are going to be influenced only by the type of drill (e-drill or paper drill). Results highlight the motivation factors of ICT and enables us to identify benefits and drawbacks of e-drills. The results will be the part of the requirement specification of the new development of e-drills.",

    "Intellectual Capital Risk Assessment": "a Perspective From Credit Risk Analysts",

    "Abstract": "Intellectual capital (IC) of an enterprise refers to the knowledge, skills and experiences of the employees and the values like corporate culture, business processes and customer satisfaction which they create for the enterprise. IC is sometimes known as intangible or knowledge assets as opposed to the much more familiar traditional physical capital and financial capital, which are tangible in nature. Many researchers found that IC would create the majority of corporate values, especially for knowledge-intensive companies, explaining why IC has become the single most important driver of enterprise business growth, sustainability, innovation and competitive advantage in our globalized environment. Therefore proper assessment and reporting of these critical though intangible assets are essential in addition to what financial reports received by the business community for years. As there is currently much literature written on IC performance in the field already, this paper focuses instead on the risks such as knowledge loss from poor documentation or resignation of key staff. In particular, how a knowledge of IC risks can enhance the quality of credit risk analysis of financial institutions is also studied, as a poor credit risk management may quickly erode the capital base and accumulated earnings of any bank. In this research, an exploratory test design comprising a literature review and semi-structured interviews with credit risk banking professionals have been developed and adopted. Information is collected on IC risks in general and how and why IC risks can be useful in credit risk analysis of business loan applicants. A conceptual framework is then put forward to identify, analyze and assess the potential IC risks and their impacts, which are important considerations in the value creation process of an enterprise. The relevance of the framework to credit risks analysis is also addressed.",

    "Abstract": "Nutrition education is a standard of care in bariatric surgery clinical practice guidelines. Despite its known importance, no studies have documented the trajectory of nutrition knowledge over the course of the bariatric surgery process.

BACKGROUND Nutrition education is a standard of care in bariatric surgery clinical practice guidelines. Despite its known importance, no studies have documented the trajectory of nutrition knowledge over the course of the bariatric surgery process. Primary objectives included determining changes in bariatric surgery nutrition knowledge scores from the pre-surgical phase to 1-month post-surgical intervention and investigating the impact of time on nutrition education retention in bariatric patients. Secondary objectives focused on the relationship between patients' pre-operative anxiety and depression on nutrition knowledge retention.Prior to data collection, patients attended a nutrition education class and met with a registered dietitian. One hundred and nineteen consented patients eligible for bariatric surgery completed a nutrition knowledge questionnaire, Eating After Bariatric Surgery (EABS) prior to and 1 month following bariatric surgery. METHODS Prior to data collection, patients attended a nutrition education class and met with a registered dietitian. One hundred and nineteen consented patients eligible for bariatric surgery completed a nutrition knowledge questionnaire, Eating After Bariatric Surgery (EABS) prior to and 1 month following bariatric surgery.Analyses revealed (1) patients' nutrition knowledge (measured by EABS) significantly increased from the pre-operative phase (M = 46.9; SD = 14.4) to the post-operative phase ((M = 56.9; SD = 14.1), t(118) = -8.01, p < .001); (2) time between the nutrition education class and patients' surgery significantly impacted knowledge retained; (3) patients with higher pre-operative levels of depression and anxiety had significantly lower post-operative nutrition knowledge; and (4) gender differences in terms of patients' nutrition knowledge. RESULTS Analyses revealed (1) patients' nutrition knowledge (measured by EABS) significantly increased from the pre-operative phase (M = 46.9; SD = 14.4) to the post-operative phase ((M = 56.9; SD = 14.1), t(118) = -8.01, p < .001); (2) time between the nutrition education class and patients' surgery significantly impacted knowledge retained; (3) patients with higher pre-operative levels of depression and anxiety had significantly lower post-operative nutrition knowledge; and (4) gender differences in terms of patients' nutrition knowledge.This study confirmed that dietary knowledge significantly improves following surgical intervention. Furthermore, increased time in between receiving nutrition knowledge and surgery resulted in less retained knowledge 1-month post-op. Future education interventions for bariatric surgery programs should focus on addressing these factors to optimize patient knowledge and information retention after surgery. CONCLUSIONS This study confirmed that dietary knowledge significantly improves following surgical intervention. Furthermore, increased time in between receiving nutrition knowledge and surgery resulted in less retained knowledge 1-month post-op.

Prospective, randomized trial involving 40 physicians in a pediatric emergency department was used. Instrument was comprised of 48 multiple-choice questions (evaluative component) and answer critiques (educational component) on pediatric trauma divided into two modules. The instrument was assessed for test-retest reliability, item difficulty, and construct validity. Intervention consisted of online administration of each module as eight spaced emails (3 questions each) over a course of 4 weeks and was repeated after 2 and 4 months. Participants received an answer critique on committing to an answer. Primary outcome was difference in mean percentage of correct answers at 2 and 4 months versus baseline. Paired t test and effect size (d) were performed. Secondary outcome was exit-survey of ISE acceptability. There was significant improvement at 2 months (8.0, 95% confidence intervel [CI] = [3.6, 12.5], d = 0.75), but improvement at 4 months (1.6, 95% CI = [-4.5, 7.7], d = 0.18) was not significant. Sixty percent would retake and recommend ISE to others. Interactive, spaced education improves knowledge in pediatric trauma and is well accepted. Studies are required to determine the optimal spacing interval for this form of education.",

    "Abstract": "The effectiveness of an educational board game developed to teach the pharmacology of antimicrobial drugs to medical students was compared with the lecture-based seminar as a supplemental tool to improve short- and long-term knowledge retention and the perception of the learning method by students. A group of 124 students was randomized to board game and control groups. Short-term knowledge retention was assessed by comparing differences in post- and pre-tests scores, and long-term knowledge retention by comparing final examination scores. Both didactic methods seem to improve short-term knowledge retention to similar extent. Long-term knowledge retention of board game seminar participants was higher than those who attended the lecture-based seminar (ANCOVA, P = 0.035). The effect was most pronounced within 14 days after the intervention (ANOVA, P = 0.007). The board game was well perceived by the students. The board game seems to be a promising didactic tool, however, it should be further tested to assess its full educational utility.",

    "Abstract": "According to Illinois Agricultural Education's 2014 annual report, nearly 61% of students beginning their undergraduate studies in Agriculture at a 2-yr college in Illinois came from non-farm backgrounds. Yet. knowledge of and experience in livestock operations is still a requirement for many careers in the animal science industry. In response to tins, the Department of Agriculture at Illinois State University has implemented a course that provides students an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with beef cattle management and marketing. The course was designed to enhance learning by requiring students to develop and execute a management and marketing plan for a pen of steers at the University Farm, which encouraged practical application of classroom instruction. The objective of this study was to determine if participation in the course enhanced student learning and knowledge retention. Eight student teams, composed of 5-4 students each, executed their own management and marketing strategies with the goal of obtaining the highest return on production, measured by subtracting expenses from revenue. Quantitative data was derived from gain scores on a pre-test at the beginning of the course and a post-test at the conclusion of the course. Qualitative data was obtained by having the students reflect on what they had learned. Tins reflection occurred at the end of each unit using Likert-scale and open-ended questions. Results obtained demonstrated that the contest enhanced learning and knowledge retention. Post-test means improved significantly (P = 0.000) over pre-test means with gain scores being the highest in the unit topic areas of meat science, marketing and health. In addition, student reflection indicated the students believed that the contest enhanced learning, noting that it increased their beef cattle knowledge by making them aware of all of the factors that 20 into raising and marketing feedlot cattle.",

    "Abstract": "Description Neonatal Tips is an online education resource that delivers daily microteaching through mobile e-learning technology with the aim of improving knowledge in neonatal medicine for paediatric trainees. The tips are short (less than 50 words) pieces of information relating to neonatal medicine, followed by a relevant reference hyperlink to a guideline or journal article. The level of information in the tips is aligned to the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) level one curriculum (2010). Each tip is emailed out to subscribers, free of charge, daily from Monday to Friday, which they can read on their smart phone, tablet, personal computer, or any email facility. Subscribers are self-selecting, do so voluntarily and can cease participation at any time. Aim To evaluate the effectiveness of the Neonatal Tips e-learning programme. Methodology A service evaluation incorporating knowledge assessment by multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and participant evaluation questionnaire. Setting Recruitment, consent, the e-learning programme, MCQs and questionnaire were all administered online. Participants Participants were volunteer postgraduate paediatric specialty trainees who were either existing users of Neonatal Tips or recruited from the local deanery by email. Main outcome measures Participants' knowledge change and participants' satisfaction. Results In total, 1504 MCQ questions were completed over 11 weeks by 18 participants. Participants significantly improved their MCQ scores from pre- to post-tips (from 42% to 68% correct answers, p < 0.001). All participants wanted Neonatal Tips to continue for their learning. 63% of participants answered that Neonatal Tips was \"extremely useful\" and 85% answered that receiving tips by email was either \"valuable\" or \"very valuable\". Conclusion Neonatal Tips is a novel convenient method of delivering teaching to busy postgraduate trainees. It is effective in improving short-term knowledge, is useful in signposting participants to further relevant reading and has high user satisfaction. Further evaluation is required to assess longer-term knowledge retention. Research is needed to compare the effectiveness and acceptability of this new format with existing e-learning programmes and standard teaching.",

    "Abstract": "English ENG English Educational intervention programs are an important element to improve nurses' knowledge of pressure ulcer (PU) prevention. Various teaching methods have been used with diverse results but none have been analyzed in Nigeria. A quasi-experimental study using a pretest/post test design was conducted among 193 registered nurses with 6 months experience who worked in purposefully selected wards (neuroscience, orthopedics, renal, and cardiac) in 3 teaching hospitals to examine the level of knowledge retention after interactive instruction. Participants were randomized to intervention (IG, n = 127 from 2 hospitals) and control (CG, n = 66 from 1 hospital) groups; the IG was provided a 5-day, face-to-face interactive lecture, and the CG engaged in a 1-day, 4-hour discussion of PU prevention practices. The Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Tool, a 47-item questionnaire in which a correct answer = 1 point and an incorrect/\"I don't know\" answer = 0 (maximum score 47), was used to assess and compare knowledge retention at 3 time points: baseline (T1), immediately after instruction (T2), and after 3 months (T3). Three trained research assistants assisted with registration of participants and distribution and collection of the questionnaires. All questionnaires were retrieved at T1 before the intervention began. Respondents were encouraged to respond to all questions. Data were analyzed using t-test and ANOVA (P = 0.05). At T1, knowledge scores were comparable between the IG and CG (32.5 ± 4.2 and 30.8 ± 5.0 for IG and CG, respectively). At T2, knowledge scores increased significantly only in the IG to 40.7 ± 3.4 (d = 1.94, P 0.05). The mean difference between T1 and T2 was -8.2 ± 5.4, t = -17.0, P = 0.000. Similarly, mean scores increased significantly from T2 to T3 in the IG (mean= -2.0 ± 5.5, t = -4.1, P = 0.000); scores in the CG were -6.2 ± 7.2, t = -6.3 (P = 0.000). A face-to-face interactive lecture was shown to be an effective method of program delivery for nurses; other educational methods should be assessed and their effects on PU prevention practices and outcomes evaluated.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of simulation versus lecture-based education among preclinical medical students. Methods: Twenty medical students participated in this randomized, controlled crossover study. Students were randomized to four groups. Each group received two simulations and two lectures covering four different topics. Students were administered a pre-test, post-test and delayed post-test. The mean percentage of questions answered correctly on each test was calculated. The mean of each student’s change in score across the three tests was used to compare simulation- versus lecture-based education. Results: Students in both the simulation and lecture groups demonstrated improvement between the pre-test and post-test ( p 0.05). When comparing interventions, the change in score between the pre-test and post-test was similar among both the groups ( p > 0.05). The change in score between the post-test and delayed post-test was greater in the simulation group ( p < 0.05). Conclusions: High-fidelity simulation may serve as a viable didactic platform for preclinical medical education. Our study demonstrated equivalent immediate knowledge gain and superior long-term knowledge retention in comparison to lectures.

    "Abstract": "Educational intervention programs are an important element to improve nurses' knowledge of pressure ulcer (PU) prevention. Various teaching methods have been used with diverse results but none have been analyzed in Nigeria. A quasi-experimental study using a pretest/post test design was conducted among 193 registered nurses with >6 months experience who worked in purposefully selected wards (neuroscience, orthopedics, renal, and cardiac) in 3 teaching hospitals to examine the level of knowledge retention after interactive instruction. Participants were randomized to intervention (IG, n = 127 from 2 hospitals) and control (CG, n = 66 from 1 hospital) groups; the IG was provided a 5-day, face-to-face interactive lecture, and the CG engaged in a 1-day, 4-hour discussion of PU prevention practices. The Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Tool, a 47-item questionnaire in which a correct answer = 1 point and an incorrect/\"I don't know\" answer = 0 (maximum score 47), was used to assess and compare knowledge retention at 3 time points: baseline (T1), immediately after instruction (T2), and after 3 months (T3). Three trained research assistants assisted with registration of participants and distribution and collection of the questionnaires. All questionnaires were retrieved at T1 before the intervention began. Respondents were encouraged to respond to all questions. Data were analyzed using t-test and ANOVA (P = 0.05). At T1, knowledge scores were comparable between the IG and CG (32.5 ± 4.2 and 30.8 ± 5.0 for IG and CG, respectively). At T2, knowledge scores increased significantly only in the IG to 40.7 ± 3.4 (d = 1.94, P <0.05). The mean difference between T1 and T2 was -8.2 ± 5.4, t = -17.0, P = 0.000. Similarly, mean scores increased significantly from T2 to T3 in the IG (mean= -2.0 ± 5.5, t = -4.1, P = 0.000); scores in the CG were -6.2 ± 7.2, t = -6.3 (P = 0.000). A face-to-face interactive lecture was shown to be an effective method of program delivery for nurses; other educational methods should be assessed and their effects on PU prevention practices and outcomes evaluated.",

    "Abstract": "Medicalization was the theme of the 29th European Conference on Philosophy of Medicine and Health Care that included a panel session on the DSM and mental health. Philosophical critiques of the medical model in psychiatry suffer from endemic assumptions that fail to acknowledge the real world challenges of psychiatric nosology. The descriptive model of classification of the DSM 3-5 serves a valid purpose in the absence of known etiologies for the majority of psychiatric conditions. However, a consequence of the \"atheoretical\" approach of the DSM is rampant epistemological confusion, a shortcoming that can be ameliorated by importing perspectives from the work of Jaspers and McHugh. Finally, contemporary psychiatry's over-reliance on neuroscience and pharmacotherapy has led to a reductionist agenda that is antagonistic to the inherently pluralistic nature of psychiatry. As a result, the field has suffered a loss of knowledge that may be difficult to recover.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of simulation versus lecture-based education among preclinical medical students. Twenty medical students participated in this randomized, controlled crossover study. Students were randomized to four groups. Each group received two simulations and two lectures covering four different topics. Students were administered a pre-test, post-test and delayed post-test. The mean percentage of questions answered correctly on each test was calculated. The mean of each student's change in score across the three tests was used to compare simulation- versus lecture-based education. Students in both the simulation and lecture groups demonstrated improvement between the pre-test and post-test (p 05). When comparing interventions, the change in score between the pre-test and post-test was similar among both the groups (p >05). The change in score between the post-test and delayed post-test was greater in the simulation group (p <05). High-fidelity simulation may serve as a viable didactic platform for preclinical medical education. Our study demonstrated equivalent immediate knowledge gain and superior long-term knowledge retention in comparison to lectures.",

    "Abstract": "Educational intervention programs are an important element to improve nurses' knowledge of pressure ulcer (PU) prevention. Various teaching methods have been used with diverse results but none have been analyzed in Nigeria. A quasi- experimental study using a pretest/post test design was conducted among 193 registered nurses with >6 months experience who worked in purposefully selected wards (neuroscience, orthopedics, renal, and cardiac) in 3 teaching hospitals to examine the level of knowledge retention after interactive instruction. Participants were randomized to intervention (IG, n = 127 from 2 hospitals) and control (CG, n = 66 from 1 hospital) groups; the IG was provided a 5-day, face-to-face interactive lecture, and the CG engaged in a 1-day, 4-hour discussion of PU prevention practices. The Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Tool, a 47-item questionnaire in which a correct answer = 1 point and an incorrect/\"I don't know\" answer = 0 (maximum score 47), was used to assess and compare knowledge retention at 3 time points: baseline (T1), immediately after instruction (T2), and after 3 months (T3). Three trained research assistants assisted with registration of participants and distribution and collection of the questionnaires. All questionnaires were retrieved at T1 before the intervention be- gan. Respondents were encouraged to respond to all questions. Data were analyzed using t-test and ANOVA (P = 0.05). At T1, knowledge scores were comparable between the IG and CG (32.5 ± 4.2 and 30.8 ± 5.0 for IG and CG, respectively). At T2, knowledge scores increased significantly only in the IG to 40.7 ± 3.4 (d = 1.94, P less than 0.05). The mean difference between T1 and T2 was -8.2 ± 5.4, t = -17.0, P = 0.000. Similarly, mean scores increased significantly from T2 to T3 in the IG (mean= -2.0 ± 5.5, t = -4.1, P = 0.000); scores in the CG were -6.2 ± 7.2, t = -6.3 (P = 0.000). A face-to-face interactive lecture was shown to be an effective method of program delivery for nurses; other educational methods should be assessed and their effects on PU prevention practices and outcomes evaluated.Educational intervention programs are an important element to improve nurses' knowledge of pressure ulcer (PU) prevention.

    "Abstract": "The effectiveness of an educational board game developed to teach the pharmacology of antimicrobial drugs to medical students was compared with the lecture-based seminar as a supplemental tool to improve short- and long-term knowledge retention and the perception of the learning method by students. A group of 124 students was randomized to board game and control groups. Short-term knowledge retention was assessed by comparing differences in post- and pre-tests scores, and long-term knowledge retention by comparing final examination scores. Both didactic methods seem to improve short-term knowledge retention to similar extent. Long-term knowledge retention of board game seminar participants was higher than those who attended the lecture-based seminar (ANCOVA, P = 0.035). The effect was most pronounced within 14 days after the intervention (ANOVA, P = 0.007). The board game was well perceived by the students. The board game seems to be a promising didactic tool, however, it should be further tested to assess its full educational utility.The effectiveness of an educational board game developed to teach the pharmacology of antimicrobial drugs to medical students was compared with the lecture-based seminar as a supplemental tool to improve short- and long-term knowledge retention and the perception of the learning method by students.

Pretest/posttest and precourse/postcourse surveys evaluated students' short-term knowledge retention and perceptions before and after the redesigned course. The final grades improved after the redesign. Mean scores on the posttest improved from the pretest. Postcourse survey showed 88% of students were satisfied with the redesign.

    "Abstract": "Developing and refining methods for teaching systems engineering is part of Systems Engineering grand challenges and agenda for research in the SE research community. Retention of systems engineering knowledge is a growing concern in the United States as the baby boom generation continues to retire and the faster pace of technology development does not allow for younger generations to gain experiential knowledge through years of practice. Government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), develop their own curricula and SE leadership development programs to \"grow their own\" systems engineers. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) conducts its own Center-focused Marshall Systems Engineering Leadership Development Program (MSELDP), a competitive program consisting of coursework, a guest lecture series, and a rotational assignment into an unfamiliar organization engaged in systems engineering. Independently, MSFC developed two courses to address knowledge retention and sharing concerns: Real World Marshall Mission Success course and its Case Study Writers Workshop and Writers Experience. Teaching case study writing and leading students through a hands-on experience at writing a case study on an SE topic can enhance SE training and has the potential to accelerate the transfer of experiential knowledge. This paper is an overview of the pilot experiences with teaching case study writing, its application in case study-based learning, and identifies potential areas of research and application for case study writing in systems engineering education.",

    "Abstract": "The introduction of the RIIO-T1 price control in 2013 brought a significant increase in the scale of construction works in the SP Transmission area. This includes modernisation of end of life assets and extensive reinforcement to accommodate significant volumes of renewable generation. In order to meet the demands of project throughput, a need to create efficiencies in the design and delivery of Protection & Control solutions was identified. The benefits of applying substation automation systems (SAS) based on the IEC 61850 standard were identified and adopted as the preferred solution. The paper describes the step change in technology for SP Transmission, the benefits of the design solution, and the challenges encountered in its development. The benefits of developing solutions in-house will be described, including knowledge retention and transfer and the embedding of the benefits of IEC61850 in the corporate culture.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The purpose of this study was to use the body painting method to teach hand anatomy to a group of preclinical medical students. Methods: Students reviewed hand anatomy using the traditional method and body painting exercise. Feedback and retention of the anatomy-related information were examined by a questionnaire and multiple-choice questions, respectively, immediately and 1 month after the painting exercise. Results: Students agreed that the exercise was advantageous and helped facilitate self-active learning after in-class anatomy lessons. While there was no significant difference in knowledge retention between the control and experimental groups, the students appreciated the exercise in which they applied body paint to the human body to learn anatomy. Conclusion: The body painting was an efficient tool for aiding the interactive learning of medical students and increasing the understanding of gross anatomy.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: We investigated the effect of Team-Based Learning (TBL) on long-term retention of knowledge in comparison to a traditional curriculum. Methods: As TBL was incorporated into our curriculum in the 2008–2009 academic year, students were compared with those who received the traditional curriculum the year prior. Students in both the groups completed multiple-choice knowledge test at four time points spanning two years. Test performance was compared at each time point to assess changes in knowledge retention as a function of time. Results: Baseline knowledge did not differ significantly between the TBL and control groups [51% versus 46%; t (84) = 0.91, p = 0.37, d = 0.20]. Performance improved after the course for both the groups, but was significantly higher in the TBL group [79% versus 59%; t (84) = 4.96, p = 0.000004, d = 0.95]. However, when assessed prior to the pediatrics clerkship, learning gains from TBL had largely disappeared and the small difference in performance was not significant [57% versus 51%; t (84) = 1.51, p = 0.14, d = 0.32]. Conclusion: Incorporating TBL into the pre-clinical pediatrics curriculum led to large gains in knowledge over the short-term, but these gains did not persist. Further research should focus on extending the impact of TBL on long-term knowledge retention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "NASA's Johnson Space Center is working with Stottler Henke to improve teamwork skills for long-duration space missions. Numerous factors, however, make instilling teamwork skills into deep-space astronauts extremely challenging. First, due to communication difficulties and mission duration, teams must be trained in a wide variety of domains - from maintenance procedures throughout the ship, to extremely thorough medical training, to science evaluations. Second, there may be a significant delay between when such knowledge is acquired and when it is needed; for instance, several years may pass between an astronaut learning how to diagnose, and to treat, a collapsed lung. Third, training must anticipate a huge range of conditions; the sheer length of deep-space missions when compared to shuttle missions vastly increases the number, and scope, of possible situations that could arise, making it virtually impossible to train for every scenario. To face the myriad challenges of deep-space flight, inflight training must be readily available. Our solution is a low-fidelity simulation using game-based training that leverages our experience with intelligent tutoring system (ITS) technology. Game-based training is engaging - it provides an entertaining break from the more onerous aspects of deep-space flight. Moreover, it incentivizes practice of amorphous, but critical, teamwork skills, motivating crews to practice more frequently for either mission-related team training or generalizable team skills training. Finally, a game-based solution addresses the problem of finding the physical space in which to train when a small crew is constrained in a cramped environment for extended periods of time. This paper reviews the process of creating games based on firefighting on the International Space Station (ISS) and Medical Training. We review the process of analyzing the firefighting procedure to determine the teamwork skills involved; how those skills were mapped to game mechanics; what changes were made to try to make the experience more engaging; and finally, whether these changes were effective.",

    "Abstract": "For long-duration missions such as Mars Express and Rosetta, operating at considerable distances from Earth and with complex and highly variable mission profiles, issues of automation, the retention of knowledge and experience, and the potential human risk factor are especially relevant. Maximising the benefits of a \"human in-the-loop\" are increasingly seen as fundamental to on-going mission success. This paper presents a summary of these benefits, the experiences gained and the lessons learned. In section 4 of the paper specific case studies are presented, illustrating for both missions the significance of human involvement. This facilitated for Mars Express: (i) more efficient use of limited resources on the spacecraft; (ii) safer and more robust routine operations (as a reaction to critical on-board anomalies); (iii) the resolution of potentially significant scientific losses to the mission; and (iv) the realisation of a science return after mitigating risk during the encounter with Comet Siding Spring. Complementary case studies are also presented for Rosetta. In section 5, the principal lessons learned from the two missions are reviewed. These lessons encompass the experiences and knowledge gathered during extensive simulations and training campaigns, as well as years of in-flight experience. It is shown how a continually evolving mission profile (due, for example, to changes in science requirements, anomalies on the spacecraft or complex and changing mission phases), and on-going staff turnover, have led to significant challenges in knowledge retention and dissemination. Experience gained in the implementation of control-room automation is specifically highlighted - a concept introduced partly as a proof of concept, but also as a complement to (and extension of) automation implemented within the Mission Planning System. The relevance of the above experiences to the future evolution of the Mars Express mission is presented in section 6. This mission will have to manage a number of future challenges: (i) safely automating end-to-end spacecraft operations from planning and scheduling to spacecraft commanding; (ii) increasingly automating the verification process wherever possible and utilising the human resources where they are most valuable to the process; (iii) conducting safe operations within increasingly constraining power/thermal conditions; (iv) ensuring that knowledge and expertise can be retained in future years, after the Rosetta mission has ended. To summarise, the longevity and success of such complex missions could not have been achieved without the resourcefulness and adaptability offered by the human operator in the loop. The primary challenge for the remaining years of the Mars Express mission is therefore how to build on this knowledge and expertise for the benefit of the mission, whilst also encouraging and fostering a more institutionalised approach to knowledge capture and dissemination for the missions to come.",

Methodology: This study used a two-group single-blinded randomized controlled design and was conducted at seven community hospitals in the Midwest United States. Participants answered a demographic questionnaire and completed a knowledge test related to sepsis care management. Participants were randomized to either the treatment intervention (simulation) or the standard intervention (self-study article). Immediately after the education intervention and again at 3 months after the education intervention, participants completed the same knowledge test. Conclusion: Overall, there was no significant difference in knowledge test scores between groups of participants who received simulation and self-study. Knowledge scores for both groups improved after the educational intervention. References",

    "Abstract": "English ENG English The Taiwanese government subsidizes healthcare providers offering preventive medicine to patients to help reduce the threats of chronic sickness and halt skyrocketing medical expenditures. Usually, nurses are the primary workers who perform community health promotion; however, because of the chronic shortage of working nurses, many Taiwan hospitals have closed wards and deferred the responsibility of promoting primary prevention. With a community health promotion platform integrating interactive response features and Web sites for community patients and hospital staff, a case hospital efficiently sustained the community health services. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the integrated community health promotion platform for conducting education. Fifty-four patients/residents were invited to join a quasi-experiment of health education, and a follow-up survey was conducted to assess the acceptance of the community health promotion platform from both the experimental group of learners/users and the hospital staff. The results showed that the community health promotion platform was effective in improving participant health awareness. The experimental group outperformed the control group, with higher posttest scores and longer knowledge retention. Furthermore, users indicated a high acceptance of the community health promotion platform.",

BACKGROUND Hispanic dialysis patients often encounter barriers to learning about living kidney donation and transplantation. Effective culturally targeted interventions to increase knowledge are lacking. We developed a culturally targeted educational website to enhance informed treatment decision making for end-stage kidney disease.A pretest/posttest intervention study was conducted among adult Hispanic patients undergoing dialysis at 5 dialysis centers in Chicago, Illinois. Surveys included a 31-item, multiple-choice pretest/posttest of knowledge about kidney transplantation and living donation, attitudes about the website, Internet use, and demographics. The intervention entailed viewing 3 of 6 website sections for a total of 30 minutes. The pretest/posttest was administered immediately before and after the intervention. Participants completed a second posttest via telephone 3 weeks thereafter to assess knowledge retention, attitudes, and use of the website.

The intervention entailed viewing 3 of 6 website sections for a total of 30 minutes. The pretest/posttest was administered immediately before and after the intervention. Participants completed a second posttest via telephone 3 weeks thereafter to assess knowledge retention, attitudes, and use of the website.Sixty-three patients participated (96% participation rate). Website exposure was associated with a mean 17.1% same day knowledge score increase between pretest and posttest (P < .001). At 3 weeks, participants' knowledge scores remained 11.7% above pretest (P < .001). The greatest knowledge gain from pretest to 3-week follow-up occurred in the Treatment Options (P < .0001) and Cultural Beliefs and Myths (P < .0001) website sections. Most participants (95%) \"agreed\" or \"strongly agreed\" that they would recommend the website to other Hispanics. RESULTS Sixty-three patients participated (96% participation rate).

    "Abstract": "Over the past decade most of engineers, researchers, institutions, standard organizations and businessmen had been faced with challenges on how to represent productivity functions for effort estimation in information system workflow development. Despite the fact that workflows are everywhere, only few reports about its development effort are available. Accurate workflow sizing is a very difficult task at conceptual state. This paper proposes the proximity scoring measurement method to determine workflow size and to estimate workflow development effort with its knowledge retention effort. The approach is applied to the web publishing industry as a human resources case study. The approach of this paper is scalable and easy to apply to evaluate Web human resource workflow development effort. The implication of this work is that workflows can be estimated more precisely, helping to estimate the benefit of workflow reuse.",

    "Abstract": "The authors investigated the effect of Team-Based Learning (TBL) on long-term retention of knowledge in comparison to a traditional curriculum. As TBL was incorporated into our curriculum in the 2008-2009 academic year, students were compared with those who received the traditional curriculum the year prior. Students in both the groups completed multiple-choice knowledge test at four time points spanning two years. Performance improved after the course for both the groups, but was significantly higher in the TBL group [79% versus 59%; t(84)=4.96, p=0.000004, d=0.95]. However, when assessed prior to the pediatrics clerkship, learning gains from TBL had largely disappeared and the small difference in performance was not significant [57% versus 51%; t(84)=1.51, p=0.14, d=0.32]. Incorporating TBL into the pre-clinical pediatrics curriculum led to large gains in knowledge over the short-term, but these gains did not persist. Further research should focus on extending the impact of TBL on long-term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "This study reports on the socio-demographic and locality factors that influence ethnobiological knowledge in three communities of Zapotec indigenous people of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico. It uses local botanical nomenclature as a proxy for general ethnobiological knowledge. In each of these communities (one urban and two rural), 100 adult men were interviewed aided with a field herbarium. Fifty had a background in farming, and 50 worked in the secondary or tertiary sector as their main economic activity, totaling 300 interviews. Using a field herbarium with samples of 30 common and rare wild regional species, we documented visual recognition, knowledge of the local life form, generic and specific names and uses (five knowledge levels measuring knowledge depth). The relationship between sociodemographic variables and knowledge was analyzed with simple correlations. Differences between the three communities and the five knowledge levels were then evaluated with a discriminant analysis. A general linear analysis identified factors and covariables that influenced the observed differences. Differences between the groups with different economic activities were estimated with a t-test for independent samples. Most of the relationships found between sociodemographic variables and plant knowledge were expected: age and rurality were positively related with knowledge and years of formal schooling was negatively related. However, the somewhat less rural site had more traditional knowledge due to local circumstances. The general linear model explained 70–77% of the variation, a high value. It showed that economic activity was by far the most important factor influencing knowledge, by a factor of five. The interaction of locality and economic activity followed. The discriminant analysis assigned interviewees correctly to their localities in 94% of the cases, strengthening the evidence for intracultural variation. Both sociodemographic and historic intracultural differences heavily influence local knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose - This study aims to examine factors that may influence affective organizational commitment among knowledge workers. The five final factors considered in this study include knowledge-sharing culture, autonomy, workplace value identity, promotion practices and, finally, management support. Gender was included as the moderator for the aforementioned relationships. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 522 knowledge workers from manufacturing, retail and service sector anonymously completed a structured questionnaire that included measures of the variables of this study. Hierarchical regression was used to test the hypotheses. Findings - The findings provide evidence on the possible factors that organizations need to focus on and improvise to ensure the \"want to remain in the organization\" sentiment is enhanced among knowledge workers. Workplace value identity and knowledge-sharing culture were identified as the pertinent factors in influencing affective commitment. Gender was found to moderate the relationship between unfair promotion practice, knowledge-sharing culture and affective commitment. Research limitations/implications - One obvious limitation is that the sample of this study is sourced from a pool of knowledge workers. This limits our ability to conduct a comparative analysis with non-knowledge workers. Hence, future research could expand the model of this study to compare these relationships among knowledge and non-knowledge worker. Practical implications - Understanding the impact of these factors in a knowledge-based context helps firms prioritize and focus on important factors that can improve the level of affective commitment among knowledge workers. Doing so facilitates knowledge retention and prevents loss of knowledge. Originality/value - From a knowledge-based view, this paper identified factors that play an important role in retaining knowledge workers through enhanced affective commitment. With the changing workforce, the findings of this study show how knowledge-sharing culture and achievement orientation dominate affective commitment in a knowledge-based context.",

    "Abstract": "Background Despite the value of simulation for surgical training, it is unclear whether acquired competencies persist long term. A prior randomized trial showed that structured simulation improves knowledge of the safe use of electrosurgery (ES) amongst trainees up to 3 months after the curriculum (Madani et al. in Surg Endosc 28(10):2772-2782, 2014 ). We now analyse long-term knowledge retention. This study estimates the effects of a structured simulation-based curriculum to teach the safe use of ES on knowledge after 1 year. Methods Trainees previously participated in a 1-h didactic ES course, followed by randomization into one of two groups: an unstructured hands-on session where trainees used ES devices (control group) or a goal-directed hands-on training session (Sim group). Knowledge of pre- and post-curriculum (immediate, 3 months and 1 year) and knowledge of ES safety were assessed using different multiple-choice examinations. Data are expressed as median (interquartile range), *p < 0.05. Results Fifty-nine trainees participated (30 control group; 29 Sim group). Despite equal baseline examination scores, Sim group demonstrated higher scores compared to control immediately (89 % [83; 94] vs. 83 % [71; 86]*), 3 months (77 % [69; 90] vs. 60 % [51; 80]*) and 1 year after curriculum (70 % [61; 74] vs. 60 % [31; 71]*). One-year score remained significantly greater compared to baseline in the Sim group (70 % [61; 74] vs. 49 % [43; 57]*), but was similar to baseline in the control group (60 % [31; 71] vs. 45 % [34; 52]). Conclusions After ES simulation training, retention of competencies persists longer when the hands-on component is designed to reinforce specific learning objectives in a structured curriculum. Despite routine clinical use of ES devices, knowledge degrades overtime, suggesting the need for ongoing formal educational activities to reinforce curricular objectives.",

    "Abstract": "There has been growing attention to the need to shift from primarily lecture-based teaching to more active learning pedagogies in introductory science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classrooms. It has also been suggested that instructional content needs to shift to better prepare students to make connections between scientific facts and concepts and the contexts in daily life and policy making where an understanding of those concepts are required. Changes like these have been shown to promote increases in student engagement and knowledge retention. Deliberative democracy, a consensus model of decision making, has been used in real-life policy making involving controversial, science-related issues to increase citizen participation and engagement. Here, we describe a pedagogical approach based on this model implemented in a large, lecture-based, nonmajors introductory biology course at an urban public university. Results of student surveys and content retention tests show that this approach was effective in increasing student engagement and learning. This model has the potential to be expanded across STEM disciplines and in a variety of classroom and institutional contexts.",

    "Abstract": "To compare lecture-based learning (LBL) and discussion-based learning (DBL) by assessing immediate and long-term knowledge retention and application of practical knowledge in third- and fourth-year medical students. OBJECTIVE To compare lecture-based learning (LBL) and discussion-based learning (DBL) by assessing immediate and long-term knowledge retention and application of practical knowledge in third- and fourth-year medical students.A prospective, randomized control trial was designed to study the effects of DBL. Medical students were randomly assigned to intervention (DBL) or control (LBL) groups. Both the groups were instructed regarding the management of gastroschisis. The control group received a PowerPoint presentation, whereas the intervention group was guided only by an objectives list and a gastroschisis model. Students were evaluated using a multiple-choice pretest (Pre-Test MC) immediately before the teaching session, a posttest (Post-Test MC) following the session, and a follow-up test (Follow-Up MC) at 3 months. A practical examination (PE), which tested simple skills and management decisions, was administered at the end of the clerkship (Initial PE) and at 3 months after clerkship (Follow-Up PE). Students were also given a self-evaluation immediately following the Post-Test MC to gauge satisfaction and comfort level in the management of gastroschisis.

SETTING University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics and the Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA.A total of 49 third- and fourth-year medical students who were enrolled in the general surgery clerkship were eligible for this study. Enrollment into the study was completely voluntary. Of the 49 eligible students, 36 students agreed to participate in the study, and 27 completed the study. PARTICIPANTS A total of 49 third- and fourth-year medical students who were enrolled in the general surgery clerkship were eligible for this study. Enrollment into the study was completely voluntary. Of the 49 eligible students, 36 students agreed to participate in the study, and 27 completed the study.Mean scores for the Pre-Test MC, Post-Test MC, and Follow-Up MC were similar between the control and intervention groups. In the control group, the Post-Test MC scores were significantly greater than Pre-Test MC scores (8.92 ± 0.79 vs 4.00 ± 1.04, p < 0.0001), whereas the Follow-Up MC scores were significantly lower than Post-Test MC scores (7.17 ± 1.75 vs 8.92 ± 0.79, p = 0.005). In the control group, the Follow-Up MC scores were significantly greater than Pre-Test MC scores (7.17 ± 1.75 vs 4.00 ± 1.04, p < 0.0001). Analysis of variance for all control group MC examinations had a p < 0.0001. In the intervention group, the Post-Test MC scores were significantly greater than Pre-Test MC scores (8.33 ± 1.23 vs 4.60 ± 1.55, p < 0.0001), whereas the Follow-Up MC scores were significantly lower than Post-Test MC scores (7.13 ± 1.77 vs 8.33 ± 1.23, p = 0.04). In the intervention group, the Follow-Up MC scores were significantly greater than Pre-Test MC scores (7.13 ± 1.77 vs 4.60 ± 1.55, p = 0.0002). Analysis of variance for all intervention group MC examinations had a p < 0.0001. Mean scores for the Initial PE were significantly higher for the intervention group compared with the control group's score (7.47 ± 1.68 vs 5.25 ± 2.34, p = 0.008). Mean scores for the Follow-Up PE were significantly higher for the intervention group compared with the control group's score (7.87 ± 1.77 vs 5.83 ± 2.04, p = 0.005). A comparison of Initial PE vs Follow-Up PE was not significant in either group. Students in the intervention group were more comfortable in the immediate management of gastroschisis and placement of a silo and felt that the educational experience was more worthwhile than students in the control group did. RESULTS Mean scores for the Pre-Test MC, Post-Test MC, and Follow-Up MC were similar between the control and intervention groups. In the control group, the Post-Test MC scores were significantly greater than Pre-Test MC scores (8.92 ± 0.79 vs 4.00 ± 1.04, p < 0.0001), whereas the Follow-Up MC scores were significantly lower than Post-Test MC scores (7.17 ± 1.75 vs 8.92 ± 0.79, p = 0.005).

Students in the intervention group were more comfortable in the immediate management of gastroschisis and placement of a silo and felt that the educational experience was more worthwhile than students in the control group did.After a single instructional session, there was a significant difference in the students' scores between the control and the intervention groups on both administrations of the PEs. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in any administration of the MC examinations. This seems to suggest that DBL may lead to better practical knowledge and potentially improved long-term knowledge retention when compared with LBL. Students in the DBL group also felt more comfortable with the management of gastroschisis and were more satisfied with the educational session.

    "Abstract": "To determine whether a flipped classroom design would improve student performance and perceptions of the learning experience compared to traditional lecture course design in a required pharmacotherapy course for second-year pharmacy students. Students viewed short online videos about the foundational concepts and answered self-assessment questions prior to face-to-face sessions involving patient case discussions. Pretest/posttest and precourse/postcourse surveys evaluated students' short-term knowledge retention and perceptions before and after the redesigned course. The final grades improved after the redesign. Mean scores on the posttest improved from the pretest. Postcourse survey showed 88% of students were satisfied with the redesign. Students reported that they appreciated the flexibility of video viewing and knowledge application during case discussions but some also struggled with time requirements of the course. The redesigned course improved student test performance and perceptions of the learning experience during the first year of implementation.",

    "Abstract": "This is the first study in Serbia and the region of South-East Europe dedicated to clients' perception of outcome and efficiency of prenatal and reproductive genetic counseling. The primary aim of this study was to assess overall value and success of genetic counseling in prenatal and reproductive care with regard to perceived personal control of clients, reflecting also in a part patient comprehension, knowledge retention, and empowerment in decision-making. The standardized Perceived Personal Control questionnaire (PPC) was used for the assessment of 239 female participants. First, we performed a complete validation of the psychometric characteristics of the Serbian-language version of the PPC questionnaire. The validation of the questionnaire permits other researchers from Serbian-speaking regions of South-East Europe to use this standard instrument to assess the effectiveness of prenatal genetic counseling in their communities and analyze advantages and disadvantages of their counseling models. We also measured social and demographic characteristics of participants. Further, we analyzed effects of our team-based prenatal and reproductive genetic counseling model through (a) calculation of PPC scores at three different stages (before initial, after initial, and before second counseling session), and (b) by assessing participants' responses by indication for referral (advanced maternal age, abnormal biochemical screening, family history of hereditary disorders, maternal exposure to drugs, exposure to radiation, exposure to infective agents, infertility or recurrent abortions, and miscellaneous). The results indicate that participants' knowledge after initial counseling increased significantly and after that remained stable and sustainable. A satisfactory level of confidence among participants had been achieved, in that many felt an increased sense of control over their situation and emotional response to it. Indirectly, these results indicate the success of a team-based prenatal genetic counseling model, which has not been assessed in the literature to date.",

    "Abstract": "Research has shown that patients transported by nonpediatric teams have higher rates of morbidity and mortality. There is currently a paucity of pediatric standardized ongoing medical education for emergency medical service providers, thus we aimed to develop a model curriculum to increase their knowledge regarding pediatric respiratory distress and failure. OBJECTIVE Research has shown that patients transported by nonpediatric teams have higher rates of morbidity and mortality. There is currently a paucity of pediatric standardized ongoing medical education for emergency medical service providers, thus we aimed to develop a model curriculum to increase their knowledge regarding pediatric respiratory distress and failure.The curriculum was based on the Kolb Learning Cycle to optimize learning. Target learners were flight nurses (registered nurse) and emergency medical technicians of a private helicopter emergency transport team. The topics included were pediatric stridor, wheezing, and respiratory failure. Online modules were developed for continued spaced education. Knowledge gained from the interventions was measured by precurricular and postcurricular testing and compared with paired t tests. A linear mixed regression model was used to investigate covariates of interest. METHODS The curriculum was based on the Kolb Learning Cycle to optimize learning.

The topics included were pediatric stridor, wheezing, and respiratory failure. Online modules were developed for continued spaced education. Knowledge gained from the interventions was measured by precurricular and postcurricular testing and compared with paired t tests. A linear mixed regression model was used to investigate covariates of interest.Sixty-two learners attended the workshop. Fifty-nine learners completed both precurricular and postcurricular testing. The mean increase between pretest and posttest scores was 12.1% (95% confidence interval, 9.4, 14.8; P < 0.001). Type of licensure (private emergency medical technician vs registered nurse) and number of years experience had no association with the level of knowledge gained. Learners who had greater than 1 year of pediatric transport experience scored higher on their pretests. There was no significant retention shown by those who participated in spaced education.

    "Abstract": "This is the first study in Serbia and the region of South-East Europe dedicated to clients' perception of outcome and efficiency of prenatal and reproductive genetic counseling. The primary aim of this study was to assess overall value and success of genetic counseling in prenatal and reproductive care with regard to perceived personal control of clients, reflecting also in a part patient comprehension, knowledge retention, and empowerment in decision-making. The standardized Perceived Personal Control questionnaire (PPC) was used for the assessment of 239 female participants. First, we performed a complete validation of the psychometric characteristics of the Serbian-language version of the PPC questionnaire. The validation of the questionnaire permits other researchers from Serbian-speaking regions of South-East Europe to use this standard instrument to assess the effectiveness of prenatal genetic counseling in their communities and analyze advantages and disadvantages of their counseling models. We also measured social and demographic characteristics of participants. Further, we analyzed effects of our team-based prenatal and reproductive genetic counseling model through (a) calculation of PPC scores at three different stages (before initial, after initial, and before second counseling session), and (b) by assessing participants' responses by indication for referral (advanced maternal age, abnormal biochemical screening, family history of hereditary disorders, maternal exposure to drugs, exposure to radiation, exposure to infective agents, infertility or recurrent abortions, and miscellaneous). The results indicate that participants' knowledge after initial counseling increased significantly and after that remained stable and sustainable. A satisfactory level of confidence among participants had been achieved, in that many felt an increased sense of control over their situation and emotional response to it. Indirectly, these results indicate the success of a team-based prenatal genetic counseling model, which has not been assessed in the literature to date.This is the first study in Serbia and the region of South-East Europe dedicated to clients' perception of outcome and efficiency of prenatal and reproductive genetic counseling.

    "Abstract": "The care of patients with acute and chronic illnesses requires nurses to fully understand the underlying pathophysiology associated with disease processes. Although mastering a pathophysiology course is a strong predictor of student success in nursing programs, it is a course with which students and new nurses most often struggle. The authors describe a teaching innovation-visual narrative illustration (VNI)-and demonstrate how VNIs are used to teach complex pathophysiology concepts to nursing students. The consistent positive feedback regarding the VNIs that have already been implemented in the pathophysiology course prompted the authors to systematically and formally study the impact of this innovative approach on student learning and knowledge retention. Use of VNI is an innovative teaching strategy that has the potential to augment other course materials and bridge some of the knowledge gaps that challenge nursing students from fully understanding pathophysiologic concepts.

    "Abstract": "The European Paediatric Life Support (EPLS) provider course aims at training doctors and nurses in the efficient and prompt management of cardiopulmonary arrest in children. EPLS is a 2-day European Resuscitation Council course, involving the teaching of theoretical knowledge and practical skills. The aim of the study was to evaluate the retention of theoretical knowledge and certain skills of EPLS providers 4 months after the course. OBJECTIVE The European Paediatric Life Support (EPLS) provider course aims at training doctors and nurses in the efficient and prompt management of cardiopulmonary arrest in children. EPLS is a 2-day European Resuscitation Council course, involving the teaching of theoretical knowledge and practical skills. The aim of the study was to evaluate the retention of theoretical knowledge and certain skills of EPLS providers 4 months after the course.In total, 80 doctors and nurses who attended three EPLS provider courses, from May 2012 to December 2012, were asked to participate in the study and only 50 responded positively. Demographic data (age, sex, occupation) of the participants were collected. The European Resuscitation Council-approved EPLS written test was used to assess theoretical knowledge right after the course and after 4 months. The retention of certain skills (airway opening, bag-mask ventilation, chest compressions) was also examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS In total, 80 doctors and nurses who attended three EPLS provider courses, from May 2012 to December 2012, were asked to participate in the study and only 50 responded positively. Demographic data (age, sex, occupation) of the participants were collected. The European Resuscitation Council-approved EPLS written test was used to assess theoretical knowledge right after the course and after 4 months. The retention of certain skills (airway opening, bag-mask ventilation, chest compressions) was also examined.The theoretical knowledge decreased significantly (P<0.001) 4 months after the course. Age, sex and occupational status (medical or nursing profession) had no effect in theoretical knowledge retention. Interestingly, certain skills such as the application of airway opening manoeuvres and effective bag-mask ventilation were retained 4 months after the course, whereas chest compression skill retention significantly declined (P=0.012). RESULTS The theoretical knowledge decreased significantly (P<0.001) 4 months after the course. Age, sex and occupational status (medical or nursing profession) had no effect in theoretical knowledge retention. Interestingly, certain skills such as the application of airway opening manoeuvres and effective bag-mask ventilation were retained 4 months after the course, whereas chest compression skill retention significantly declined (P=0.012).According to our findings, theoretical knowledge of the EPLS course uniformly declines, irrespective of the provider characteristics, whereas retention of certain skills is evident 4 months after the course.

    "Abstract": "This is the first study in Serbia and the region of South-East Europe dedicated to clients’ perception of outcome and efficiency of prenatal and reproductive genetic counseling. The primary aim of this study was to assess overall value and success of genetic counseling in prenatal and reproductive care with regard to perceived personal control of clients, reflecting also in a part patient comprehension, knowledge retention, and empowerment in decision-making. The standardized Perceived Personal Control questionnaire (PPC) was used for the assessment of 239 female participants. First, we performed a complete validation of the psychometric characteristics of the Serbian-language version of the PPC questionnaire. The validation of the questionnaire permits other researchers from Serbian-speaking regions of South-East Europe to use this standard instrument to assess the effectiveness of prenatal genetic counseling in their communities and analyze advantages and disadvantages of their counseling models. We also measured social and demographic characteristics of participants. Further, we analyzed effects of our team-based prenatal and reproductive genetic counseling model through (a) calculation of PPC scores at three different stages (before initial, after initial, and before second counseling session), and (b) by assessing participants’ responses by indication for referral (advanced maternal age, abnormal biochemical screening, family history of hereditary disorders, maternal exposure to drugs, exposure to radiation, exposure to infective agents, infertility or recurrent abortions, and miscellaneous). The results indicate that participants’ knowledge after initial counseling increased significantly and after that remained stable and sustainable. A satisfactory level of confidence among participants had been achieved, in that many felt an increased sense of control over their situation and emotional response to it. Indirectly, these results indicate the success of a team-based prenatal genetic counseling model, which has not been assessed in the literature to date.

    "Abstract": "Indigenous populations are undergoing rapid ethnobiological, nutritional and socioeconomic transitions while being increasingly integrated into modernizing societies. To better understand the dynamics of these transitions, this article aims to characterize the cultural domain of food plants and analyze its relation with current day diets, and the local perceptions of changes given amongst the Ngäbe people of Southern Conte-Burica, Costa Rica, as production of food plants by its residents is hypothesized to be drastically in recession with an decreased local production in the area and new conservation and development paradigms being implemented. BACKGROUND Indigenous populations are undergoing rapid ethnobiological, nutritional and socioeconomic transitions while being increasingly integrated into modernizing societies. To better understand the dynamics of these transitions, this article aims to characterize the cultural domain of food plants and analyze its relation with current day diets, and the local perceptions of changes given amongst the Ngäbe people of Southern Conte-Burica, Costa Rica, as production of food plants by its residents is hypothesized to be drastically in recession with an decreased local production in the area and new conservation and development paradigms being implemented.Extensive freelisting, interviews and workshops were used to collect the data from 72 participants on their knowledge of food plants, their current dietary practices and their perceptions of change in local foodways, while cultural domain analysis, descriptive statistical analyses and development of fundamental explanatory themes were employed to analyze the data. METHODS Extensive freelisting, interviews and workshops were used to collect the data from 72 participants on their knowledge of food plants, their current dietary practices and their perceptions of change in local foodways, while cultural domain analysis, descriptive statistical analyses and development of fundamental explanatory themes were employed to analyze the data.Results show a food plants domain composed of 140 species, of which 85 % grow in the area, with a medium level of cultural consensus, and some age-based variation. Although many plants still grow in the area, in many key species a decrease on local production-even abandonment-was found, with much reduced cultivation areas. Yet, the domain appears to be largely theoretical, with little evidence of use; and the diet today is predominantly dependent on foods bought from the store (more than 50 % of basic ingredients), many of which were not salient or not even recognized as 'food plants' in freelists exercises. While changes in the importance of food plants were largely deemed a result of changes in cultural preferences for store bought processed food stuffs and changing values associated with farming and being food self-sufficient, Ngäbe were also aware of how changing household livelihood activities, and the subsequent loss of knowledge and use of food plants, were in fact being driven by changes in social and political policies, despite increases in forest cover and biodiversity.

We attribute dietary shifts to socioeconomic and political changes in recent decades, in particular to a reduction of local production of food, new economic structures and agents related to the State and globalization.

    "Abstract": "Background The purpose of this study was to use the body painting method to teach hand anatomy to a group of preclinical medical students. Methods Students reviewed hand anatomy using the traditional method and body painting exercise. Feedback and retention of the anatomy-related information were examined by a questionnaire and multiple-choice questions, respectively, immediately and 1 month after the painting exercise. Results Students agreed that the exercise was advantageous and helped facilitate self-active learning after in-class anatomy lessons. While there was no significant difference in knowledge retention between the control and experimental groups, the students appreciated the exercise in which they applied body paint to the human body to learn anatomy. Conclusion The body painting was an efficient tool for aiding the interactive learning of medical students and increasing the understanding of gross anatomy.",

    "Abstract": "Kenya Methodist University (KeMU) is facing challenges like duplication of work due to lack of a central repository for knowledge retention, loss of knowledge through expertise leaving the institution without knowledge being captured and over reliance on a few known subject matter experts as others have not been identified. Utilising the Knowledge Retention Strategy framework, this study sought to assess knowledge retention practices at KeMU, with a view to entrench the culture of sharing knowledge. The ultimate aim of this study was to develop a model for knowledge retention at institutions of higher learning which KeMU could adopt. The study relied on mixed method research (MMR) with qualitative and quantitative data mixed at collection, analysis, discussion and reporting levels. The study triangulated data collection tools which encompassed a questionnaire, interview, observation and review of documents to collect data from 106 respondents and 11 heads of departments respectively. These two groups were purposively selected as they play a key role in knowledge retention at KeMU. The study disclosed a variety of informal knowledge retention practices but formal practices like: documented work processes; training and development for specific job tasks; orientation for general and job specific; knowledge repositories; communities of practice; knowledge retention policies; knowledge recovery initiatives; and human resources processes and practices for knowledge retention were lacking. Considering the value placed on the above list of lacking essential practices for knowledge retention, KeMU is indeed in dire need for a solution to help retain operational relevant knowledge. The study formulated a KR model for institutions of higher learning that would help KeMU leverage its knowledge assets. The study recommends that KeMU should work out a knowledge retention policy on how to implement the best knowledge retention practices. A further study on measuring KM in an academic institution is recommended.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge is now considered the most important organizational resource, surpassing other resources like land and capital. It has, therefore, been acknowledged that knowledge can play an important role in ensuring an organization’s competitive edge. The purpose of this study was to investigate if knowledge sharing is being used to improve service delivery at the National University of Lesotho’s Thomas Mofolo Library. The researcher held the view that Librarians at Thomas Mofolo Library have different sets of skills which, if combined, could improve service delivery. By not sharing and retaining this existing wealth of knowledge, the researcher claimed that when librarians retire or resign from work, they will certainly take with them the knowledge they possess and the result of this knowledge loss is that the Library may be plagued by an inability to learn from the past experiences, which leads to reinvented wheels, unlearned lessons and the pattern of repeated mistakes. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed in the case study design in order to allow for multiple methods of data collection. Data were collected by means of questionnaires and interviews. Questionnaires were administered to all librarians who were available at the time and purposive sampling was used to determine interview participants. Out of the 25 questionnaires administered, 15 were returned, providing a response rate of 60%. The data collected by means of questionnaires was processed using Microsoft Access and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software (Version 17). The results of analysis were exported into Microsoft Excel for visual presentation and reporting of the results. The data from the interview sessions was analyzed manually by content analysis, using the notes that were taken by the researcher from the respondents during the interview sessions. The findings pointed to the fact that knowledge sharing does occur at TML, although mostly in an informal manner. This was largely due to a number of impediments such as lack of trust and the absence of motivations and rewards. The study concluded by recommending a number of initiatives that could be implemented in order to retain knowledge within the Library. The recommendations included developing a knowledge management strategy and formalizing knowledge sharing by formulating the desired policies.",

    "Abstract": "Las empresas que ofrecen servicios de mensajería han crecido en cobertura y en complejidad de sus operaciones, sin embargo, en muchas de ellas continúan utilizando la experiencia de sus trabajadores como principal insumo para ejecutar sus procesos de distribución, esto representa una desventaja ya que errores humanos pueden generar inconsistencias en el proceso, debidos, entre otras causas, a la rotación de personal, la cual genera constante pérdida del conocimiento sobre cómo realizar el proceso. El presente proyecto de grado plantea y resuelve un modelo de ruteo de vehiculos basado en estos servicios de mensajería. En la descripción del problema se explica el modelo de operación de estos servicios. A partir del problema planteado se propone una metodologia que permitirá resolver el problema de ruteo de vehículos considerando restricciones de ventanas de tiempo, fechas de vencimiento, distancia y horario de capacidad. Esta metodologia consiste en resolver el problema en tres etapas: Programación, Zonificación y Diseño de rutas. El proyecto está organizado de la siguiente manera. El capitulo 1 contiene el problema de investigación. El capítulo 2 es el marco de referencia y está compuesto del estado del arte del VRP, una revisión bibliográfica sobre sistemas expertos y por ultimo información general de los servicios de mensajeria. El capítulo 3 describe la formulación matemática del problema y la metodologia que se propone para resolver el problema de investigación. En el capitulo 4 se presentan los resultados de la propuesta y finalmente están las conclusiones y recomendaciones del proyecto.",

    "Abstract": "Currently, the challenge for researchers and managers in the area of knowledge management is to study methods and models that promote and facilitate the acquisition, retention, distribution and utilization of knowledge by individuals and groups of organizations. The main objective of this paper is to analyze how a company that operates in multi-site service sector is organized internally in order to retain the acquired knowledge. The research strategy used is the simple case study, applied in a large multinational company. The findings points out that the service providing organizations should focus their knowledge retention process in a specific department toward this goal. This department has the task of identifying and registering the best practices and learned lessons among all the employees working on different clients in databases, in addition, to promote the integration of these employees in order to promote the distribution of tacit knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "The efficient feature selection for predictive and accurate classification is highly desirable in many application domains. Most of the attempts to neuro-fuzzy classifier lose information to build interpretable neuro-fuzzy classification model. This paper proposes an interpretable neuro-fuzzy classification model with significant features without loss of knowledge, which is an extension of an existing interpretable neuro-fuzzy classification model. The proposed model is designed based on the consideration of feature importance that is determined by frequency of linguistic features. The rules are then made based on important features. Therefore, the knowledge acquired in network can be comprehended to logical rules using only important features. The proposed model finally performs classification task by rule-based approach. The average accuracy calculated by 10-fold cross validation finds that the proposed model can increase performance of the already proven neuro-fuzzy system for classification tasks.",

    "Abstract": "O presente Relatório de Estágio avalia a possibilidade de reorganização da Mota-Engil (ME), através do desenvolvimento de uma plataforma de Gestão do Conhecimento. Esta necessidade surge com a falta de estruturação de informação e consequente perda da mesma no Grupo ME. Com o objetivo de encontrar, recolher, analisar e estruturar de forma uniforme a informação relativa à atividade “core” do estudo de caso – a engenharia – foi analisada e testada a implementação de um sistema de Gestão do Conhecimento nesta organização. Em termos de estratégia de investigação optou-se pelo estudo de caso, os métodos de recolha de informação utilizados foram a análise documental, entrevistas semiestruturadas e não-estruturadas, um inquérito por questionário e a observação participante. A Mota-Engil já havia desenvolvido uma plataforma de Gestão do Conhecimento – o siTEC –, considerada desajustada essencialmente devido a problemas de acessibilidade, uma vez que, ao exigir ligação via intranet, não chegava a todos os colaboradores do Grupo ME espalhados pelo mundo. Outros problemas apontados foram a pouca divulgação da plataforma pelos colaboradores e a fraca utilização da mesma por parte destes. A nova plataforma de GC desenvolvida – KNOW.ME –, pretende colmatar as falhas detetadas no siTEC, tornando-se uma plataforma de caráter colaborativo e de acesso transversal a todos os colaboradores. É expectável que esta nova ferramenta colmate um grave problema subjacente à Mota-Engil – a perda de conhecimento – e que cative e entusiasme os colaboradores a continuar com o bom trabalho e a gerar resultados positivos para a ME. Alternate abstract: The following Internship Report aims to evaluate the possibility of an organizational restructuring of Mota-Engil through the development of a Knowledge Management platform. This need arises from the lack of structured information and consequent lost on Group ME. In order to track, collect, analyze and structure the information related to the core activity of the case study - engineering - the implementation of a Knowledge Management System in this organization was analyzed and tested. This study was carried out through case of study, the methods used to collect information were documentary analysis semi-structured and non-structured interviews a questionnaire survey and participant observation. This company, Mota-Engil, has already in execution a Knowledge Management platform – siTEC – considered essentially unappropriated due to accessibility problems, since, by requiring intranet connection, this not reach all ME Group employees around the world. Other problems pointed out were the low dissemination of the platform by the employees and the week use of the platform by them. The new Knowledge Management Platform – KNOW-ME – aims to fill the gaps found in siTEC, becoming a collaborative and transversal platform for all employees. It is expected that this new tool will solve a critical a problem to Mota-Engil - the loss of knowledge – and captivate and enthusiast employees to continue the good work and generate positive results for ME.",

    "Abstract": "With the increasing emphasis on globalization and consumer demands in highly competitive markets, organizations have attempted to integrate and standardize across their corporate subsidiaries by implementing Enterprise Systems (ES). In such corporate-wide ES implementations, system requirements are dictated by headquarters, favouring large subsidiaries, and thus potentially compromising the unique business requirements of smaller units. This research reports findings from an ES initiative within a group of large, medium, and small organizations, where the impact of organization size is assessed in relation to the level of system success and knowledge-management competence. The results of this analysis suggest that (i) large organizations, in contrast to their smaller counterparts, receive greater benefits in terms of both Individual and Organizational Impacts, (ii) while no such differences were observed in relation to System and Information Quality. Similarly, (iii) no differences were observed in relation to knowledge-creation competencies amongst large, medium, and small organizations. However, (iv) differences were observed between the large and smaller firms on their Knowledge-Retention and Knowledge-Transfer competencies.",

    "Abstract": "Emerging evidence links adverse surgical outcomes to errors in intra-operative cognitive skills, such as judgment and decision-making. However, the complex thought patterns and behaviours that characterize safe and effective surgeons are poorly understood and highly situation-dependent, and therefore challenging to evaluate and teach. Despite prior attempts to define these constructs, they remain largely theoretical and do not provide for a roadmap for optimizing performance and minimizing errors. This thesis aims to better understand the factors that govern intra-operative decision-making to inform the design of educational curricula to improve behaviours, and to develop novel metrics that evaluate these complex skills. To understand the various facets contributing to intra-operative competence, a large breadth and volume of evidence from surgical and non-surgical domains was reviewed and synthesized into conceptual frameworks that define these constructs. We then demonstrate how simulation and other technologies can be used to design educational curricula that reinforce sound judgment. This is first done through the development of a bench-top simulation curriculum to teach the safe use of electrosurgery, and a randomized-controlled trial to evaluate its effectiveness. Subsequently, we examine the use of Internet and software-based technologies (e-learning) as an alternative method to overcome some of the limitations of a bench-top model, by performing a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of e-learning for surgical training. Finally, we design a novel e-learning platform ( Think Like A Surgeon ) to teach and assess advanced cognitive skills during laparoscopic cholecystectomy by developing objective metrics and obtaining validity evidence to support their use. To demonstrate how expert knowledge can be incorporated into an educational intervention to improve patient safety, a structured bench-top simulation curriculum was developed to teach surgical trainees the safe use of electrosurgery in the operating room. Educational outcomes of course participants (intervention group) were compared to that of participants who only had access to didactic material and an unstructured wet-lab without objectives or tasks (control group). Amongst 289 (145 control; 144 intervention) participants from eleven institutions with similar baseline scores, total knowledge exam score was significantly higher in the intervention group immediately (89% (±9) vs. 83% (±10), p<0.01) and 3 months (72% (±18) vs. 64% (±15), p<0.01) after the curriculum. A subset of 59 participants (30 control; 29 Sim) was re-evaluated for long-term retention after one year and showed greater scores amongst trainees in the intervention group compared to the control group (70% [61-74] vs. 60% [31-71], p=0.02). The structured curriculum was also an independent predictor of long-term knowledge retention. Given the progressive decay in acquired competencies and the high costs and resources limiting the ongoing delivery of curricular content on a large scale using a bench-top simulation workshop, the effectiveness of e-learning as a method of teaching these surgical skills was evaluated by performing a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials. Out of 4704 studies screened and 87 included, e-learning showed either greater or similar effectiveness compared to no intervention (29 and 4 studies, respectively), or compared to non-e-learning interventions (29 and 22 studies, respectively) for teaching cognitive (71 studies), psychomotor (36 studies), and nontechnical skills (8 studies). Finally, a novel web-based platform was developed to teach and assess intra-operative cognitive skills during laparoscopic cholecystectomy using novel objective metrics. First, a qualitative study of expert surgeons defined a total of 108 cognitive competencies that are essential for performing the procedure safely and avoiding bile duct injuries. This framework was used to develop the platform’s educational modules and served as the basis of a 12-item assessment tool to evaluate intra-operative decision-making and judgment. After assessing 39 subjects (17 surgeons, 22 trainees), preliminary validity evidence was obtained with regards to content, internal structure, and correlation to other variables, including self-reported experience and intra-operative performance. In conclusion, comprehensive frameworks were developed to allow us to understand the processes that guide experts' decisions, and ultimately their actions and behaviours. The taxonomies and classification systems from this analysis provide the groundwork for future work attempting to address performance and safety gaps in surgical care. This thesis further demonstrated how to effectively utilize bench-top and pervasive computer-based simulation as tools to incorporate expert knowledge and cognitive competencies into educational curricula designed to reinforce sound intra-operative judgment and effective decision-making. Finally, we developed a novel method for objectively assessing advanced cognitive skills using an e-learning platform and provided validity evidence to support its use. Alternate abstract: De nouvelles observations établissent un lien entre des résultats chirurgicaux négatifs et des erreurs liées aux facultés cognitives peropératoires, telles que le jugement et la prise de décision. Cependant, les schémas de pensée complexes et les comportements caractérisant les chirurgiens compétents et efficaces sont mal compris et dépendent fortement de la situation. Ils sont, par conséquent, difficiles à évaluer et à enseigner. Malgré les tentatives de définition de ces concepts, ils restent largement théoriques et ne donnent pas de feuille de route permettant l'optimisation des performances et la limitation des erreurs. Le présent rapport d'intervention a pour objet de mieux appréhender les facteurs régissant la prise de décision peropératoire afin d'améliorer la conception des programmes d'enseignement, dans le but d'optimiser les comportements et de développer de nouvelles métriques permettant d'évaluer ces facultés complexes. Pour comprendre les différents aspects bénéfiques pour les compétences peropératoires, une grande quantité d'observations variées, émanant des domaines chirurgicaux et non chirurgicaux, ont été étudiées et synthétisées en cadres conceptuels définissant ces concepts. Nous démontrons ensuite dans quelle mesure la simulation et les autres technologies peuvent servir à concevoir des programmes d'enseignement renforçant un jugement éclairé. La première étape est le développement d'un programme de simulation compact visant à enseigner l'utilisation sécurisée de l'électrochirurgie et d'un essai clinique randomisé pour évaluer son efficacité. Par la suite, nous examinons l'utilisation des technologies Internet et logicielles (apprentissage en ligne) comme autre méthode nous permettant de dépasser certaines limites d'un modèle compact, en procédant à une analyse systématique dans le but d'évaluer l'efficacité de l'apprentissage en ligne pour la formation en chirurgie. En dernier lieu, nous concevons une nouvelle plate-forme d'apprentissage en ligne ( Think Like A Surgeon ) pour enseigner et évaluer les facultés cognitives avancées pendant la cholécystectomie laparoscopique en développant des métriques objectives et en obtenant des preuves de validité venant encourager leur utilisation. Pour démontrer de quelle façon intégrer les connaissances des spécialistes à une intervention éducative pour améliorer la sécurité des patients, nous avons développé un programme de simulation compact structuré visant à enseigner aux chirurgiens en formation l’utilisation sécurisée de l’électrochirurgie dans la salle d’opération. Les résultats des participants (groupe d’intervention) ont été comparés à ceux des participants ayant uniquement accès au matériel pédagogique et à un laboratoire humide non structuré sans objectif ni tâche (groupe témoin). Sur 289 participants (145 issus du groupe témoin; 144 issus du groupe d’intervention) provenant de onze établissements présentant des scores de référence similaires, le score global de l’examen des connaissances a été nettement plus élevé dans le groupe d’intervention immédiatement après le programme (89 % (±9) contre 83 % (±10), p<0,01) et 3 mois (72 % (±18) contre 64 % (±15), p<0,01) après le programme. Un sous-ensemble de 59 participants (30 issus du groupe témoin; 29 issus du groupe d’intervention) ont été réévalués afin d’évaluer la conservation des données à long terme après un an. Les scores ont été plus élevés chez les chirurgiens en formation du groupe d’intervention que chez ceux du groupe témoin (70 % [61 à 74] contre 60 % [31 à 71], p=0,02). Le programme structuré fut également un indicateur indépendant de la conservation des connaissances sur le long terme En raison de la dégradation progressive des compétences acquises, ainsi que du coût élevé et du manque de ressources pour la livraison continue du contenu des programmes à grande échelle à l’aide d’un atelier de simulation compact, l’efficacité de l’apprentissage en ligne comme méthode d’enseignement de ces compétences chirurgicales a été évaluée en effectuant une analyse systématique des essais cliniques randomisés. Sur les 4 704 études examinées et les 87 études incluses, l’apprentissage en ligne s’est révélé être d’une efficacité supérieure ou semblable comparé à l’absence d’intervention (29 et 4 études, respectivement), ou comparé aux interventions sans apprentissage en ligne (29 et 22 études, respectivement), pour l’enseignement des facultés cognitives (71 études), psychomotrices (36 études) et non techniques (8 études). Pour finir, une nouvelle plate-forme Web a été développée dans le but d’enseigner et d’évaluer les facultés cognitives peropératoires pendant la cholécystectomie laparoscopique en utilisant de nouvelles métriques objectives. Tout d’abord, une étude qualitative menée par des chirurgiens spécialistes a défini un total de 108 facultés cognitives essentielles pour la réalisation de l’intervention en toute sécurité et en évitant les blessures du canal cholédoque. Ce cadre a été utilisé pour développer les modules pédagogiques de la plate-forme et a servi de base à un outil d’évaluation à 12 points conçu pour évaluer la prise de décision et le jugement peropératoires. Après avoir évalué 39 sujets (17 chirurgiens, 22 chirurgiens en formation), des preuves de validité préliminaires ont émergé en ce qui concerne le contenu, la structure interne et la corrélation à d’autres variables, notamment les expériences autodéclarées et les performances peropératoires. En conclusion, des cadres exhaustifs ont été développés pour nous permettre de comprendre les processus orientant les décisions des spécialistes et, en bout de ligne, leurs actes et leurs comportements. Les taxonomies et les systèmes de classification issus de cette analyse servent de point de départ aux futurs travaux ayant pour objet de tenter de corriger les problèmes de performance et de sécurité associés aux soins chirurgicaux. Le présent rapport d'intervention a également démontré comment utiliser efficacement une simulation informatique compacte et généralisée comme outil d'intégration des connaissances et des facultés cognitives des spécialistes à des programmes d'enseignement conçus pour renforcer un jugement peropératoire éclairé et une prise de décision efficace. Pour finir, nous avons développé une nouvelle méthode d'évaluation objective des facultés cognitives avancées en utilisant une plate-forme d'apprentissage en ligne, puis fourni des preuves de validité encourageant son utilisation.",

    "Abstract": "Clinical correlations are tools to assist students in associating basic science concepts with a medical application or disease. There are many forms of clinical correlations and many ways to use them in the classroom. Five types of clinical correlations that may be embedded within basic science courses have been identified and described. (1) Correlated examples consist of superficial clinical information or stories accompanying basic science concepts to make the information more interesting and relevant. (2) Interactive learning and demonstrations provide hands-on experiences or the demonstration of a clinical topic. (3) Specialized workshops have an application-based focus, are more specialized than typical laboratory sessions, and range in complexity from basic to advanced. (4) Small-group activities require groups of students, guided by faculty, to solve simple problems that relate basic science information to clinical topics. (5) Course-centered problem solving is a more advanced correlation activity than the others and focuses on recognition and treatment of clinical problems to promote clinical reasoning skills. Diverse teaching activities are used in basic science medical education, and those that include clinical relevance promote interest, communication, and collaboration, enhance knowledge retention, and help develop clinical reasoning skills.",

We performed a multi-centered, prospective, randomized study consisting of postgraduate year (PGY) 1 to PGY 3 & 4 residents in three United States EM residency programs in 2014. Fifty eight residents were randomized into one delivery group: text message or email. Participants completed a 40 question pre- and post-intervention exam. Primary outcomes were the means of pre- and post-intervention exam score differences. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired t-test, and multiple linear regressions. No significant difference was found between the primary outcomes of the two groups (P=0.51). PGY 2 status had a significant negative effect (P=0.01) on predicted exam score difference. Neither delivery method enhanced resident knowledge retention. Further research on implementation of mobile technology in residency education is required.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to use the body painting method to teach hand anatomy to a group of preclinical medical students. Students reviewed hand anatomy using the traditional method and body painting exercise. Feedback and retention of the anatomy-related information were examined by a questionnaire and multiple-choice questions, respectively, immediately and 1 month after the painting exercise. Students agreed that the exercise was advantageous and helped facilitate self-active learning after in-class anatomy lessons. While there was no significant difference in knowledge retention between the control and experimental groups, the students appreciated the exercise in which they applied body paint to the human body to learn anatomy. The body painting was an efficient tool for aiding the interactive learning of medical students and increasing the understanding of gross anatomy.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigated the effects of problem-based learning (PBL) on knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention in a controlled experiment in a lab setting. Eighty-eight first-year psychology students were randomly assigned to either a PBL condition, a lecture condition, or a self-study condition. All participants had the opportunity to study the same text. Their knowledge acquisition was tested on both an immediate post-test and a delayed post-test, one week later. The results showed beneficial effects for the PBL group on the immediate and the delayed test compared to the lecture group. There were no differences between knowledge acquisition scores for the self-study condition and either of the other conditions. Moreover, no differences on knowledge retention were shown, because the decline in performance over time was equal in all conditions. In conclusion, the present study provides experimentally based evidence of the disadvantageous effects of instruction through lectures compared to PBL.",

    "Abstract": "Science inquiry has been found to be effective with students from diverse backgrounds and varied academic abilities. This study compared student learning, enjoyment, motivation, perceived understanding, and creativity during a science unit on Models and Designs for 38 sixth grade students (20 male, 18 female; 1 Black, 1 Hispanic and 36 White). The unit began with a very teacher-centered approach, then became increasingly student-centered, employing more inquiry with each lesson set to determine the effects of student-centered instruction on performance and attitudes. Pretest-posttest data with specific questions tied to each lesson set were collected, as well as repeated measures attitude surveys administered at the conclusion of each of the six sets of lessons. The surveys included ratings of lesson enjoyment, student motivation, perceived understanding, creativity designed into the lesson, and perceived self-creativity on a scale of one to ten, along with open ended responses of reasons for the ratings. Results indicate a trend of improving knowledge retention as student-centeredness and inquiry increased until the last lesson set, which a few students found too challenging. Additionally, reported levels of enjoyment, motivation, and creativity increased as the instructional approaches became more studentcentered until the challenge became too great for some students, causing a small dip in the upward trend. Greater experience with science inquiry may assist students in extending their confidence, inquiry leadership, and achievement.",

    "Abstract": "This study examined the effectiveness of online education to providers who serve people experiencing homelessness, comparing online and face-to-face training of Critical Time Intervention (CTI), an evidence-based case management model. The authors recruited 184 staff from nineteen homeless service agencies to participate in one of two training conditions: (a)\"Online Training\" + \"Community of Practice\" or (b) \"Face-to-Face Training\" + \"Telephone Consultation.\" Each group received twenty-four hours of instruction and support. Through baseline, follow-up, and nine-month posttraining surveys, the authors examined satisfaction, knowledge gains, knowledge retention, and readiness to implement CTI. Although satisfaction rates were higher among participants in the face-to-face group, the two training conditions produced comparable pre/postknowledge gains.

    "Abstract": "Arts integration into science has been shown to motivate students and promote long-term retention of content. To add to the literature addressing arts integration, an experiment was conducted with middle school students studying the anatomical similarities and differences between modern and fossil marine invertebrates and different types of extant insects. Eighth grade students participated in a counterbalanced-design, quasi-experimental study to determine if the integration of art into the science curriculum would influence student retention of content, enjoyment, motivation, and perceived learning toward learning science concepts supporting the Next Generation Science Standards including engineering-related concepts. The lessons addressed Life Science standard MS-LS4-2. Results showed that the integration of an art activity had a significant effect on knowledge retention favoring the experimental condition with a medium effect size on the posttest and a large effect on the distal posttest. Student enjoyment, motivation, and perceived learning also showed significant differences overall and specifically for enjoyment and for perceived learning favoring the experimental conditions of arts integration with a small effect size.",

    "Abstract": "This research chronicles the development of a capstone experience by a regional comprehensive university. The process began with a multi-year project during which the faculty annually reviewed the results with a view to determining if the class provided the deep learning culminating experiences anticipated. A major measure of success was the desire to replicate the deep learning common in face-to-face classes in the online environment. The results of 166 students were analyzed, 82 online and 84 face-to-face, to determine if a difference existed. A one-way ANOVA tested the score differences among 10 sections and determined the students’ scores did not differ significantly. Finally, a two-sample t-test between proportions determined that there was not a significant difference between the online and face-to-face students with respect to the level of assessment scores earned. Given that online and face-to-face students demonstrate the same level of knowledge, does this beg the question, what value does face-to-face class time offer?",

    "Abstract": "This thesis examines the turnover phenomenon in the oil and gas industry in the Niger Delta area with specific focus on three of the top oil and gas organizations in the area, these being The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, Nigerian Agip Oil Company and the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Company, in order to ascertain the factors that encourage high turnover rates in these organizations as well as establish ways in which human resources practices can be improved in order to enhance retention. While several studies exist on employee turnover, these are mostly studies with a focus on Western and Asian organizations, cultures and contexts, with a lack of similar focus on developing countries, and particularly none in the oil and gas industry of the Niger Delta. Additionally, this current study incorporates the understanding of employee’s personal characteristics and psychological state and how it influences the relationships between diverse factors and turnover. Over the past three to five years, there has been significant turnover of key technical staff in the organizations of interest, despite the knowledge that these organizations are high paying organizations in the area in question. These key technical staff who are the backbone of the organization also take away with them the knowledge and experience gathered over the years, leading to the organizations having to re-invest in attracting, employing and training new staff to replace the leaving staff. In addition, this loss of knowledge and lack of experience is coming at a time when it most required, i.e. at a time the industry is on a growth path. It therefore becomes important to understand all the possible factors that underpin an employee’s decision to leave. Nigeria is a large country of over 170 million people, with a land area of ~924,000 square kilometres covering several geographic zones, one of which is the Niger Delta area. The Niger Delta area, situated in the southern part of the country covers ~1/8th of Nigeria’s total surface area and is bounded on the East by Cameroun and to the South and West by the Atlantic Ocean. The country’s main source of income is the export of crude oil, and as at 2015, it is the largest producer of oil and gas in Africa, the 7 th largest producer of oil within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), as well as the 13th largest producer of oil in the world. Oil and gas production are Nigeria’s major source of earnings 11 and government financing, with the GDP Annual Growth Rate averaging ~6% over the past three years. The oil and gas industry in Nigeria began with the exploration for oil and gas in Western Nigeria in 1908. This was further extended in 1937 to cover the whole of Nigeria, with exploration success recorded by Shell D’Arcy in the Niger Delta with the discovery of commercial volumes of oil and gas in Oloibiri in 1956. Production of oil first started in 1958 and by 1970 had risen to a peak of 2.4 million bbl/d. By 2015 oil production from Nigeria stands at ~2 million bbl/d, with several oil and gas international and independent having joined the production. While the oil and gas industry has continued to grow over the years; insecurity has gradually set in due to agitation of the Nationals for a bigger share of the oil and gas resources, making the environment a tough and challenging one not only for the organizations to operate in, but for employees to work. Having identified from the review of literature that affectivity plays an important role in the relationship between an employee’s satisfaction and their decision to stay or leave, as well as understanding that some psychological and personal elements play a role in the employee’s satisfaction and commitment to the organization, five main research questions have therefore been addressed in this thesis, these being: 1) What impact does positive affectivity have on affective, continuance and normative commitment? 2) What impact do affective, continuance and continuance commitment have on organizational commitment and ultimately on turnover intentions? 3) What impact does positive affectivity have on Perceived Organizational Support? 4) What impact does Perceived Organizational Support have on Pay Satisfaction and Organizational Identification? 5) Do pay satisfaction and organizational identification have an impact on turnover intentions in the Niger Delta Oil and Gas Industry? This research was therefore conducted in an exploratory manner and included an e-mail survey of employees within the participating organizations as well as learning set discussions with subject matter experts as research participants to validate the findings from the action research cycle one, i.e. the e-mail survey. This exercise enabled a better understanding of employees’ reasons for either deciding to leave or stay, as well as the factors that could make them minimize or eliminate any turnover intentions. Following the discourse and observations in action research cycles one and two, the key variables found to have a strong impact on turnover intention were organizational commitment (specifically continuance commitment), perceived organizational support, pay satisfaction and positive affectivity both directly and indirectly. Several improvement strategies were identified and implemented in a pilot study mode in one of the participating organizations and was found to record the expected improvements and lower turnover intentions over a period of observation.",

    "Abstract": "Government-reported statistics and existing research herald an epic age demographic change in the federal workforce, as a large number of its workers approach the average retirement age of 61.3 (United States Office of Personnel Management, 2016, March). Hence, this study examined the changing age demographic of the federal workforce with regard to workforce separation and retirement. Through years of professional practice, older workers accumulated a breadth of knowledge that provides widespread benefit to the respective federal organizations. As a result, there is a need for effective knowledge management (KM) strategies that respond to the changing knowledge requirements of federal workers. Based on this age demographic trend, a significant consideration for knowledge retention and knowledge sharing in the federal workforce emerges (Slagter, 2007). This researcher found that the appropriate KM strategies address the knowledge considerations specific to the federal workforce. Management practitioners are presented with both challenges and opportunities for the development of new management strategies to address changing workforce dynamics. Consistent with the chosen management focus of applied leadership and change in an organizational context, this researcher pursued KM success strategies for a federal agency workplace that faces significant demographic change. Through this evidence-based study, the researcher identified and analyzed relationships between KM concepts. A KM strategic framework is provided for mitigating the projected knowledge gaps in the federal workforce. This success framework provides elements for KM strategy development including; situational adaptation, social factors, and the management of knowledge as an essential resource.",

    "Abstract": "Recent empirical findings concerning the performance effects of service business model innovation (servitization) and its interplay with product innovation are mixed. Using the lenses of the demand-based view on value creation and complementarity, the performance impact of two key service business models is examined: the product-oriented model and the customer-oriented model, implemented jointly with product innovation. Results indicate that the interplay between service business model innovation and product innovation results in long-term performance benefits coupled with a degree of short-term performance sacrifice. Service business model innovation in isolation from product innovation results in short-term profit gains but long-term knowledge loss and, thus, market performance decline. Our study suggests that firms need to look beyond the evidence on short-term effects in order to achieve superior performance in the long run.",

This KCM is used to manage the transfer of knowledge from the former staff to successor staff so as to prevent the loss of knowledge when staff left the organization. Methods or steps of this implementation were written based on a case study of KCM implementation in non-profit organization (NPO). The KCM development was carried out through several important stages of process which is based on the concept of KM building blocks, SECI knowledge conversion process, and KCM mapping areas to determine categories of knowledge for all functions and levels of the organization. As the results, there are four important outcomes from this project. First is the determination of knowledge goal; second is the development process of how NPO identify and acquire knowledge; third is applying of four knowledge categories with its subcategories; fourth is the determination of NPO key positions for KCM.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine which academic and affective student factors were significant to student success in a mastery learning program in developmental mathematics and to determine if the mastery learning program led to increased mathematical knowledge retention and success in the subsequent math course. The first phase of the study involved 298 students in developmental mathematics. Using binary logistic regression, the researcher found that placement test score, previous experience with mastery learning, and gender were statistically significant factors related to student success in the mastery learning program. The second phase of the study involved 529 students in the subsequent course intermediate algebra. Using one-way analysis of variance and chi-square methods, the researcher found that mastery learning students retained significantly more mathematical content knowledge and succeeded at significantly higher rates in the subsequent course intermediate algebra as compared to students who took developmental mathematics through traditional methods and those who opted out of placement testing. Results of the study showed that the mastery learning approach in developmental mathematics which incorporated the affective student domain offered advantages for assisting students to overcome math background and self-efficacy barriers.

The main objective of this paper is to analyze how a company that operates in multi-site service sector is organized internally in order to retain the acquired knowledge. The research strategy used is the simple case study, applied in a large multinational company. The findings points out that the service providing organizations should focus their knowledge retention process in a specific department toward this goal. This department has the task of identifying and registering the best practices and learned lessons among all the employees working on different clients in databases, in addition, to promote the integration of these employees in order to promote the distribution of tacit knowledge.",

Developers leaving a software project deprive the project of the knowledge of the decisions they have made. Previous research shows that the survivors and newcomers maintaining abandoned code have reduced productivity and are more likely to make mistakes. We focus on quantifying the extent of abandoned source files and adapt methods from financial risk analysis to assess the susceptibility of the project to developer turnover. In particular, we measure the historical loss distribution and find (1) that projects are susceptible to losses that are more than three times larger than the expected loss. Using historical simulations we find (2) that projects are susceptible to large losses that are over five times larger than the expected loss. We use Monte Carlo simulations of disaster loss scenarios and find (3) that simplistic estimates of the `truck factor' exaggerate the potential for loss. To mitigate loss from developer turnover, we modify Cataldo et al's coordination requirements matrices. We find (4) that we can recommend the correct successor 34% to 48% of the time. We also find that having successors reduces the expected loss by as much as 15%. Our approach helps large projects assess the risk of turnover thereby making risk more transparent and manageable.",

    "Abstract": "Absenteeism and retention are costly problems that healthcare leaders continuously face. Voluntary turnover has many negative implications for healthcare organizations, including loss in productivity, loss of knowledge and experience, high replacement costs, and ultimately negative patient outcomes. There are several variables that impact absenteeism and turnover , which include stress, job satisfaction, conflict management styles, and worker expectations. This project identifies the items that contribute to absenteeism and voluntary turnover and provides a solution that is based upon a model to achieve positive organizational outcomes. Conflict management styles contribute to both positive and negative organizational outcomes. The result of this project is to use Wiemann’s (1977) Communication Competency Scale to determine a prospective employee’s conflict management style in order to increase retention and produce positive organization outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "The concept of applying integration in many carriers has impressed the educational directors and the facilitators with multiple glorious advantages. The benefits obtained from integrated systems of education include strong base of scientific knowledge, deep understand learning, ability of self-integration, creation potential, long-term retention, and capability to correlate the past with the present for greater innovation of the future. The integrated medical education has been highly successful in many medical schools and starts to offer precious fruit when implemented recently in certain dental fields. Some educational systems can be well integrated into building blocks both horizontally and vertically such as self-directed education and problem-based learning. In this review, a trial was undergone to discuss the idea of integration of dental education, its preclinical and clinical implementations, its advantages and disadvantages, and its pitfalls.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of the multiple-case study is to determine the perception of six faculty members if PBL assists with career-preparedness. The general problem is that some accounting graduates lack practical experience and competencies in problem-solving. The main problem is to what extent does accounting faculty believe that (PBL) instructional strategies support career preparedness among accounting students? Kolb’s Experiential Theory, Dewey’s Experiential Theory, and Engelmann’s Theory on Direct teaching are the theoretical framework. The main research question was: To what extent does accounting faculty believe that (PBL) instructional strategies support career-preparedness among accounting students? The following are the three sub-questions: 1.How can educators use (PBL) instructional strategies to support problem-solving skills to meet employer expectations? 2. Would (PBL) instructional strategies improve career-preparedness among accounting students? 3. How can (PBL) support knowledge retention and mastery of accounting concepts within students? An exploratory multiple case research method and purposive sampling was used. Triangulation consisted of a focus group, conference call, and observations. NVivo 10.0 was used to help code the interview data and organize emerging themes. The findings are themes such as pedagogy methods, real-world experience, knowledge retention, and critical-thinking and problem solving. Three sub-themes exist which are active learning, and improvements to curricula. PBL is promoted in the classroom and found as a useful tool in the classroom for career-preparedness. Conclusions are practicing more problems, having more current materials, and instructor’s openness to change. Recommendations include bigger sampling, narrowing down PBL, and focusing on graduates.",

    "Abstract": "It has been observed that the retention of a professional and qualified staff has become a challenge in the education industries as the turnover rate has been significantly increased in recent years. This is due to the drastic changes in the work environment that have caused an impact on the employees' perception of the chosen career. The loss of knowledge, talent and skill of an employee is a potential threat to an organization in an academic field. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the pull factors and academicians turnover; the effect of career anchor and to determine the dominant career anchor possessed by academicians in the Higher Learning Institutions. The population sample was drawn among the employees of the Higher Learning Institutions to identify the independent factors within organizations for this study. Moderated regression analysis and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to detect the main effects and interaction effects of pull factors and moderator (Edgar's career anchors) on turnover of employees. The empirical results of the study are discussed in detail. It is hoped that the present study will bring an insight to the Higher Education Institutions and the Ministry of Higher Education in addressing the turnover issue and ensuring a fit between the jobs and career anchors. Recommendations have been discussed and proposed for future use to any research in this field of academia.",

    "Abstract": "Workers handling chemicals need to understand the risk to health involved in their work, and this requires training. In this study effectivity of concept attainment teaching methodology (CATM) as training strategy for cleaning workers was assessed. CATM was used to train workers on chemicals information and health hazards. Pictures, illustrations, and hazards/precautionary statements presentations were used in reception-based strategy, while printed pictures and information cards on chemicals health hazards were used in selection-based strategy. The experimental group was given a pre-training test which was repeated on completion of the training (post-test1). The test was repeated after a month to determine level of knowledge retention. Cleaner (n = 307) from hospitals, a municipality and from a privately-run company took part. Certified cleaners and supervisors, the control group, were also tested. The tests scores were compared to assess for learning attainment and knowledge retention. Compared mean scores showed improved scores after training. ANOVA of the group means showed the differences were statistically significant. The objectives of the training were met, and with good knowledge retention as indicated by the improved scores in the post-tests. This indicates the efficacy of the method in training cleaning workers.",

    "Abstract": "As part of an experimental study on the effects of jigsaw learning on Vietnamese tertiary students' longer term achievement in a course of Management of Education and Administration, knowledge retention after one month was investigated. As reported in our previous papers, students in the cooperative jigsaw group (N = 40), perceived their instruction as more cooperative and more student-centered, and less teacher-centered than did those in the lecture group (N = 40). They also obtained significantly higher scores on a post experiment achievement test than did the others. Results indicate that in general students in the cooperative jigsaw group appreciated most working with others and getting help, discussing and sharing information and teaching others, and enjoyed the jigsaw context. This paper furthers that analysis by investigating students' knowledge retention. The findings show that a month after the experiment, students in the jigsaw group had greater long-term achievement than those did in the lecture group. However, students in both groups had a similar percentage of knowledge retention on the delay test of achievement. They retained nearly all of what they had learned (approximately 99 percent of knowledge) a month after the six weeks of the instruction.",

    "Abstract": "Even if knowledge exchange in general generates benefits, it may have opposite effects if it happens unintentionally from the knowledge holder's point of view. Knowledge leaving may cause knowledge loss if it involves key employees, and in the hands of outsiders, some knowledge assets may hurt competitiveness of the firm. As the overall knowledge mobility related dynamics are rather abstract and difficult to grasp, this study tries to dissolve some of the debates that exist especially in open innovation literature, around the relevance of knowledge protection for innovation management. The study aims at showing that sharing and protection are two sides of the same coin. We approach the identification of dimensions by the questions: how and why knowledge moves, what kind of knowledge moves, and where and how knowledge flows happen. Through theoretical and qualitative empirical investigation we develop a categorization of dimensions of knowledge mobility.",

There have been several high technological intensity digital laboratories where learners are engaged with the subject matter through various activities. There are also several low intensity web based solutions that familiarize learners with curriculum material but in less experientially intensive manners. A ubiquitous approach to highly impactful, low cost, high reusability gamified educational approach is a versatile mixed reality educational environment. Using prolific technologies such as inexpensive AR headsets and a versatile low maintenance Database(DB) back ends, a real world environment can be transformed with 3d graphics and audio to various educational spaces of highly impactful content. Such a simple implementation is presented here for virtual patients in medicine. A simple DB backend supports a presentation frontend developed in Unity, utilizing the \"vufori\" mixed reality platform. Based on this implementation future directions are explored.",

    "Abstract": "The present study investigated the differences in syllabus, teaching methodology, practice, and learning assessment for Microbiology course designed for Food Science undergraduate between Nanchang University(NCU) in China and University of Minnesota(UMN) in the US. The study found that, compared with UMN Microbiology course, NCU Microbiology course involves little advanced contents, lacks of classroom discussion, and mainly relies on final exam for learning evaluation. NCU students tend to spend time to study only before exams, which limits their full understanding of the subjects being taught and does not favor long-term knowledge retention. In addition, their ability to apply knowledge to solving real problems is poor due to lack of practice. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommend that we redesign our syllabus so that it is student-centered, renovate our course materials in order to implement the student-center syllabus and to include updated knowledge in the field, adopt problem-base learning methodology, enhance cases studies, adopt teaching assistant policy, improve learning assessment, and invest in instructor engineering training programs.",

    "Abstract": "Currently, the challenge for researchers and managers in the area of knowledge management is to study methods and models that promote and facilitate the acquisition, retention, distribution and utilization of knowledge by individuals and groups of organizations. The main objective of this paper is to analyze how a company that operates in multi-site service sector is organized internally in order to retain the acquired knowledge. The research strategy used is the simple case study, applied in a large multinational company. The findings points out that the service providing organizations should focus their knowledge retention process in a specific department toward this goal. This department has the task of identifying and registering the best practices and learned lessons among all the employees working on different clients in databases, in addition, to promote the integration of these employees in order to promote the distribution of tacit knowledge.

Therefore, it is vital the adoption of new teaching methodologies that enable the students' engagement in their own learning process. Based on a case study, this manuscript aims to demonstrate how games/hands-on approaches can improve the teaching/learning processes in Industrial Engineering education, more specifically in the Lean Manufacturing context. The investigation is focused on: (i) type of achievable learning objectives (according to Bloom's taxonomy) and (ii) alignment with the students' learning styles (according to Felder-Silverman's model).Data about (ii) is gathered by a questionnaire applied to students after the lean manufacturing game. The discussion of (i) is based on the questionnaire and on the analysis of the type of game applied.",

    "Abstract": "Students demonstrate increased engagement and knowledge retention when they are able to make connections between the text and the outside world. Despite the real world not being formed into neat subjects, the Ontario curriculum is. Through integrated curriculum, Susan Drake and James Beane argue that students are better equipped to become life-long learners and global citizens. As leading professionals in the field of integrated curriculum, this document analysis utilizes inductive analysis to explore the Ontario Ministry of Education’s 2006 curriculum document for Language (Revised) to determine if Drake and Beane’s approaches are explicitly stated. Results found that neither approach was explicitly stated, although the Ministry utilized similar integrated approaches as presented by Drake, while desired student outcomes aligned with Beane. The Ontario Ministry of Education should consider the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary frameworks of Drake and Beane when producing future editions of the Ontario curriculum documents.",

    "Abstract": "The components necessary to start a fire, including fuels, ignition sources and oxidizers are present in operating rooms. Fire risk assessments are tools used by surgical team members to rank the risk of a surgical fire occurring and to facilitate communication to reduce risk. Fire risk assessment tools are often inconsistently used by surgical team members. At one facility, the circulating nurse documents the fire risk assessment without engagement of the other surgical team members. The purposes of this quality improvement project conducted at a metropolitan surgery center were to improve the knowledge and awareness of the importance of surgical fire risk and to increase practitioners’ use of a fire risk assessment tool during the surgical safety communication process. An estimated 200–240 surgical fires occur annually in the U.S. All surgical team members need to be aware of surgical fire risk and communicate with team members to minimize it. Many professional and regulatory entities recommend using fire risk assessments during the surgical safety communication process to increase awareness of the risk. A quasi-experimental, before and after intervention, pilot research project utilized a purposive sample including all surgical team members of a metropolitan surgery center. The educational intervention was based on both published evidence and findings of a knowledge, attitudes and practice survey. A 10-item pre/post-test assessed knowledge, current practice and practice intent. A follow up post-test assessed knowledge retention and practice change. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze knowledge questions and common themes were derived from the open-ended responses. The average percentage correct on the pre-test was 48.82%, the post-test 71.88% and the follow up post-test given 3 months later, was 58.57%. On the follow up post-test, 93% of participants indicated they were incorporating surgical fire prevention strategies into their practice, compared to 82% on the pre-test. A separate pre-test question specifically regarding the use of a fire risk assessment was not asked, however, 50% reported using the fire risk assessment during the surgical safety communication process post intervention. The findings suggest that a brief educational intervention regarding fire risk assessment contributes to improving staff knowledge and use of prevention strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Through certification courses like the American Heart Association's (AHA) Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS), health care providers are trained in assessment and interventions for critically ill and/or injured pediatric patients (American Heart Association, 2010). The purpose of this study was to determine if there were benefits to integration of simulation technology (ST) into PALS curriculum. Participants were randomized to control or experimental classes. Experimental classes received PALS courses with ST while the control classes received PALS courses with static manikins. Multilevel modeling was used to examine the differences between control and experimental classes at course end and 6 months later. In addition, participants completed assessment of Kolb's Learning Style Inventory to determine if preferred learning style moderated knowledge retention and skill self efficacy at 6 month follow up. I hypothesized that healthcare providers who participated in a PALS course with ST would have higher skill self-efficacy (SEI), skill performance, and exam scores at the end of training compared to healthcare providers who participated in a course without ST. The experimental group did not have higher SEI or exam scores at the end of the course however their skill performance was better when compared to the control group. Hypothesis 2 stated health care providers who participated in a PALS course with ST would have higher SEI and exam scores at six months post training compared to healthcare providers in a course without ST. Both control and experimental groups experienced a decrease in SEI scores and exam scores over time however the control group experienced a much faster rate of decrease. Finally, hypothesis three, did learning style moderate the effect of ST in the PALS course on knowledge retention and skill self-efficacy at six months? There was no statistically significant effect of learning style on knowledge and skill self-efficacy at the 6 month follow up. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "The practice of science education in American colleges and universities is changing and the role of faculty is changing as well. There is momentum in higher education to transform our instruction and do a better job at supporting more students' success in science and engineering programs. New teaching approaches are transforming undergraduate science instruction and new research demonstrates that these new approaches are more engaging for students, result in greater achievement, and create more positive attitudes toward science careers. Additionally, teaching scholars have described a paradigm shift toward placing the burden of content coverage on students which allows more time for in-class activities such as discussion and problem solving. Teaching faculty have been asked to redesign their courses and rebrand themselves as facilitators of student learning, rather than purveyors of information, to improve student engagement, achievement, and attitudes. This dissertation is a critical evaluation of both the assumption that active learning improves student achievement and knowledge retention and my own assumptions regarding science education research and my students' resiliency. This dissertation is a collection of research articles, published or in preparation, presenting the chronological development (Chapters 2 and 3) and evaluation (Chapters 4 and 5) of an active instructional model for undergraduate biology instruction. Chapters 1 and 6.provide a broad introduction and summary, respectively. Chapter 2 is an exploration of student engagement through interviews with a variety of students. From these interviews I identified several themes that students felt were important, and science instructors need to address, including the place where learning happens and strategies for better engaging students. Chapter 3 presents a review of the science education literature broadly and more focused review on the how students learn and how faculty teach. Consistent with what my student interviews suggested, I found that engaging students by way of innovative instructional approaches is a major theme in science education. I conclude by arguing for the development of collaborative learning communities and the use of cognitive apprenticeships in science classrooms. In Chapter 4 I presented the development and initial evaluation of an instructional framework for undergraduate biology classrooms. I found that student satisfaction as measured by end-of-course iv evaluations increased compared to my previous instructional model. I concluded that the instructional framework was efficacious and proceeded to evaluate the model in the context of knowledge acquisition and retention. Chapter 5 is the culmination of the work I conducted for the research presented in Chapters 2 through 4. In Chapter 5 I formally test the hypotheses that my instructional framework presented in Chapter 4 results in no greater knowledge acquisition or retention compared to a more traditional lecture model of instruction. I failed to reject these hypotheses which runs contrary to much published literature; the implications of my findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "The potential knowledge loss from Baby Boomer generation employee retirements can negatively affect information systems organizations. The purpose of this hermeneutic phenomenology study was to explore the lived experiences of the leaders and managers of information systems organizations as they tried to maintain operational continuity after Baby Boomer worker retirements. The impact of this issue was the operational continuity after the Baby Boomer worker retirement. The social impact of this issue was the knowledge loss events that might result in business loss or even bankruptcy. McElroy’s knowledge life cycle model was the conceptual framework for this study that included knowledge production and knowledge integration processes within a feedback loop. The lived experiences of 20 knowledgeable participants who had experienced institutional knowledge loss from retired Baby Boomer generation employees were captured through purposeful sampling. Data were collected through individual interviews using either face-to-face or a web conferencing tool such as Skype and analyzed through a modified Van Kaam. Five themes were identified: business climate, delivery practices, work processes, camaraderie, and management response. Significant attributes that added to the body of knowledge were workplace navigation, alternate focus, and outsourcing management. The results of the study may enable organizations to be better able to understand and manage the Baby Boomer knowledge loss effects and subsequently create systems to help maintain their competitive edge and avoid knowledge loss that might result in business loss or even bankruptcy.",

    "Abstract": "The training of law enforcement personnel has followed the traditional block-didactic format (i.e., pedagogical passive transfer of knowledge from teacher to student) since formal training was conducted in the early 1940s in the United States. This same model was replicated and used in several parts of the world to include Southern and South East East Asia. Research has shown that this traditional training was instructor-led and placed emphasis on memorization rather than problem-solving skills. Consequently, the traditional pedagogy of law enforcement training has not evolved to address the reality of today's complicated society and demands placed upon law enforcement to solve problems rather than \"just answer calls for service\" by the public. To address this shortcoming, Problem Based Learning (PBL) has been identified as a potential solution that can increase critical thinking and knowledge retention of police recruits as well as to be culturally adroit as to be effective in any geographic setting. This paper explored the results found when examining the recruit experience during the delivery of courses in three countries, the United States, Southern Asia and Southeast Asia, using PBL as a primary delivery method. Observations of the classroom experience in these countries and descriptions and comparisons of the learning environments are presented, as well as analysis of student experience, identifying achievements, and barriers implementing the constructivist philosophy of training through PBL. Results showed a positive experience in the Southern and South East Asian countries and neutral to negative satisfaction in the United States. Findings also include the need for instructor screening and training, preparation, constant feedback, and content reinforcement. This illuminating study will help curriculum developers and administrators improve PBL process and principles in the development of more competent and knowledgeable law enforcement personnel.

    "Abstract": "The cost of losing a manager in the retail sector is 2 to 3 times their yearly salary. The purpose of this exploratory single case study was to explore strategies general managers in large retail organizations can use to improve assistant manager retention. Building upon Ramlall’s adaptation of motivation theory, research was conducted to determine factors that contributed to retention of assistant managers in a general merchandise retail store operating in Virginia and North Carolina. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 20 general managers of stores in the same organization located in Virginia and North Carolina, reflective journals, and researcher observations and were then coded by themes and analyzed using Moustaka’s method of thematic analysis. Seven themes emerged from the study including needs for a supportive work environment, training and communication, pay, and appreciation and feedback. Implications for positive social change include increased wages through higher retention, which can affect the economy of the communities in which the company operates. The company operates nationally, so the potential insight on in increased wages could have a wide impact on the economy if applied to all stores. Assistant managers will also benefit from consistency and growth within the company and in turn be able to provide more stability to employees that work for them. If applied to other companies, this study could also have a positive impact on a wider scale. General managers from different companies in different areas may use the results of this study as a starting point to assess and improve assistant manager retention within their stores. This improved retention could lead to more stability in their team and better knowledge retention for the organization.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore students’ lived experiences in compressed courses. This study was launched because of a phenomenon that occurred at one community college; student success was higher in shorter courses, with the highest success rates realized in the shortest duration courses. The increase in success rates was unexplained previously. Inputs-Environment-Outputs (I-E-O) conceptual theory framed this study. Nine students participated in the study. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) methodology allowed the researcher to examine participants’ experiences through individual interviews. Thorough data analysis, review, and interpretation led to the generation of common themes from the participants’ stories. The central research question that guided this study was: How do students explain higher success rates in compressed, 7-week courses than in full-semester length courses? Five common themes emerged from this study including time management, focus, motivation, knowledge retention, and instructional methods. The themes were consistent with current literature on the compressed course modality. The findings are relevant to community college administrators and faculty who may be considering a compressed course implementation or who already offer this format but do not fully understand whether student success is greater in shorter courses. Additional research is needed to explore the perspectives of faculty who teach compressed courses. Research could be expanded to examine students who experienced a decline in success rates under the compressed course format.",

    "Abstract": "Many teachers create multimedia resources for their students, but most are uncertain as to what factors to consider regarding the design of multimedia instructional materials. Prior research identified instructional design principles for multimedia including the coherence principle and voice principle. The purpose of this study was to test the coherence principle in a realistic setting using a heterogeneous group of ninth grade students in a humanities course to determine the effect of seductive details on retention and problem-solving transfer. To extend understanding of the voice principle, this study examined the effect of the teacher’s voice on student learning as measured by retention and problem-solving transfer. Additionally, the study explored the relationship between prior knowledge, retention, and problem-solving transfer. Accordingly, the study, a 2 x 2 factorial design used a convenience sample of 134 ninth grade students enrolled in a Christian Sexuality course in an urban, co-ed high school in the San Francisco Bay Area. Students were randomly assigned to one of four groups for the four multimedia packages delivered over a month: No Seductive Details/Teacher Voice, No Seductive Details/Different Teacher Voice, Seductive Details/ Teacher Voice, or Seductive Details/ Different Teacher Voice. Students completed a prior knowledge inventory first and a retention inventory and problem-solving transfer inventory after each multimedia package. Eight two-way ANOVAs were conducted to determine differences in performance between the groups. One statistically significant main effect for the seductive details condition, F (1, 121) = 4.32, p < .05 , d = 0.36 , was observed for problem-solving transfer in Video 1. In contrast to prior research conducted in laboratory settings, there was no seductive details effect observed. No statistically significant differences for voice were observed, but the descriptive statistics revealed a trend of improving scores for both retention and transfer for different teacher voice suggesting that social agency theory does not explain previous voice principle research. Prior knowledge was positively associated with transfer for teacher’s voice and with retention with different teacher’s voice.",

    "Abstract": "With low levels of physical activity being linked to 6% of deaths worldwide (WHO, 2014), a change is needed. Students enrolled in colleges and universities are in a point of transition and of change in their lives. This change has resulted in a decrease in physical activity as focus shifts to academics and as interest in physical activity decreases. An intervention was created to provide a possible alternative to becoming inactive. The intervention consisted of a number of physical activity activities that were incorporated as homework assignments for students enrolled in a college wide general education wellness course. The physical activities were designed to vary in intensity to meet the challenges often expressed by students including a lack of time or equipment. All activities were approximately 20 minutes in length and required little to no equipment perfect for completion in a residence hall room. The results were examined using a repeated measures ANOVA examining not only physical activity levels by also physical activity knowledge retention at three points over a 23 week period. Of the three problem statements examined only the main problem could be evaluated as a result of low participation rates in certain demographics. Examining physical activity rates between groups lead to no significant differences based on intervention or non-intervention group. Similar results were found when comparing the two groups regarding physical activity knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The purpose of this study was to explore DSP workplace experiences, preparation, employee training, emotions, and perceptions in regards to types of sexual and affectionate behaviors exhibited by intellectually disabled adults in their care in the CILA setting. The study focused on analyzing these topics in relation to sexuality/affectionate behaviors experienced in the CILA workplace using a qualitative case study method. This analysis provided an understanding of what ideas and values DSPs brought to their roles of guiding the sexuality/affectionate behaviors of residents in their care and identified additional training needs from the DSP perspective to help them better do their jobs. Methods: Principles found in qualitative evaluation research were used to examine the influence of sexuality and affectionate behaviors and training within its naturally occurring world. The case was comprised of DSPs from the selected organization, located in a rural college town of approximately 25,000 people. Nine DSPs from five different CILA homes participated in the study. Data were generated using semi-structured interviews, observation of behaviors on interview video tapes, observation of emotional verbal cues on interview audio tapes, document analysis, and field notes. Results: Major themes were identified from data and organized around the research questions. Common categories under affectionate behaviors were dating, flirting, friendship/socialization, holding hands/hugging, media/technology, and problematic behaviors. Common categories under sexuality behaviors were groping, masturbation/females, masturbation/males, and problematic behaviors. Less common categories were affectionate behaviors-attention seeking/ego, sexuality behaviors -- sexual intercourse, and sexuality behaviors -- dating and marriage. Once data were categorized, each category's responses were sorted to identify overarching theme areas for recommendations. The themes were Employee Training and Development, Socialization Needs (Affectionate Behaviors, Sexuality, and Relationships), and Language Issues (Positive, Negative, and First Person). Primary strengths identified included thinking of residents as family, the feeling of strong management support, and lack of significant conflict within the CILA homes. Elements that detracted from the DSP experience included low rate of hourly pay, employee turnover among DSP supervisors, lack of specific sexuality education for both staff and residents, limited retention of mandatory training topics, and lack of communication of sexuality policies and procedures. Conclusions were a need for additional training for DSPs and staff on the topics of human sexuality and affectionate behaviors in CILA homes; examining DSP training to increase knowledge retention in the staff; better communication of policies, procedures, and protocols regarding sexuality and affectionate behaviors that pertain to how situations are handled in CILA homes; and ensuring all training materials use first person language.

    "Abstract": "Educators are continually searching for techniques to improve knowledge retention in the classroom. This research makes a case for employing agile techniques in pedagogical practices. The premise for the research is that poor knowledge retention exists because teaching typically follows a traditional waterfall approach, which studies show to be ineffective in software development. Agile software development, on the other hand, has gained acceptance due to its flexible approach and lightweight methodologies. The need for a flexible approach that adapts to students’ needs and focuses on value should be the new norm in the classroom. The “learn and forget” style of rote learning should be discouraged. This research proposes that delivering the course in order of importance, constant stakeholder collaboration, and adapting the delivery based on feedback can improve learning and knowledge retention. Through a test-driven development approach, continuous planning and frequent feedback, the research further proposes that students feel valued and because of this iterative planning and feedback loop, can continuously align course objectives to desired learning throughout the process. The research focuses on agile principles to enhance the teaching delivery methods and student learning in the classroom. This research does not focus on agile practices such as Scrum or eXtreme Programming (XP). The main objective of the research is to determine if incorporating agile principles provides any benefits to knowledge retention. The researcher proposes that an agile approach will improve students’ learning, retention, and satisfaction.",

    "Abstract": "Medical education increasingly involves online learning experiences to facilitate the standardization of curriculum across time and space. In class, delivering material by lecture is less effective at promoting student learning than engaging students in active learning experience and it is unclear whether this difference also exists online. We sought to evaluate medical student preferences for online lecture or online active learning formats and the impact of format on short- and long-term learning gains. Students participated online in either lecture or constructivist learning activities in a first year neurologic sciences course at a US medical school. In 2012, students selected which format to complete and in 2013, students were randomly assigned in a crossover fashion to the modules. In the first iteration, students strongly preferred the lecture modules and valued being told \"what they need to know\" rather than figuring it out independently. In the crossover iteration, learning gains and knowledge retention were found to be equivalent regardless of format, and students uniformly demonstrated a strong preference for the lecture format, which also on average took less time to complete. When given a choice for online modules, students prefer passive lecture rather than completing constructivist activities, and in the time-limited environment of medical school, this choice results in similar performance on multiple-choice examinations with less time invested. Instructors need to look more carefully at whether assessments and learning strategies are helping students to obtain self-directed learning skills and to consider strategies to help students learn to value active learning in an online environment.Medical education increasingly involves online learning experiences to facilitate the standardization of curriculum across time and space.

    "Abstract": "Background The Republic of Georgia (Sakartvelo in Georgian language) is part of the Caucasus biodiversity hotspot, and human agricultural plant use dates bat at least 6000 years. However, little ethnobiological research has been published from the region since the 1940s. Given the lack of recent research in the region, the present study we report on plant uses in Skartvelo (Republic of Georgia), Caucasus. We hypothesized that, (1) given the long tradition of plant use, and the isolation under Soviet rule, plant use both based on homegardens and wild harvesting would be more pronounced in Georgia than in the wiser region, (2) the Soviet occupation would have had broad influence on plant use, and (3) there would still be incidence of knowledge loss despite wide plant use. Methods Fieldwork was conducted in Khevsureti, Samtskhe-Javakheti, Tusheti, Svaneti, and Racha in July-August 2013, July-August 2014, and September-October 2015. Interviews using semi-structured questionnaires were conducted with 170 participants (80 women and 90 men) after obtaining their oral prior informed consent. All interviews were carried out in the participants' homes and gardens by native speakers of Georgian and its local dialects (Svan, Tush, Khevsur, Psav), or, where participants spoke these as their native language, Armenian, Russian, or Greek. Results In the present study we encountered 480 plant species belonging to 249 genera of 95 families being used in the research region. The highest number of species and of unique species were reported from the remote Tusheti-Khevsureti region. Informant consensus and number of use reports were highest for each region in the food and medicinal use categories. Of the 480 plants being used in the research region 282 species were exclusively wild-harvested, 103 were grown in homegardens, and 84 were both grown in gardens and sourced in the wild. Conclusions Plant species, and uses, found in our study, both for Georgia in general, as well as for its regions, showed clear relations to the wider Caucasus - Asia Minor - Balkans cultural complex. However, plant use in Georgia was much more diverse than reported in other studies from Eurasia.",

    "Abstract": "This research study sought to understand the influence of outsourcing in aerospace engineering services. This research study was a qualitative phenomenological study focused on analyzing the relationships between knowledge retention, types of knowledge, and outsourcing of aerospace engineering. Aerospace engineering professionals participated in this study shared their perceptions and the lived experiences of outsourcing aerospace engineering services. This study revealed that organizations with strategic outsourcing approaches, including solid knowledge management plans, and documented procedures, show fewer errors in estimating realistic cost savings due to outsourcing. Knowledge transfer from customer to supplier is important for outsourcing to be successful. Customer and supplier need to be consistent on the understanding and expectations of the outsourced engineering service. The data analysis revealed three themes that emerged from the data: Effective knowledge retention does not occur during outsourcing aerospace engineering work due to change in focus of the organization and lack of interest of skilled engineers. Clear documentation of the processes, requirements, and contract obligations for knowledge transfer yields the best results during outsourcing. The rate of success of outsourcing explicit engineering knowledge is higher than outsourcing tacit engineering knowledge. Future research on aerospace engineering IP loss could help aerospace professionals to be aware of the information protection needs during outsourcing.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Knowledge loss impact on the performance of management information system (MIS) departments due to its influence on absorptive capacity. Furthermore, knowledge retention in human resource management and information system application is also included in the research model, in order to examine their effectiveness in mitigating knowledge loss. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Survey method and hypotheses are tested with the collected data from 191 Taiwanese IS personnel. Findings: The results not only indicate knowledge loss has impacts on the absorptive capacity and performance of MIS departments while information systems could mitigate knowledge loss, but also provide deeper understanding of knowledge loss and potential issues for academics; as for practitioners, this study could serve as a reference to design and adopt knowledge management (KM) mechanisms. Originality/value: KM is an important issue for organizations since it is the source of competitive advantages and excellent performance, although the investment in KM is not necessary effective in retaining knowledge. This study conducts survey to examine the influences of knowledge loss in MIS departments, since the high turnover rate of employees and the rapid environmental changes in technical world may worsen the situation. According to dynamic capability theory, absorptive capacity is a critical ability to have while facing turbulent environment.

    "Abstract": "There are many ways to teach within a classroom environment. Traditional teaching methods have been successful because they can be applied in almost any classroom and are useful for imparting knowledge to a learner (Chang & Fisher, 2001). However, understanding and being able to apply that knowledge can be a challenge within a normal classroom environment. Simulations and games have been used in both the past and the present by the military and the government to teach and fine tune desired skills (Balci, Bertelrud, Esterbrook, & Nance, 1997). Video games and simulations give the learner a chance to apply their knowledge in a range of situations safely and with minimal cost. Many current video games mimic real world situations and can be used to create hands-on learning experiences. Learners gain self-efficacy towards the selected topic and are able to apply their empirical knowledge and cognitive reasoning skills. This study planned to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of using video games in the classroom to a traditional learning environment. Learners will be evaluated on their perception of the learning environment and their retention of knowledge. According to the literature, video games provide a unique and diverse learning environment. Popular video games often have the concepts of social cognitive theory, scaffolding and application of knowledge built into their gameplay. The layout of the study was created with these concepts in mind. The participants were adult learners from a community college setting who volunteered to take part in the two hour study. They attended two modules; one module to gain a knowledge base and another module that split the group into two different classrooms: Video Game Based and Traditional. They took the WEBLEI-VGB (Web Based Learning Inventory) that was adapted from an instrument created by Chang and Fisher (2003) and a Content Knowledge Assessment. The data was analyzed and the two classrooms were compared. Despite low participation in the study, the reported data and the addressed literature emphasizes the need for future studies involving video games, learning environments and knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "The study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of the Healthy Relationships & Autism (HR) curriculum (Sutton & Wesley Spectrum Services, 2013), which is a developmentally sequenced, manualized treatment intended for children and adolescents with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The HR curriculum is designed to facilitate healthy interpersonal relationships in children and adolescents with ASD. Specifically, this study investigates the effectiveness of Module 2 of the curriculum, which focuses on teaching basic biological sex education, using well researched techniques designed to reach individuals with ASD. The paper elaborates on the history and development of the need to address these issues, both clinically and in the literature. The study has examined the knowledge acquisition and retention of a sample of adolescents based the results of a pre- and post-intervention test, using a quasi-experimental, repeated measures design was within the study. Research question 1a investigated whether or not the HR curriculum is effective in the initial knowledge acquisition of basic biological sexual education for children and adolescents with an ASD. A paired samples t-test was used to determine whether or not there was a significant increase in score from pretest to posttest for all participants. Research question 1b investigates whether or not the participants in the HR curriculum achieved mastery of the module content as measured by at least an 85% correct on the initial posttest following the completion of Module 2. Descriptive statistics were reported to describe the results. Research questions 2a and 2b investigate whether or not the HR curriculum is effective for the retention of basic biological sex education knowledge children and adolescents with an ASD of all functioning levels. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and individual visual analyses were used to determine the extent of the effect of the HR curriculum on knowledge retention. Results of the study indicate that the HR curriculum was effective in increasing knowledge acquisition for the participants in the sample. In addition, results indicate overall effectiveness in knowledge retention overtime for adolescents who span the spectrum in terms of skill and functioning abilities.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to propose that knowledge management (KM) could be a way to nurture job satisfaction and examine how KM can increase individual employees’ job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model concerning the connections between five facets of KM (knowledge acquisition, knowledge sharing, knowledge creation, knowledge codification and knowledge retention) and job satisfaction is proposed. It is then empirically tested with a structural equation modelling partial least squares analysis of a survey data set of 824 observations, collected from the members of a Finnish municipal organisation. Findings: Existence of KM processes in one’s working environment is significantly linked with high job satisfaction. Especially intra-organisational knowledge sharing seems to be a key KM process, promoting satisfaction with one’s job in most employee groups. Interestingly, significant knowledge-based promoters of job satisfaction differ as a function of job characteristics. Practical implications: KM has a strong impact on employee job satisfaction, and therefore, managers are advised to implement KM activities in their organisations, not only for the sake of improving knowledge worker performance but also for improving their well-being at work. Originality/value: This paper produces knowledge on a type of consequence of KM that has been largely unexplored in previous research, individual job satisfaction. Also, it promotes moving the KM literature to the next stage where the impact of KM practices is not explored as a “one size fits all” type of a phenomenon, but rather as a contingent and contextual issue.

    "Abstract": "Kinesiology is a growing discipline, and the concepts associated with kinesiology are being used by many professionals to address societal health concerns, employee wellness, and health across the life span. This study was designed to determine the best practice course design for an undergraduate kinesiology course, assessing student's ability to understand and retain entry level kinesiology concepts. Data was gathered over a period of three semesters, and included a lecture only control group, a lecture and software lab group, and a lecture and hands-on lab group. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess which course design, lecture with software lab or lecture with hands-on lab, yielded the best outcomes. The results indicate no significant difference between the groups and implies that the lecture with a lab, either software or hands-on, offer solid knowledge gains and knowledge retention of kinesiology concepts and theories.

    "Abstract": "Chronic diseases are increasing worldwide and have become a significant burden to those affected by those diseases. Disease-specific education programs have demonstrated improved outcomes, although people do forget information quickly or memorize it incorrectly. The teach-back method was introduced in an attempt to reinforce education to patients. To date, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of health education employing the teach-back method in improved care has not yet been reviewed systematically. BACKGROUND Chronic diseases are increasing worldwide and have become a significant burden to those affected by those diseases. Disease-specific education programs have demonstrated improved outcomes, although people do forget information quickly or memorize it incorrectly. The teach-back method was introduced in an attempt to reinforce education to patients. To date, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of health education employing the teach-back method in improved care has not yet been reviewed systematically.This systematic review examined the evidence on using the teach-back method in health education programs for improving adherence and self-management of people with chronic disease. OBJECTIVES This systematic review examined the evidence on using the teach-back method in health education programs for improving adherence and self-management of people with chronic disease.Adults aged 18 years and over with one or more than one chronic disease.All types of interventions which included the teach-back method in an education program for people with chronic diseases. The comparator was chronic disease education programs that did not involve the teach-back method.Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, before-after studies and case-control studies.The outcomes of interest were adherence, self-management, disease-specific knowledge, readmission, knowledge retention, self-efficacy and quality of life. INCLUSION CRITERIA Adults aged 18 years and over with one or more than one chronic disease.All types of interventions which included the teach-back method in an education program for people with chronic diseases. The comparator was chronic disease education programs that did not involve the teach-back method.Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, before-after studies and case-control studies.The outcomes of interest were adherence, self-management, disease-specific knowledge, readmission, knowledge retention, self-efficacy and quality of life.Searches were conducted in CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health Source, and Google Scholar databases. Search terms were combined by AND or OR in search strings. Reference lists of included articles were also searched for further potential references. SEARCH STRATEGY Searches were conducted in CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health Source, and Google Scholar databases. Search terms were combined by AND or OR in search strings. Reference lists of included articles were also searched for further potential references.Two reviewers conducted quality appraisal of papers using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY Two reviewers conducted quality appraisal of papers using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument.Data were extracted using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument data extraction instruments. DATA EXTRACTION Data were extracted using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument data extraction instruments.There was significant heterogeneity in selected studies, hence a meta-analysis was not possible and the results were presented in narrative form. DATA SYNTHESIS There was significant heterogeneity in selected studies, hence a meta-analysis was not possible and the results were presented in narrative form.Of the 21 articles retrieved in full, 12 on the use of the teach-back method met the inclusion criteria and were selected for analysis. Four studies confirmed improved disease-specific knowledge in intervention participants. One study showed a statistically significant improvement in adherence to medication and diet among type 2 diabetics patients in the intervention group compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Two studies found statistically significant improvements in self-efficacy (p = 0.0026 and p < 0.001) in the intervention groups. One study examined quality of life in heart failure patients but the results did not improve from the intervention (p = 0.59). Five studies found a reduction in readmission rates and hospitalization but these were not always statistically significant. Two studies showed improvement in daily weighing among heart failure participants, and in adherence to diet, exercise and foot care among those with type 2 diabetes.

Five studies found a reduction in readmission rates and hospitalization but these were not always statistically significant. Two studies showed improvement in daily weighing among heart failure participants, and in adherence to diet, exercise and foot care among those with type 2 diabetes.Overall, the teach-back method showed positive effects in a wide range of health care outcomes although these were not always statistically significant. Studies in this systematic review revealed improved outcomes in disease-specific knowledge, adherence, self-efficacy and the inhaler technique. There was a positive but inconsistent trend also seen in improved self-care and reduction of hospital readmission rates. There was limited evidence on improvement in quality of life or disease related knowledge retention.Evidence from the systematic review supports the use of the teach-back method in educating people with chronic disease to maximize their disease understanding and promote knowledge, adherence, self-efficacy and self-care skills.Future studies are required to strengthen the evidence on effects of the teach-back method. Larger randomized controlled trials will be needed to determine the effectiveness of the teach-back method in quality of life, reduction of readmission, and hospitalizations.

    "Abstract": "More than 35% of the U.S. workforce is composed of Baby Boomers who are eligible to retire within the next 5 years. Despite the potential loss of critical expertise, a gap in knowledge retention exists in small consulting businesses. The purpose of this case study was to explore effective strategies for retaining the tacit and explicit knowledge of retiring employees, to avoid operational knowledge drain. Exploration ensued through semistructured interviews at 2 small consulting businesses in the Washington, DC metropolitan area that are adept at innovatively retaining requisite knowledge. The conceptual frameworks of Bass’ transformational leadership and Nonaka’s knowledge creation led to the identification of strategies to retain tacit and explicit knowledge of retiring Baby Boomers. Seven small business leaders addressed questions on knowledge types, knowledge stimulation and sharing methods, and retention strategies to provide meaningful responses to the knowledge retention phenomenon. Data analysis included the Colaizzi and modified van Kaam methods of mining, categorizing, organizing, and describing participants’ statements. Subsequently, the themes that emerged during the analysis identified reward, communication, and motivation as strategies for knowledge-share and transfer. Succession planning, mentoring, documentation, training, and knowledge sharing also emerged as effective methods for knowledge retention. The findings will contribute to social change by illuminating the roles effective leaders practice to influence and foster knowledge management, offering insight to other small businesses having difficulties remaining sustainable as the operational knowledge of Baby Boomers becomes unavailable as they retire.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge has been considered a critical factor for any organization's survival however its retention and utilization has remained a challenge to many organizations in developing countries education institutions inclusive. In schools of developing countries in particular, educators struggle for subsistence and many leave to seek for greener pastures. Such exodus of educators has led to knowledge loss and has widened the knowledge gap between the schools for the rich and those for the poor. This has been worse especially in the most challenging subjects like Science and Mathematics. Closing this gap, schools need to depend on the knowledge of other experienced educators that are still in the Education system in order to enhance the capabilities of those that are inexperienced. Practically, this study could be leveraged by schools and governments to entrench tacit knowledge and to address the brain drainage associated with the continuous exodus of the skilled and experienced educators.

    "Abstract": "Objective: To determine if physical activity can reinforce nutrition education messages in the Families in Transformation ( FIT ) program at HealthWorks! located in Tupelo, Mississippi. Methods: Children ages 7–13 participating in the (FIT) program made up the subjects for this study. A control and treatment group were observed using a nutrition reinforcement physical activity and a non-nutrition reinforcement activity during the regular physical activity nights of the ( FIT ) program, and a pre and post Nutrition Quiz, Health Habits Survey, anthropometric data, and Fitness data were obtained pre and post study to determine if the intervention had an impact on the subjects. Results: There were no significant differences seen in pre and post BMI . The means for the fitness test results are found in Table 3. Significant (p < 0.05) differences were seen from pre-program to post-program from for the girls in push-ups (14.00 + 6.23 to 20.2 + 5.63) and chair squats (29.3 + 3.23 to 32.4 + 4.59) which in turned affected significant differences for the total group for push-ups (14.31 + 7.62 to 19.63 + 6.62) and chair squats (30.50 + 10.21 to 34.44 + 7.39). Significant (p < 0.05) differences were seen from pre-program to post-program for sit-ups for the total group (39.63 + 5.80 to 44.38 + 4.91). Differences were almost significant in both girls and boys, but was not because sample size was smaller. The intervention group performed better on the nutrition quiz in 6 out of the 10 questions, 2 questions were 100% pre and post, 4 of the 10 questions being statistically significant. Children performed better on the post Nutrition Quiz than the pre Nutrition Quiz. Conclusion: The nutrition reinforcement treatment group scored better on the post Nutrition Quiz in comparison to the control group. Nutrition reinforcement through physical activity does have a positive effect on nutrition education knowledge retention. Short term weight management programs do produce positive health effects.",

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of electronic learning and educational booklet on the nurses' retention of diabetes updates. BACKGROUND Training methods that enhance nurses' learning and retention will increase the quality of patient care. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of electronic learning and educational booklet on the nurses' retention of diabetes updates.In this controlled trial study, convenience sampling was used to select 123 nurses from the endocrinology and internal medicine wards of three hospitals affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, Iran). The participants were allocated to three groups of manual, electronic learning, and control. The booklet and electronic learning groups were trained using educational booklet and electronic continuous medical education (CME) website, respectively. The control group did not receive any intervention. In all the three groups, the nurses' knowledge was measured before the intervention, and one and four weeks after the intervention. Data were collected by a questionnaire.

The participants were allocated to three groups of manual, electronic learning, and control. The booklet and electronic learning groups were trained using educational booklet and electronic continuous medical education (CME) website, respectively. The control group did not receive any intervention. In all the three groups, the nurses' knowledge was measured before the intervention, and one and four weeks after the intervention. Data were collected by a questionnaire.Significant differences were observed between the mean scores of the three groups one and four weeks after the intervention (F=26.17, p=0.001 and F=4.07, p=0.020, respectively), and post hoc test showed that this difference was due to the higher score in e-learning group. Both e-learning and booklet methods could effectively improve nurses' knowledge (χ²=23.03, p=0.001 and χ²=51.71, p=0.001, respectively). RESULTS Significant differences were observed between the mean scores of the three groups one and four weeks after the intervention (F=26.17, p=0.001 and F=4.07, p=0.020, respectively), and post hoc test showed that this difference was due to the higher score in e-learning group. Both e-learning and booklet methods could effectively improve nurses' knowledge (χ²=23.03, p=0.001 and χ²=51.71, p=0.001, respectively).According to the results of this study, electronic learning was more effective than booklet in enhancing the learning and retention of knowledge. Electronic learning is suggested as a more suitable method as it provides appropriate interactions and attractive virtual environments to motivate the learners and promote retention. CONCLUSION According to the results of this study, electronic learning was more effective than booklet in enhancing the learning and retention of knowledge. Electronic learning is suggested as a more suitable method as it provides appropriate interactions and attractive virtual environments to motivate the learners and promote retention.",

Learning materials, multimedia learning objects, knowledge testing and grading is driven to the details in Slovenia but the drill seems to be forgotten. Knowledge retention positively correspond with the amount and duration of the drills. Drill should not increase costs of education for students. In Slovenia a project E-va (electronic drill book) produced publically available e-drills for primary and secondary schools [1]. Article present the test of efficiency of e-drills on the population of 1st year students of undergraduate study program of elementary education. Those students are interdisciplinary in nature and knows physics from secondary schools. Two random groups were formed to be tested with the paper drill questions and e-drill questions. We do not expect the difference between groups since both groups are going to have three drills of each type. Differences are going to be influenced only by the type of drill (e-drill or paper drill). Results highlight the motivation factors of ICT and enables us to identify benefits and drawbacks of e-drills. The results will be the part of the requirement specification of the new development of e-drills.",

    "Abstract": "This dissertation defines a new executive role of The Data Narrativist to address the emerging leadership needs of analytics organizations practicing data science. The Data Narrativist is designed to be an executive storyteller with expertise in the humanization of data driven communication. The Data Narrative Process provides an approach for managing exploratory analysis, analytics research, story creation and execution of data narratives. A new profile for this role is defined by a review of existing profiles from similar executive roles, a definition of emerging administrative roles, and an assessment of complementary methodologies. This thesis proceeds with an investigation into the structure and techniques of documentary film applied to the practice of creating narrative data visualization in video. Structural elements in documentary video are identified to engage a broad audience not formally trained in data visualization. An empirical analysis is performed using matched pairs of narrative visualization videos highlighting particular documentary techniques. With the accumulation of user preferences, voice over audio and the participatory mode are recommended to improve audience engagement of the analytical content. This work provides guidance for the construction of effective documentary narrative visualization videos as a form of enhanced data narrative. Documentary Data Narrative is incorporated into an evaluation of three unique types of enhanced data narrative to determine their effectiveness in knowledge transfer. Two examples of enhanced data narrative using data visualization are defined as Visual Data Narrative and Documentary Data Narrative. Another is defined as Computer Generated Text Data Narrative, constructed using Natural Language Generation (NLG) technology from the field of artificial intelligence. Together the three defined forms of enhanced data narrative are evaluated along with a traditional Human Generated Text Data Narrative. Each of the four types of data narrative is constructed from a common set of quantitative data measures regarding an earnings announcement for an established technology company. Based on the results of a set of knowledge retention questions, we perform a statistical analysis to determine the knowledge transfer performance for each form of data narrative. With this analysis we make observations about the effectiveness of the four discrete forms of data narrative.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the services management literature by identifying a sequence of the different processes of knowledge management (KM) to create customer service value. Design/methodology/approach: The context for the research hypotheses is the Spanish banking industry. The authors conducted a study including 76 banks and 1,832 customers of these banks. This paper uses the partial least squares method to conduct the data analysis. Findings: The authors find support for all the hypotheses proposed in the model. The results show that service firms that are able to apply more knowledge or apply knowledge more effectively are likely to generate more benefits for their customers, and/or reduce their sacrifices, contributing significantly to a higher perception of service value. Research limitations/implications: The study focusses on one particular industry in a single point in time. A longitudinal analysis of a variety of service industries would enrich the study. Practical implications: It is argued that KM constitutes a key capability for service firms for the delivery of service value. According to the research, if service firms want to improve the application of knowledge, it is important to focus on knowledge retention while they create new knowledge. Originality/value: Although a considerable amount of research has been carried out in the fields of KM and customer value, there has been less research that has taken both into consideration simultaneously. This paper addresses this gap in the literature. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2016 IEEE Aerospace Conference Conference Start Date: 2016, March 5 Conference End Date: 2016, March 12 Conference Location: Big Sky, MT, USA For long-duration missions such as Mars Express and Rosetta, operating at considerable distances from Earth and with complex and highly variable mission profiles, issues of automation, the retention of knowledge and experience, and the potential human risk factor are especially relevant. Maximising the benefits of a \"human in-the-loop\" are increasingly seen as fundamental to on-going mission success. This paper presents a summary of these benefits, the experiences gained and the lessons learned. In section 4 of the paper specific case studies are presented, illustrating for both missions the significance of human involvement. This facilitated for Mars Express: (i) more efficient use of limited resources on the spacecraft; (ii) safer and more robust routine operations (as a reaction to critical on-board anomalies); (iii) the resolution of potentially significant scientific losses to the mission; and (iv) the realisation of a science return after mitigating risk during the encounter with Comet Siding Spring. Complementary case studies are also presented for Rosetta. In section 5, the principal lessons learned from the two missions are reviewed. These lessons encompass the experiences and knowledge gathered during extensive simulations and training campaigns, as well as years of in-flight experience. It is shown how a continually evolving mission profile (due, for example, to changes in science requirements, anomalies on the spacecraft or complex and changing mission phases), and on-going staff turnover, have led to significant challenges in knowledge retention and dissemination. Experience gained in the implementation of control-room automation is specifically highlighted -- a concept introduced partly as a proof of concept, but also as a complement to (and extension of) automation implemented within the Mission Planning System. The relevance of the above experiences to the future evolution of the Mars Express mission is presented in section 6. This mission will have to manage a number of future challenges: (i) safely automating end-to-end spacecraft operations from planning and scheduling to spacecraft commanding; (ii) increasingly automating the verification process wherever possible and utilising the human resources where they are most valuable to the process; (iii) conducting safe operations within increasingly constraining power/thermal conditions; (iv) ensuring that knowledge and expertise can be retained in future years, after the Rosetta mission has ended. To summarise, the longevity and success of such complex missions could not have been achieved without the resourcefulness and adaptability offered by the human operator in the loop. The primary challenge for the remaining years of the Mars Express mission is therefore how to build on this knowledge and expertise for the benefit of the mission, whilst also encouraging and fostering a more institutionalised approach to knowledge capture and dissemination for the missions to come.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2016 IEEE Aerospace Conference Conference Start Date: 2016, March 5 Conference End Date: 2016, March 12 Conference Location: Big Sky, MT, USA NASA's Johnson Space Center is working with Stottler Henke to improve teamwork skills for long-duration space missions. Numerous factors, however, make instilling teamwork skills into deep-space astronauts extremely challenging. First, due to communication difficulties and mission duration, teams must be trained in a wide variety of domains -- from maintenance procedures throughout the ship, to extremely thorough medical training, to science evaluations. Second, there may be a significant delay between when such knowledge is acquired and when it is needed; for instance, several years may pass between an astronaut learning how to diagnose, and to treat, a collapsed lung. Third, training must anticipate a huge range of conditions; the sheer length of deep-space missions when compared to shuttle missions vastly increases the number, and scope, of possible situations that could arise, making it virtually impossible to train for every scenario. To face the myriad challenges of deep-space flight, inflight training must be readily available. Our solution is a low-fidelity simulation using game-based training that leverages our experience with intelligent tutoring system (ITS) technology. Game-based training is engaging -- it provides an entertaining break from the more onerous aspects of deep-space flight. Moreover, it incentivizes practice of amorphous, but critical, teamwork skills, motivating crews to practice more frequently for either mission-related team training or generalizable team skills training. Finally, a game-based solution addresses the problem of finding the physical space in which to train when a small crew is constrained in a cramped environment for extended periods of time. This paper reviews the process of creating games based on firefighting on the International Space Station (ISS) and Medical Training. We review the process of analyzing the firefighting procedure to determine the teamwork skills involved; how those skills were mapped to game mechanics; what changes were made to try to make the experience more engaging; and finally, whether these changes were effective.",

    "Abstract": "Recent empirical findings concerning the performance effects of service business model innovation (servitization) and its interplay with product innovation are mixed. Using the lenses of the demand-based view on value creation and complementarity, the performance impact of two key service business models is examined: the product-oriented model and the customer-oriented model, implemented jointly with product innovation. Results indicate that the interplay between service business model innovation and product innovation results in long-term performance benefits coupled with a degree of short-term performance sacrifice. Service business model innovation in isolation from product innovation results in short-term profit gains but long-term knowledge loss and, thus, market performance decline. Our study suggests that firms need to look beyond the evidence on short-term effects in order to achieve superior performance in the long run.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine which academic and affective student factors were significant to student success in a mastery learning program in developmental mathematics and to determine if the mastery learning program led to increased mathematical knowledge retention and success in the subsequent math course. The first phase of the study involved 298 students in developmental mathematics. Using binary logistic regression, the researcher found that placement test score, previous experience with mastery learning, and gender were statistically significant factors related to student success in the mastery learning program. The second phase of the study involved 529 students in the subsequent course intermediate algebra. Using one-way analysis of variance and chi-square methods, the researcher found that mastery learning students retained significantly more mathematical content knowledge and succeeded at significantly higher rates in the subsequent course intermediate algebra as compared to students who took developmental mathematics through traditional methods and those who opted out of placement testing. Results of the study showed that the mastery learning approach in developmental mathematics which incorporated the affective student domain offered advantages for assisting students to overcome math background and self-efficacy barriers.",

    "Abstract": "The single most important role of the security function within an organization is to protect property, people, and assets. While this protection is one of the most expensive countermeasures in an organization, it is critical to every organizational security system. An important decision of security management is whether to hire proprietary security officers or to contract out these services to a security services agency. Among the factors considered in this decision process are costs, flexibility, and the level of commitment of the officers. Since security departments do not generate revenue there are advantages to using contract security officers to reduce costs, however, this can lead to major obstacles within the profession. Organizational leaders looking to make a profit may opt for the lowest priced security solutions which can elicit underpaid, undertrained, and under supervised security officers. These factors combined can increase turnover because more qualified staff leave for better job opportunities. Not only is employee turnover expensive, but turnover is linked to loss of knowledge capital and weakens the organization’s reputation. The problem addressed in this study was turnover intention among contract security officers. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships of key work-related attitudes and turnover intention among contract security officers. The population studied was security officers employed by a contract organization and located at a client organization within the United States. Data was collected through a custom online survey using previously validated scales. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationships among the variables using Pearson product–moment correlations and step-wise regression analysis. To conduct a linear or multiple regression the differences between actual values and predicted values (residuals) must be independent. Independence of residuals was confirmed for all hypotheses using the Durbin-Watson test. The Durbin-Watson has a scale range from 0.0 to 4.0, with a value of 2.0 indicating no autocorrelation between actual and predicted values. The results of this Durbin-Watson value for hypothesis one was 2.11, for hypothesis two was1.89, for hypothesis three was 1.91, and for hypothesis four was 2.19; which meets the assumption.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this project has been to evaluate the potential impact of the ageing and retirement of the baby boom generation on the healthcare workforce. The largest generation of the last century is retiring and has increased demands on the healthcare workforce by consuming greater quantities of healthcare services in retirement. The healthcare workforce mirrors baby boomers and a large proportion have been retiring at time of high demand. The retirement of the baby boomers has represented a loss of knowledge and expertise; a commodity not easily replaced. A peer reviewed literature search for material pertaining to baby boomer retirement, the healthcare workforce, primary care, and related terms was done. Articles were reviewed and sorted into relevant categories. Current trends, solutions, and evidence based practice dealing with barriers to workforce retention and expansion were analyzed. Findings pointed to healthcare workforce shortages, rising healthcare costs and gaps in the delivery of services. An increase of Geriatricians, registered nurses and medical support staff has been needed to cope with demand. Healthcare organizations and schools have had to focus on drawing in new professionals and keeping existing employees on staff and content. Educational funding, work/life balance and compensation packages have been important to attracting more professionals. Baby boomers will live longer, have access to advanced technology and will have better quality of life in retirement. Longevity comes with chronic disease, disability and dementia which has increased demand for services and has increased costs. The retirement of the baby boom generation has force the government and healthcare organizations to look at healthcare spending, workforce planning and tracking, and how to best provide care to the largest growing segment of our population.

    "Abstract": "Many California community colleges are searching for new leadership. This is a result of the current leaders reaching the age of retirement, thus creating many vacancies, even at the presidential level. The California Community College leadership shortage reached crisis proportions, making colleges vulnerable to a collective system of knowledge loss, exposure to potential financial, and organizational instability. If the leadership skills and competencies that define a successful California community college president are not realized, tomorrow’s college presidents may not possess the necessary skills required to move their institutions forward. The purpose of this multiple case qualitative study was to document how existing community college presidents and chancellors in California defined a successful community college president through the identification and exploration of the traits, characteristics, and skills and how each contribute to the long-term success and sustainability of the community college. For this qualitative research proposal, the researcher proposed the case study strategy because the form of the research questions is how no control of behavioral events is required, and the focus was on contemporary as opposed to historical events. Fourteen California community college leaders, presidents, and chancellors were administered an online open-ended questionnaire focusing on ideologies of leadership preparedness, capacities, such as educational skills, interpersonal, and people skills, cultural change, and strategic leadership. From the questionnaire, qualitative content analysis was conducted of the themes emerging from the questions and answers of the college leaders.",

    "Abstract": "Corporations are experiencing significant changes because of the impending Baby Boomers retirements. There are four generations in the workforce today, Traditionalist, Baby Boomers, and Generations X and Y. To effectively address the knowledge management challenges organizations are creating mechanisms to identify, capture, and transfer knowledge to individuals who will be tasked with replacing Baby Boomers, the largest segment of the population. This phenomenological study addressed organizational readiness and loss of knowledge when Baby Boomers retire from the United States based aerospace company. Twenty semi structured face-to-face and telephone interviews were conducted at the United States-based aerospace company. The major findings from this research study identified the need to implement a knowledge transfer program, filling the intermediate gap of security personnel, motivating remaining employees, providing incentives for sharing knowledge, and addressing the obstacles toward knowledge sharing. More important, leaders face the challenge of having skilled and qualified personnel in place before Baby Boomers retire from the organization. In addition, the lack of a robust knowledge transfer program was a finding that requires attention from all leaders, to ensure the company's competitive advantage is not threatened. However, it will be imperative for security leaders to ensure knowledge transfer occurs in the organization once Baby Boomers begin to retire. Knowledge sharing with less experienced personnel is critical to providing security leaders with insight into identifying, capturing, and transferring industrial security knowledge before Baby Boomers retire, thus sustaining the organization's competitive advantage. Future research in the area of information technology is important to building a robust infrastructure to support knowledge management in the security and fire protection organization.

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study which evolved into a collective case study was to gain a deeper understanding of knowledge retention and transfer practices within an information technology (IT) interorganizational community of practice. The study involved analyzing structured interview responses from six trainee, seven leaders and two government leader participants in the Bermuda-based program who had experienced knowledge retention and transfer within the social environment, as well as an analysis of relevant documentation to identify emergent themes. Eight themes identified through the data were learner, role model, relevance, learning environment, communication, opportunity, networking, and modeling. The research revealed many elements in the interorganizational IT community of practice contributed to knowledge retention and transfer, including the environment, differing perspectives of those involved, personal development of participants, the career boost perceived by participants, and the complexity of the IT industry. The findings include suggestions for expanding and strengthening the community of practice through partnerships with educational institutions, IT organizations, and alumni of the program, in addition to program enhancements and the replication of the program in other jurisdictions, which might lead to enhancing the value of participation in the IT interorganizational community of practice to the constituent groups involved.

    "Abstract": "A public health workforce must be trained to react quickly, especially in the case of terrorist attack. Political leaders and emergency management experts have often cited inadequate emergency training as a contributing factor in the public health system's failed preparations for a bioterrorist event. As a result of these failures, billions of dollars have been allocated towards correcting infrastructure deficiencies including training for public health nurses (PHNs), who are critical to a communitywide medical response. This quantitative study used Pearson's correlation and a multivariate regression analysis to evaluate the most effective modality of bioterrorism training (BTT) for PHNs working in rural communities in North Carolina. Using a conceptual framework created by Handler, Issel, and Turnock, this study compared 3 modalities of instruction (MOI) to seek the best predictor of success in retaining learned bioterrorism skills. The research question focused on whether MOI for BTT/all-hazards training courses significantly predicted the degree of retention of emergency knowledge/skills for PHNs working in public health agencies in North Carolina. A multiple choice survey was used to test 103 PHNs' level of knowledge retention on a bioterrorism quiz. The results of this study were ultimately inconclusive in that no MOI was found to be a statistically significant predictor of retention. Factors such as age were found to be successful predictors of knowledge retention. The readiness issues identified in this study have a potential for positive social change if community decision makers use this information to prioritize future funding for public health professionals or enhance communitywide emergency preparedness education programs.

CONTEXT/OBJECTIVE Despite the availability of consensus-based resources, first responders and emergency room (ER) health care professionals (HCPs) have limited knowledge regarding autonomic dysreflexia (AD) recognition and treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of \"The ABCs of AD\" educational seminar for improving HCPs' short- and long-term knowledge of AD recognition, diagnosis, and management.Multi-center prospective pre, post, and follow-up questionnaire study. DESIGN Multi-center prospective pre, post, and follow-up questionnaire study.Level I trauma centers with emergency departments in British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario. SETTING Level I trauma centers with emergency departments in British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario.ER professionals completed measures immediately before and after (n = 108), as well as 3-months following (n = 23), attendance at \"The ABCs of AD\" seminar. METHODS ER professionals completed measures immediately before and after (n = 108), as well as 3-months following (n = 23), attendance at \"The ABCs of AD\" seminar.AD knowledge test; seminar feedback. OUTCOME MEASURES AD knowledge test; seminar feedback.Following the seminar, participants had higher ratings of their AD knowledge and had significantly higher AD knowledge test scores (M ± SD pre = 11.85 ± 3.88, M ± SD post = 18.95 ± 2.39, out of 22; P < 0.001, d = 2.21). Most participants believed the seminar changed their AD knowledge, and rated the seminar information as having the potential to influence and change their practice. AD knowledge test scores significantly decreased between post-seminar and 3-month follow-up (M ± SD 3mo = 17.04 ± 3.28; P = 0.004, d = -0.70); however, 3-month scores remained significantly higher than baseline. RESULTS Following the seminar, participants had higher ratings of their AD knowledge and had significantly higher AD knowledge test scores (M ± SD pre = 11.85 ± 3.88, M ± SD post = 18.95 ± 2.39, out of 22; P < 0.001, d = 2.21).

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of simulation versus lecture-based education among preclinical medical students. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of simulation versus lecture-based education among preclinical medical students.Twenty medical students participated in this randomized, controlled crossover study. Students were randomized to four groups. Each group received two simulations and two lectures covering four different topics. Students were administered a pre-test, post-test and delayed post-test. The mean percentage of questions answered correctly on each test was calculated. The mean of each student's change in score across the three tests was used to compare simulation- versus lecture-based education. METHODS Twenty medical students participated in this randomized, controlled crossover study. Students were randomized to four groups. Each group received two simulations and two lectures covering four different topics. Students were administered a pre-test, post-test and delayed post-test. The mean percentage of questions answered correctly on each test was calculated. The mean of each student's change in score across the three tests was used to compare simulation- versus lecture-based education.Students in both the simulation and lecture groups demonstrated improvement between the pre-test and post-test (p 0.05). When comparing interventions, the change in score between the pre-test and post-test was similar among both the groups (p > 0.05). The change in score between the post-test and delayed post-test was greater in the simulation group (p 0.05). When comparing interventions, the change in score between the pre-test and post-test was similar among both the groups (p > 0.05). The change in score between the post-test and delayed post-test was greater in the simulation group (p < 0.05).High-fidelity simulation may serve as a viable didactic platform for preclinical medical education. Our study demonstrated equivalent immediate knowledge gain and superior long-term knowledge retention in comparison to lectures.

    "Abstract": "Background: The purpose of this study was to use the body painting method to teach hand anatomy to a group of preclinical medical students. Methods: Students reviewed hand anatomy using the traditional method and body painting exercise. Feedback and retention of the anatomy-related information were examined by a questionnaire and multiple-choice questions, respectively, immediately and 1 month after the painting exercise. Results: Students agreed that the exercise was advantageous and helped facilitate self-active learning after in-class anatomy lessons. While there was no significant difference in knowledge retention between the control and experimental groups, the students appreciated the exercise in which they applied body paint to the human body to learn anatomy. Conclusion: The body painting was an efficient tool for aiding the interactive learning of medical students and increasing the understanding of gross anatomy.",

    "Abstract": "Physicians underrecognize and undertreat anaphylaxis. Effective interventions are needed to improve physician knowledge and competency regarding evidence-based anaphylaxis diagnosis and management (ADAM). We designed and evaluated an educational program to improve ADAM in pediatrics, internal medicine, and emergency medicine residents from two academic medical centers. Anonymous questionnaires queried participants' demographics, prior ADAM clinical experience, competency, and comfort. A pretest assessing baseline knowledge preceded a 45-minute allergist-led evidence-based presentation, including practice with epinephrine autoinjectors, immediately followed by a posttest. A follow-up test assessed long-term knowledge retention twelve weeks later. 159 residents participated in the pretest, 152 participated in the posttest, and 86 participated in the follow-up test. There were no significant differences by specialty or site. With a possible score of 10, the mean pretest score (7.31 ± 1.50) was lower than the posttest score (8.79 ± 1.29) and follow-up score (8.17 ± 1.72) (P < 0.001 for both). Although participants' perceived confidence in diagnosing or managing anaphylaxis improved from baseline to follow-up (P < 0.001 for both), participants' self-reported clinical experience with ADAM or autoinjector use was unchanged. Allergist-led face-to-face educational intervention improves residents' short-term knowledge and perceived confidence in ADAM.

    "Abstract": "We present a mind mapping method for evaluating entrepreneurship education. Concepts in students' mind maps are scored against Moore's staged model of entrepreneurship to measure the emphasis of retained knowledge. Scoring entropy and the number of concepts represent the breadth and depth of retained knowledge, respectively. We use this method to compare two cohorts of students enrolled in entrepreneurship courses: one in France and the other in the United States. Mind maps demonstrate significant difference in knowledge depth and emphasis, with French students more focused on the decision to launch a start-up and US students more focused on its implementation.",

    "Abstract": "This study reports on the socio-demographic and locality factors that influence ethnobiological knowledge in three communities of Zapotec indigenous people of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico. It uses local botanical nomenclature as a proxy for general ethnobiological knowledge. In each of these communities (one urban and two rural), 100 adult men were interviewed aided with a field herbarium. Fifty had a background in farming, and 50 worked in the secondary or tertiary sector as their main economic activity, totaling 300 interviews. Using a field herbarium with samples of 30 common and rare wild regional species, we documented visual recognition, knowledge of the local life form, generic and specific names and uses (five knowledge levels measuring knowledge depth). The relationship between sociodemographic variables and knowledge was analyzed with simple correlations. Differences between the three communities and the five knowledge levels were then evaluated with a discriminant analysis. A general linear analysis identified factors and covariables that influenced the observed differences. Differences between the groups with different economic activities were estimated with a t-test for independent samples. Most of the relationships found between sociodemographic variables and plant knowledge were expected: age and rurality were positively related with knowledge and years of formal schooling was negatively related. However, the somewhat less rural site had more traditional knowledge due to local circumstances. The general linear model explained 70-77% of the variation, a high value. It showed that economic activity was by far the most important factor influencing knowledge, by a factor of five. The interaction of locality and economic activity followed. The discriminant analysis assigned interviewees correctly to their localities in 94% of the cases, strengthening the evidence for intracultural variation. Both sociodemographic and historic intracultural differences heavily influence local knowledge.This study reports on the socio-demographic and locality factors that influence ethnobiological knowledge in three communities of Zapotec indigenous people of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico.

    "Abstract": "Medical students have to process a large amount of information during the first years of their study, which has to be retained over long periods of nonuse. Therefore, it would be beneficial when knowledge is gained in a way that promotes long-term retention. Paper-and-pencil drawings for the uptake of form-function relationships of basic tissues has been a teaching tool for a long time, but now seems to be redundant with virtual microscopy on computer-screens and printers everywhere. Several studies claimed that, apart from learning from pictures, actual drawing of images significantly improved knowledge retention. However, these studies applied only immediate post-tests. We investigated the effects of actual drawing of histological images, using randomized cross-over design and different retention periods. The first part of the study concerned esophageal and tracheal epithelium, with 384 medical and biomedical sciences students randomly assigned to either the drawing or the nondrawing group. For the second part of the study, concerning heart muscle cells, students from the previous drawing group were now assigned to the nondrawing group and vice versa. One, four, and six weeks after the experimental intervention, the students were given a free recall test and a questionnaire or drawing exercise, to determine the amount of knowledge retention. The data from this study showed that knowledge retention was significantly improved in the drawing groups compared with the nondrawing groups, even after four or six weeks. This suggests that actual drawing of histological images can be used as a tool to improve long-term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the effect of Team-Based Learning (TBL) on long-term retention of knowledge in comparison to a traditional curriculum. PURPOSE We investigated the effect of Team-Based Learning (TBL) on long-term retention of knowledge in comparison to a traditional curriculum.As TBL was incorporated into our curriculum in the 2008-2009 academic year, students were compared with those who received the traditional curriculum the year prior. Students in both the groups completed multiple-choice knowledge test at four time points spanning two years. Test performance was compared at each time point to assess changes in knowledge retention as a function of time. METHODS As TBL was incorporated into our curriculum in the 2008-2009 academic year, students were compared with those who received the traditional curriculum the year prior. Students in both the groups completed multiple-choice knowledge test at four time points spanning two years. Test performance was compared at each time point to assess changes in knowledge retention as a function of time.Baseline knowledge did not differ significantly between the TBL and control groups [51% versus 46%; t(84) = 0.91, p = 0.37, d = 0.20]. Performance improved after the course for both the groups, but was significantly higher in the TBL group [79% versus 59%; t(84) = 4.96, p = 0.000004, d = 0.95]. However, when assessed prior to the pediatrics clerkship, learning gains from TBL had largely disappeared and the small difference in performance was not significant [57% versus 51%; t(84) = 1.51, p = 0.14, d = 0.32]. RESULTS Baseline knowledge did not differ significantly between the TBL and control groups [51% versus 46%; t(84) = 0.91, p = 0.37, d = 0.20].

Further research should focus on extending the impact of TBL on long-term knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "Physicians underrecognize and undertreat anaphylaxis. Effective interventions are needed to improve physician knowledge and competency regarding evidence-based anaphylaxis diagnosis and management (ADAM). We designed and evaluated an educational program to improve ADAM in pediatrics, internal medicine, and emergency medicine residents from two academic medical centers. Anonymous questionnaires queried participants' demographics, prior ADAM clinical experience, competency, and comfort. A pretest assessing baseline knowledge preceded a 45-minute allergist-led evidence-based presentation, including practice with epinephrine autoinjectors, immediately followed by a posttest. A follow-up test assessed long-term knowledge retention twelve weeks later. 159 residents participated in the pretest, 152 participated in the posttest, and 86 participated in the follow-up test. There were no significant differences by specialty or site. With a possible score of 10, the mean pretest score (7.31 ± 1.50) was lower than the posttest score (8.79 ± 1.29) and follow-up score (8.17 ± 1.72) ( P < 0.001 for both). Although participants' perceived confidence in diagnosing or managing anaphylaxis improved from baseline to follow-up ( P < 0.001 for both), participants' self-reported clinical experience with ADAM or autoinjector use was unchanged. Allergist-led face-to-face educational intervention improves residents' short-term knowledge and perceived confidence in ADAM. Limited clinical experience or reinforcement contributes to the observed decreased knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "Older adults are highly susceptible to the effects of inadequate health literacy (HL). Independently-living elders comprise most of this population, and are at risk for medication misuse. Grounded in integrated HL theory, a pre-experimental, pre- and posttest study was pilot-tested with participants living in an independent-living retirement facility to determine whether a brief, low-HL tailored intervention on common medication management issues could effect immediate changes in the dependent variables of knowledge and self-efficacy (SE). Baseline HL status was evaluated using the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) tool. Nonparametric analyses were utilized to assess relationships due to the small sample size (N=14). Higher SE pre-test scores correlated with higher SE post-test scores ( p = .784,p = .001). Pre-test knowledge scores strongly correlated with baseline HL scores ( p = .646, p = .012). Post-test knowledge scores were significantly higher than pre-test scores for all participants ( M = 8.43, Mdn = 9.00, SD = 1.651 versus M = 3.93, Mdn = 4.00, SD = 1.817; p < .001). Change in knowledge and SE scores were not related to age, educational attainment, or baseline HL status. Likert-type scale assessment of participant satisfaction was not related to baseline HL status. Qualitative satisfaction assessment revealed positive themes four times as often as negative themes. Positive themes centered on the type of content, its utility and comprehensibility. Among negative themes, dislike of the NVS was strong. Results showed the intervention more than doubled knowledge scores in 100% of participants. However, SE scores were not significantly changed, pointing to need for long-term follow-up. Follow-up is also necessary to ascertain knowledge retention for long-term outcome evaluation. While the NVS is cognitively challenging for this sample population, the current study indicates its ability to identify high performers on HL knowledge assessments, lends credence to reports that it discriminates between limited/not limited HL subpopulations, and adds to the knowledge base concerning its use. These results help to elucidate effective practice strategies for improved medication management in geriatric HL interventions, and aid in evaluating HL's role in mediating public health efforts.

    "Abstract": "Medical students have to process a large amount of information during the first years of their study, which has to be retained over long periods of nonuse. Therefore, it would be beneficial when knowledge is gained in a way that promotes long‐term retention. Paper‐and‐pencil drawings for the uptake of form‐function relationships of basic tissues has been a teaching tool for a long time, but now seems to be redundant with virtual microscopy on computer‐screens and printers everywhere. Several studies claimed that, apart from learning from pictures, actual drawing of images significantly improved knowledge retention. However, these studies applied only immediate post‐tests. We investigated the effects of actual drawing of histological images, using randomized cross‐over design and different retention periods. The first part of the study concerned esophageal and tracheal epithelium, with 384 medical and biomedical sciences students randomly assigned to either the drawing or the nondrawing group. For the second part of the study, concerning heart muscle cells, students from the previous drawing group were now assigned to the nondrawing group and vice versa. One, four, and six weeks after the experimental intervention, the students were given a free recall test and a questionnaire or drawing exercise, to determine the amount of knowledge retention. The data from this study showed that knowledge retention was significantly improved in the drawing groups compared with the nondrawing groups, even after four or six weeks. This suggests that actual drawing of histological images can be used as a tool to improve long‐term knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "We examine to what extent market conditions facilitating start-up formation affect firms' R&D investment and profits. We consider a model in which R&D efforts of an incumbent firm generate partly tacit technological know-how embodied in a key R&D employee, who might use it to form a start-up. The availability of complementary assets influences whether new firms are created and determine expected profits for start-up's founders. A large availability of complementary assets has the direct effect that the generation of start-ups is fostered. However, as a strategic effect, the incentives of incumbents to invest in R&D may be reduced because of the increased danger of knowledge loss occurring through start-up formation.

    "Abstract": "Medical students have to process a large amount of information during the first years of their study, which has to be retained over long periods of nonuse. Therefore, it would be beneficial when knowledge is gained in a way that promotes long-term retention. Paper-and-pencil drawings for the uptake of form-function relationships of basic tissues has been a teaching tool for a long time, but now seems to be redundant with virtual microscopy on computer-screens and printers everywhere. Several studies claimed that, apart from learning from pictures, actual drawing of images significantly improved knowledge retention. However, these studies applied only immediate post-tests. We investigated the effects of actual drawing of histological images, using randomized cross-over design and different retention periods. The first part of the study concerned esophageal and tracheal epithelium, with 384 medical and biomedical sciences students randomly assigned to either the drawing or the nondrawing group. For the second part of the study, concerning heart muscle cells, students from the previous drawing group were now assigned to the nondrawing group and vice versa. One, four, and six weeks after the experimental intervention, the students were given a free recall test and a questionnaire or drawing exercise, to determine the amount of knowledge retention. The data from this study showed that knowledge retention was significantly improved in the drawing groups compared with the nondrawing groups, even after four or six weeks. This suggests that actual drawing of histological images can be used as a tool to improve long-term knowledge retention. Anat Sci Educ. © 2015 American Association of Anatomists.",

    "Abstract": "Recent empirical findings concerning the performance effects of service business model innovation (servitization) and its interplay with product innovation are mixed. Using the lenses of the demand-based view on value creation and complementarity, the performance impact of two key service business models is examined: the product-oriented model and the customer-oriented model, implemented jointly with product innovation. Results indicate that the interplay between service business model innovation and product innovation results in long-term performance benefits coupled with a degree of short-term performance sacrifice. Service business model innovation in isolation from product innovation results in short-term profit gains but long-term knowledge loss and, thus, market performance decline. Our study suggests that firms need to look beyond the evidence on short-term effects in order to achieve superior performance in the long run.",
