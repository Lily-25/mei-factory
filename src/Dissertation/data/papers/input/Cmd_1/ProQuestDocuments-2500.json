    "Abstract": "Commercial escape rooms have grown in popularity as an enjoyable experience that also doubles as an exercise in communication and collaboration. Educators can take advantage of these natural qualities to engage and support students in a low-stress learning environment. The primary goal of this study is to share the development and application of an educational escape room as a tool to provide biomedical engineering (BME) students with an immersive and practical experience. A BME laboratory course-specific escape room was developed and beta-tested on an initial group of BME students. The first set of feedback enabled improvements to the design and difficulty of the escape room, which was followed by the final release of the activity for the intended undergraduate BME course. Across an academic year, 74 participants agreed to provide survey feedback for this study. Despite a moderate escape rate (29%), students reported high satisfaction and enthusiasm for the activity. Student survey responses indicated that participants were engaged and empowered to successfully escape even without external motivators. Responses supported the effectiveness of the escape room as a BME learning environment, allowing students to practice and retain course-related knowledge in a challenging but low-risk activity. The foundational structure of escape rooms offers a beneficial environment for experiential knowledge application. We conclude that educational escape rooms show promise as a pedagogical tool in promoting enhanced knowledge retention through immersive, game-based learning.",

    "Abstract": "Aero medicine and first aid training is essential in preparing qualified cabin crew for in-flight medical emergencies. Nonetheless, it has always been regarded as a challenging aspect of cabin crew training. Cabin crew have been facing a more complex situation when conducting their duties onboard due to COVID-19. This study aims to explore the current status of aero medicine and first aid training in China. Using the snowballing technique, 17 participants were recruited for the in-depth semi-structured interview, including cabin crew from 9 airlines in China, first aid instructors from airline training centers, and lecturers from universities. Based on thematic analysis, four themes were extracted: required competencies, factors affecting first aid behaviors, course content and instructional strategies. Findings indicated that most airlines in China emphasized training their cabin crew in aero medicine and first aid. However, some conducted recurrent training once every two years, which was insufficient for skills and knowledge retention. Automated External Defibrillators (AED) were rarely equipped onboard. MedAire was not available for all airlines in China. The results pointed out the shortfalls on aero medicine and first aid aspect in China and can help improve the in-flight first aid facilities and optimize the training programs.",

    "Abstract": "Virtual microscopes are computer or web-based programs that enable users to visualize digital slides and mimic the experience of using a real light microscope. Traditional light microscopes have always been an essential teaching tool in health science education to observe and learn cell and tissue structures. However, studies comparing virtual and real light microscopes in education reported learners' satisfaction with virtual microscopes regarding their usability, image quality, efficiency, and availability. Although the use of virtual or web-based microscopy is increasing, there is no equivalent decrease in the number of schools utilizing traditional microscopes. We conducted a scoping review to investigate the comparative impact of conventional and virtual microscopes on different aspects of learning. We report a relative effect of virtual and light microscopy on student performance, long-term knowledge retention, and satisfaction. Our results show that virtual microscopy is superior to traditional microscopes as a teaching tool in health science education. Further studies are needed on different learning components to guide the best use of virtual microscopy as a sole teaching tool for health care education.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction The integration of technology in pharmacy education has led to significant changes, making it essential to examine its impact on student learning outcomes. With the rise of emerging technologies, such as game-based learning and augmented reality, new pedagogical approaches have been introduced. However, these technologies also bring challenges that necessitate well-thought-out responses from educational institutions, especially considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on learning formats. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with pharmacy students in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, utilizing stratified random sampling for data collection. The study employed a validated questionnaire to gather information on students' use of technology, their preferences, and their perceived learning outcomes. The analysis was carried out using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, version 29) (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY), ensuring adherence to the ethical standards set by the institutional review board. Results The study, involving 508 pharmacy students from Saudi Arabia, revealed that a significant majority regularly use technology in their education, particularly online learning management systems and virtual labs, indicating a shift toward more accessible and efficient learning methods. A notable portion of the students acknowledged the beneficial impact of technology on their learning, with 86.3% reporting improved knowledge retention, 92% noting enhanced skills, and 87.1% observing better academic performance. However, the study also uncovered challenges, with about half of the students facing issues mainly related to distractions while finding technological complexity less problematic. The support from educational institutions in addressing these issues was found to be moderate. These findings underscore the crucial role of technology in enhancing pharmacy education while highlighting the need for more comprehensive institutional support and strategic planning to address the challenges faced by students. Conclusions Technology plays a vital role in the modernization of pharmacy education, significantly aiding in knowledge retention, skill development, and academic performance. Despite the widespread use of technology, the varied experiences and challenges encountered by students underscore the need for increased institutional support and strategic planning. Education must adapt alongside technological advancements to cater to the diverse needs of learners, highlighting the importance of further research into the long-term effects and optimal strategies for technology integration in pharmacy education.",

    "Abstract": "Gamification is an effective teaching tool that improves engagement and knowledge retention. Tabletop role-playing games are dynamic games that use random chance and foster player/leader partnership. To date, there are no teaching tools that mimic dynamic or unpredictable patient presentations. This style of game may work well as a tool for medical education in a simulation-based modality. In this report, we document the rules, materials, and training required to reproduce a hybrid game created to combine facets of simulation and tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) to create a dynamic medical education tool. After testing the game for flaws and fluidity of gameplay, we plan to collect data evaluating emergency medicine residents' enjoyability and knowledge retention. In this article, we describe a novel TRPG simulation hybrid game that we hypothesize will improve learner enjoyability/engagement and have similar educational benefits to standard medical education.",

    "Abstract": "Background Emergency medicine is particularly well suited to simulation training. However, evidence for the efficacy of simulation-based medical training remains limited especially to manage high-risk cases such as acute asthma. Objective The objective of our study was to compare the performance of high-fidelity simulation (HFS) and interactive video-case challenge-based training (IVC) for final-year medical students in the management of acute asthma. Methods This was a prospective randomized controlled study conducted at the emergency department (ED) of Monastir University hospital ( Tunisia). 69 final-year medical students were randomized to HFS ( n  = 34) and IVC ( n  = 35) training on acute asthma topic. The study was conducted over a 1-week period. Efficacy of each teaching method was compared through the use of multiple-choice questionnaires (MCQ) before (pre-test), after (post-test) training and a simulation scenario test conducted 1 week later. The scenario was based on acute asthma management graded on predefined critical actions using two scores: the checklist clinical score (range 0 to 30), and the team skills score (range 0 to 16). Student satisfaction was also evaluated with the Likert 5 points scale. Two years after the post-test, both groups underwent a third MCQ testing to assess sustainability of knowledge. Results There were no differences in age between groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the HFS and IVC groups pre-test scores ( p  = 0.07). Both groups demonstrated improvement in MCQ post-test from baseline after training session; the HFS MCQ post-test score increased significantly more than the IVC score ( p  < 0.001). The HFS group performed better than the IVC group on the acute asthma simulation scenario ( p  < 0.001). Mean checklist clinical score and mean team skills score were significantly higher in HFS group compared to IVC group (respectively 22.9 ± 4.8 and 11.5 ± 2.5 in HFS group vs 19.1 ± 3 and 8.4 ± 3.1 in IVC group) ( p  < 0.001). After 2 years, MCQ post-test scores decreased in both groups but the decrease was lower in HFS group compared to the IVC group. Conclusion High-fidelity simulation-based training was superior to interactive video-case challenge for teaching final year medical students,and led to more long-term knowledge retention in the management of simulated acute asthma patients. Trial registration The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02776358 on 18/05/2016.",

    "Abstract": "Assessment and feedback are common sources of student dissatisfaction within higher education, and employers have shown dissatisfaction with graduates' communication skills. Authentic assessment, containing 'real-world' context and student collaboration, provides a means to address both issues simultaneously. We discuss how we used authentic assessment within a biological sciences degree programme, replacing an individually written essay coursework assignment with learner-generated podcasts. We outline our implementation strategy in line with existing theory on learner-generated digital media, assessment for learning and self-regulated learning. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of survey data (2020 and 2021) indicate students prefer podcast assignments over traditional essay coursework, perceiving them to be more enjoyable, authentic, allowing for greater creativity, and better for building their confidence as communicators. Podcasting as an assessment may have a positive influence on knowledge retention and promote deep learning too. Our assessment design provides opportunities for community building, formative peer review and enhancing assessment literacy, while also being flexible enough to be used across any discipline of study and/or as an inter-disciplinary assessment.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Pain management is a crucial aspect of patients' perioperative journey and a fundamental duty of every anesthetist. Throughout anesthesia training, there is an emphasis on the management of critical incidents, several of which surround pain management. With changes to the anesthesia curriculum over recent years, variable exposure to training opportunities, and a reduction in clinical hours during training, many trainees report feeling underprepared for their future roles as consultants. However, pain management remains a small fragment of the core anesthesia curriculum with no pain-focused simulation courses currently available across the UK. Simulation has proven to aid learning transfer in complicated and stressful scenarios with a substantial improvement in knowledge retention and prevention of skill loss while eliminating the risk of harm to patients. Aim A novel perioperative pain management simulation course was designed and implemented in the East of England to equip junior anesthesia trainees with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage perioperative pain and the associated critical incidents. Methods A multidisciplinary team (MDT) was involved in the course design. The faculty consisted of anesthesia consultants, trainees, pain nurses, and simulation technicians. The course ran twice over a six-month period both locally and regionally. A blended learning approach was adopted where 17 trainees attended PowerPoint presentations providing an overview of basic pain theories, perioperative pain management, regional anesthesia, and labor analgesia. Trainees then underwent telecasted simulation training using replicated patient notes, imaging, blood gas analysis, and a high-fidelity SimMan®. A debriefing period followed each scenario using Pendleton's model. An anonymized questionnaire was completed by all trainees before and after the course to assess improvement in their knowledge and confidence levels across four domains covering the management of perioperative pain. Results All 17 trainees completed the questionnaire; therefore, the entire dataset was analyzed. The pre-course questionnaire showed that using a scale of zero to 10, the vast majority of trainees reported low levels of confidence (<6/10) in the management of chronic pain during the perioperative period (82%), intraoperative pain management (76%), regional anesthesia (88%), and labor analgesia (65%). Following the simulation training, the results showed an overwhelmingly positive improvement in all 17 trainees’ knowledge and confidence across all four tested domains. All 17 trainees (100%) also showed an improvement in their understanding of local pain protocols. The subjective feedback was positive, highlighting the overall usefulness of the course and that the tailored complexity of each simulation scenario was appropriate to each candidate's prior level of experience. Trainees also reported feeling more confident in starting their anesthesia on-calls. Conclusion This novel simulation course is the first of its kind in pain management. It has shown great improvements in trainee confidence in managing perioperative pain and the associated critical incidents. Subjective feedback has also been positively reassuring. Its inclusion into the East of England anesthesia training program and national training curriculum would greatly enhance trainee’s knowledge and experience in pain management in the perioperative setting.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Lack of consistency in primary care residency training exists in transitions of care (TOC) of adolescents from pediatric to adult medicine, which can lead to conflicting or incomplete training. To fill this gap, we developed a curriculum based on the Got Transition Six Core Elements and piloted it at two bicoastal, academic Medicine-Pediatrics (Med-Peds) residency programs. Objectives: The goals of this project are to increase resident TOC knowledge, increase transition discussion comfort and skills, and obtain feedback for curriculum improvement. Methods: Two educational sessions were held at both institutions between 2020-2021. Of 32 potential resident participants, 26 participated in session one and 22 participated in session two. Sessions included a didactic presentation, small group activities, and a guest speaker discussing transitional experience. Electronic pre-session, post-session, and retention surveys evaluated resident knowledge, comfort, and self-reported skills of TOC. A Hybrid Type II design was used with mixed methods to evaluate curriculum effectiveness and implementation. Results: The first and second sessions had 81% and 68% attendance, respectively. Eighty-four percent completed the pre-session survey, 65% completed the post-session survey, and 68% completed the retention survey. TOC knowledge increased by 19% overall (p<0.001). First-year residents gained the most knowledge and implementation skills. Residents participating in alternating medicine and pediatric clinics gained more knowledge than those in a combined Med-Peds clinic (p=0.001). Comfort increased for both initiating and continuing TOC discussions after the first session. Knowledge retention was not statistically significant. Conclusion: A standardized TOC curriculum can improve resident knowledge and is easily implemented at multiple institutions. Early-in-training residents and those in alternating medicine and pediatric clinics particularly benefit.",

    "Abstract": "Background Three-dimensional-printed anatomical models (3DPAMs) appear to be a relevant tool due to their educational value and their feasibility. The objectives of this review were to describe and analyse the methods utilised for creating 3DPAMs used in teaching human anatomy and for evaluating its pedagogical contribution. Methods An electronic search was conducted on PubMed using the following terms: education, school, learning, teaching, learn, teach, educational, three-dimensional, 3D, 3-dimensional, printing, printed, print, anatomy, anatomical, anatomically, and anatomic. Data retrieved included study characteristics, model design, morphological evaluation, educational performance, advantages, and disadvantages. Results Of the 68 articles selected, the cephalic region was the most studied (33 articles); 51 articles mentioned bone printing. In 47 articles, the 3DPAM was designed from CT scans. Five printing processes were listed. Plastic and its derivatives were used in 48 studies. The cost per design ranged from 1.25 USD to 2800 USD. Thirty-seven studies compared 3DPAM to a reference model. Thirty-three articles investigated educational performance. The main advantages were visual and haptic qualities, effectiveness for teaching, reproducibility, customizability and manipulability, time savings, integration of functional anatomy, better mental rotation ability, knowledge retention, and educator/student satisfaction. The main disadvantages were related to the design: consistency, lack of detail or transparency, overly bright colours, long printing time, and high cost. Conclusion This systematic review demonstrates that 3DPAMs are feasible at a low cost and effective for teaching anatomy. More realistic models require access to more expensive 3D printing technologies and substantially longer design time, which would greatly increase the overall cost. Choosing an appropriate image acquisition modality is key. From a pedagogical viewpoint, 3DPAMs are effective tools for teaching anatomy, positively impacting the learning outcomes and satisfaction level. The pedagogical effectiveness of 3DPAMs seems to be best when they reproduce complex anatomical areas, and they are used by students early in their medical studies.",

    "Abstract": "Background While serious games seem to be supportive in healthcare education, none of them had been designed to develop competence in diagnosis and treatment planning of oral lesions. Therefore, this research aimed to develop an online simulation-based serious game for training diagnosis and treatment planning of oral lesions (SimOL) and to evaluate its educational impact in terms of knowledge improvement and retention. Methods As a mandatory task in an oral lesion course, all 28 students were required to participate in SimOL activities. Participants were instructed to complete a pre-knowledge assessment following a one-week washout period prior to the game activity. Subsequent to the game completion, they were tasked to complete a post-knowledge assessment I (Full score = 15) and satisfaction questionnaire. A post-knowledge assessment II was administered a week later to evaluate knowledge retention. Results The findings demonstrated a significant increase in the assessment scores after interacting with the game ( P    0.05). Additionally, students perceived the game as positively in all aspects, although the entertainment aspect achieved a slightly lower score of 3.70 (SD = 0.21), in comparison to the usefulness and ease of use with a score of 4.02 (SD = 0.11) and 4.02 (SD = 0.16), respectively. Conclusion SimOL demonstrated its potential as an effective learning tool for improving and retaining knowledge for diagnosis and treatment planning of oral lesions. The game was perceived positively by dental students in all aspects, however further improvements should prioritize the enhancement of entertaining components.",

    "Abstract": "While the innovativeness of the flipped classroom (FC) approach promotes active participation and higher-order thinking among students, there are concerns about its effectiveness in terms of knowledge retention. Currently, there are no studies involving medical school biochemistry that evaluate this aspect of effectiveness. Thus, we conducted a historical control study that analyzed observational data from two freshman batches of the Doctor of Medicine program in our institution. Class 2021 (n = 250) served as the traditional lecture (TL) group while Class 2022 (n = 264) served as the FC group. Data on relevant observed covariates (age, sex, National Medical Admission Test or NMAT score, undergraduate degree) and the outcome variable (carbohydrate metabolism course unit examination percentage scores, as indicator of knowledge retention) were included in the analysis. Propensity scores were calculated using logit regression conditional on these observed covariates. Afterwards, 1:1 nearest-neighbor propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to produce an estimated average treatment effect (ATE) measure afforded by FC (as adjusted mean difference in examination scores between the two batches), balancing on the covariates. Nearest-neighbor matching using the calculated propensity scores effectively balanced the two groups (standardized bias <10%), producing 250 matched student-pairs that received either TL or FC. Following PSM, the FC group was found to have a significantly higher adjusted mean examination score compared to the TL group (adjusted mean difference = 5.62%, 95% CI: 2.54%, 8.72%; p < 0.001). Using this approach, we were able to demonstrate benefit of FC over TL in terms of knowledge retention, as reflected by the estimated ATE.",

    "Abstract": "Collaborative testing has been demonstrated the ability to improve students' performance, enhance students' learning, and aid in knowledge retention in many different courses. However, this examination mode lacks the process of teacher feedback. Herein, a short teacher feedback from was added immediately after the collaborative testing to improve the students' performance. A parasitology class of 121 undergraduates was randomized into two groups: \"group A\" and \"group B.\" Collaborative testing was carried out at the end of theoretical teaching. During the test, students would first answer questions as individuals for 20 minutes. Then, students from \"group A\" answered the same questions in groups (5 students in each group) for 20 minutes, while the group-testing duration was only 15 minutes in \"group B.\" Immediately after the group testing, teachers conducted a 5-minute feedback about the morphology identification according to the analysis of the answers by \"group B.\" Four weeks later, a final test was conducted in an individual test. The total scores and scores for each examination content were analyzed. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the final exam scores between both groups (t = -1.278, P = 0.204). However, the morphological and diagnostic test results of the final examination in group B were significantly higher than those of the midterm examination, while there was no significant change in \"group A\" (t = 4.333, P = 0.051). The results confirmed that the teacher feedback after the collaborative testing can effectively make up for the students' knowledge gaps.",

    "Abstract": "The field of language education has experienced a rise in using virtual reality (VR) to support interactive, contextualized, and collaborative language learning in recent years. The current study investigates the effects of auditory, visual, and textual input on speaking and writing in English for Tourism Purposes (ETP) through immersive, scenery-based virtual reality (SBVR) dyadic learning. Adopting a framework on ETP sociocultural, linguistic, and formulaic competence, the researchers designed relevant learning content using audios, images, and verbatim onscreen text on \"EduVenture VR\" to create an interactive, simulated tour. Thirty-eight English as a foreign language undergraduates participated in this single-group quasi-experiment. Various data sources included speaking and writing pre-, post- and delayed post-tests, a post-intervention survey, and reflections about the VR learning experience. The study reported significant speaking gains in language accuracy, destination promotion, knowledge retention, and replication of ETP language, as well as significant writing improvement in using sophisticated vocabulary, knowledge retention, and replication of ETP language. The study concludes that SBVR warrants positive impact on improving productive ETP skills. Possible factors, limitations, and pedagogical implications for using scenery-based VR in dyadic learning for ETP are discussed. Finally, the study suggests future research directions to combine technology-enhanced language learning theories with multimodal input and material design supported by immersive VR to enhance language production for specific purposes.",

    "Abstract": "Anatomy is physiotherapy's foundation. However, undergraduate classroom learning and knowledge acquisition-retention remain questionable. This study explored the possibility of improving this learning experience and evaluates the gross anatomy of abdomen and pelvis short-term knowledge retention among first-year physiotherapy students in Malta. The online Kahoot! game-based quiz platform was used through an instructor-designed best-of-four multiple-choice questions. Correctly answered questions and Kahoot! scores generated by the platform were utilized to measure knowledge retention. Kahoot! sessions 1 and 3 shared similar attendance and response rate and were compared together. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare Kahoot! scores and Chi test for trend to compare correctly answered questions. Students' perceived learning experiences before and after the introduction of the Kahoot quizzes were gathered through Likert scores and analyzed using McNamar's chi-square test. Overall, a significantly increased trend in correctly answered questions (X[subscript 2]: 23.38, p-value: <0.001) across the Kahoot! sessions were evident. Four questions out of 12 exhibited significant Kahoot! scores differences. Students reported better learning experiences following the initiation of Kahoot! (X[subscript 2]: 5.1, p-value: 0.02). Indeed, all students agreed that the use of the interactive quiz improved their anatomy short term knowledge retention. Introducing an online interactive quiz as part of the lecture program may be useful to improve the learning experience and anatomy knowledge retention among physiotherapy students.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The opioid epidemic is an increasingly severe problem affecting public health and leading to significant economic burdens on healthcare systems. Overdose reversal training and de-stigmatization efforts are common strategies used to combat this epidemic. Nevertheless, healthcare professionals report a lack of confidence in administering naloxone and high stigmatization levels toward people with opioid use disorder (OUD). While one-time educational training reduces stigma and improves naloxone administration confidence, we previously demonstrated that knowledge retention at a three-month follow-up is reduced among a cohort of medical students. This study aimed to improve the effectiveness of opioid overdose awareness and reversal training (OOART) with a three-month follow-up abbreviated OOART (aOOART) booster video. Methods: Voluntary OOART was offered to first-year medical students (M1) at the Drexel University College of Medicine in 2022. At this training, 82 students completed a pre-training survey to establish a baseline knowledge and attitude toward people with OUD and their familiarity with the steps to reverse an opioid overdose. Following the hour-long training, 64 of 82 (79%) participants completed the post-training survey to measure the immediate retention of training information. After 2.5 months, students were randomly selected to receive a 6.5-minute aOOART booster video or serve as an unboosted control. Students in the booster and non-booster cohorts then completed a three-month follow-up survey. Results: Students who received the aOOART booster had significantly increased opioid reversal knowledge scores compared to non-boosted control students at the three-month follow-up. The aOOART booster resulted in a retention of the lowered stigma, and participants expressed a higher willingness to respond to an opioid overdose compared to participants who did not receive the booster video at the three-month follow-up. Conclusions: This study shows that an aOOART booster method improves knowledge retention following initial OOART. Further, the aOOART booster video served to maintain participants’ reduced stigma toward people with OUD and maintained participants’ willingness to respond to an opioid overdose. These results support the incorporation of an abbreviated, periodic OOART reinforcement video into opioid overdose response training nationwide. We believe this “booster video” approach is a novel and effective method to improve healthcare professionals’ and medical student preparedness to render appropriate care to people with OUD.",

    "Abstract": "Background Neonatal resuscitation training in a simulated delivery room environment is a new paradigm in pediatric medical education. The purpose of this research is to highlight team-based simulation as an effective method of teaching neonatal resuscitation to senior pediatric residents. Methods In an intervention educational study, we evaluated the impact of team-based simulation training in the development of neonatal resuscitation. A team consisting of a three-person group of senior pediatric residents performed neonatal resuscitation on a low-fidelity newborn simulator based on the stated scenario. Video-based structured debriefing was performed and followed by the second cycle of scenario and debriefing to evaluate the feasibility of conducting team-based simulation training in a lesser-resourced environment. Evaluation criteria included megacode scores which is a simulation performance checklist, pre-and post-test scores to evaluate residents’ knowledge and confidence, the survey checklist as a previously developed questionnaire assessing residents’ satisfaction, and debriefing from live and videotaped performances. Four months after the end of the training course, we measured the behavioral changes of the residents by conducting an OSCE test to evaluate post-training knowledge retention. Mean ± SD was calculated for megacode, satisfaction (survey checklist), and OSCE scores. Pre- and post-program gains were statistically compared. The first three levels of Kirkpatrick’s training effectiveness model were used to evaluate the progress of the program. Results Twenty-one senior residents participated in the team-based simulation. The mean ± SD of the megacode score was 35.6 ± 2.2. The mean ± SD of the overall satisfaction score for the evaluation of the first level of the Kirkpatrick model was 96.3 ± 3.7. For the evaluation of the second level of the Kirkpatrick model, the pre-posttest gain in overall confidence score had a statistically significant difference (P = 0.001). All residents obtained a passing grade in OSCE as an evaluation of the third level. Conclusions Team-based simulation training in neonatal resuscitation improves the knowledge, skills, and performance of pediatric residents and has a positive effect on their self-confidence and leadership skills. There is still a need to investigate the transfer of learning and abilities to real-life practice, and further research on cost-effectiveness and impact on patient outcomes is warranted.",

    "Abstract": "Making the simulated patient die is one of the controversial decisions in healthcare simulation. Some experts believe that we should never make the manikin die as they believe the facilitator is deceiving the learners, whereas other groups of experts believe that there are advantages in making the simulated patient die as it provides a valuable learning experience to the learners, and it is as close to reality as possible. Hence, we undertook this review to know whether simulated patient mortality benefits the learners. A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, Scopus, PubMed Central, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar. Randomized controlled trials assessing the learner’s stress and knowledge retention when the simulated patient dies were eligible for inclusion. Comparative intervention effect estimates obtained from meta-analyses were represented as pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% CI. Six studies with 384 participants (learners) were eligible for the analysis. All the studies had some concerns when the risk of bias was assessed. In the simulated patient mortality group, the learners experienced higher stress as assessed compared to the group where the simulated patient survives. The two groups' pooled mean difference for anxiety and stress levels was 0.63 (0.17-1.09). Three out of five studies showed improved knowledge retention in the simulated mortality group, one showed no difference, and one showed decreased knowledge retention in the simulated mortality group. The stress response of learners when exposed to simulated mortality during a simulation session is higher than the simulated survival group. However, this increased stress response is processed by the students differently. Some students will thrive when increased stress is presented to them, while some students perceive it negatively. Thus, this increased stress response can lead to knowledge retention if the timing of the stress response happens mainly during debriefing for select students. The role of the facilitator is also important as skilled debriefers will be able to use this increased stress to their advantage to increase knowledge retention. Thus, simulated mortality can be used as an effective stressor for increasing knowledge retention during the debriefing phase for select students by a skilled debriefer. This study would aid the simulation policymakers, simulation faculties, and simulation researchers in the impact of simulated patient death and learners’ stress response. If the simulation scenario is designed well with robust pre-briefing, this increased stress response can enhance learning and knowledge retention during debriefing.",

    "Abstract": "Background Despite the proven effectiveness of simulation-based learning activities, its adoption in medical education remains limited, and the influence of simulation on student motivation, particularly subjective task values, is seldom explored. This study aimed to investigate the impact of a simulation-based learning activity on student learning and subjective task values in a medical morphology-related course of Human Parasitology. Methods A quasi-experimental study was conducted with 113 Chinese undergraduate medical students who participated in a Human Parasitology course during April to May 2022. Students were divided into two groups: Simulation Group (n = 55), where students used the simulation, and Lecture Group (n = 58), where students attended an online lecture. Students’ learning was measured prior to the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and three weeks later to assess knowledge retention. The subjective task values questionnaire was administered before and after the interventions. Data were analyzed using one-way ANCOVA and MANOVA. Results Students in the Simulation Group exhibited significantly higher knowledge gain compared to the Lecture Group [ F (1,110) = 23.69, p  < 0.01]. Additionally, the Simulation Group retained knowledge significantly better than the Lecture Group [ F (1,101) = 10.05, p  < 0.005]. Furthermore, students in the Simulation Group experienced a significant increase in subjective task values after the intervention [ F (3, 52) = 3.57, p  < 0.05, η p 2  = 0.17], while students in the Lecture Group reported a significant decrease in subjective task values [ F (3, 55) = 2.96, p  < 0.05, η p 2  = 0.14]. Conclusions Simulation-based learning not only leads to superior learning but also enhances students’ subjective task values. These findings offer valuable insights into designing effective simulation-based learning experiences in medical education and have significant practical implications for educators and medical professionals.",

    "Abstract": "The recent explosion of technological innovations in mobile technology, virtual reality (VR), digital dissection, online learning platform, 3D printing, and augmented reality (AR) has provided new avenues for improving preclinical education, particularly in anatomy and histology education. Anatomy and histology are fundamental components of medical education that teach students the essential knowledge of human body structure and organization. However, these subjects are widely considered to be some of the most difficult disciplines for healthcare students. Students often face challenges in areas such as the complexity and overwhelming volume of knowledge, difficulties in visualizing body structures, navigating and identifying tissue specimens, limited exposure to learning materials, and lack of clinical relevance. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the situation by reducing face-to-face teaching opportunities and affecting the availability of body donations for medical education.To overcome these challenges, educators have integrated various educational technologies, such as virtual reality, digital 3D anatomy apps, 3D printing, and AI chatbots, into preclinical education. These technologies have effectively improved students' learning experiences and knowledge retention. However, the integration of technologies into preclinical education requires appropriate pedagogical approaches and logistics to align with educational theories and achieve the intended learning outcomes.The chapter provides practical guidance and examples for integrating technologies into anatomy, histology, and biochemistry preclinical education. The author emphasizes that every technology has its own benefits and limitations and is best suited to specific learning scenarios. Therefore, it is recommended that educators and students should utilize multiple modalities for teaching and learning to achieve the best outcomes. The chapter also acknowledges that cadaver-based anatomy education is essential and proposes that educational technologies can serve as a crucial complement for promoting active learning, problem solving, knowledge application, and enhancing conventional cadaver-based education.The recent explosion of technological innovations in mobile technology, virtual reality (VR), digital dissection, online learning platform, 3D printing, and augmented reality (AR) has provided new avenues for improving preclinical education, particularly in anatomy and histology education.

    "Abstract": "Introduction Traditional medical school curricula rely on textbook-based learning during the first two years, often limiting students' clinical exposure. Simulation-based learning (SBL) provides an opportunity for students to gain clinical exposure and competency with common procedures as well as to gain knowledge related to common clinical topics. Retention of factual knowledge is a current topic of discussion as medical learners often have difficulty with long-term retention. The aim of this study was to assess if students would learn, retain, and enjoy emergency medicine (EM)-focused SBL. Materials and methods We developed an EM-focused SBL curriculum consisting of four main educational events: suturing, medical stabilization, mass casualty triage, and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Participants were first- and second-year healthcare students enrolled in a traditional, preclinical curriculum, who completed pre- and post-event quizzes consisting of multiple-choice questions on topics covered during the SBL scenario. We compared pre- and post-event quiz scores using a one-way paired t-test. Quizzes were readministered up to 100 days after each SBL event to test knowledge retention, and scores were compared across time by repeated-measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA). Results For suture (n=22), mass casualty (n=20), and ultrasound simulations (n=17), post-event mean quiz scores increased significantly in comparison to mean quiz scores from before the event (p≤0.05). Medical stabilization simulation post-event scores were increased but did not reach statistical significance. Data collected at 45, 74, and 94 days following the suture lab as well as 29 and 49 days after the medical evacuation event, and 20 days after the mass casualty event showed no statistical decrease in quiz means suggesting retention of knowledge among learners. Subjective assessments of participant satisfaction demonstrated an enjoyment of the events. Discussion EM-focused SBL events offered enjoyable learning opportunities for students to effectively obtain and possibly retain clinical knowledge. Conclusion SBL has the potential to improve student retention of clinical knowledge during the preclinical years and, therefore, should be further explored and implemented as a core pillar of medical education as opposed to its current state as a learning adjunct.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose. This quality improvement project aimed to improve the knowledge, retention of information, and to increase the satisfaction of education delivery to frontline staff in a large acute care hospital system by using staff Registered Nurse Unit Education Champions (RN UECs) to deliver biweekly education. Background. Current processes for healthcare clinicians to obtain information and education needed for daily practices are not adequate to keep up with the rapidly expanding growth in knowledge. For RNs working in acute care hospitals, this often means that knowledge gaps continue to broaden and may affect the quality-of-care patients receive, especially those with complex medical problems. It is suggested that when there are opportunities to integrate learned information into practice, nurses' critical thinking and clinical judgment develop quickly. The RN UEC model explores the ability to improve the knowledge and retention of information of nurses by receiving education while they are on shift which allows them to integrate their new knowledge immediately.Methods. The pilot used the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) approach and implemented the RN UEC model in four nursing units with similar patient populations. The education was delivered after a pretest survey was given to establish baseline knowledge of the topic and to evaluate their satisfaction with the current education delivery method. Two posttest surveys were given, one immediately after the education was delivered and the other one to four weeks after the education was completed. These posttest surveys contained the same questions.Results. There was an immediate improvement in knowledge after the delivery of education and while there was a decline in the long-term retention of the information, there continued to be an overall improvement of knowledge from baseline. Additionally, there was improved satisfaction from the frontline staff with the RN UEC model for education delivery.Conclusion. It has been established through this project that the use of the RN UEC model is an effective way to deliver education for the improvement of knowledge and retention of information in a highly satisfying way for the frontline nursing staff.

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between take-home (open-book) examinations (THE) and in-class (closed-book) examinations (ICE) on academic performance and student wellbeing. Two social science courses (one bachelor and one master) were included in the study. In the first cohort (2019), students from both courses performed an ICE, whereas students in the second cohort (2020) performed a THE. Four to six months following course completion, students were approached to fill out a survey pertaining to their academic performance and wellbeing during the course, and to complete a test measuring knowledge retention on the course materials. No significant differences were found between the ICE and THE cohorts in academic performance and knowledge retention for either the bachelor or the master students. Bachelor students who completed a THE in 2020 reported significantly lower wellbeing in comparison to their peers completing the ICE a year earlier. The implications of the results in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "The COVID-19 outbreak has created turbulence and uncertainty into multiple aspects of life in countries around the world. In China, the pandemic continues to pose a great challenge to the nature of traditional in-class education in schools. Chinese education has faced the difficult decision of whether to resume in-person teaching in an unprecedented and time-pressured manner. To ensure the quality of teaching and learning during this time, this study aims to explore the effectiveness of an \"online + in-person\" hybrid teaching model with a new three-part approach to the hybrid teaching lab, where students prepare for the in-person lab using virtual simulated experiments and learning modules and debrief their learning afterwards online as well. This approach not only enhances the efficiency during the in-person lab but also strongly reinforces concepts and laboratory skills by providing a \"practice run\" before physically attending the lab. A total of 400 medical undergraduates from Dalian Medical University in China were recruited for this study. In an undergraduate molecular biology laboratory course, we observed 200 students in a hybrid teaching model. We evaluated the learning outcomes from the \"online + in-person\" hybrid teaching model with a questionnaire survey and assessed the quality of experiment execution, report writing, and group collaboration. Moreover, the 200 students from the hybrid group were evaluated during an annual science competition at the university and compared to 200 students from the competition cohort who had no experience with a hybrid learning model. The comparison data were analyzed using a student's t-test statistical analysis. The students in the hybrid learning group demonstrated a strong enthusiasm for the model, high amount of time utilizing the online system, and high scores on laboratory evaluation assignments. Approximately 98% of the hybrid learning students reported that they preferred mixed teaching to the traditional teaching mode, and all students scored above 96% on the online laboratory report. Teachers of the course observed that the hybrid group had a noticeably higher level of proficiency in lab skills compared to the previous students. At the Dalian Medical University annual science competition, where we compared our hybrid group to a traditional learning group, scores for both the objective and subjective items showed that the students instructed with the hybrid lab model had superior performance (p < 0.05). In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a new three-part molecular biology laboratory course that strongly improved students' laboratory skills, knowledge retention, and enthusiasm for the course using online learning to improve their learning efficiency and expedite the in-person laboratory experience. We found that these students performed at a higher level in a combined theoretical/practical science competition compared to the students in traditional in-person lab courses. Additionally, our model subjectively fostered enthusiasm and excellence in both teachers and students. Further, cultivation of the students' independent learning and creative problem solving skills were emphasized. The exploration of an effective teaching model, such as the one described here, not only provides students with a solid foundation for their future medical studies and career development but also promotes more efficient in-person laboratory time.",

    "Abstract": "Semantic Variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA) has often been considered as a loss of knowledge stored in semantic memory, but might also be due to a general disruption of mechanisms allowing the acquisition, storage, and retrieval of semantic memories. In order to assess any parallelism in svPPA patients between loss of semantic knowledge and inability to acquire new semantic information, we administered a battery of semantic learning tasks to healthy individuals and svPPA patients, where they were requested to learn new conceptual representations and new word forms, and to associate the former with the latter. A strong relation was found between loss of semantic knowledge and disruption of semantic learning: (a) patients with severe svPPA had the lowest scores in the semantic learning tasks; (b) significant correlations were found between scores obtained in semantic learning tasks and scores obtained in semantic memory disorders in svPPA patients.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Accidents involving sports or leisure activities, falls, blows from objects, acts of interpersonal violence, and accidents can all result in dental trauma (also known as traumatic dental injuries [TDIs]). School children are one of the population groups that are highly vulnerable to TDIs. Multiple school-based interventions have been conducted around the world on the prevention and management of TDIs; however, no known scoping review has been conducted to map the evidence. Hence, this study aimed to conduct a scoping review of existing school-based interventions on TDIs. Methods: This scoping review adopted the research design presented by Arksey and O’Malley. Eight research databases—PubMed, SCOPUS, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL Ultimate, AMED (The Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), Child Development & Adolescent Studies, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and SPORTDiscuss—were searched to retrieve literature relevant to the scoping review question. Some of the retrieved literature existed in duplicate and was deduplicated using Rayyan software. Twenty papers that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected and reviewed. Results: A total of 526 publications were retrieved from the eight databases searched in this scoping review. Ninety-seven publications were duplicates and were removed. After the two-stage screening of the deduplicated copies, only 20 peer-reviewed journal articles were relevant and included in the review. The selected studies sampled a total of 7152 participants whose ages ranged between 9 and 62 years (mean = 10.56 to 46.5; standard deviation = ±0.97 to ±8.1). The findings obtained from the reviewed journal articles revealed that pupils are at high risk of dental trauma and they are more likely to sustain these injuries during school activities. In addition, inadequate understanding, poor attitudes, and low experiential knowledge of dental trauma were found among educators, parents, and even school pupils. The evidence of long-term knowledge retention and a high knowledge score in the experimental groups buttresses the need for continuous first-aid education on dental trauma. Conclusions: The application of multiple educational approaches or modalities in schools will reinforce and promote good first-aid skills and management practices that are essential for preserving traumatized teeth.",

    "Abstract": "Instructional methods that offer students' opportunity for engagement are essential to develop an active learning environment. This paper aims (1) to assess whether the use of an Audience Response System (ARS) during anatomy and physiology lectures improves students' engagement, knowledge retention and academic achievement and (2) to evaluate the feasibility of introducing ARS as a formative tool from both instructors' and students' perspectives. Purpose Instructional methods that offer students' opportunity for engagement are essential to develop an active learning environment. This paper aims (1) to assess whether the use of an Audience Response System (ARS) during anatomy and physiology lectures improves students' engagement, knowledge retention and academic achievement and (2) to evaluate the feasibility of introducing ARS as a formative tool from both instructors' and students' perspectives.This quasi-experimental study was conducted across ten lectures for the second-year Pre-Applied Medical Science (PAMS) and Pre-Medical (PMED) students at the College of Sciences and Health Professions, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The ARS was integrated into five lectures, whereas the remaining were conducted without ARS. A comparison of the immediate post-lecture and prior laboratory session quiz scores between the lectures with and without ARS was performed using an independent sample t -test. An online survey was completed by the students as well as informal feedback was taken from the instructors to assess ARS usefulness. Materials and Methods This quasi-experimental study was conducted across ten lectures for the second-year Pre-Applied Medical Science (PAMS) and Pre-Medical (PMED) students at the College of Sciences and Health Professions, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The ARS was integrated into five lectures, whereas the remaining were conducted without ARS. A comparison of the immediate post-lecture and prior laboratory session quiz scores between the lectures with and without ARS was performed using an independent sample t-test. An online survey was completed by the students as well as informal feedback was taken from the instructors to assess ARS usefulness.A total of 65 PMAS and 126 PMED students participated in the study. Students achieved significantly better scores for ARS lectures than non-ARS lectures: PAMS ( p 0.038) and PMED ( p 0.018). Students and instructors agreed that ARS was easy to use, allowing students to engage and actively participate in the teaching process by responding to questions and receiving instant and anonymous feedback about their learning progress. Results A total of 65 PMAS and 126 PMED students participated in the study. Students achieved significantly better scores for ARS lectures than non-ARS lectures: PAMS (p 0.038) and PMED (p 0.018). Students and instructors agreed that ARS was easy to use, allowing students to engage and actively participate in the teaching process by responding to questions and receiving instant and anonymous feedback about their learning progress.Employing suitable interactive teaching methods facilitates students' learning and improves their retention of knowledge. Students and instructors positively view the ARS strategy as a means to promote learning in a traditional lecture setting. Increased practice on how to integrate its use into classrooms could lead to further utilization. Conclusion Employing suitable interactive teaching methods facilitates students' learning and improves their retention of knowledge.

    "Abstract": "Studies on human anatomy mainly depend on cadaver dissection. New technology devices have progressed to improve anatomy teaching, such as the 3D Anatomage virtual dissection table. There is a shortage and deficiency in information about the uses and benefits of the Anatomage table. The aim of this article was to review and assess the current evidence about the advantages of the Anatomage virtual table in medical education and curricula of medical courses, and its utility in diagnosis. The current study is a comprehensive systematic review. A search was conducted on online medical and scientific databases. Twenty-nine articles relevant to the content of the current research topic were selected. Based on this review, the use of the Anatomage table is valuable for anatomy learning outcomes, and most of the research supported it as an important anatomy tool in addition to cadaveric dissection. The Anatomage table in association with human dissection can improve knowledge retention of anatomy. It is an important tool for understanding organ variation. Anatomage is now considered an important tool for the educational training programs of medical students and residents and for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Anatomage can make the curriculum more interesting and valuable. Utilizing the Anatomage table can help medical and paramedical students and residents by assisting them to understand anatomy in a better way. It will also improve radiological knowledge and facilitate pre-planning for surgeries. Finally, it has a crucial role during exceptional circumstances such as pandemics.",

    "Abstract": "The topic of this research is the examination of the effectiveness of Virtual Reality (VR) training compared to traditional training methods. The research methodology used a systematic review to compare traditional and VR training methods in the workplace. The systematic review used 12 articles from 2013 thru 2021, and the two main criteria for the article selection included pretest/posttest design and workplace training. The keywords used to narrow the search were virtual reality, knowledge acquisition, workers, workplace, pretest, and posttest. Four themes identified using thematic analysis were increased knowledge acquisition, better knowledge retention, higher knowledge transference, and cost advantages/disadvantages. Although there were instances when the traditional method resulted in better training outcomes, overall, VR training resulted in better training outcomes. The systematic review findings also showed that VR training is not a one-size-fits-all and may not be suitable depending on circumstances. Organizations should conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine if VR training is the right choice for their organizational needs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "Digital educational games have been a part of the educational landscape since the early 1970s. Since then, there has been a proliferation in the quantity, format, type, and quality of digital educational games available to classroom teachers. Despite this, the body of literature surrounding the effectiveness of these digital educational games remains highly fragmented and lacks unifying themes. While some literature exists to support the use of digital educational games in immediate knowledge acquisition, little research has been done on how digital educational games impact the retention of knowledge in the long term. As such, this study examines how the use of a digital educational game impacts both immediate knowledge acquisition and the retention of that knowledge long-term. Outcomes of a digital educational game are compared to outcomes of hands-on instruction in the context of genetics content delivered in a high school biology course. Secondary analysis of an existing data set serves to determine if a digital educational game provides increased knowledge acquisition immediately after instruction when compared to hands-on instructional activities. Additionally, the investigation determines if a digital educational game provides increased knowledge retention thirty days post instruction when compared to hands-on instructional activities. The examination and analysis of the data, which includes pre-test, immediate post-test, and long-term post-test assessment scores was be conducted. The findings from this study help to advance the understanding of the value of digital educational games and their appropriate implementation in science classrooms.

    "Abstract": "Background: This paper poses to discuss and examine the concern of unmonitored and excessive internet use by school-age children, ages eight years to 11 years old, along with the importance of employing a Family Media Use Plan, which is recommended by the American Family of Pediatrics (AAP). This issue, although not often studied, is a common occurrence today and is associated with physical and mental health concerns for this vulnerable population. Method: This quality improvement project was accomplished through educating and surveying the parent population of the Intermediate building of a rural, Southeast Missouri Public School District. The involved parent population completed a pre-education Qualtrics survey, reviewed an education module, then completed an immediate post-education and 3-month post-education Qualtrics survey. Following the completion of the education module and Qualtrics surveys by the parent population survey data was collected and analyzed utilizing paired t-tests which were completed through the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 29.0.Results: The resulting data of comparing the pre-education survey and the immediate post-education survey did offer statistical significance in parental knowledge gain demonstrated by a p value of .018 attained through a paired t-test. Further completion of paired t-testing regarding use and awareness of the Family Media Use Plan, as well as parental knowledge retention, also resulted in findings that are statistically significant as noted by p-values.Conclusion: This quality improvement project resulted in findings that support continual and increased involvement of parents in monitoring of their school age child/children's daily internet use. Changes noted in the pre vs. immediate post education survey were found to be statistically significance, and all result findings are clinically significant in the school-age child's overall health and well-being.

    "Abstract": "Safety training effectively addresses the inexperience of and lack of knowledge among construction workers, which are some of the most significant contributors to workplace accidents on construction sites. This paper aims to understand the effectiveness of different extended reality (XR) technologies in imparting important construction safety training to construction workers in a virtual environment compared to conventional classroom training sessions. A group of experts were engaged to understand the most effective learning criteria and the impact of XR visualizations, and their responses were analysed using the interval type-2 fuzzy Delphi (IT2FD) method. Following this, a cohort of engineering students were subjected to construction safety training in traditional, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) environments. Their feedback was collected using an online questionnaire and the responses were analysed using the interval type-2 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (IT2F–AHP). The results revealed that addressing the virtual interface design of the training to maintain the attention of trainees and ensuring the virtual environment’s resemblance to the actual site and task were the most important factors in ensuring effective knowledge retention by the trainees. AR visualizations were most effective at imparting knowledge, and their interactive nature allowed trainees to retain the learned knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, considering the multifactor influence of the knowledge dissemination process, a new ignorant-knower-spreader-forgetter (IKSF) knowledge dissemination model is proposed, which considers internalization mechanism, degradation mechanism, communication, and willingness, as well as time-varying and uncertain parameters. First, we prove that the knowledge loss equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number R 0 1 . Next, improving the willingness of knower individuals and reducing the knowledge degradation function of spreader individuals can make the best effect of propagation; a hierarchical control strategy is designed. At the upper layer, an effective optimal control mechanism of the IKSF knowledge dissemination model is studied to provide optimal control action and minimization costs. At the lower layer, to guarantee robustness control performance and track the control targets, an intervention optimal guaranteed cost control strategy for the IKSF knowledge dissemination system with uncertain parameters is studied. Converting the controller’s design problem into a minimization problem with linear matrix inequalities, not only the impact of uncertain parameters is reduced but also the propagation effect of the knowledge dissemination model is guaranteed. Simulation results confirm our method.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to determine if Project-Based Learning (PBL) retrieval activities can impact knowledge gains and retention in high school mathematics students, and to look for a possible relationship between student achievement level, retrieval activity type, and mathematics knowledge retention. For two mathematical topics, ten high school seniors (six average-achieving and four high-achieving) received instruction, completed a post-instruction test, participated in either a PBL or a Traditional retrieval activity, and completed a post-activity test the day after the activity to measure knowledge gains and a deferred post-test six weeks after the activity to measure knowledge retention. There was no statistically significant difference in either knowledge gains or knowledge retention based on type of retrieval activity. The knowledge gains effect size between the two groups was negligible (Hedges' g = 0.017). The knowledge retention effect size was small (Hedges' g = 0.203) with a preference for the Traditional activity. Within both achievement levels, large effect sizes (Hedges' g > 0.8) were found in knowledge retention, with the high-achieving group showing higher knowledge retention after the PBL activity and the average-achieving group showing higher knowledge retention after the Traditional retrieval activity. These results indicate that PBL activities can be as effective as Traditional activities in the high school mathematics classroom and may be more beneficial to some students. Future research to determine attributes that may contribute to student's response to different types of retrieval activities is suggested.

INTRODUCTION Students must rapidly learn and retain fundamental basic science knowledge in a doctor of pharmacy curriculum. Active learning stimulates engagement, reinforces concept understanding, and promotes retention of knowledge. The purpose this study was to determine if introducing game-based active recall and critical thinking microlearning activities improved student comprehension of challenging concepts, exam performance, and successful completion of a biochemistry course.Microlearning activities were generated using Articulate Storyline software. Questions and problems were embedded in gamification-type activities to reinforce challenging biochemistry concepts and improve critical thinking. Activities were published on Blackboard and student performance was recorded. Students were divided into performance groups using their first exam scores. Student's exam scores were related to results from corresponding microlearning. Statistical analysis of results was performed to compare exam results with outcomes of microlearning activities. METHODS Microlearning activities were generated using Articulate Storyline software.

Activities were published on Blackboard and student performance was recorded. Students were divided into performance groups using their first exam scores. Student's exam scores were related to results from corresponding microlearning. Statistical analysis of results was performed to compare exam results with outcomes of microlearning activities.Student performance on exams and final scores positively correlated with successful completion of microlearning activities. Students who successfully completed more microlearning activities performed significantly better on all exams in comparison with students who completed few microlearning activities. Students who initially struggled with the material but completed more microlearning improved their performance on exams and passed the course with a higher score. In contrast, students who struggled and completed fewer activities failed to improve their exam and course performance.

    "Abstract": "Anatomy is an important component in the vertical integration of basic science and clinical practice. Two common pedagogies are cadaveric dissection and examination of prosected specimens. Comparative studies mostly evaluate their immediate effectiveness. A randomized controlled trial design was employed to compare both the immediate and long-term effectiveness of dissection and prosection. Eighty third-year medical students undergoing their surgical rotation from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine were randomized into two groups: dissection and prosection. Each participated in a one-day hands-on course following a similar outline that demonstrated surgical anatomy in the context of its clinical relevance. A pre-course test was conducted to establish baseline knowledge. A post-course test was conducted immediately after and at a one-year interval to evaluate learner outcome and knowledge retention. A post-course survey was conducted to assess participant perception. Thirty-nine and thirty-eight participants for the dissection and prosection groups, respectively, were included for analysis. There was no significant difference between mean pre-course test scores between the dissection and prosection groups [12.6 (3.47) vs. 12.7 (3.16), P > 0.05]. Both the mean immediate [27.9 (4.30) vs. 24.9 (4.25), P < 0.05] and 1 year [23.9 (4.15) vs. 19.9 (4.05), P < 0.05] post-course test scores were significantly higher in the dissection group. However, when adjusted for course duration [dissection group took longer than prosection group (mean 411 vs. 265 min)], these findings were negated. There is no conclusive evidence of either pedagogy being superior in teaching surgical anatomy. Based on learner surveys, dissection provides a greater learner experience.",

    "Abstract": "Objective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) students' knowledge and to measure student perceptions of an online, multi-institutional debate curriculum as an alternative to a journal club to improve critical thinking skills related to diabetes medications. Methods. All APPE students assigned to four faculty (n=37) at three different colleges during the 20202021 academic year received instruction on diabetes medication classes and their cardiovascular outcome trials. Students debated via the Lincoln-Douglas format whether the preferred second-line therapies for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are either glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or sodiumglucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Matched pre- and post-APPE knowledge scores were measured using a seven-item assessment tool. A 22-item post-debate survey measured student perceptions of the activity. Results. Pre- and post-APPE knowledge scores were compared in 32 students, yielding an 86% response rate. Knowledge scores improved 32% (59% pre vs 87% post). Thirty-three students completed the perceptions survey, yielding an 89% response rate. Students reported that the debate activity was beneficial (100%) and rated it more effective than a journal club at improving critical thinking skills and knowledge retention. Conclusion. Preliminary results suggest that incorporating an online, multi-institutional debate as an alternative to journal clubs during APPE rotations was well received. Further research is warranted on the impact of the multi-institutional debate and how to best deliver it during the APPEs of a pharmacy curriculum.",

    "Abstract": "Despite the understanding that loss of knowledge resulting from demographic changes in the workforce, in particular, the massive retirement of baby-boomers, constitutes a high potential risk in advanced economies, research on knowledge continuity (KC) is scant. In particular, empirical research of the antecedents that determine inter-generation KC behavior (KCB) is limited mainly to qualitative studies emphasizing the departing employees' perceptions. The study presented in this dissertation addressed this gap in the literature by adopting a broader perspective to investigate the antecedents of effective inter-generation KC behavior among knowledge workers, incorporating personal and organizational factors before their retirement and the effectiveness of KC behavior after their retirement. Furthermore, we offer a first-of-its-kind multiple-stakeholder approach to the investigation of inter-generation KC, considering the perceptions of various stakeholders that may affect and be affected by knowledge continuity.The study comprised three phases. First, we identified dyads of soon-to-retire employees and their successors in a large technology-intensive firm. In the second and third phases, to test the study hypotheses, we used a longitudinal design to collect data at two time points, before and after the workers' retirement (six months after retirement). Data were collected from 87 dyads and their relevant supervisors and colleagues.The findings suggest that the interaction between soon-to retire employees and their successors embedded in trust relations is positively related to KC behavior, but does not indirectly influence KC effectiveness (KCE) as mediated by KC behavior. Moreover, the workers' perceptions of task interdependence do not moderate these relationships. In addition, transformational leadership does not affect KC behavior directly and does not indirectly influence KC effectiveness. However, the effects of successors and supervisors' perceptions of task interdependence were found to moderate these relationships. Transformational leadership is positively associated with KC behavior, but only among successors who perceive low task interdependence. Furthermore, KC behavior is positively associated with KC effectiveness only among supervisors who perceive high task interdependence. Finally, a moderated-mediation effect of transformational leadership style and task interdependence on KC effectiveness via KC behavior is found. The analysis results demonstrate differences in stakeholders' perceptions. We identified that the supervisors' demonstrated a \"blind spot,\" which, given their role in enabling KC, may have crucial implications in terms of their willingness to act and invest in KC processes.In summary, considering the growing senior population that will be ageing and exiting the workforce in the coming years, the current study sheds light on the influence of different characteristics and needs among different generations and their implications for KC behavior and KC effectiveness. We discuss the important role of managers' behaviors and stakeholders' perceptions in KC among knowledge workers and how human resources practices can help facilitate inter-generation KC and harness its effectiveness.

    "Abstract": "Background Obstetric ultrasound has become a routine part of antenatal care in many parts of the world including low income settings. However, there is a shortage of radiologists and sonographers to perform routine obstetric scans in many areas especially in the rural settings of low income countries, despite having equipment available to do this. As a result, Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) has been suggested to bridge this gap by training other health workers such as midwives to perform basic obstetric ultrasound as part of their clinical care. Methods It was a prospective cohort pilot study in which trained midwives in point of care obstetric ultrasound were followed up at 6 months post training to assess their knowledge retention. Eleven trained midwives were purposively selected and followed up for knowledge retention. These were trained for 6 weeks and were given a knowledge assessment immediately after training, then given an assessment at 6 months following training. Data was analyzed using SPSS. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare assessments and perceived knowledge as well as Spearman correlation to test the relationship between the number of scans performed and exam assessments, knowledge and exam assessments, and number of scans and knowledge. Results There were eleven midwives, all female with an average age of 42.3 years. The mean exam score (out of 50) was 44.2 at the end of the training and 42.9 at 6-months follow up. The midwives demonstrated higher perceived knowledge at the end of the training when compared to the 6-months follow up. However, this perceived higher knowledge was not statistically significant when correlated with the exam scores either at the end of the training or at the follow up of 6 months. Conclusion This pilot study has demonstrated that training midwives in point of care obstetric ultrasound can result into acceptable levels of knowledge retention that assist the midwives to apply this knowledge when making routine clinical decisions in relation to pregnant women.",

    "Abstract": "Anatomy is an important component in the vertical integration of basic science and clinical practice. Two common pedagogies are cadaveric dissection and examination of prosected specimens. Comparative studies mostly evaluate their immediate effectiveness. A randomized controlled trial design was employed to compare both the immediate and long‐term effectiveness of dissection and prosection. Eighty third‐year medical students undergoing their surgical rotation from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine were randomized into two groups: dissection and prosection. Each participated in a one‐day hands‐on course following a similar outline that demonstrated surgical anatomy in the context of its clinical relevance. A pre‐course test was conducted to establish baseline knowledge. A post‐course test was conducted immediately after and at a one‐year interval to evaluate learner outcome and knowledge retention. A post‐course survey was conducted to assess participant perception. Thirty‐nine and thirty‐eight participants for the dissection and prosection groups, respectively, were included for analysis. There was no significant difference between mean pre‐course test scores between the dissection and prosection groups [12.6 (3.47) vs. 12.7 (3.16), P  > 0.05]. Both the mean immediate [27.9 (4.30) vs. 24.9 (4.25), P  < 0.05] and 1 year [23.9 (4.15) vs. 19.9 (4.05), P  < 0.05] post‐course test scores were significantly higher in the dissection group. However, when adjusted for course duration [dissection group took longer than prosection group (mean 411 vs. 265 min)], these findings were negated. There is no conclusive evidence of either pedagogy being superior in teaching surgical anatomy. Based on learner surveys, dissection provides a greater learner experience.",

    "Abstract": "COVID-19 sparked massive educational change and dictated that traditional courses rapidly transitioned online. This presented a unique challenge for anatomy, a visually orientated subject that has conventionally relied heavily on face-to-face teaching. Near-peer teaching (NPT) is one method with the potential to address this challenge. When given more responsibility, student-teachers are more likely to deliver effective teaching sessions and include the most appropriate resources for the learners. Current literature surrounding the use of NPT in both frontline and supplementary settings have already demonstrated its potential, however, its efficacy in an online environment is still largely unknown. The Faculty of Medicine at the University of Southampton has a well-established NPT programme as part of its 5 year undergraduate course (BM5). A quasi-experimental cohort study was conducted to determine whether the benefits associated with NPT are preserved when delivered online. Two cohorts of second year BM5 students received cranial nerve NPT as part of their formal clinical neuroanatomy module, one face to face (N = 150) and the other online (N = 168). Knowledge tests were undertaken by participants to assess knowledge gain and retention, and an established Likert style survey instrument was administered to assess student perceptions. Both online and face-to-face NPT sessions resulted in significant increases in student knowledge gain (p < 0.0001), yet the difference between the two was insignificant (p = 0.2432). Subsequent knowledge retention tests were also shown to be similar (p = 0.7732). Students perceived both methods of NPT delivery positively but found online NPT less enjoyable (p < 0.0001) and considered it to be a more inefficient use of time (p = 0.0035). This research suggests that online NPT can be deployed without a detrimental risk to learning when compared to traditional NPT applications in pre-clinical neuroanatomy teaching.COVID-19 sparked massive educational change and dictated that traditional courses rapidly transitioned online.

    "Abstract": "The lack of innovative employee performance in the automotive industry leads to failure when it comes to the execution of organizational strategies. Senior automotive managers are concerned with innovative employee performance, as it has the potential loss of knowledge and the skillset by the employee. Grounded in Vroom's expectancy theory, the purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore strategies automotive managers use that encourage innovative employee performance. The participants were three senior automotive managers in Southeastern Michigan with at least three years of knowledge in employee work performance. Data were collected through semistructured interviews. Through thematic analysis, four themes were identified: (a) expectations, (b) communication strategies, (c) integrity, and (d) benchmarking. A key recommendation is for automotive managers to use multiple communication methods to engage staff and keep them informed. An implication for positive social change includes the potential to increase and accomplish community growth, encouraging development and innovation by helping stimulate economic growth with employment opportunities, continuing expansion, and long-term prosperity.

    "Abstract": "Commercial escape rooms have grown in popularity as an enjoyable experience that also doubles as an exercise in communication and collaboration. Educators can take advantage of these natural qualities to engage and support students in a low-stress learning environment. The primary goal of this study is to share the development and application of an educational escape room as a tool to provide biomedical engineering (BME) students with an immersive and practical experience. A BME laboratory course-specific escape room was developed and beta-tested on an initial group of BME students. The first set of feedback enabled improvements to the design and difficulty of the escape room, which was followed by the final release of the activity for the intended undergraduate BME course. Across an academic year, 74 participants agreed to provide survey feedback for this study. Despite a moderate escape rate (29%), students reported high satisfaction and enthusiasm for the activity. Student survey responses indicated that participants were engaged and empowered to successfully escape even without external motivators. Responses supported the effectiveness of the escape room as a BME learning environment, allowing students to practice and retain course-related knowledge in a challenging but low-risk activity. The foundational structure of escape rooms offers a beneficial environment for experiential knowledge application. We conclude that educational escape rooms show promise as a pedagogical tool in promoting enhanced knowledge retention through immersive, game-based learning.Commercial escape rooms have grown in popularity as an enjoyable experience that also doubles as an exercise in communication and collaboration.

    "Abstract": "Objective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) students' knowledge and to measure student perceptions of an online, multi-institutional debate curriculum as an alternative to a journal club to improve critical thinking skills related to diabetes medications. Methods. All APPE students assigned to four faculty (n=37) at three different colleges during the 2020-2021 academic year received instruction on diabetes medication classes and their cardiovascular outcome trials. Students debated via the Lincoln-Douglas format whether the preferred second-line therapies for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are either glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Matched pre- and post-APPE knowledge scores were measured using a seven-item assessment tool. A 22-item post-debate survey measured student perceptions of the activity. Results. Pre- and post-APPE knowledge scores were compared in 32 students, yielding an 86% response rate. Knowledge scores improved 32% (59% pre vs 87% post). Thirty-three students completed the perceptions survey, yielding an 89% response rate. Students reported that the debate activity was beneficial (100%) and rated it more effective than a journal club at improving critical thinking skills and knowledge retention. Conclusion. Preliminary results suggest that incorporating an online, multi-institutional debate as an alternative to journal clubs during APPE rotations was well received. Further research is warranted on the impact of the multi-institutional debate and how to best deliver it during the APPEs of a pharmacy curriculum.Objective.

    "Abstract": "Anatomy is an important component in the vertical integration of basic science and clinical practice. Two common pedagogies are cadaveric dissection and examination of prosected specimens. Comparative studies mostly evaluate their immediate effectiveness. A randomized controlled trial design was employed to compare both the immediate and long-term effectiveness of dissection and prosection. Eighty third-year medical students undergoing their surgical rotation from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine were randomized into two groups: dissection and prosection. Each participated in a one-day hands-on course following a similar outline that demonstrated surgical anatomy in the context of its clinical relevance. A pre-course test was conducted to establish baseline knowledge. A post-course test was conducted immediately after and at a one-year interval to evaluate learner outcome and knowledge retention. A post-course survey was conducted to assess participant perception. Thirty-nine and thirty-eight participants for the dissection and prosection groups, respectively, were included for analysis. There was no significant difference between mean pre-course test scores between the dissection and prosection groups [12.6 (3.47) vs. 12.7 (3.16), P > 0.05]. Both the mean immediate [27.9 (4.30) vs. 24.9 (4.25), P   0.05]. Both the mean immediate [27.9 (4.30) vs. 24.9 (4.25), P < 0.05] and 1 year [23.9 (4.15) vs. 19.9 (4.05), P < 0.05] post-course test scores were significantly higher in the dissection group. However, when adjusted for course duration [dissection group took longer than prosection group (mean 411 vs. 265 min)], these findings were negated. There is no conclusive evidence of either pedagogy being superior in teaching surgical anatomy. Based on learner surveys, dissection provides a greater learner experience.",

BACKGROUND Co-management of HIV-TB coinfection remains a challenge globally. Addressing TB among people living with HIV (PLHIV) is a key priority for the Government of India (GoI). In 2016, GoI implemented single-window services to prevent and manage TB in PLHIV. To strengthen HIV-TB service delivery, case-based e-learning was introduced to health care providers at Antiretroviral Therapy centres (ARTc).We implemented a hub and spoke model to deliver biweekly, virtual, case-based e-learning at select ARTc (n = 115), from four states of India-Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. We evaluated feasibility and acceptability of case-based e-learning and its impact on professional satisfaction, self-efficacy, knowledge retention using baseline and completion surveys, session feedback, pre-and post-session assessments. We reviewed routine programmatic data and patient outcomes to assess practices among participating ARTc. METHODS We implemented a hub and spoke model to deliver biweekly, virtual, case-based e-learning at select ARTc (n = 115), from four states of India-Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. We evaluated feasibility and acceptability of case-based e-learning and its impact on professional satisfaction, self-efficacy, knowledge retention using baseline and completion surveys, session feedback, pre-and post-session assessments. We reviewed routine programmatic data and patient outcomes to assess practices among participating ARTc.Between May 2018 and September 2020, 59 sessions were conducted with mean participation of 55 spokes and 152 participants. For 95% and 88% of sessions ≥ 80% of respondents agreed that topics were clear and relevant to practice, and duration of session was appropriate, respectively. Session participants significantly improved in perceived knowledge, skills and competencies (+ 8.6%; p = 0.025), and technical knowledge (+ 18.3%; p = 0.04) from baseline. Participating ARTc increased TB screening (+ 4.2%, p < 0.0001), TB diagnosis (+ 2.7%, p < 0.0001), ART initiation (+ 4.3%, p < 0.0001) and TB preventive treatment completion (+ 5.2%, p < 0.0001).

E-learning could address demand for accessible and sustainable continuing professional education to manage complex diseases, and thereby enhance health equity. We recommend expansion of this initiative across the country for management of co-morbidities as well as other communicable and non-communicable diseases to augment the existing capacity building interventions by provide continued learning and routine mentorship through communities of practice.

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Knowledge transfer from older to younger employees plays a key role in lessening knowledge loss and maintaining firms’ competitiveness. While the disharmony derived from a salient age difference between younger and older workers hinders such knowledge transfer. This study aims to construct a rapport model to address it. Methods: Data from 318 respondents in various industries were collected through a questionnaire-based survey to test the proposed model. The research hypotheses were tested using hierarchical multiple regressions. Results: Our empirical results show that almost all rapport dimensions facilitate such knowledge transfer; The moderating role of supportive climate is strong that it enhances or replaces the effects of rapport dimensions on such knowledge transfer. Discussion: This study contributes to research on knowledge transfer and rapport by providing a detailed understanding of the relational mechanism of the knowledge transfer from older to younger employees based on a revised model of rapport. It also serves as a reference for firms to leverage rapport- building and a supportive climate to enhance this invaluable knowledge transfer.

    "Abstract": "Embodied cognition theory denotes that knowledge is incorporated into the body’s sensorimotor system, which facilitates learning and understanding abstract concepts. In this context, several interaction modalities have been introduced to design learning experiences that promote multisensory processing. This study examined the impacts of the type of embodied interaction modality on learning gains in a real classroom context. The researchers designed learning interfaces involving different interaction modalities including tablet application, tangible user interface, motion-based technology, and multimodal interaction. Thirty-six primary school students (aged 7 to 9) were assigned to four groups to learn the basics of the human body anatomy. The study adopted an immediate and a 20-day delayed post-test to measure students’ knowledge retention. Regardless of interaction modality type, participants showed significant immediate learning gains. However, participants in the multimodal embodiment conditions performed better on the delayed post-test. The findings suggested that multimodal embodied interaction, merging between body movements and tangible user interfaces, may lead to better knowledge retention. The process of performing body movements and physical interaction offered an alternative and a complementary encoding strategy for understanding and memorizing the learning concepts.",

    "Abstract": "Background. Although individuals' well-being has received considerable attention in academic research, the impact of knowledge management (KM) on workplace happiness has not yet been investigated. Objectives. This study contributes to job satisfaction, workplace happiness, and KM research. It aims to investigate the role of KM processes-knowledge acquisition, knowledge sharing, knowledge creation, knowledge codification, and knowledge retention-in promoting workplace happiness and job satisfaction. Methods. The study follows a quantitative approach. A Web-based questionnaire is the main data collection instrument. Five hundred and thirty-nine professionals participated in the study. Results. The results reveal that there is a significant relationship between the five processes of KM and workplace happiness. All of the KM processes had a strong impact on workplace happiness. Workplace happiness was significantly related to job satisfaction. Implications. It was concluded that promoting a culture based on KM processes can help individuals experience a greater sense of workplace happiness and improve their job satisfaction.",

    "Abstract": "Clinical and forensic toxicology are critically involved in the acquisition of basic skills to correctly suspect intoxication, collect biological and non-biological materials for toxicological analysis, comprehend the complexities inherent to laboratory activity, and understand the fundamentals of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics that underlie the interpretation of results. This works presents a pedagogical innovation proposal for the teaching of clinical and forensic toxicology based on a compilation of more than 3 000 cases where the image was fulcra for suspicion. The experience in this article follows the model practiced in bachelors, masters, and PhD degrees, as well as in other continuing training courses, where we are teaching toxicology for more than 15 years. All these levels of education are considered fundamental to the sound development of this science. This approach aims also to offer strength to the intervention of the true toxicologist in all the toxicological phases, besides the classic analytical chemistry. Indeed, it is impossible to provide effective clinical and forensic toxicological interpretations without a proper and broad education, and not thinking exclusively in terms of laboratory techniques. In the future, it will be interesting to evaluate knowledge retention and to propose a database of videos of signs related to intoxications.",

    "Abstract": "How to promote deep knowledge transfer and knowledge application during the process of R&D achievements delivery? This paper takes knowledge transfer as the research object. First of all, the path of knowledge transfer during the process of R&D achievements delivery is drawn. Next, the status of knowledge transfer is assessed by constructing users’ tolerance zone model by selecting key factors in the path of knowledge transfer. Empirical research finds the following conclusions: knowledge transfer experience − actual , knowledge transfer distance and knowledge transfer carrier have a positive influence on the actual service level of knowledge transfer. Knowledge transfer experience − ideal , continuous strengthening behavior and knowledge service commitment have a positive impact on the ideal service level of knowledge transfer. Then, based on knowledge transfer path and users’ tolerance zone model, this paper explores the knowledge navigation model from the environment, main structure and transmission mode. Finally, from the perspective of knowledge transfer environment, knowledge transfer subject, knowledge transfer object and knowledge transfer mode, the relevant strategies were put forward to reduce knowledge retention, and promote the deep knowledge absorption and transformation during the process of R&D achievements delivery.",

    "Abstract": "Disease education is a fundamental component in health science and medicine curricula, as it prepares students for their progression into health profession careers. However, this requires an ability to integrate concepts across multiple disciplines. Technology-enhanced interventions may bridge this gap, and this study assessed the effectiveness of a textbook-style or a three-dimensional mixed reality (MR, a hybrid of augmented and virtual reality) HoloLens resource for student learning and knowledge retention using asthma as a model of disease. Sixty-seven first-year undergraduate health science and medical students were randomized into two groups to complete a lesson on the physiology, anatomy, pathology, and pharmacology of asthma, delivered through either a textbook-style ( n  = 34) or MR ( n  = 33) resource. Participants took part in the study in small groups and completed the intervention and surveys in separate areas of a large laboratory space. A pre-test prior to the lesson included multiple-choice questions, with the post-test having additional multiple-choice questions to assess learning. A follow-up test to assess retention was performed two weeks later. Pre- and post-test scores revealed increased learning across both the textbook ( p  = 0.001) and MR ( p  = 0.05) interventions, although higher test results were obtained by those using the textbook-style resource ( p  < 0.05). There was no difference between groups in knowledge retention scores. Although the textbook-style resource was more effective for increasing test results, participants perceived MR as more favorable, highlighting the experience as enjoyable and useful. This study presents MR as an option for integration in cases where educators wish to enhance student enjoyment of the learning experience. However, the results suggest that traditional text-based resources persist as a fundamental delivery mode within a modern curriculum.Disease education is a fundamental component in health science and medicine curricula, as it prepares students for their progression into health profession careers.

    "Abstract": "Rabies is one of the most important zoonotic diseases that mostly affect children. We conducted a rabies education among 129 secondary school children (intervention group = 94 students, control group = 35 students) in two schools in southeast Bhutan and evaluated the effectiveness of the lesson by comparing the knowledge, perception and safety behaviour score about rabies before and after education. We also assessed the knowledge retention capacity of the students at three months post intervention. Our findings indicated that short rabies lesson significantly (P<0.001) improved the mean knowledge score from 19.98(±2.72) to 26.96(±2.24) in the intervention group. Similarly, mean scores for perception and safety behaviour improved significantly (P<0.001) from 10.77 (±1.89) to 13.95 (±1.36) and 9.809 (±1.85) to 12.97 (±1.54), respectively. Although the scores have reduced significantly (P<0.001) at three months post intervention, most of the rabies information was largely retained by the students. In control group, significant increase in mean scores were also observed for perception from 10.17 (±2.38) to 11.2 (±2.44) and safety behaviour from 9.14(±1.44) to 10.74 (±1.95) after 3 months of education. The finding demonstrate that a short rabies lesson is effective in improving knowledge, perceptions and understanding of dog bites safety behaviour among the school children. However, there is a need for a frequent awareness program, at least quarterly or half yearly. Rabies education should focus on critical points such as dog bites being the main source of rabies and the importance washing a dog/animal bite wound with soap and water, and visiting the hospital for medical advice following animal bites.",

    "Abstract": "The rapidly declining biosphere integrity, representing one of the core planetary boundaries, is alarming. In particular, the global numbers of mammals, birds, fishes, and plants declined by 68% from 1970 to 2016. One of the most widely accepted measures to halt the rate of biodiversity loss is to maintain and expand protected areas that are effectively managed. However, doing so requires substantial finance derived from nature-based tourism, specifically visitors from urban areas. Using the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) for conducting analysis on 535 Vietnamese urban residents, the current study examined how their biodiversity loss perceptions can affect their willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation in protected areas. We found that perceived environmental degradation, loss of economic growth, loss of nature-based recreation opportunities, and loss of knowledge as consequences of biodiversity loss indirectly affect the willingness to pay through the mediation of the attitude towards conservation. Notably, perceived knowledge loss also has a direct positive influence on the willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation. In contrast, perceived loss of health is negatively associated with the attitude towards conservation. Based on these findings, we suggest that building an eco-surplus culture among urban residents by stimulating their subjective cost-benefit judgments towards biodiversity loss can be a promising way to generate more finance from nature-based tourism for conservation in protected areas and ease the domestic government’s and international organizations’ funding allocation problems. Eco-surplus culture is a set of pro-environmental attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors shared by a group of people to reduce negative anthropogenic impacts on the environment and conserve and restore nature.",

    "Abstract": "The role of radiotherapy (RT) in cancer care is well described, with a clear correlation between access to radiotherapy and overall survival. Cancer mortality rates in Africa are substantially higher than those of the rest of the world, which may be partly attributed to lack of RT access and insufficient human resources. The Access to Care (A2C) Cape Town RT training programme was created in 2014 with the aim of supplementing practical RT training in the region, focusing on clinics moving from 2 to 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). The programme makes use of hybrid teaching methods, including pre-course e-learning followed by 17 on-site days of free-thinking design exercises, didactic learning, hands-on treatment planning computer sessions (39% of total teaching time), virtual simulation training and departmental demonstration sessions. Email support is offered to all teams for 3 months after each course to develop clinical protocols. Thirteen teams (radiation oncologist, medical physicist and radiation therapy technologist) from Africa attended the course between 2015 and 2019, with additional participants from seven South African and four international centres. E-learning done on the LäraNära training platform was only successful once formal progress tracking was introduced in 2019 (34% vs. 76% test completion rate). Delays between course attendance and initial clinical use of equipment proved to be detrimental to knowledge retention, with some centres having to send a second team for training. The course will be modified for remote teaching in 2021, to make provision for the global changes in travel due to Covid-19.",

BACKGROUND Virtual reality learning environments (VRLEs) are a potentially valuable learning tool that have recently increased in popularity due to widespread availability and decreased cost. VRLEs can provide an immersive learning environment that increases the understanding of three-dimensional relationships between anatomical structures. However, there is a paucity of evidence in the literature supporting its use within Midwifery education.To explore the effectiveness of a VRLE as an educational tool in midwifery education. OBJECTIVES To explore the effectiveness of a VRLE as an educational tool in midwifery education.A large University in Ireland, with institutional ethical approval. SETTING A large University in Ireland, with institutional ethical approval.Undergraduate and graduate degree midwifery students. PARTICIPANTS Undergraduate and graduate degree midwifery students.A descriptive qualitative and quantitative study was carried out. Data collection was carried out between September 2020 and March 2021. DESIGN A descriptive qualitative and quantitative study was carried out. Data collection was carried out between September 2020 and March 2021.Participants underwent a VRLE lesson based on the topic of fetal lie, position, and presentation in pregnancy. A multiple-choice questionnaire was used to quantitatively evaluate knowledge before and immediately after the intervention, and knowledge retention after one week. Qualitative data was collected using open-ended questions in the questionnaire. The primary outcome was a difference in pre- and post-intervention knowledge scores. Data was analysed using repeated measures one-way ANOVA. Qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis and simple content analysis. All students participated in the quantitative and qualitative components of the study. Secondary outcomes included participant satisfaction and self-confidence in learning which were analysed using thematic analysis. The side effect profile of the virtual reality device was also explored using open-ended questions in the questionnaire.

Repeated measures one-way ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences in knowledge scores pre- and post-intervention. Participants rated high satisfaction and self-confidence scores with regard to the VRLE as a learning modality. Side effects most commonly experienced by participants included dizziness (49 %), disorientation (30 %) and symptoms similar to motion sickness (32 %). The following themes were identified: \"Learning in 3D\", \"The Power of Visual Learning\", \"The value of Educational Technology\", \"Learning can be fun and enjoyable\". RESULTS Forty-one midwifery students participated in the study, with a 100 % participation and response rate.

The following themes were identified: \"Learning in 3D\", \"The Power of Visual Learning\", \"The value of Educational Technology\", \"Learning can be fun and enjoyable\".This study showed that the VRLE had no impact on knowledge gain, though high levels of satisfaction and self-confidence indicate a positive response to the VRLE. VRLEs are a potentially valuable learning tool to help enhance the student learning experience, promoting increased engagement, satisfaction, and self-confidence with the learning material. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that the VRLE had no impact on knowledge gain, though high levels of satisfaction and self-confidence indicate a positive response to the VRLE.

    "Abstract": "Increasingly, basic science educators at medical and health science programs are faced with the challenge of delivering fundamental science content using evidence-based pedagogical approaches that build students' fund of knowledge while also supporting their development as self-regulated learners. This has led to an increased use of active learning-based pedagogies such as flipped classroom teaching. However, there are many open questions about the conditions necessary for successful flipped classroom sessions. In particular, the role of student compliance (i.e., participation, engagement, attendance) in mediating performance needs to be evaluated. This is especially important in accelerated curricula where multiple basic science disciplines are integrated together in pass-fail courses, presenting challenges to both students' time and cognitive load. Data on prematriculation performance, in-class participation, weekly quiz performance, and summative assessment performance from three cohorts of medical students (n = 146) at a new medical school were collected and analyzed. We found that historically high-performing students more readily participated in flipped classroom application sessions compared with historically lower-performing students. Correlational analysis of performance on weekly formative quizzes and the summative course exam was not related to in-class participation. However, performance on weekly formative quizzes played the most significant role in students' performance on summative exams. Efforts to understand the benefits of in-class participation beyond short-term assessment performance, such as long-term knowledge retention or development of noncognitive skills, should be undertaken to justify using such time- and human resource-intensive pedagogies.",

    "Abstract": "Increasingly, basic science educators at medical and health science programs are faced with the challenge of delivering fundamental science content using evidence-based pedagogical approaches that build students' fund of knowledge while also supporting their development as self-regulated learners. This has led to an increased use of active learning-based pedagogies such as flipped classroom teaching. However, there are many open questions about the conditions necessary for successful flipped classroom sessions. In particular, the role of student compliance (i.e., participation, engagement, attendance) in mediating performance needs to be evaluated. This is especially important in accelerated curricula where multiple basic science disciplines are integrated together in pass-fail courses, presenting challenges to both students' time and cognitive load. Data on prematriculation performance, in-class participation, weekly quiz performance, and summative assessment performance from three cohorts of medical students ( n = 146) at a new medical school were collected and analyzed. We found that historically high-performing students more readily participated in flipped classroom application sessions compared with historically lower-performing students. Correlational analysis of performance on weekly formative quizzes and the summative course exam was not related to in-class participation. However, performance on weekly formative quizzes played the most significant role in students' performance on summative exams. Efforts to understand the benefits of in-class participation beyond short-term assessment performance, such as long-term knowledge retention or development of noncognitive skills, should be undertaken to justify using such time- and human resource-intensive pedagogies. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study explores the use of flipped classroom teaching in a voluntary and accelerated medical school course. We found that historically high-performing students attend class, whereas historically low-performing students do not attend class as readily. Formative assessment performance appears to be more important than participation in determining the final grade. Correlation of high performance (>90%) with participation may differentiate students who excel in our curriculum from those who simply pass with superficial knowledge.Increasingly, basic science educators at medical and health science programs are faced with the challenge of delivering fundamental science content using evidence-based pedagogical approaches that build students' fund of knowledge while also supporting their development as self-regulated learners.

    "Abstract": "To identify exemplary medical education curricula, operationalized as curricula evaluating knowledge retention and/or clinical skills acquisition, for health care for sexual and gender minoritized (SGM) individuals and individuals born with a difference in sex development (DSD). PURPOSE To identify exemplary medical education curricula, operationalized as curricula evaluating knowledge retention and/or clinical skills acquisition, for health care for sexual and gender minoritized (SGM) individuals and individuals born with a difference in sex development (DSD).The authors conducted a systematic review of the literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches were performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ERIC, Embase, PsycINFO, and the gray literature to identify studies that (1) pertained to undergraduate and/or graduate medical education, (2) addressed education on health care of SGM/DSD individuals, and (3) assessed knowledge retention and/or clinical skills acquisition in medical trainees. The final searches were run in March 2019 and rerun before final analyses in June and October 2020. METHOD The authors conducted a systematic review of the literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches were performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ERIC, Embase, PsycINFO, and the gray literature to identify studies that (1) pertained to undergraduate and/or graduate medical education, (2) addressed education on health care of SGM/DSD individuals, and (3) assessed knowledge retention and/or clinical skills acquisition in medical trainees. The final searches were run in March 2019 and rerun before final analyses in June and October 2020.Of 670 full-text articles reviewed, 7 met the inclusion criteria. Five of the 7 studies assessed trainee knowledge retention alone, 1 evaluated clinical skills acquisition alone, and 1 evaluated both outcomes. Studies covered education relevant to transgender health, endocrinology for patients born with DSDs, and HIV primary care. Only 1 study fully mapped to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) SGM/DSD competency recommendations. Six studies reported institutional funding and development support. No studies described teaching SGM/DSD health care for individuals with multiply minoritized identities or engaging the broader SGM/DSD community in medical education curriculum development and implementation.

    "Abstract": "In this study, we investigated whether playing an escape room game after explicit instruction (instruction-first group, N  = 20) is more effective to learn about copyright and media law than playing the game before explicit instruction (problem-solving-first group, N  = 21). This is an important question as escape room games are complex, problem-based learning environments that can overwhelm learners and thus hinder the acquisition of knowledge and skills. According to cognitive load theory, preparing learners with explicit instruction before problem-solving activities can overcome this problem leading to better learning. However, in the productive failure paradigm problem-solving before explicit instruction is seen as more effective, especially when it comes to the application of newly acquired knowledge to solve novel problems. Based on these two theories, we conducted an experiment and found that playing the developed digital escape room game after explicit instruction was more effective for knowledge retention and domain-specific self-efficacy with at the same time lower cognitive load. However, we found no differences regarding the application of knowledge as both groups scored equally high on transfer tasks. The result is discussed considering previous productive failure studies mostly conducted in the science and engineering domain. In sum, the instruction first approach proved to be effective for both knowledge acquisition and knowledge application, leading to higher domain-specific self-efficacy and lower cognitive load. Therefore, we conclude that the implementation of escape room games after instruction is an effective instructional approach and better suited to promote learning than playing escape room games before instruction.",

    "Abstract": "This research investigates how experiencing virtual embodiment in a wheelchair affects implicit bias towards people who use wheelchairs. We also investigate how receiving information from a virtual instructor who uses a wheelchair affects implicit bias towards people who use wheelchairs. Implicit biases are actions or judgments of people towards various concepts or stereotypes (e.g., races). We hypothesized that experiencing a Disability Simulation (DS) through an avatar in a wheelchair and receiving information from an instructor with a disability will have a significant effect on participants' ability to recall disability-related information and will reduce implicit biases towards people who use wheelchairs. To investigate this hypothesis, a 2x2 between-subjects user study was conducted where participants experienced an immersive VR DS that presents information about Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with factors of instructor (i.e., instructor with a disability versus instructor without a disability) and locomotion interface (i.e., without a disability - locomotion through in-place-walking, with a disability - locomotion in a wheelchair). Participants took a disability-focused Implicit Association Test two times, once before and once after experiencing the DS. They also took a test of knowledge retention about MS. The primary result is: experiencing the DS through locomotion in a wheelchair was better for both the disability-related information recall task and reducing implicit bias towards people who use wheelchairs.This research investigates how experiencing virtual embodiment in a wheelchair affects implicit bias towards people who use wheelchairs.

    "Abstract": "The role of radiotherapy (RT) in cancer care is well described, with a clear correlation between access to radiotherapy and overall survival. Cancer mortality rates in Africa are substantially higher than those of the rest of the world, which may be partly attributed to lack of RT access and insufficient human resources. The Access to Care (A2C) Cape Town RT training programme was created in 2014 with the aim of supplementing practical RT training in the region, focusing on clinics moving from 2 to 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). The programme makes use of hybrid teaching methods, including pre-course e-learning followed by 17 on-site days of free-thinking design exercises, didactic learning, hands-on treatment planning computer sessions (39% of total teaching time), virtual simulation training and departmental demonstration sessions. Email support is offered to all teams for 3 months after each course to develop clinical protocols. Thirteen teams (radiation oncologist, medical physicist and radiation therapy technologist) from Africa attended the course between 2015 and 2019, with additional participants from seven South African and four international centres. E-learning done on the LäraNära training platform was only successful once formal progress tracking was introduced in 2019 (34% vs. 76% test completion rate). Delays between course attendance and initial clinical use of equipment proved to be detrimental to knowledge retention, with some centres having to send a second team for training. The course will be modified for remote teaching in 2021, to make provision for the global changes in travel due to Covid-19.The role of radiotherapy (RT) in cancer care is well described, with a clear correlation between access to radiotherapy and overall survival.

    "Abstract": "One of the challenges in medical education is effectively assessing basic science knowledge retention. National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) clerkship subject exam performance is reflective of the basic science knowledge accrued during preclinical education. The aim of this study was to determine if students' retention of basic science knowledge during the clerkship years can be analyzed using a cognitive diagnostic assessment (CDA) of the NBME subject exam data. INTRODUCTION One of the challenges in medical education is effectively assessing basic science knowledge retention. National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) clerkship subject exam performance is reflective of the basic science knowledge accrued during preclinical education. The aim of this study was to determine if students' retention of basic science knowledge during the clerkship years can be analyzed using a cognitive diagnostic assessment (CDA) of the NBME subject exam data.We acquired a customized NBME item analysis report of our institution's pediatric clerkship subject exams for the period of 2017-2020 and developed a question-by-content Q-matrix by identifying skills necessary to master content. As a pilot study, students' content mastery in 12 major basic science content areas was analyzed using a CDA model called DINA (deterministic input, noisy \"and\" gate). METHODS We acquired a customized NBME item analysis report of our institution's pediatric clerkship subject exams for the period of 2017-2020 and developed a question-by-content Q-matrix by identifying skills necessary to master content. As a pilot study, students' content mastery in 12 major basic science content areas was analyzed using a CDA model called DINA (deterministic input, noisy \"and\" gate).The results allowed us to identify strong and weak basic science content areas for students in the pediatric clerkship. For example: \"Reproductive systems\" and \"Skin and subcutaneous tissue\" showed a student mastery of 83.8 ± 2.2% and 60.7 ± 3.2%, respectively. RESULTS The results allowed us to identify strong and weak basic science content areas for students in the pediatric clerkship. For example: \"Reproductive systems\" and \"Skin and subcutaneous tissue\" showed a student mastery of 83.8 ± 2.2% and 60.7 ± 3.2%, respectively.Our pilot study demonstrates how this new technique can be applicable in quantitatively measuring students' basic science knowledge retention during any clerkship. Combined data from all the clerkships will allow comparisons of specific content areas and identification of individual variations between different clerkships. In addition, the same technique can be used to analyze internal assessments thereby creating an opportunity for the longitudinal tracking of student performances. Detailed analyses like this can guide specific curricular changes and drive continuous quality improvement in the undergraduate medical school curriculum.

    "Abstract": "Active-learning environments have been slowly but increasingly integrated into the political science curricula. Students and professors have fun in the active-learning processes. However, we still need evidence to support the nexus between learning and playing to ensure students learn more, or at least the same, with active-learning methodologies than with traditional ones. This article tests the effect of game-based learning on knowledge acquisition about political systems. We conduct a quasi-experiment in a Spanish university on second-year political science major students. Two groups were exposed to the treatment (role-play), and the third did not receive the intervention but a traditional lecture. We conducted a multi-method analysis to explore the data. Our results confirm that students exposed to role-plays have higher short-term knowledge retention about political systems than those who took the traditional lectures. The main sociodemographic factor pushing knowledge retention is the current GPA of students. Qualitative analysis shows that, through games, students perceive a reinforcement of their skills and recognize the usefulness of role-playing games in for teaching electoral formulas, the benefits of redistribution and trade, and the complexities around decision-making in political systems. Alternate abstract: El aprendizaje activo se ha ido integrando en los planes de estudio de Ciencias Políticas. Estudiantes y profesores se divierten, pero necesitamos evidencia para sustentar el nexo entre aprendizaje y juego para asegurarnos de que los alumnos aprenden más, o al menos lo mismo, que con las metodologías tradicionales. En este trabajo se comprueba el efecto del aprendizaje basado en el juego en la adquisición de conocimientos sobre los sistemas políticos. Llevamos a cabo un cuasi experimento en una universidad española con estudiantes de segundo curso de la carrera de Ciencias Políticas. Dos grupos fueron expuestos al tratamiento (juego de rol), y el tercero a una clase tradicional. Realizamos un análisis multimétodo para explorar los datos. Los resultados confirman que los expuestos a los juegos de rol tienen una mayor retención de conocimiento a corto plazo sobre los sistemas políticos que aquellos que recibieron solo clases tradicionales. El principal factor sociodemográfico asociado con la retención de conocimientos es la nota media.

    "Abstract": "This pilot study aimed to assess the effects of high-fidelity simulation on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) self-efficacy and knowledge retention compared to case-based learning. A two-group, experimental, longitudinal design was adopted. Fifty-two undergraduate nursing students were invited to participate in the study, which was conducted between March and May 2019. The results show statistically significant differences in favor of the experimental group on both CPR knowledge retention and self-efficacy one month after training. These findings may assist nurse educators to implement high-fidelity simulation in CPR education.",

Introduction Image optimisation is essential for acquisition of quality images in ultrasound and critical to the diagnostic ability of the examination. These skills are taught to sonography students early in their education, but research has found that retention of non-rehearsed knowledge decreases significantly after a year. The aim of this study was to determine which optimisation tools (knobology) final year sonography students use, how often and why they chose to adjust parameters and assess barriers to optimisation of knobology tools.A prospective study using data from an anonymous online survey of 34 final year sonography students. Methods A prospective study using data from an anonymous online survey of 34 final year sonography students.Survey results showed that 19/34 (55%) of students \"frequently\" optimise all Doppler settings and 23/34 (67%) of students \"frequently\" optimise basic parameter settings (depth, focus, time gain compensation). Time constraints (24/34 (70%)) and loss of gained knowledge of sonography principles and instrumentation (17/34 (50%)) were the major barriers to the use of knobology. The majority 28/34 (82%) believed they would benefit from further training.

    "Abstract": "A significant number of instructors, researchers and students have claimed that chemistry is a challenging subject to teach and learn at all education levels. Its main learning difficulties are in line with certain sights of its phenomena that are abstract, and some chemistry teachers do not specify what to be learned and assessed in chemistry lesson. The current work investigates the use of formative assessment rubrics for supporting secondary school students’ progressive learning in organic chemistry through a technology-based learning project approach in Rwanda. The investigators used a convergent parallel research design, and quantitative data were gathered by distributing questionnaires to the students, and the answers were statistically analyzed. Qualitative data were obtained through observation and interview and were narratively analyzed. The results from this study showed that rubric-based formative assessment supported students’ learning of organic chemistry via technology-based learning approach. This is accredited to the fact that students were motivated while doing their assessment and they were able to do self-assessment by applying the provided rubrics via technology. The students understood instructors’ expectations, encouraged their learning, sharpened their technology skills, and their knowledge retention was also increased. The instructors were able to grade the students’ tasks fast with the help of an analytic rubric and good formative feedback was availed to students on time. The instructors were also able to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of the learners and give them quick formative feedback.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Evidence indicates that tailored educational resources such as e-Bug in schools can improve students’ knowledge of infection prevention. This study aimed to (1) understand the feasibility of using soap use data as a proxy for measuring student handwashing behaviours and (2) refine a study method that could be implemented by local authorities and schools to assess impact as a result of the implementation of e-Bug. Design: A stepped-wedge design was employed, and 10 primary schools were randomly assigned to groups where teachers were trained to use e-Bug, either in July 2019 (early intervention group) or in January 2020 (late intervention group). Pre/post student knowledge-retention questionnaire data and soap use measurements were collected from all schools before and after the early group teachers used e-Bug. The sample included 16 soap use measures, 561 students in the early group and 601 students in the late group. Statistical analysis involved single/multivariable mixed-effects linear and logistic regression. Setting: A local authority in England. Results: In 15–18 questions, there was a significant relationship between training and students answering questions about microbes, hand/respiratory hygiene and antibiotic use/resistance correctly (degree of change varied). There was not enough power to comment on the relationship between the intervention and soap use. Conclusion: This study informs the feasibility of cluster, randomised, controlled trials in educational settings to measure the impact of educational resources. It can be used to inform future studies and highlights the need to ensure adequate sample size to estimate soap use and improve the measurement accuracy of data collection tools.",

BACKGROUND The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in South Africa compelled medical schools to switch to a purely online curriculum. The innovative changes transformed the standard clinical skills curriculum to increase learning transfer to bridge the theory-practice gap. The efficacy of this intervention remains unknown. This study aims to measure medical students' clinical competency in the affective, cognitive, and psychomotor domains by assessing clinical skills knowledge retention and transfer from the online platform compared to face-to-face and blended learning.A non-random cross-sectional quasi-experimental study assessed third-year medical students' knowledge retention and learning transfer in three domains of clinical skills competence. Data were obtained using a score sheet during a directly observed formative and a trial online summative assessment. One hundred and one third-year medical students volunteered for the formative onsite assessment that tested the psychomotor domain. Two hundred and thirty-nine students were evaluated on the affective and cognitive domains in the summative online trial mini-objective structured clinical examination (tm-OSCE). The OSCE scores were analysed using descriptive statistics. The significance of the findings was evaluated by comparing OSCE scores with the pre-pandemic 2019 third-year medical students.

The significance of the findings was evaluated by comparing OSCE scores with the pre-pandemic 2019 third-year medical students.Statistically significant differences were found between the two cohorts of medical students from both years (p < 0.05). The 2021 blended group's (n = 101) medians were 90%, 95%CI [86, 92], 82%, 95%CI [80, 85], and 87%, 95% CI [84, 90] for the psychomotor, affective, and cognitive skills, respectively. The e-learning group's affective and cognitive skills medians were 78%, 95%CI [73, 79] and 76%, 95%CI [71, 78], respectively. The 2019 face-to-face cohort (n = 249) achieved medians of 70%, 95% CI [69, 72] and 84%, 95%CI [82, 86] for the affective and psychomotor skills, respectively.

The blended group performed significantly better than the e-learning and face-to-face groups. Medical schools and educators play a vital role in overcoming learning challenges and achieving higher transfer levels by adopting multiple student-centered teaching delivery approaches and arranging immediate application opportunities.

OBJECTIVE To examine long-term participant knowledge retention over a six-month follow-up period following completion of the Understanding MS MOOC, a freely available six-week online health education intervention.We conducted pre-post analysis using paired t-tests to determine the effect of the course on MS knowledge (primary outcome), health literacy, resilience, self-efficacy, quality of life, and MS symptom severity among pwMS and not living with MS. We assessed the effect of participant characteristics on the change in MS knowledge using linear regression. METHODS We conducted pre-post analysis using paired t-tests to determine the effect of the course on MS knowledge (primary outcome), health literacy, resilience, self-efficacy, quality of life, and MS symptom severity among pwMS and not living with MS. We assessed the effect of participant characteristics on the change in MS knowledge using linear regression.Both pwMS (N=139) and not living with MS (N=164) significantly increased MS knowledge over the follow-up period. PwMS also showed increases in health literacy and self-efficacy. These increases were largely maintained from the post-course assessment. There was no effect on resilience or quality of life.

The present research tested whether greater learning success could paradoxically be achieved through making errors by intentional design, relative to traditional errorless learning methods. We show that deliberately committing and correcting errors even when one knows the correct answers enhances learning—a counterintuitive phenomenon that we termed the derring effect. Across two experiments ( N = 160), learners engaged in open-book study of scientific expository texts and were then tested on their retention and higher-order application of the material to analyze a novel news event. Deliberate error commission and correction during study produced not only better recall performance, but also superior knowledge application compared to two errorless study techniques that are popular among students and educational researchers: copying with underlining, and elaborative studying with concept mapping (Experiment 1). These learning benefits persisted even over generating alternative conceptually correct answers, revealing that the derring effect is not merely attributable to generation or elaboration alone, but is unique to producing incorrect responses (Experiment 2). Yet, learners were largely unaware of these advantages even after experiencing them. Our results suggest that avoiding errors in learning may not always be most optimal.

    "Abstract": "Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the addition of standardized patients or the addition of interprofessional student teams with standardized patients to the use of a simulated electronic health record improved student knowledge retention and perceptions. Methods. This was a prospective cohort study assessing three cohorts of first-year student pharmacists in pharmacy skills laboratory activities that occurred in 2018, 2019, and 2021. The primary objective of the study was to compare knowledge retention of the case material between groups at one month. Each year, an element of simulated experience was added onto the previous year's case. In 2018, students completed the case using only the electronic health record web application. In 2019, the previous year's experience was combined with an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) with standardized patients. In 2021, the 2019 experience was supplemented with student physician assistants. Case scores and student perceptions were also compared between groups. Results. Of the 260 potential participants, 238 students were included in the primary analysis. Results showed that with the addition of interprofessional team-based care and standardized patients, significant improvement was demonstrated in knowledge retention assessments at one month. Mean knowledge retention assessment scores for the 2018, 2019, and 2021 groups were 63.8%, 71.7%, and 76.1%, respectively. Significant improvement was also found in student perceptions. Conclusion.

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG New types of workflows are being used in science that couple traditional distributed and high-performance computing (HPC) with data-intensive approaches, and orchestrate ensembles of numerical simulations and artificial intelligence (AI) models. Such workflows may use AI models to supplement computation where numerical simulations may be too computationally expensive, to automate trivial yet time consuming operations, to perform preliminary selections among intractable numbers of combinations in domains as diverse as protein binding, fine-grid climate simulations, and drug discovery. They offer renewed opportunities for scientific research but exhibit high computational, storage and communications requirements [Goble et al. 2020, Al-Saadi et al. 2021, da Silva et al. 2021]. These workflows can be orchestrated by workflow management systems (WMS) and built upon composable blocks that facilitate task placement and resource allocation for parallel executions on high performance systems [Lee et al. 2021, Merzky et al. 2021]. The scientific computing communities running these kinds of workflows have been slow to adopt Findable, Accessible, Interpretable, and Re-usable (FAIR) principles, in part due to the complexity of workflow life cycles, the numerous WMS, and the specificity of HPC systems with rapidly evolving architectures and software stacks, and execution modes that require resource managers and batch schedulers [Plale et al. 2021]. FAIR Digital Objects (FDO) that encapsulate bit sequences of data, metadata, types and persistent identifiers (PID) can help promote the adoption of FAIR, enable knowledge extraction and dissemination, and contribute to re-use [De Smedt et al. 2020]. As workflows typically use data and software during planning and execution, FDOs are particularly adapted to enable re-use [Wittenburg et al. 2020]. But the benefits of FDOs such as automating data processing and actionable DO collections cannot be realized without the main components of FAIR, rich metadata and clear identifiers, being universally adopted in the community. These components are still elusive for HPC digital objects. Some metadata are added after results have been produced, are not described by controlled vocabularies, and typically left unconstrained, resulting in inefficient processes and loss of knowledge. Persistent identifiers are added at the time of publication to data supporting conclusions, so only a very small amount of data are being shared outside a small community of researchers “in the know”. In this conceptual work, one can distinguish several kinds of FDOs for HPC workflows that present both common and specific challenges to the development of canonical DO infrastructure and the implementation of FDO workflows that we discuss below: result FDOs represent computational results obtained when program execution complete, performance FDOs that contain performance measures and results from code optimization on parallel, heterogeneous architectures, intermediate FDOs from intermediate states of workflow execution, obtained from HPC checkpointing. All these FDOs for HPC workflows should include the computing environment and system specifications on which code was executed for metadata rich enough to enable re-usability [Pouchard et al. 2019]. Containers are often being used to capture dependencies between underlying libraries and versions in the execution environment for the installation and re-use of software code [Lofstead et al. 2015, Olaya et al. 2020]. But containers published in code repositories are made available without identifiers registered with resolvers. For instance, to attribute a Digital Object Identifier to software shared in github, one must perform the additional step of registering the code into Zenodo. FDOs extracted and built in the context of a canonical workflow framework including collections will help with the attribution of persistent identifiers and the linking of execution environment with data and workflow. Computational results may include machine learning predictions resulting form stochastic training of non-deterministic models. Neural networks and deep learning models present specific challenges to result FDOs related to provenance and the selection of quantities needed to include in an FDO for the re-use of results. What information needs to be included in a FAIR Digital Object encapsulating deep learning results to make it persistent and re-usable? The description of method, data and experiment recommended in [Gundersen and Kjensmo 2018] can be instantiated in a FDO collection. To make it re-usable, it should include the model architecture, the machine learning platform and its version, a submission script that contains hyperparameters, the loss function, batch size and number of epochs [Pouchard et al. 2020]. Challenges specific to digital objects containing performance measures for HPC workflows are those related to size, selection and reduction. Performance data at scale tends to be very large, thus a principled approach to selection is needed to determine which execution counters must be included in FDOs for performance reproducibility of an application [Patki et al. 2019]. Performance FDOs should include the variables selected to show their impact on performance and the methods used for selection: do such variables represent outliers in performance metrics? What methods and thresholds are used to qualify as outliers, what impact do these outliers have on overall performance of an execution? A key contributor to the failure to capture important information in HPC workflows is that metadata and provenance capture is often “bolted on” after the fact and in a piecemeal, cumbersome, inefficient manner that impedes further analysis. An FDO approach including DO collections at the appropriate level of abstraction and rich metadata is needed. Capturing metadata automatically must take into account the appropriate granularity level for re-use across system layers and abstraction levels. Intermediate FDOs capture and fuse metadata across multiple sources during the planning and execution stages [Nicolae 2022]. Some tools already exist. Darshan is a scalable tool summarizing Input/Output file characteristics [Dai et al. 2019], Radical Cybertools [Merzky et al. 2021] can produce the provenance task graph of an execution. Such tools could be included in a canonical workflow framework as they present a path forward for composable services for HPC and would guarantee a level of encapsulation into DOs favorable to re-use.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG Public events such as state fairs provide valuable opportunities to provide informal animal welfare education, possibly changing people’s decisions regarding animal welfare. This study evaluated whether an interactive animal-free exhibit increased visitors’ self-reported knowledge and stated behavioral intentions related to animal welfare. The exhibit featured information about the behavior and welfare of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, poultry, horses, cats and dogs. Survey data were collected at two events in the Midwestern United States (Purdue University Spring Fest (FEST): n = 32; Indiana State Fair (FAIR): n = 49 valid responses). Most people agreed and strongly agreed (FEST: 60.00%; FAIR: 74.47%) that they learned new information and would consider this information when making decisions (FAIR: 70.37%; FAIR: 76.19). Most people (FEST: 67.86%; FAIR: 71.11%) also stated that they had a better understanding of animal welfare after visiting the exhibit. These findings indicate that an animal welfare exhibit can positively influence visitors’ self-reported knowledge and stated decisions about animal welfare. Future research is needed to examine the long-term impacts of animal welfare exhibits on knowledge retention, decisions and behavior.",

    "Abstract": "Being a professor at the university is associated with the acquisition of sufficient domain knowledge and skills to teach. On the other hand, there is a constant need to update and strengthen teaching skills and contribute to an effective learning process. Neuroscience research provides evidence on facilitating factors to student engagement and lasting, durable learning. Toward the improvement of the learning quality in Higher Education, the development of an innovative didactic proposal based on neuroscience was undertaken. For that reason, a mixed research method was designed with the purpose of exploring instructors’ opinions and practices. Participants were sixty academics from five Greek universities. Findings include the recognition of the validity and importance of neuroeducation training. It was also revealed that academics’ theoretical declarations are not always aligned with teaching practice. Equally important is their need to deepen the comprehension of memory function for the enhancement of students’ knowledge retention. Eventual misconceptions about the brain might be present, while not all employed pedagogical methods lead to desired student outcomes such as creativity and critical thinking. In addition, it is considered useful to apply alternative, creative and authentic assessment methods based on neuroscience evidence to increase students’ interest and engagement.

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG Breastfeeding is important for preterm mothers and infants. However, evidence-based practice and standardized education remain inadequate. To implement evidence-based practice, continuous education is mandatory for nurse-midwives. We previously implemented our developed education program on early essential milk expression care for preterm mothers among Japanese nurse-midwives. Herein, we aimed to assess the effects of our education program on nurse-midwives'knowledge of milk expression care for preterm mothers in terms of changes in their correct answer rates for 20 specific knowledge items before and after the education program implementation. We also aimed to identify program-related issues from nurse-midwives' comments to improve the program. We conducted a secondary analysis of our previous data and surveyed the knowledge of 36 nurse-midwives who received a similar face-to-face education program on milk expression care for mothers three months before (Pre-1), just before (Pre-2), just after (Post-1), and three months after (Post-2) the program. We obtained their comments at Post-2 and identified issues for program improvement. The knowledge items, in which the correct answer rates of Post-1 were significantly higher than those of Pre-2, were Verification of the motivation and intent, Benefits of breastfeeding for mothers and infants, Milk volume on the fourth day and at around the second week after birth, Lactogenesis stage 3, Autocrine control, Time between birth and the initiation of milk expression, Early initiation of milk expression, Frequent milk expression, and Duration of pumping. The issues identified were practical training, knowledge retention, and misunderstanding knowledge. Nurse-midwives' unacquired knowledge of milk expression care for preterm mothers was effectively supplemented by the education program. Pre-education knowledge items with low correct answer rates must be strengthened during in-service education. Practical training, knowledge retention, and misunderstanding knowledge can be improved.",

    "Abstract": "Higher Education Institutions (HEI) are beleaguered by knowledge loss, occasioned by staff moving to other workplaces, layoffs, and in some cases retirement. Organizations generally prefer to keep resources, including knowledge, that make them distinctive, innovative, and creative in a rapidly changing environment that demands constant renewal powered by knowledge. This critical resource, considered intangible and inimitable and likely to depend on work experience, is highly impacted by changing demographics in workplaces, which are fueled by incessant layoffs and staff attrition and are characterized by knowledge loss, skills, experience and relationships. Given the importance of knowledge, the process of identifying and managing critical knowledge in organizations-with a view to using and reusing knowledge, referred to as knowledge retention-becomes imperative. Yet, HEI have not crafted strategies in the past to retain critical knowledge, contrary to the Transactive Memory Systems theory which underpins this study. Data for the study was collected using a self-administered survey instrument that targeted randomly selected administrative staff from five public universities of Uganda. Purposively selected key respondents were interviewed to complement the quantitative data. Factor and reliability tests and descriptive statistics were the various statistical analyses undertaken using SPSS. The findings affirm low extent of knowledge retention practices among administrative staff in HEI in Uganda. The study also offers recommendations, including a knowledge retention strategy framework.",

    "Abstract": "In the Middle East, where most of the higher learning institutions still focus on the teacher-centred approach, implementation of this pedagogical model is an enormous task for educators. This study was designed to assess the role that the flipped classroom modality plays in the knowledge retention of medical students with a background in traditional methods of teaching and learning. Background In the Middle East, where most of the higher learning institutions still focus on the teacher-centred approach, implementation of this pedagogical model is an enormous task for educators. This study was designed to assess the role that the flipped classroom modality plays in the knowledge retention of medical students with a background in traditional methods of teaching and learning.This study employed a mixed study design among a sample of 3rd year medical students (n=193) in the neurosciences course block. The students were divided into two groups: experimental and control. A post-test, a questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews as research instruments were used to collect data in this study. Methods This study employed a mixed study design among a sample of 3rd year medical students (n=193) in the neurosciences course block. The students were divided into two groups: experimental and control. A post-test, a questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews as research instruments were used to collect data in this study.The results revealed a significant mean difference between the post-test scores in traditional (4.1±0.98) and flipped classroom (3.6±1.03) with a p-value=0.01, while no mean difference was found between male and female students (3.9±1.04, 3.9±1.02, p-value=0.77). The students appreciated the flipped classroom modality that helped with information sharing, interaction with peers and learning from others' experiences. Correspondingly, the four main characteristics of flipped classroom emerged from the thematic analysis: (1) positive perceptions of the flipped classroom, (2) challenges of the flipped classroom, (3) the effects of personal characteristics, and (4) lack of administration support. Results The results revealed a significant mean difference between the post-test scores in traditional (4.1±0.98) and flipped classroom (3.6±1.03) with a p-value=0.01, while no mean difference was found between male and female students (3.9±1.04, 3.9±1.02, p-value=0.77).

Correspondingly, the four main characteristics of flipped classroom emerged from the thematic analysis: (1) positive perceptions of the flipped classroom, (2) challenges of the flipped classroom, (3) the effects of personal characteristics, and (4) lack of administration support.The performance of students was better in the traditional class than in the flipped classroom, particularly in the cognitive areas that deal with the interpretation and application of knowledge. The students taking responsibility for their own learning in this new modality and the short duration of the study might have had some influence on the study results. Future in-depth studies are recommended.

    "Abstract": "Purpose > This paper presents an educational virtual reality (VR) game and experiments with different methods of including it into the teaching process. The purpose of this research study is to discover if immersive VR games can be used as an effective pedagogical tool if blended with traditional lectures by assisting learning gain, memory and knowledge retention while increasing edutainment value. Design/methodology/approach > This research design comprises three different methods of learning: lecture-based involving lecture slides, infographics, and a video, game-based involving an immersive VR game of oil rig exploration, and the combination of lecture and game-based. Participants of each method filled up a questionnaire before and after participation to measure the learning gain, memory, and knowledge retention. Findings > From the predominant findings of the study, the combined method demonstrated a significant increase in learning gain, memory, and knowledge retention and maybe a potentially suitable pedagogical tool. Research limitations/implications > Limitations of the study include findings based on one VR game with a specific educational topic, additionally, it is suspected that having different participants for each of the three methods may have slightly affected the results, albeit to a limited extent. Practical implications > Findings of this study will provide evidence that VR games can be used alongside traditional lectures to aid in the learning process. Educators can choose to include VR games into their curriculums to improve the educational delivery process. Originality/value > This research contributes to ways of incorporating VR games into educational curriculums through findings of this study highlighting the combination of VR games with lectures.",

    "Abstract": "The quality of people's daily lives is dependent on the functioning of natural systems - ecosystem services. These services are essential for social and economic development of our society and for ensuring the well-being of humans. This dependency is not easily understandable, as it is non-linear. The use of games has been proven a successful method in teaching complex systems. Games can improve, besides knowledge, students' social and academic achievement, promote students' motivation, improve their critical thinking and co-operation skills. In this research we assessed how an ecosystem services themed board game „End of the World Begins in Kurtna\" supports students' ability to understand the relationship between humans and nature. We evaluated the game's potential as an educational tool to foster better comprehension of the concept of ecosystem services. To validate the game's usability and learning value, game sessions were conducted with more than a hundred students. To collect their knowledge about both ecosystem services and nature, their attitudes towards the game and their subjective assessment of their own knowledge, pre-test and post-test questionnaires were used and the data was analysed using mixed methods. The results present that the game enhances the understanding of relations between humans and nature and helps to notice causality related to the subject. The game makes players perceive the human impact on nature and creates a positive attitude towards protecting the natural environment. The majority of respondents found the game to be interesting and engaging. Since interest and engagement are closely related to motivation we conclude that the game also has a positive effect on learning motivation. We conclude that board games can be suitable means for understanding complex terms such as ecosystem services. The game is applicable for enriching natural science education and is a good supporting material for teaching. However, since we did not measure knowledge retention over a long period of time we cannot confirm the game's ability to enable deeper understanding of the subject.",

    "Abstract": "New types of workflows are being used in science that couple traditional distributed and high-performance computing (HPC) with data-intensive approaches, and orchestrate ensembles of numerical simulations and artificial intelligence (AI) models. Such workflows may use AI models to supplement computation where numerical simulations may be too computationally expensive, to automate trivial yet time consuming operations, to perform preliminary selections among intractable numbers of combinations in domains as diverse as protein binding, fine-grid climate simulations, and drug discovery. They offer renewed opportunities for scientific research but exhibit high computational, storage and communications requirements [Goble et al. 2020,Al-Saadi et al. 2021,da Silva et al. 2021]. These workflows can be orchestrated by workflow management systems (WMS) and built upon composable blocks that facilitate task placement and resource allocation for parallel executions on high performance systems [Lee et al. 2021,Merzky et al. 2021]. The scientific computing communities running these kinds of workflows have been slow to adopt Findable, Accessible, Interpretable, and Re-usable (FAIR) principles, in part due to the complexity of workflow life cycles, the numerous WMS, and the specificity of HPC systems with rapidly evolving architectures and software stacks, and execution modes that require resource managers and batch schedulers [Plale et al. 2021]. FAIR Digital Objects (FDO) that encapsulate bit sequences of data, metadata, types and persistent identifiers (PID) can help promote the adoption of FAIR, enable knowledge extraction and dissemination, and contribute to re-use [De Smedt et al. 2020]. As workflows typically use data and software during planning and execution, FDOs are particularly adapted to enable re-use [Wittenburg et al. 2020]. But the benefits of FDOs such as automating data processing and actionable DO collections cannot be realized without the main components of FAIR, rich metadata and clear identifiers, being universally adopted in the community. These components are still elusive for HPC digital objects. Some metadata are added after results have been produced, are not described by controlled vocabularies, and typically left unconstrained, resulting in inefficient processes and loss of knowledge. Persistent identifiers are added at the time of publication to data supporting conclusions, so only a very small amount of data are being shared outside a small community of researchers “in the know”. In this conceptual work, one can distinguish several kinds of FDOs for HPC workflows that present both common and specific challenges to the development of canonical DO infrastructure and the implementation of FDO workflows that we discuss below: result FDOs represent computational results obtained when program execution complete, performance FDOs that contain performance measures and results from code optimization on parallel, heterogeneous architectures, intermediate FDOs from intermediate states of workflow execution, obtained from HPC checkpointing. All these FDOs for HPC workflows should include the computing environment and system specifications on which code was executed for metadata rich enough to enable re-usability [Pouchard et al. 2019]. Containers are often being used to capture dependencies between underlying libraries and versions in the execution environment for the installation and re-use of software code [Lofstead et al. 2015,Olaya et al. 2020]. But containers published in code repositories are made available without identifiers registered with resolvers. For instance, to attribute a Digital Object Identifier to software shared in github, one must perform the additional step of registering the code into Zenodo. FDOs extracted and built in the context of a canonical workflow framework including collections will help with the attribution of persistent identifiers and the linking of execution environment with data and workflow. Computational results may include machine learning predictions resulting form stochastic training of non-deterministic models. Neural networks and deep learning models present specific challenges to result FDOs related to provenance and the selection of quantities needed to include in an FDO for the re-use of results. What information needs to be included in a FAIR Digital Object encapsulating deep learning results to make it persistent and re-usable? The description of method, data and experiment recommended in [Gundersen and Kjensmo 2018] can be instantiated in a FDO collection. To make it re-usable, it should include the model architecture, the machine learning platform and its version, a submission script that contains hyperparameters, the loss function, batch size and number of epochs [Pouchard et al. 2020]. Challenges specific to digital objects containing performance measures for HPC workflows are those related to size, selection and reduction. Performance data at scale tends to be very large, thus a principled approach to selection is needed to determine which execution counters must be included in FDOs for performance reproducibility of an application [Patki et al. 2019]. Performance FDOs should include the variables selected to show their impact on performance and the methods used for selection: do such variables represent outliers in performance metrics? What methods and thresholds are used to qualify as outliers, what impact do these outliers have on overall performance of an execution? A key contributor to the failure to capture important information in HPC workflows is that metadata and provenance capture is often “bolted on” after the fact and in a piecemeal, cumbersome, inefficient manner that impedes further analysis. An FDO approach including DO collections at the appropriate level of abstraction and rich metadata is needed. Capturing metadata automatically must take into account the appropriate granularity level for re-use across system layers and abstraction levels. Intermediate FDOs capture and fuse metadata across multiple sources during the planning and execution stages [Nicolae 2022]. Some tools already exist. Darshan is a scalable tool summarizing Input/Output file characteristics [Dai et al. 2019], Radical Cybertools [Merzky et al. 2021] can produce the provenance task graph of an execution. Such tools could be included in a canonical workflow framework as they present a path forward for composable services for HPC and would guarantee a level of encapsulation into DOs favorable to re-use.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose We evaluated the impact of a virtual Pediatric Surgery Bootcamp curriculum on resource utilization, learner engagement, knowledge retention, and stakeholder satisfaction. Methods A virtual curriculum was developed around Pediatric Surgery Milestones. GlobalCastMD delivered pre-recorded and live content over a single 10-h day with a concluding social hour. Metrics of learner engagement, faculty interaction, knowledge retention, and satisfaction were collected and analyzed during and after the course. Results Of 56 PS residencies, 31 registered (55.4%; 8/8 Canadian and 23/48 US; p  = 0.006), including 42 learners overall. The virtual BC budget was $15,500 (USD), 54% of the anticipated in-person course. Pre- and post-tests were administered, revealing significant knowledge improvement (48.6% [286/589] vs 66.9% [89/133] p  < 0.0002). Learner surveys ( n  = 14) suggested the virtual BC facilitated fellowship transition (85%) and strengthened peer-group camaraderie (69%), but in-person events were still favored (77%). Program Directors (PD) were surveyed, and respondents ( n  = 22) also favored in-person events (61%). PDs not registering their learners ( n  = 7) perceived insufficient value-added and concern for excessive participants. Conclusions The virtual bootcamp format reduced overall expenses, interfered less with schedules, achieved more inclusive reach, and facilitated content archiving. Despite these advantages, learners and program directors still favored in-person education. Level of evidence III.",

The design of cards with valid and reliable questions is essential in gamification; however, such cards are still lacking in cardiovascular emergency learning.To develop and validate cardiovascular emergency question cards for the future use of gamification for education regarding cardiovascular emergencies among undergraduate nursing students. OBJECTIVES To develop and validate cardiovascular emergency question cards for the future use of gamification for education regarding cardiovascular emergencies among undergraduate nursing students.The development process included two phases: designing the question cards and testing validity evidence. A table of specifications was used to select and assign questions based on three levels with six learning outcome categories. Five nurse experts assessed the evidence based on test content, including the relevance, clarity, and essentiality of the questions. Seven final-year nursing students evaluated the evidence based on the response process. After revision, 61 nursing students evaluated the internal consistency reliability of each level. METHODS The development process included two phases: designing the question cards and testing validity evidence. A table of specifications was used to select and assign questions based on three levels with six learning outcome categories. Five nurse experts assessed the evidence based on test content, including the relevance, clarity, and essentiality of the questions. Seven final-year nursing students evaluated the evidence based on the response process. After revision, 61 nursing students evaluated the internal consistency reliability of each level.In the design phase, ninety English question cards were categorized into three levels based on the learning outcomes expected in an undergraduate emergency nursing course. Most of the questions were multiple-choice questions, and some were short answer questions. The final item-content validity index = 1.00, the scale-content validity index/universal agreement = 1.00, and the content validity ratio = 1.00. Cronbach's α for internal structure was 0.81 for level I (n = 61), 0.92 for level II (n = 54), and 0.81 for level III (n = 46).

In the future, testing the feasibility of applying the question cards to gamification and assessing their learning effect on cardiovascular emergency knowledge retention will be necessary. CONCLUSION The cardiovascular emergency question cards showed acceptable evidence based on the test content, response process, and internal structure.

BACKGROUND Active engagement of nursing students has deteriorated overtime, especially during the global pandemic. Therefore, there has been a widespread search for learning methods that incorporate digital technologies and active student participation in recent years. Game-based learning may be an option, as it uses game-design elements to enhance academic performance and learning.

OBJECTIVES The literature review aimed to explore student experience and learning when using game-based learning and to understand its uses in the nursing curriculum.Systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis. DESIGN Systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis.ESBCO Discovery Service was used to search healthcare, science and education-related databases. DATA SOURCES ESBCO Discovery Service was used to search healthcare, science and education-related databases.A comprehensive search of English language primary research published between 2017 and 2022 on the use of game-based learning in nursing undergraduate education was conducted. Data was analysed using thematic analysis. REVIEW METHODS A comprehensive search of English language primary research published between 2017 and 2022 on the use of game-based learning in nursing undergraduate education was conducted. Data was analysed using thematic analysis.Seventeen papers from 4 different countries were included. The studies explored interventions and subjects of increased teaching complexity that required increased levels of knowledge retention and critical thinking, such as nursing theory and complex clinical skills. Three themes emerged from the literature, including: approaches to game-based learning; student experience and engagement; impact of game-based learning on student learning and knowledge retention. Studies used a wide range of learning methods, such as quizzes, escape rooms and serious games. These methods were in general well-accepted by students, who endorsed its widespread use in the nursing curriculum. Most studies reported an increase in student experience and learning when using game-based learning, although time-limited games can often increase anxiety on students.

    "Abstract": "Public events such as state fairs provide valuable opportunities to provide informal animal welfare education, possibly changing people’s decisions regarding animal welfare. This study evaluated whether an interactive animal-free exhibit increased visitors’ self-reported knowledge and stated behavioral intentions related to animal welfare. The exhibit featured information about the behavior and welfare of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, poultry, horses, cats and dogs. Survey data were collected at two events in the Midwestern United States (Purdue University Spring Fest (FEST): n = 32; Indiana State Fair (FAIR): n = 49 valid responses). Most people agreed and strongly agreed (FEST: 60.00%; FAIR: 74.47%) that they learned new information and would consider this information when making decisions (FAIR: 70.37%; FAIR: 76.19). Most people (FEST: 67.86%; FAIR: 71.11%) also stated that they had a better understanding of animal welfare after visiting the exhibit. These findings indicate that an animal welfare exhibit can positively influence visitors’ self-reported knowledge and stated decisions about animal welfare. Future research is needed to examine the long-term impacts of animal welfare exhibits on knowledge retention, decisions and behavior.",

BACKGROUND Although intraoperative educational videos have become increasingly popular, comparatively few videos teach clinical reasoning for surgical procedures. The objectives of this study were to develop an engaging online video-based module to teach decision-making for cubital tunnel surgery, including supercharge nerve transfer, using a multimedia learning framework; and evaluate its effectiveness and use for continuing professional development.The educational module consisted of a prelecture knowledge assessment, choice of two self-guided video lectures (7 minutes and 28 minutes), and a postlecture knowledge assessment. An additional assessment examined knowledge retention 3 months after module completion. Surgeon surveys were administered after each knowledge assessment. METHODS The educational module consisted of a prelecture knowledge assessment, choice of two self-guided video lectures (7 minutes and 28 minutes), and a postlecture knowledge assessment. An additional assessment examined knowledge retention 3 months after module completion. Surgeon surveys were administered after each knowledge assessment.A total of 279 surgeons participated in the educational module (75 percent practicing surgeons, 25 percent trainees), 112 surgeons completed the postlecture assessment, and 71 surgeons completed the knowledge retention assessment. Median score on the prelecture assessment was five out of 10 (interquartile range, four to seven). Scores improved by three points (10-point scale; p < 0.0001) in the postlecture assessment. Median score on the knowledge retention assessment was eight out of 10 (interquartile range, six to nine), with participants maintaining a two-point increase from their prelecture score ( p = 0.0002). Among surgeons completing this assessment, 68 percent reported that the module had changed their management of cubital tunnel syndrome.

    "Abstract": "We evaluated the impact of a virtual Pediatric Surgery Bootcamp curriculum on resource utilization, learner engagement, knowledge retention, and stakeholder satisfaction. PURPOSE We evaluated the impact of a virtual Pediatric Surgery Bootcamp curriculum on resource utilization, learner engagement, knowledge retention, and stakeholder satisfaction.A virtual curriculum was developed around Pediatric Surgery Milestones. GlobalCastMD delivered pre-recorded and live content over a single 10-h day with a concluding social hour. Metrics of learner engagement, faculty interaction, knowledge retention, and satisfaction were collected and analyzed during and after the course. METHODS A virtual curriculum was developed around Pediatric Surgery Milestones. GlobalCastMD delivered pre-recorded and live content over a single 10-h day with a concluding social hour. Metrics of learner engagement, faculty interaction, knowledge retention, and satisfaction were collected and analyzed during and after the course.Of 56 PS residencies, 31 registered (55.4%; 8/8 Canadian and 23/48 US; p = 0.006), including 42 learners overall. The virtual BC budget was $15,500 (USD), 54% of the anticipated in-person course. Pre- and post-tests were administered, revealing significant knowledge improvement (48.6% [286/589] vs 66.9% [89/133] p < 0.0002). Learner surveys (n = 14) suggested the virtual BC facilitated fellowship transition (85%) and strengthened peer-group camaraderie (69%), but in-person events were still favored (77%). Program Directors (PD) were surveyed, and respondents (n = 22) also favored in-person events (61%). PDs not registering their learners (n = 7) perceived insufficient value-added and concern for excessive participants. RESULTS Of 56 PS residencies, 31 registered (55.4%; 8/8 Canadian and 23/48 US; p = 0.006), including 42 learners overall.

PDs not registering their learners (n = 7) perceived insufficient value-added and concern for excessive participants.The virtual bootcamp format reduced overall expenses, interfered less with schedules, achieved more inclusive reach, and facilitated content archiving. Despite these advantages, learners and program directors still favored in-person education. CONCLUSIONS The virtual bootcamp format reduced overall expenses, interfered less with schedules, achieved more inclusive reach, and facilitated content archiving. Despite these advantages, learners and program directors still favored in-person education.III. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE III.",

PURPOSE To determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an Advanced Practice Provider (APP) led smoking cessation counseling service integrated into the preanesthesia evaluation for adults preparing for an elective procedure who smoke.Quasi experimental study. DESIGN Quasi experimental study.An educational in-service was provided to staff members in the Preanesthesia Testing Clinic prior to the integration of the smoking cessation counseling intervention. Knowledge retention was assessed using a pre- and post-test. After the training was complete, staff members began to identify eligible individuals for smoking cessation counseling. Individuals who met the inclusion criteria were stratified into two groups based on their perioperative risk and medical history. High-risk individuals were counseled immediately by the APP. Low risk individuals were first screened by the Registered Nurse and internally referred to the APP for cessation counseling. Those who received smoking cessation counseling were referred to third party smoking cessation support services for ongoing follow up.

    "Abstract": "Prehospital trauma care guidelines and instruction have advanced significantly over the past 20 years. Although there have been efforts to create a standardized approach to instruction, the use of unorthodox techniques that lack supporting evidence persists. Many instructors use unrealistic scenarios, \"no-win\" scenarios, and unavoidable failing situations to train students. Doing so, however, creates student confusion and frustration and can result in poor skill acquisition. These training techniques should be reconsidered, with focus placed instead on the development of technical skills and far skill transfer. Knowing when to apply the appropriate type and level of stress within a training scenario can maximize student learning and knowledge retention. Furthermore, modalities such as deliberate practice, cognitive load theory (CLT), and stress exposure training (SET) should be incorporated into training. To improve delivery of prehospital trauma education, instructors should adopt evidence-based educational strategies, grounded in educational and cognitive science, that are targeted at developing long-term information retention as well as consistent, accurate, and timely life-saving interventions.Prehospital trauma care guidelines and instruction have advanced significantly over the past 20 years.

    "Abstract": "Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the addition of standardized patients or the addition of interprofessional student teams with standardized patients to the use of a simulated electronic health record improved student knowledge retention and perceptions. Methods. This was a prospective cohort study assessing three cohorts of first-year student pharmacists in pharmacy skills laboratory activities that occurred in 2018,2019, and 2021. The primary obj ective of the study was to compare knowledge retention of the case material between groups at one month. Each year, an element of simulated experience was added onto the previous year's case. In 2018, students completed the case using only the electronic health record web application. In 2019, the previous year's experience was combined with an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) with standardized patients. In 2021, the 2019 experience was supplemented with student physician assistants. Case scores and student perceptions were also compared between groups. Results. Of the 260 potential participants, 238 students were included in the primary analysis. Results showed that with the addition of interprofessional team-based care and standardized patients, significant improvement was demonstrated in knowledge retention assessments at one month. Mean knowledge retention assessment scores for the 2018,2019, and 2021 groups were 63.8%, 71.7%, and 76.1%, respectively. Significant improvement was also found in student perceptions. Conclusion. Adding standardized patients and interprofessional team-based care to a pharmacy skills laboratory that uses a simulated electronic health record significantly improved student knowledge retention and perceptions.",

    "Abstract": "Recent calls for reform in K‐12 science education and the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st Century emphasize improving science teaching, students' engagement, and learning. In this study, we designed and implemented a curriculum unit for sixth‐grade students ( i = 1305). The curriculum unit integrated science and engineering content and practices to teach ecology, water pollution, and engineering design. We investigated the designed integrated STEM unit's effectiveness in students' science learning outcomes on pre‐, post‐, and delayed post‐assessments. We collected pre‐and post‐assessment data of students' science learning outcomes for both the baseline group (taught via existing district‐adopted curriculum) and an intervention group (taught with integrated life science and engineering curriculum). We used a quasi‐experimental research design and examined differences between baseline and intervention groups. We used ANCOVA to explore differences in students' learning in baseline and intervention groups. Furthermore, for students in the intervention group, we conducted repeated‐measures ANOVA to investigate knowledge retention. Our analyses also accounted for students' gender and People of Color (POC) status. We conducted multiple regression analyses to explore the relationship between students' gender, POC status, and their learning outcomes. The results indicated that the intervention group students performed significantly better than the students in the baseline group. The repeated measures ANOVA showed that students in the intervention group retained science knowledge after 8 weeks of instruction. Finally, the regression analysis for the baseline group showed that gender and POC status were not significant predictors of their post‐assessment scores. However, POC status was a significant predictor of post‐assessment scores and knowledge retention for the intervention group. Overall, this study provides valuable findings on how an integrated STEM curriculum designed with engineering design and practices improves students' science learning outcomes.

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and practices about vaccination in adults with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIRD) among primary care physicians (PCPs), internal medicine specialists (IMSs), and rheumatologists and to emphasize the importance of vaccination. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and practices about vaccination in adults with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIRD) among primary care physicians (PCPs), internal medicine specialists (IMSs), and rheumatologists and to emphasize the importance of vaccination.Between March 2021 and April 2021, a total of 310 IMSs, PCPs, and rheumatologists (132 males, 178 females; mean age: 37.4±9.5 years; range, 24 to 64 years) were included. A web-based questionnaire was used in the study. Patients and methods Between March 2021 and April 2021, a total of 310 IMSs, PCPs, and rheumatologists (132 males, 178 females; mean age: 37.4±9.5 years; range, 24 to 64 years) were included. A web-based questionnaire was used in the study.Of the physicians, 87.7% were aware of that patients with AIRD were among adults with vaccination indications, but 53.9% reported that they knew about recommended vaccines, and 53.2% recommended vaccines to their patients. The most common reasons for not recommending vaccination were reservations about the drugs used (22.3%) and lack of information (17.7%). Those with longer practice as physicians and older physicians had less knowledge about the vaccine than the other participants. While 59.7% of the participants thought that the vaccination plans of the patients should be made by the rheumatologist, the rate of PCPs who did not prefer to apply the planned vaccines in the first step was 50.7%. A total of 50% of the participants did not recommend the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine in a primary healthcare institution to those receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Results Of the physicians, 87.7% were aware of that patients with AIRD were among adults with vaccination indications, but 53.9% reported that they knew about recommended vaccines, and 53.2% recommended vaccines to their patients.

A total of 50% of the participants did not recommend the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine in a primary healthcare institution to those receiving immunosuppressive therapy.Considering that one of the major obstacles to adult vaccination is the physician's refusal to recommend it, our study highlights the missing points in the vaccination knowledge and approach of physicians. Providing advice on adult vaccination and immunization of risky groups to more physicians and periodic training to prevent loss of knowledge after graduation may contribute to an increase in the vaccination rate of adults with AIRD.

    "Abstract": "The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) Pharmacy-Based Immunization Delivery Certificate Program is commonly used by schools of pharmacy to train student pharmacists in immunizations.

The impact of immunization experience on students' knowledge retention was a secondary objective. INTRODUCTION The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) Pharmacy-Based Immunization Delivery Certificate Program is commonly used by schools of pharmacy to train student pharmacists in immunizations. This study compared student pharmacists' knowledge retention of immunization content when the live seminar of the APhA Program was delivered as a one-day co-curricular activity or as a five-week required course. The impact of immunization experience on students' knowledge retention was a secondary objective.A 45-question knowledge assessment about immunizations was administered to second and third-year student pharmacists eight months after completing either a five-week course (second-year students) or a one-day seminar (third-year students). Students were also asked about their experience providing patient education, screening, and administering immunizations. METHODS A 45-question knowledge assessment about immunizations was administered to second and third-year student pharmacists eight months after completing either a five-week course (second-year students) or a one-day seminar (third-year students). Students were also asked about their experience providing patient education, screening, and administering immunizations.Knowledge assessment scores declined by an average of 26.3% from the initial to the eight-month assessment, and declines were similar for second and third-year students. However, students who reported immunizing over 50 patients had significantly higher knowledge retention than those who reported never immunizing. RESULTS Knowledge assessment scores declined by an average of 26.3% from the initial to the eight-month assessment, and declines were similar for second and third-year students. However, students who reported immunizing over 50 patients had significantly higher knowledge retention than those who reported never immunizing.A live immunization training given over one day or five weeks did not impact the retention of immunization knowledge eight months later. However, students who immunized >50 patients had greater knowledge retention. These findings indicate the importance of including the application of immunization knowledge in pharmacy curricula to enhance long-term knowledge retention. CONCLUSIONS A live immunization training given over one day or five weeks did not impact the retention of immunization knowledge eight months later.

    "Abstract": "Since the early 2000s, the government of Kazakhstan has been promoting educational reforms in higher education including introducing English-medium instruction (EMI), trilingual education (education in Kazakh, Russian, and English), and requirements of students and faculty to publish in impact factor. Within this context, the purpose of this paper is to use the lenses of political economy and linguistic justice to interpret interview data from students, faculty, and administrators of six Kazakhstani universities implementing trilingual education. These data show that some stakeholders believe English is the language of science, and it is therefore necessary to read, study, and publish in English. Competing voices argue that privileging English will lead to a loss of knowledge from local scholars who are not proficient in English. The data indicate that stakeholders believe the pursuit of EMI and English academic publishing may achieve the goals of global competitiveness and economic development under a political lens, but at a cost to the linguistic justice of languages other than English and speakers of those languages.",

    "Abstract": "Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) can be challenging to implement with fidelity to the model. Residential treatment settings are frequently overlooked as sites of implementation for DBT despite the potential benefits. This mixed-methods process evaluation examines the impact of DBT training in five residential programs on provider DBT-specific knowledge, staff turnover rates, and staff perceptions of training impact on their practice. Post-training staff knowledge levels varied considerably, but on average demonstrated substantial DBT-related knowledge retention. Staff turnover rates did not change significantly in four of five programs despite showing an overall trend in reduction. Qualitative results suggest substantial recursive training effects consistent with the DBT model. Themes emerged related to the impact of the training on effectiveness of practice with clients, application of DBT skills in staff personal lives, and positive effects on program culture. Results have implications for better understanding the mechanisms of successful dissemination of DBT across treatment settings.",

    "Abstract": "Background Despite the implementation of essential newborn care (ENC) by the World Health Organization, knowledge gaps among postpartum women persist. Inappropriate breastfeeding practices and lack of knowledge regarding ENC among mothers has resulted in higher neonatal mortality. Purpose Our study focused on evaluating the effectiveness of flip-chart assisted postpartum maternal education in improving ENC knowledge and skills. Material and Methods A single blind parallel randomized controlled trial was carried out with 120 primigravidae. Participants were allocated to the intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG) by block randomization. A pretested validated questionnaire was administered to participants in both groups within 24 h post-delivery. Women in the IG were provided flip-chart assisted education regarding ENC approximately 24 h post-delivery. Women in both groups received verbal advice on ENC from the postnatal ward nurses, as per the existing hospital policy. ENC skills were observed in all participants in postnatal wards by independent observers. 6 months later, knowledge retention was assessed and analyzed in both groups. Results Antenatal education remained at 32% among all postnatal women. Postnatal flip-chart-assisted maternal education had a significant impact on ENC skills in the IG (p < 0.01) and precipitated higher knowledge scores at the end of 6 months (p < 0.01) in the IG. Conclusion for Practice Flip-chart assisted education soon after delivery had a sustained effect on ENC knowledge and practices that persisted for 6 months post-delivery.",

    "Abstract": "Recent calls for reform in K‐12 science education and the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st Century emphasize improving science teaching, students' engagement, and learning. In this study, we designed and implemented a curriculum unit for sixth‐grade students ( i  = 1305). The curriculum unit integrated science and engineering content and practices to teach ecology, water pollution, and engineering design. We investigated the designed integrated STEM unit's effectiveness in students' science learning outcomes on pre‐, post‐, and delayed post‐assessments. We collected pre‐and post‐assessment data of students' science learning outcomes for both the baseline group (taught via existing district‐adopted curriculum) and an intervention group (taught with integrated life science and engineering curriculum). We used a quasi‐experimental research design and examined differences between baseline and intervention groups. We used ANCOVA to explore differences in students' learning in baseline and intervention groups. Furthermore, for students in the intervention group, we conducted repeated‐measures ANOVA to investigate knowledge retention. Our analyses also accounted for students' gender and People of Color (POC) status. We conducted multiple regression analyses to explore the relationship between students' gender, POC status, and their learning outcomes. The results indicated that the intervention group students performed significantly better than the students in the baseline group. The repeated measures ANOVA showed that students in the intervention group retained science knowledge after 8 weeks of instruction. Finally, the regression analysis for the baseline group showed that gender and POC status were not significant predictors of their post‐assessment scores. However, POC status was a significant predictor of post‐assessment scores and knowledge retention for the intervention group. Overall, this study provides valuable findings on how an integrated STEM curriculum designed with engineering design and practices improves students' science learning outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Information-seeking behaviour is the process of acquiring information from sources in response to a need. The acquired information can then be transferred into knowledge for use, archiving, or sharing. This study investigates the information-seeking behaviour and knowledge transfer among food industry business (fbiz) owners in Kuwait, and how these differ across generations of fbiz owners. Eighteen interviews with 10 large fbiz owners from different generations were carried out. The study found that the information needs of fbiz owners changed at different stages of their business. For information seeking, fbiz members consult a variety of information sources, with the newer generation relying more on online sources than word-of-mouth. Both paper-and-computer-based archiving is used, but information loss remains a threat. Effective knowledge transfer requires better communication between generations and appropriate archiving systems. Each fbiz in Kuwait, irrespective of generation, is required to follow Islamic law. This study brings together the related but differing fields of information behaviour and knowledge management. Most importantly, it contributes two models—a family business information behaviour model and a family business knowledge retention and transfer model that would be useful to the research and practice of information behaviour and knowledge management in family businesses.",

    "Abstract": "Most literature on Amazigh (Berber) in Morocco and in the Journal of North African Studies revolve around historical, social and political issues. Literature also covers issues of Berber cultural recognition, linguistic identity, and colonization. However, little is known of the ethnobotanical knowledge associated with the traditional way of life that maintains the livelihood and health of Berber communities in isolated regions of the High Atlas. In this paper, we aim to identify whether ethnobotanical knowledge is eroding and whether geographical isolation shapes its transmission in the context of globalization. This paper focuses on the differences between men's and women's medicinal plant knowledge. We conducted ethnographic and ethnobotanical fieldwork over 33 months interviewing 51 men and 146 women in ten villages with different degrees of access to urban areas and modern commodities and services. We used and analyzed quantitative data drawn from plants’ free listing to assess whether ethnobotanical knowledge is eroding. Our results show that gendered differences in ethnobotanical knowledge are concomitant of integration to market economies, revealing significant knowledge retention differences in the most isolated study sites. We conclude that despite strong forces at work to integrate remote communities into globalized markets, there are important risks to TEK which supports local environmental and community health.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose > This study aims to investigate whether and how a high turnover rate stimulates employees to engage more in learning behavior. Design/methodology/approach > Drawing on self-regulation theory, the authors suggest that the motive for employees to engage in learning behavior is to improve themselves. Such a need can be activated when they reflect on themselves and realize the discrepancy between their current selves and desired future selves. The authors argue that the employees’ perceived poor performance at daily work may induce their desire for self-improvement via making the future work selves salient, and in turn engage more in learning behavior. This is particularly so when turnover rate is high because employees may be alert of and concerned more about their own poor performance. In an experience sampling study, the authors obtained evidence for these hypotheses. Findings > When turnover rate was high, employees’ poor performance increased salience of future work selves, which in turn facilitated their learning behavior. This relationship was not significant when turnover rate was low. Originality/value > Contrary to the typical view that high turnover rate leads to knowledge loss for the companies, the present study findings suggest that it could also serve as a motivational factor facilitating employees’ learning behavior, which is an important way to increase knowledge pool of the companies.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Despite the implementation of essential newborn care (ENC) by the World Health Organization, knowledge gaps among postpartum women persist. Inappropriate breastfeeding practices and lack of knowledge regarding ENC among mothers has resulted in higher neonatal mortality. Purpose: Our study focused on evaluating the effectiveness of flip-chart assisted postpartum maternal education in improving ENC knowledge and skills. Material and Methods: A single blind parallel randomized controlled trial was carried out with 120 primigravidae. Participants were allocated to the intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG) by block randomization. A pretested validated questionnaire was administered to participants in both groups within 24 h post-delivery. Women in the IG were provided flip-chart assisted education regarding ENC approximately 24 h post-delivery. Women in both groups received verbal advice on ENC from the postnatal ward nurses, as per the existing hospital policy. ENC skills were observed in all participants in postnatal wards by independent observers. 6 months later, knowledge retention was assessed and analyzed in both groups. Results: Antenatal education remained at 32% among all postnatal women. Postnatal flip-chart-assisted maternal education had a significant impact on ENC skills in the IG (p < 0.01) and precipitated higher knowledge scores at the end of 6 months (p < 0.01) in the IG. Conclusion for Practice: Flip-chart assisted education soon after delivery had a sustained effect on ENC knowledge and practices that persisted for 6 months post-delivery.

    "Abstract": "Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) can be challenging to implement with fidelity to the model. Residential treatment settings are frequently overlooked as sites of implementation for DBT despite the potential benefits. This mixed-methods process evaluation examines the impact of DBT training in five residential programs on provider DBT-specific knowledge, staff turnover rates, and staff perceptions of training impact on their practice. Post-training staff knowledge levels varied considerably, but on average demonstrated substantial DBT-related knowledge retention. Staff turnover rates did not change significantly in four of five programs despite showing an overall trend in reduction. Qualitative results suggest substantial recursive training effects consistent with the DBT model. Themes emerged related to the impact of the training on effectiveness of practice with clients, application of DBT skills in staff personal lives, and positive effects on program culture. Results have implications for better understanding the mechanisms of successful dissemination of DBT across treatment settings.

Existing serious games involving waste management are complex in their data ingestion, use, and presentation, limiting individuals' opportunities to gain knowledge and decision-making skills transferrable to the real world.

    "Abstract": "Background and objective Face-to-face hospital induction has been reported to lead to information overload with poor knowledge retention. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has provided an opportunity to redesign the induction process, thereby taking it into the digital age. In this study, we aimed to discuss a comprehensive and effective approach toward the induction of medical students. Methods A video was filmed on an iPhone (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA), edited using the iMovie program (Apple Inc.), and shared with students before the start of the placement. It included a walk-through of the hospital and an explanation of educational opportunities. Pre- and post-placement questionnaires were distributed and focus groups were conducted. Results Our findings revealed that the participants strongly preferred virtual induction, feeling more confident about where to go, and who to contact, and better orientated on day one of their placement. They felt that being able to re-watch the induction at their convenience was invaluable. Discussion COVID-19 has brought about rapid digitalisation of medical services. The feedback from our study shows that virtual induction improved the well-being of students during their placement. By using easily accessible equipment, we have produced a useful resource that can be easily recreated by others.Background and objective Face-to-face hospital induction has been reported to lead to information overload with poor knowledge retention. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has provided an opportunity to redesign the induction process, thereby taking it into the digital age. In this study, we aimed to discuss a comprehensive and effective approach toward the induction of medical students. Methods A video was filmed on an iPhone (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA), edited using the iMovie program (Apple Inc.), and shared with students before the start of the placement. It included a walk-through of the hospital and an explanation of educational opportunities. Pre- and post-placement questionnaires were distributed and focus groups were conducted. Results Our findings revealed that the participants strongly preferred virtual induction, feeling more confident about where to go, and who to contact, and better orientated on day one of their placement. They felt that being able to re-watch the induction at their convenience was invaluable. Discussion COVID-19 has brought about rapid digitalisation of medical services. The feedback from our study shows that virtual induction improved the well-being of students during their placement. By using easily accessible equipment, we have produced a useful resource that can be easily recreated by others.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Mentorship should be a transformative experience that propels mentees from one point in their career to another and drives personal growth. Within the field of maternal and child health (MCH), it is considered a critical professional duty. However, MCH has yet to explicitly embrace mentorship practice as a means to address workforce challenges including turnover, knowledge loss, and undue burden on the part of historically oppressed individuals and communities to overturn oppressive systems. Call to Action We advocate for public calls for diversity and equity to be met with strategic enhancement of the practice of MCH mentorship. Transformative MCH mentorship should be used to promote positive identity formation, understanding of self in context, efficacy, and sustained commitment to working with MCH populations in ways that are inclusive and prevent the perpetration of the problematic power dynamics that lead to inequitable outcomes. Recommendations We present recommendations to strengthen MCH mentorship practice. At the individual level, there should be a refreshment of norms and expectations, where mentorship is seen as a uniquely flexible opportunity for mutual learning. At the organizational level, embedding mentorship in all aspects of practice helps establish and sustain a culture of belonging. This transformative organizational culture can attract and retain future generations of professionals that are not only more representative of the populations that MCH programs support but are prepared to authentically elevate the needs and strengths of those populations. These suggestions incorporate best practices from other fields and include ideas for the MCH field in particular.",

    "Abstract": "Agritourism is a type of ecological tourism that combines agricultural activities with tourism. There is a growing interest in this industry worldwide, which poses both opportunities and challenges for social and natural environments. Grounded on the theory of situated learning, we developed an augmented reality-based educational resource to promote eco-agritourism – namely, to promote agritourism while encouraging tourists to be environmentally responsible. This study presents the results of an educational experiment that compared the scores of students who were instructed using a combination of the augmented reality-based educational resource and the professor's guidance with those of students who were instructed only by the professor. The study analyzed the learning outcomes and the degree of users’ motivation to learn about aquaponics in an agritourism farm. The participants were 40 volunteers who had no previous knowledge about aquaponics. The results show that the resource has a medium effect size on learning gains and a large effect on knowledge retention. Likewise, the data indicates that the resource increased users’ motivation to learn and practice responsible agritourism. These results seem to indicate that augmented reality-based resources are appropriate for promoting eco-agritourism and encourage tourists to develop a positive bond with nature.",

    "Abstract": "Aims Gamification in medical education is an evolving concept. It can make learning fun, memorable and more effective. Some core paediatric topics like developmental milestones can be challenging for medical students to retain. Fun based learning relies on progress mechanics, and moderate evidence has been established for broader pedagogical purposes. Our research project was designed to compare lecture-based teaching versus game-based teaching on paediatric developmental milestones. Methods Virtual focus groups were carried out with year 4 and 5 Cardiff medical students. They were split into two groups, the lecture-based group and the game-based group. Each group did a 10-question quiz before and after the teaching to assess short-term memory retention. Each group also did a questionnaire of their views and experiences of the teaching methods. Results Quiz scores, on average, decreased by 6% after the lecture and increased by 8% after the game. These results support that game-based teaching of milestones is more effective for short-term knowledge retention. The decrease in scores for the lecture group is unexpected but could be attributed to didactic teaching. Both methods of teaching had similar scores for satisfaction with a variety of different strengths and weaknesses. Conclusion Our study has shown that gamification, when used effectively, can promote experiential learning. We have combined a theoretical framework with practical experience to develop a fun based learning activity. We have identified areas of improvement for our virtual game. We want to share our vision and promote the usage of gamification in undergraduate paediatric medical education.",

    "Abstract": "Aims Managing pediatric emergencies is a core competency for medical learners, however clinical exposure varies widely during training. Thus, the Hospital for Sick Children established a standardized simulation-based Junior Mock Code (JMC) curriculum ( figure 1 ) for first- and second-year residents. However, trainee and facilitator feedback identified persistent learning gaps, highlighting core pediatric emergencies that were missing from the original curriculum. We aimed to develop a hybrid simulation-based curriculum with complementary interactive asynchronous learning modules ( figure 2 ) to better bridge these gaps. Methods Using the Kern Curriculum Development Model, 1,2 we identified common clinical performance weaknesses, knowledge gaps, and low-frequency clinical exposures for junior trainees. We then prioritized the topics to be included in the new curriculum and established its goals and objectives: to provide supplement clinical exposure to core pediatric emergencies, including critical but low-frequency presentations (pediatric trauma and neonatal shock), through simulation-based education and complementary interactive asynchronous learning modules using the AffinityLearning™ platform. We launched our pilot in January 2022. Using Quality Improvement methodology including Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycles, we are conducting multiple iterations of feedback collection from learners and facilitators and subsequent curriculum revisions. Results Our first PDSA cycle was gathering stakeholder feedback from a departmental curriculum presentation prior to launch. Pediatric Emergency Medicine faculty and trainees overall responded very positively to the content changes from the previous curriculum and further feedback on logistics, academic potential, and networking opportunities was provided. These logistic suggestions were implemented in designing a curriculum dissemination protocol with administrative support staff. Our second cycle was a peer review of the module content and technological functionality by pediatric emergency medicine faculty and senior trainees, and feedback from this peer review was integrated prior to curriculum launch. Our current cycle started with curriculum implementation and focuses on learner reactions (Kirkpatrick level 1) and learner knowledge retention (Kirkpatrick level 2) outcomes based on feedback surveys for the asynchronous learning modules and aggregate learner performance reports on self-assessment activities embedded in each module. Abstract 789 Figure 1 Current Curriculum [Figure omitted. See PDF] Abstract 789 Figure 2 New Curriculum [Figure omitted. See PDF] Conclusion Future steps for this curriculum will include assessing trainee performance/competency scores during simulation sessions and correlating these with their performance on the preceding complementary asynchronous e-learning modules (Kirkpatrick level 3 learning outcomes). We will also continuously expand the library of e-learning modules to further bridge learning gaps for junior trainees, empowering them to reflect on their knowledge and areas for improvement as self-directed adult learners.

    "Abstract": "CPs and PPMVs are an important source of modern contraceptives in Nigeria, yet many lack the requisite knowledge and skills to capably provide these services. This skills gap might be addressed through targeted family planning (FP) training. This study measures family planning knowledge retention of CPs and PPMVs after receiving training in FP counseling and services in Kaduna and Lagos States, in Nigeria. BACKGROUND CPs and PPMVs are an important source of modern contraceptives in Nigeria, yet many lack the requisite knowledge and skills to capably provide these services. This skills gap might be addressed through targeted family planning (FP) training. This study measures family planning knowledge retention of CPs and PPMVs after receiving training in FP counseling and services in Kaduna and Lagos States, in Nigeria.In a quasi-experimental longitudinal design without a comparison group, 559 CPs and PPMVs who were enrolled in the IntegratE project between January and December 2019, completed a self-administered questionnaire to assess their knowledge related to the provision of FP counseling, and injectable and implant contraceptive services at three points in time: 1) before the training; 2) immediately after the training; and 3) 9-months after the training in Kaduna and Lagos states, Nigeria. Adjusted multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effect of provider characteristics and receipt of job aids on FP knowledge retention 9 months after the training. 95% confidence intervals and p-values were used to assess statistical significance. METHODS In a quasi-experimental longitudinal design without a comparison group, 559 CPs and PPMVs who were enrolled in the IntegratE project between January and December 2019, completed a self-administered questionnaire to assess their knowledge related to the provision of FP counseling, and injectable and implant contraceptive services at three points in time: 1) before the training; 2) immediately after the training; and 3) 9-months after the training in Kaduna and Lagos states, Nigeria. Adjusted multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effect of provider characteristics and receipt of job aids on FP knowledge retention 9 months after the training. 95% confidence intervals and p-values were used to assess statistical significance.Majority of study participants were females (60.3%) and between 30 and 49 years old (63.4%). The study revealed the importance of jobs aids as influence on knowledge retention. CPs and PPMVs who reported having the Balanced Counseling Strategy plus (BCS+) counseling cards, were more likely to retain knowledge (AOR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.01-8.40, p-value = 0.05) at 9 months follow-up. Similarly, in terms of knowledge of injectable contraceptives, CPs and Tier 2 PPMVs who reported receiving the Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) Wheel were 2.1 times more likely to retain knowledge of injectable contraceptives 9-months later on (95% CI: 1.14-3.99, p-value = 0.02). RESULTS Majority of study participants were females (60.3%) and between 30 and 49 years old (63.4%). The study revealed the importance of jobs aids as influence on knowledge retention. CPs and PPMVs who reported having the Balanced Counseling Strategy plus (BCS+) counseling cards, were more likely to retain knowledge (AOR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.01-8.40, p-value = 0.05) at 9 months follow-up.

Training and providing them with job aids on FP will therefore support task shifting and task sharing on family planning services provision in Nigeria. CONCLUSION Community Pharmacists and Proprietary Medicine Vendors had good retention of family planning knowledge, especially when combined with job aids. Training and providing them with job aids on FP will therefore support task shifting and task sharing on family planning services provision in Nigeria.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Continuing professional development (CPD) remains voluntary in nine European countries. Evidence suggests a move towards mandatory CPD across Europe with the objective of harmonisation of dental CPD. Although the importance of CPD is acknowledged, the literature regarding its effectiveness is limited and under debate. Aims and objectives The main aim was to measure the effectiveness and success of a new CPD programme with the objective to devise a strategy, guidelines and recommendations for the establishment of a dental CPD programme in Malta. Methodology This project was divided into two phases; Phase 1 was the analysis of a survey sent out to 135 members of the Dental Association of Malta. Phase 2 involved the evaluation of eight verifiable CPD events, through pre‐event and post‐event tests and feedback forms, to investigate the effect on short‐term knowledge retention and the respective satisfaction levels of participants at each event. Results The survey had a response rate of 78%. The CPD events in Phase 2 all showed statistically significant improvement in short‐term knowledge retention on each subject ( p  < 0.05). Satisfaction levels ranged from 70% to 99%. Conclusions The information gathered from this project was used to provide guidelines and recommendations for the local regulatory body and CPD providers for the set‐up of a dental CPD framework and programmes in Malta, a country where dental CPD is still voluntary. This article is the second article from a two‐part series of articles about the Malta Dental CPD Pilot project.",

    "Abstract": "Gender is rarely considered in the works on state socialism in Czech history writing. Given the prominence of the equality of the sexes in communist rhetoric and the heated anti- and pro-feminism media and intellectual debates of the 1990s, the omission stands out as a remarkable loss of opportunity in historical research. It also defies logic. For if “emancipation” and “equality” were so strongly present in pre-1989 discourse and women constituted half the population, does it not follow that the plain demographic fact should drive the interest of researchers to inquire where this population was, what it did, and what it had to say? The question has so far attracted primarily sociologists, but how does it fare in historiography? What are the losses of the absence and the gains of the inclusion of a gender perspective on the history and memory-making of state socialism? This article will first consider the status quo of gender blindness in Czech historiography and its possible reasons in the context of the legacy that state socialism left to social sciences and humanities: the legacy of expertise, disciplinary legitimation and epistemological legacy. A discussion of the consequences of the near absence of gender history and analysis from post-1989 interpretations of state socialism in historiography follows: blind spots and loss of knowledge, lack of precision and a gender bias of historical accounts, and perpetuation of false legacy.

    "Abstract": "Lack of education and awareness about cancer treatment may result in suboptimal care of patients with cancer. Unlike high-income countries, resource-limited countries lack the standardized training and scope of practice in oncology nursing. This quality improvement project was conducted to assess nurses' knowledge gain, retention of knowledge and clinical skill set, and feasibility of a blended learning approach in the care of adult oncology patients across four hospitals in Kenya and Tanzania. PURPOSE Lack of education and awareness about cancer treatment may result in suboptimal care of patients with cancer. Unlike high-income countries, resource-limited countries lack the standardized training and scope of practice in oncology nursing. This quality improvement project was conducted to assess nurses' knowledge gain, retention of knowledge and clinical skill set, and feasibility of a blended learning approach in the care of adult oncology patients across four hospitals in Kenya and Tanzania.We used a combination of computer-led eLearning sessions and face-to-face interactions over 12 months for cancer education to oncology nurses. Pre- and posttests with each training session were combined with face-to-face clinical skills training at beginning and completion of the course. A comprehensive postassessment was conducted immediately after the training, and at 6, 9, and 12 months to evaluate knowledge gain and retention.

INTRODUCTION Trauma is a major contributor to the global burden of disease, with low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) being disproportionately affected. Trauma Quality Improvement (QI) initiatives could potentially save an estimated two million lives each year. Successful trauma QI initiatives rely on adequate training and a culture of quality among hospital staff. This study evaluated the effect of a pilot trauma QI training course on participants' perceptions on leadership, medical errors, and the QI process in Cameroon.Study participants took part in a three-day, eight-module course training on trauma QI methods and applications. Perceptions on leadership, medical errors, and QI were assessed pre and post-course using a 15-item survey measured on a five-point Likert scale. Median pre- and post-course scores were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Knowledge retention and course satisfaction were also evaluated in a post-course survey and evaluation. METHODS Study participants took part in a three-day, eight-module course training on trauma QI methods and applications. Perceptions on leadership, medical errors, and QI were assessed pre and post-course using a 15-item survey measured on a five-point Likert scale. Median pre- and post-course scores were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Knowledge retention and course satisfaction were also evaluated in a post-course survey and evaluation.A majority of the 25 course participants completed pre-course (92%) and post-course (80%) surveys. Participants' perceptions of safety and comfort discussing medical errors at work significantly increased post-course (pre-median = 5, IQR [4-5]; post-median = 5, IQR [5-5]; P = 0.046). The belief that individuals responsible for medical error should be held accountable significantly decreased after the course (pre-median = 3, IQR [2-4]; post-median = 1, IQR [1-2]; P < 0.001). Overall satisfaction with the course was high with median scores ≥4. RESULTS A majority of the 25 course participants completed pre-course (92%) and post-course (80%) surveys. Participants' perceptions of safety and comfort discussing medical errors at work significantly increased post-course (pre-median = 5, IQR [4-5]; post-median = 5, IQR [5-5]; P = 0.046). The belief that individuals responsible for medical error should be held accountable significantly decreased after the course (pre-median = 3, IQR [2-4]; post-median = 1, IQR [1-2]; P < 0.001). Overall satisfaction with the course was high with median scores ≥4.These initial results suggest that targeted trauma QI training effectively influences attitudes about QI. Further investigation of the effect of the trauma QI training on hospital staff in larger courses is warranted to assess reproducibility of these findings. CONCLUSIONS These initial results suggest that targeted trauma QI training effectively influences attitudes about QI. Further investigation of the effect of the trauma QI training on hospital staff in larger courses is warranted to assess reproducibility of these findings.",

INTRODUCTION Continuing professional development (CPD) remains voluntary in nine European countries. Evidence suggests a move towards mandatory CPD across Europe with the objective of harmonisation of dental CPD. Although the importance of CPD is acknowledged, the literature regarding its effectiveness is limited and under debate.The main aim was to measure the effectiveness and success of a new CPD programme with the objective to devise a strategy, guidelines and recommendations for the establishment of a dental CPD programme in Malta. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES The main aim was to measure the effectiveness and success of a new CPD programme with the objective to devise a strategy, guidelines and recommendations for the establishment of a dental CPD programme in Malta.This project was divided into two phases; Phase 1 was the analysis of a survey sent out to 135 members of the Dental Association of Malta. Phase 2 involved the evaluation of eight verifiable CPD events, through pre-event and post-event tests and feedback forms, to investigate the effect on short-term knowledge retention and the respective satisfaction levels of participants at each event. METHODOLOGY This project was divided into two phases; Phase 1 was the analysis of a survey sent out to 135 members of the Dental Association of Malta. Phase 2 involved the evaluation of eight verifiable CPD events, through pre-event and post-event tests and feedback forms, to investigate the effect on short-term knowledge retention and the respective satisfaction levels of participants at each event.The survey had a response rate of 78%. The CPD events in Phase 2 all showed statistically significant improvement in short-term knowledge retention on each subject (p < 0.05). Satisfaction levels ranged from 70% to 99%. RESULTS The survey had a response rate of 78%. The CPD events in Phase 2 all showed statistically significant improvement in short-term knowledge retention on each subject (p < 0.05).

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Mentorship should be a transformative experience that propels mentees from one point in their career to another and drives personal growth. Within the field of maternal and child health (MCH), it is considered a critical professional duty. However, MCH has yet to explicitly embrace mentorship practice as a means to address workforce challenges including turnover, knowledge loss, and undue burden on the part of historically oppressed individuals and communities to overturn oppressive systems. Call to Action: We advocate for public calls for diversity and equity to be met with strategic enhancement of the practice of MCH mentorship. Transformative MCH mentorship should be used to promote positive identity formation, understanding of self in context, efficacy, and sustained commitment to working with MCH populations in ways that are inclusive and prevent the perpetration of the problematic power dynamics that lead to inequitable outcomes. Recommendations: We present recommendations to strengthen MCH mentorship practice. At the individual level, there should be a refreshment of norms and expectations, where mentorship is seen as a uniquely flexible opportunity for mutual learning. At the organizational level, embedding mentorship in all aspects of practice helps establish and sustain a culture of belonging. This transformative organizational culture can attract and retain future generations of professionals that are not only more representative of the populations that MCH programs support but are prepared to authentically elevate the needs and strengths of those populations.

    "Abstract": "Mentorship should be a transformative experience that propels mentees from one point in their career to another and drives personal growth. Within the field of maternal and child health (MCH), it is considered a critical professional duty. However, MCH has yet to explicitly embrace mentorship practice as a means to address workforce challenges including turnover, knowledge loss, and undue burden on the part of historically oppressed individuals and communities to overturn oppressive systems. INTRODUCTION Mentorship should be a transformative experience that propels mentees from one point in their career to another and drives personal growth. Within the field of maternal and child health (MCH), it is considered a critical professional duty. However, MCH has yet to explicitly embrace mentorship practice as a means to address workforce challenges including turnover, knowledge loss, and undue burden on the part of historically oppressed individuals and communities to overturn oppressive systems.We advocate for public calls for diversity and equity to be met with strategic enhancement of the practice of MCH mentorship. Transformative MCH mentorship should be used to promote positive identity formation, understanding of self in context, efficacy, and sustained commitment to working with MCH populations in ways that are inclusive and prevent the perpetration of the problematic power dynamics that lead to inequitable outcomes. CALL TO ACTION We advocate for public calls for diversity and equity to be met with strategic enhancement of the practice of MCH mentorship. Transformative MCH mentorship should be used to promote positive identity formation, understanding of self in context, efficacy, and sustained commitment to working with MCH populations in ways that are inclusive and prevent the perpetration of the problematic power dynamics that lead to inequitable outcomes.We present recommendations to strengthen MCH mentorship practice. At the individual level, there should be a refreshment of norms and expectations, where mentorship is seen as a uniquely flexible opportunity for mutual learning. At the organizational level, embedding mentorship in all aspects of practice helps establish and sustain a culture of belonging. This transformative organizational culture can attract and retain future generations of professionals that are not only more representative of the populations that MCH programs support but are prepared to authentically elevate the needs and strengths of those populations. These suggestions incorporate best practices from other fields and include ideas for the MCH field in particular. RECOMMENDATIONS We present recommendations to strengthen MCH mentorship practice.

    "Abstract": "Annually 2.5 million infants die in the first 28 days of life, with a significant regional distribution disparity. An estimated 80% of those could be saved if neonatal resuscitation were correctly and promptly initiated. A barrier to achieving the target is the knowledge and skills of healthcare workers. BACKGROUND Annually 2.5 million infants die in the first 28 days of life, with a significant regional distribution disparity. An estimated 80% of those could be saved if neonatal resuscitation were correctly and promptly initiated. A barrier to achieving the target is the knowledge and skills of healthcare workers.The objective of this cluster randomized trial was to assess the improvement and retention of resuscitation skills of nurses, midwives, and birth attendants in 2 birth centers serving 60 villages in rural India using high-frequency, low-dose training. PURPOSE The objective of this cluster randomized trial was to assess the improvement and retention of resuscitation skills of nurses, midwives, and birth attendants in 2 birth centers serving 60 villages in rural India using high-frequency, low-dose training.There was a significant difference ( P < .05) between the groups in the rate of resuscitation, with 18% needing resuscitation in the control group and 6% in the intervention group. The posttest scores for knowledge retention at the final 8-month evaluation were significantly better in the intervention group than in the control group (intervention group mean rank 19.4 vs control group mean rank 10.3; P < .05). The success rate of resuscitation was not significantly different among the groups. RESULTS There was a significant difference ( P < .05) between the groups in the rate of resuscitation, with 18% needing resuscitation in the control group and 6% in the intervention group. The posttest scores for knowledge retention at the final 8-month evaluation were significantly better in the intervention group than in the control group (intervention group mean rank 19.4 vs control group mean rank 10.3; P < .05). The success rate of resuscitation was not significantly different among the groups.Improved knowledge retention at 8 months and the lower need for resuscitation in the intervention group support the efficacy of the high-frequency, low-dose education model of teaching in this setting. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Improved knowledge retention at 8 months and the lower need for resuscitation in the intervention group support the efficacy of the high-frequency, low-dose education model of teaching in this setting.Replication of these findings in other settings with a larger population cohort is needed to study the impact of such intervention on birth outcomes in low-resource settings. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH Replication of these findings in other settings with a larger population cohort is needed to study the impact of such intervention on birth outcomes in low-resource settings.",

    "Abstract": "Code and emergent situations require skilled nursing response wherever they occur. Nurse preparation for code response is an ongoing need in nursing education. The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Parkland Health and Hospital System in Dallas, Texas, has a team of 3 nurse educators. These educators determined the need for increased nurse confidence, skill, and response in code and emergent situations within the NICU. The education team also recognized the need to increase nurse involvement in professional development activities and preparation for the national certification examination. BACKGROUND Code and emergent situations require skilled nursing response wherever they occur. Nurse preparation for code response is an ongoing need in nursing education. The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Parkland Health and Hospital System in Dallas, Texas, has a team of 3 nurse educators. These educators determined the need for increased nurse confidence, skill, and response in code and emergent situations within the NICU. The education team also recognized the need to increase nurse involvement in professional development activities and preparation for the national certification examination.The purpose of this article is to describe how a NICU education team, in a level III NICU, trained nurses using simulated scenarios to improve nursing knowledge for national certification, skill, and confidence in code situations and to provide ongoing professional development opportunities within a controlled learning environment. PURPOSE The purpose of this article is to describe how a NICU education team, in a level III NICU, trained nurses using simulated scenarios to improve nursing knowledge for national certification, skill, and confidence in code situations and to provide ongoing professional development opportunities within a controlled learning environment.The intervention designed to meet these specific goals for the NICU was the creation of a simulation team (called the \"Drill Team\") to facilitate simulated activities created by the NICU education team. This simulation strategy was found to have multiple advantages for content delivery, as multiple learning styles can be incorporated into the simulated activities. METHODS The intervention designed to meet these specific goals for the NICU was the creation of a simulation team (called the \"Drill Team\") to facilitate simulated activities created by the NICU education team. This simulation strategy was found to have multiple advantages for content delivery, as multiple learning styles can be incorporated into the simulated activities.Nurses demonstrated improved performance, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge retention after the Drill Team project. Nursing confidence in code performance also increased using this intervention. FINDINGS Nurses demonstrated improved performance, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge retention after the Drill Team project. Nursing confidence in code performance also increased using this intervention.This educational intervention can be replicated and utilized in nursing education for all specialties. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE This educational intervention can be replicated and utilized in nursing education for all specialties.Further research could be conducted to determine the effectiveness of simulated activities and national certification pass rates.

Grounded on the theory of situated learning, we developed an augmented reality-based educational resource to promote eco-agritourism—namely, to promote agritourism while encouraging tourists to be environmentally responsible. This study presents the results of an educational experiment that compared the scores of students who were instructed using a combination of the augmented reality-based educational resource and the professor's guidance with those of students who were instructed only by the professor. The study analyzed the learning outcomes and the degree of users’ motivation to learn about aquaponics in an agritourism farm. The participants were 40 volunteers who had no previous knowledge about aquaponics. The results show that the resource has a medium effect size on learning gains and a large effect on knowledge retention. Likewise, the data indicates that the resource increased users’ motivation to learn and practice responsible agritourism. These results seem to indicate that augmented reality-based resources are appropriate for promoting eco-agritourism and encourage tourists to develop a positive bond with nature.

    "Abstract": "This study describes how wearable devices can be used in elementary schools to compare some aspects of different teaching approaches. Upper arm wearables were used as an objective tool to compare three approaches when teaching science: (i) classical frontal teaching, (ii) embodied (kinesthetic) teaching, and (iii) a distance teaching approach. Using the wearables, the approaches were compared in terms of their impact on students' psychological arousal and perceived well-being. In addition, short-term and long-term knowledge gain and physiological synchronization between teacher and students during the lecture were assessed. A synchronization index was defined to estimate the degree of physiological synchronization. During distance teaching, by means of measurements with wearables, students were significantly less physically active and significantly less psychologically aroused. Embodied teaching allowed significantly higher physical activation than during the other two approaches. The synchronization index for all three teaching approaches was positive with the highest values for distance and frontal teaching. Moreover, knowledge gain immediately after the embodied lessons was higher than after frontal lessons. No significant differences in the long-term knowledge retention between the three different teaching methods were found. This pilot study proved that wearables are a useful tool in research in the field of education and have the potential to contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in learning, even in complex environments such as an elementary school classroom.This study describes how wearable devices can be used in elementary schools to compare some aspects of different teaching approaches.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Online learning has become increasingly commonplace, including the replacement and augmentation of traditional in-residence education, as well as ad-hoc training systems and just-in-time knowledge dissemination. However, design for instructional media to facilitate performance has relied on an inadequate understanding of the behavioral affect elicited from these designs. To investigate the degree to which excitement and engagement are predictive of individual learning outcomes in an online learning setting, we evaluate an experiment with two instructional representations (static and dynamic) using learning materials for a semaphore signaling system. We examine the excitement and engagement levels of the participants using electroencephalography (EEG) as potential mediators. Learning outcomes are measured by the evaluation scores of knowledge retention. We consider several structural equation models (SEMs) to see the underlying relationship between instructional representation, excitement, engagement, and learning outcomes. Notably, the models indicate the full mediation of behavioral affect on learning outcomes, in which both the range of excitement and the maximum level of engagement are mediating effects. This article illustrates the potential for biometrically measured affect aid in the modeling and understanding of how instructional design features ultimately impact performance.

    "Abstract": "To assess the impact of an interprofessional case-based training programme to enhance clinical knowledge and confidence among clinicians working in high HIV-burden settings in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of an interprofessional case-based training programme to enhance clinical knowledge and confidence among clinicians working in high HIV-burden settings in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).Health professions training institutions and their affiliated clinical training sites in 12 high HIV-burden countries in SSA. SETTING Health professions training institutions and their affiliated clinical training sites in 12 high HIV-burden countries in SSA.Cohort comprising preservice and in-service learners, from diverse health professions, engaged in HIV service delivery. PARTICIPANTS Cohort comprising preservice and in-service learners, from diverse health professions, engaged in HIV service delivery.A standardised, interprofessional, case-based curriculum designed to enhance HIV clinical competency, implemented between October 2019 and April 2020. INTERVENTION A standardised, interprofessional, case-based curriculum designed to enhance HIV clinical competency, implemented between October 2019 and April 2020.The primary outcomes measured were knowledge and clinical confidence related to topics addressed in the curriculum. These outcomes were assessed using a standardised online assessment, completed before and after course completion. A secondary outcome was knowledge retention at least 6 months postintervention, measured using the same standardised assessment, 6 months after training completion. We also sought to determine what lessons could be learnt from this training programme to inform interprofessional training in other contexts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes measured were knowledge and clinical confidence related to topics addressed in the curriculum. These outcomes were assessed using a standardised online assessment, completed before and after course completion. A secondary outcome was knowledge retention at least 6 months postintervention, measured using the same standardised assessment, 6 months after training completion. We also sought to determine what lessons could be learnt from this training programme to inform interprofessional training in other contexts.Data from 3027 learners were collected: together nurses (n=1145, 37.9%) and physicians (n=902, 29.8%) constituted the majority of participants; 58.1% were preservice learners (n=1755) and 24.1% (n=727) had graduated from training within the prior year. Knowledge scores were significantly higher, postparticipation compared with preparticipation, across all content domains, regardless of training level and cadre (all p 6 months, knowledge and self-reported confidence scores were greater compared with precourse scores (all p 6 months, knowledge and self-reported confidence scores were greater compared with precourse scores (all p<0.05).To our knowledge, this is the largest interprofessional, multicountry training programme established to improve HIV knowledge and clinical confidence among healthcare professional workers in SSA. The findings are notable given the size and geographical reach and demonstration of sustained confidence and knowledge retention post course completion. The findings highlight the utility of interprofessional approaches to enhance clinical training in SSA.

    "Abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is one of the main public health problems worldwide. One key tool to optimize antibiotic prescription is medical training. The aim of this study is to compare the impact of training in infectious diseases on students' knowledge of the antibiotic resistance problem and the rational use of antibiotics. BACKGROUND Antibiotic resistance is one of the main public health problems worldwide. One key tool to optimize antibiotic prescription is medical training. The aim of this study is to compare the impact of training in infectious diseases on students' knowledge of the antibiotic resistance problem and the rational use of antibiotics.We performed a cross-sectional study in the medical school of the University of Navarra. We conducted an anonymous in situ survey of students in each year of training. Data were analyzed grouping the students as follows: GROUP 1: first three years of education, no training in Clinical Microbiology (CM) or in Infectious Diseases (ID); GROUP 2: fourth-year students, training in CM but not ID; GROUP 3: Fifth and sixth-year students who have completed the training in CM and ID. Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test when appropriate) was performed to evaluate potential associations. Wilcoxon's test was used to compare the median correct answers between groups. We used Spearman's test for correlation between year of training and performance in questionnaire. METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study in the medical school of the University of Navarra. We conducted an anonymous in situ survey of students in each year of training. Data were analyzed grouping the students as follows: GROUP 1: first three years of education, no training in Clinical Microbiology (CM) or in Infectious Diseases (ID); GROUP 2: fourth-year students, training in CM but not ID; GROUP 3: Fifth and sixth-year students who have completed the training in CM and ID. Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test when appropriate) was performed to evaluate potential associations. Wilcoxon's test was used to compare the median correct answers between groups. We used Spearman's test for correlation between year of training and performance in questionnaire.A total of 994 students respond to the survey, 80.4% of the eligible students. Almost all students who had completed infectious diseases training perceive antibiotic resistance as an important problem in comparison with students who had not completed the formation (99.5% in group 3 vs 94.5% in group 1, p = 0.02). Knowledge of antibiotic stewardship underwent a statistically significant change after training in infectious diseases (from 9.2% in group 1 to 52.2% in group 3, p < 0.001). In the training questions block we also found an increase in the average number of correct answers (21.4% in group 1 vs 44.7% in group 3, p < 0.001). When comparing the results of subgroups 3A and 3B we found a significant loss of knowledge as we moved away from training (49% vs 40.9%, p < 0.001). RESULTS A total of 994 students respond to the survey, 80.4% of the eligible students. Almost all students who had completed infectious diseases training perceive antibiotic resistance as an important problem in comparison with students who had not completed the formation (99.5% in group 3 vs 94.5% in group 1, p = 0.02).

However, we have an opportunity for educational improvement as far as infectious diseases are concerned, regarding both the acquisition of knowledge and its loss as time lapses after training. CONCLUSIONS The training of medical students is the key to improving both perception and knowledge of infectious diseases.

    "Abstract": "Knowledge management is a multifaceted, complex, end-to-end organizational process dealing with collecting and using data, information, and knowledge generated by a group of individuals. The current study examines the changes required in companies’ quality systems to enhance intergenerational learning and knowledge retention. Our primary objective was to understand the factors that influence the development of an organizational culture encouraging innovation, knowledge sharing, organizational learning, openness, and providing opportunities to create up-to-date knowledge. We collected the viewpoints and needs of industry professionals by using interviews and a survey. Then, we analyzed the factors that influence knowledge management quality and transfer between workforce generations. The professionals’ primary goal is to introduce, integrate, and improve knowledge in their organization. Their second goal is to facilitate knowledge sharing and transfer between workforce generations. Improving transgenerational knowledge sharing and reducing the loss of knowledge are challenges for all industries. A cutting-edge industry such as the defense field deals with sensitive data, and knowledge management is a strategic need in a competitive context. Quality management standards propose guidelines for developing and enhancing the overall knowledge-related processes. However, implementing them requires a shift in the corporate culture team. Organizational knowledge resilience must be developed by involving the workforce in implementing knowledge management systems.

    "Abstract": "The WHO developed a 5-day basic emergency care (BEC) course using the traditional lecture format. However, adult learning theory suggests that lecture-based courses alone may not promote long-term knowledge retention.

OBJECTIVES The WHO developed a 5-day basic emergency care (BEC) course using the traditional lecture format. However, adult learning theory suggests that lecture-based courses alone may not promote long-term knowledge retention. We assessed whether a mobile application adjunct (BEC app) can have positive impact on knowledge acquisition and retention compared with the BEC course alone and evaluated perceptions, acceptability and barriers to adoption of such a tool.Mixed-methods prospective cohort study. DESIGN Mixed-methods prospective cohort study.Adult healthcare workers in six health facilities in Tanzania who enrolled in the BEC course and were divided into the control arm (BEC course) or the intervention arm (BEC course plus BEC app). PARTICIPANTS Adult healthcare workers in six health facilities in Tanzania who enrolled in the BEC course and were divided into the control arm (BEC course) or the intervention arm (BEC course plus BEC app).Changes in knowledge assessment scores, self-efficacy and perceptions of BEC app. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Changes in knowledge assessment scores, self-efficacy and perceptions of BEC app.92 enrolees, 46 (50%) in each arm, completed the BEC course. 71 (77%) returned for the 4-month follow-up. Mean test scores were not different between the two arms at any time period. Both arms had significantly improved test scores from enrolment (prior to distribution of materials) to day 1 of the BEC course and from day 1 of BEC course to immediately after BEC course completion. The drop-off in mean scores from immediately after BEC course completion to 4 months after course completion was not significant for either arm. No differences were observed between the two arms for any self-efficacy question at any time point. Focus groups revealed five major themes related to BEC app adoption: educational utility, clinical utility, user experience, barriers to access and barriers to use.

    "Abstract": "Challenging the notion of “teaching by telling,” active learning utilizes a student-oriented approach by emphasizing the concept of knowledge retention through peer interaction. To further examine the potential of active learning, we created a workshop based on didactic education and student collaboration. Participants included undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented and disadvantaged backgrounds. The workshop was part of our summer academic enrichment program run in an urban, medically underserved community. The workshop focused on clinical and biochemical nutrition, wherein students synthesized information by discussing dietary choices and the socioeconomic aspects of nutrition. Student reception of the workshop was adjudged by anonymous surveys. The survey questions were designed to gauge how the workshop objectives were achieved. Cronbach alpha (0.276) confirmed that there was more than a single theme contained in the questions. The majority of students (97%) agreed that the workshop met the learning objectives: (1) acquire basic clinical knowledge, (2) gain a better understanding of nutrition, (3) formulate a linkage between clinical nutrition and disease, and (4) benefit from peer interaction. Students’ performance in the post-quiz (100% correct answers) had improved significantly compared to the pre-quiz (25% correct answers) suggesting acquisition, understanding and application of nutrition aspects taught in the workshop. Overall, the present study demonstrated the engagement and understanding of students with respect to learning about nutrition and community health in an active learning setting. These types of active-learning-based sessions may have broad applicability for any academic discipline to improve student engagement and knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "The lecture and infographic are targeted towards Emergency Medicine physicians and residents. Audience The lecture and infographic are targeted towards Emergency Medicine physicians and residents.Pain is the most common presenting symptom in the emergency department.1 Various classes of medications are used to treat acute and chronic pain. Specifically, opiate medications are often used to relieve moderate to severe pain. About 20% of patients presenting with the chief complaint of non-cancer pain receive an opioid prescription.2 Since there are many different types of opiates, conversion between one opioid to another has provided a great challenge in terms of addressing the balance between adequately controlling patients' pain and preventing serious adverse effects. The lack of a readily available standard opiate equivalent guide and physicians' limited knowledge base about morphine milligram equivalents may contribute to medication errors, insufficient treatment, addiction, and overdose. Introduction Pain is the most common presenting symptom in the emergency department.1 Various classes of medications are used to treat acute and chronic pain. Specifically, opiate medications are often used to relieve moderate to severe pain. About 20% of patients presenting with the chief complaint of non-cancer pain receive an opioid prescription.2 Since there are many different types of opiates, conversion between one opioid to another has provided a great challenge in terms of addressing the balance between adequately controlling patients' pain and preventing serious adverse effects. The lack of a readily available standard opiate equivalent guide and physicians' limited knowledge base about morphine milligram equivalents may contribute to medication errors, insufficient treatment, addiction, and overdose.The primary aim of this study was to educate residents and attending physicians about opiate equivalent medications, medication metabolism, provide usual dosages, and to provide a standardized method for converting between various opiate medications in the emergency department (ED). By the end of this session, the learner will be able to: 1) define the term, \"morphine milligram equivalents;\" 2) describe the relative onset and duration of action of different pain medications often used in the emergency department; and 3) convert one opioid dose to another.Additionally, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the lecture and the infographic in increasing physicians' knowledge base of opioid medications and standardize the method of prescribing and converting between opioids in the ED. We designed and placed a simple, eye-catching infographic in the University of California, Irvine Emergency Department that depicted information pertaining to morphine equivalents and pharmacological properties of the opioids. We then presented a lecture on morphine equianalgesic doses, metabolism, and method for conversion between medications. In order to evaluate the functionality of the lecture and chart, we administered multiple surveys to ED providers pre- and post-lecture and placement of the chart in the ED. Our lecture and infographic included up-to-date literature and considered dose reductions, cross tolerance, and patient comorbidities. We designed the infographic to be visually appealing and simple for ease of use in a busy ED environment.

Educational Methods A lecture was designed to educate emergency department physicians and residents on the properties, metabolism and techniques for conversion between various opioid medications. Following the lecture, we walked through an example question with the participants. The lecture was presented at an Emergency Department conference.This lecture was presented at emergency medicine residency grand rounds. To evaluate the efficacy of our chart and educational lecture, we implemented a pre-presentation survey consisting of questions related to opiate conversions, metabolism, and medication characteristics without the help of the chart. After the presentation participants were once again asked to fill out the same set of questions on a post-presentation survey with the help of the chart. The effectiveness of the lecture and infographic was assessed by comparing participants' scores between the pre-presentation survey and post-presentation survey. A second post-presentation survey with the same set of questions was also sent out about 7 months after the presentation, to assess for retention of the information presented during the lecture. The responses were kept anonymous, though participants were asked for their level of training and four screening questions for the purpose of matching individual responses between the pre-presentation, initial post-presentation, and 7-month post-presentation surveys.

The responses were kept anonymous, though participants were asked for their level of training and four screening questions for the purpose of matching individual responses between the pre-presentation, initial post-presentation, and 7-month post-presentation surveys.Seven initial post-presentation survey responses were matched to pre-presentation survey responses, while five 7-month post-presentation survey responses were matched to pre-presentation survey responses. Only one participant filled out all three surveys; this participant was found to have increased in score from pre-presentation survey (4/10) to immediate post-presentation survey (10/10), but decreased in score at the 7-month post-presentation survey (8/10). Five of the participants who filled out both the pre- presentation survey and immediate post-presentation survey showed improvement in their scores, one participant received the same score on both surveys, and one participant had a decrease in score. Between the five participants who filled out the pre-presentation survey and the 7-month post-presentation survey, one participant showed an increase in scores, two participants received the same score each time, and two participants decreased in scores. Results Seven initial post-presentation survey responses were matched to pre-presentation survey responses, while five 7-month post-presentation survey responses were matched to pre-presentation survey responses. Only one participant filled out all three surveys; this participant was found to have increased in score from pre-presentation survey (4/10) to immediate post-presentation survey (10/10), but decreased in score at the 7-month post-presentation survey (8/10).

Between the five participants who filled out the pre-presentation survey and the 7-month post-presentation survey, one participant showed an increase in scores, two participants received the same score each time, and two participants decreased in scores.Overall, the educational content and infographic allowed for improvement in a majority of the participants' scores between the pre-presentation survey and immediate post-presentation survey. However, it seems that retention of knowledge gained by the presentation waned as time passed, which manifested in most participants showing a decrease or no change in score between the pre-presentation survey and the 7-month post-presentation survey. In other words, through implementation of the infographic in the Emergency Department and educational lecture, we learned that the presentation and the walk-through of an example question contributed to immediate retention of knowledge of morphine equivalents. However, long-term retention of the knowledge about morphine equivalents was lacking. Given the small sample size of eleven participants, we are unable to definitively conclude whether this infographic and lecture are overall effective in improving knowledge, retention of knowledge, and change in clinical management. However, our results suggest that further larger studies could be conducted with the infographic and presentation as useful tools to advance EM physicians' knowledge and awareness of morphine milligram equivalents. Therefore, our hypothesis still stands that this infographic and lecture are useful tools that other EM programs could use and conduct studies to evaluate improvement in their learners' knowledge. The main takeaways are that educational lectures and visually-appealing graphics are able to enhance physicians' understanding of morphine equianalgesic doses in the immediate period after exposure, but must also be conducted with consistent follow-up to improve preservation of knowledge.

    "Abstract": "Development of Open Educational eXtended Reality (OEXR) resources was driven by a need to provide anatomy models for faculty and students for whom access to formaldehyde-preserved specimens was challenging or impossible due to medical conditions, pregnancy, and other factors that limited access to the lab and the lessons. The OEXR virtual assets were developed using a process called photogrammetry and were made freely available to students and faculty. The rapid transition to remote instruction in March 2020 increased adoption and utilization of these resources dramatically. This study investigates the implementation of the OEXR library in an anatomy lab setting in Spring 2020, relative to the impact on student motivation to learn, as well as knowledge retention and performance. The experimental research design included measures of OEXR efficacy, student motivation to learn, and user experiences within a lab setting. Student responses indicated that experimental group members were more engaged but less confident in their mastery of the material, which was ultimately contrasted by their overall performance. The results provide an adequate alternative to physical lab resources, which presents an opportunity to leverage OEXR virtual models to supplement physical lab specimens in cases where access is limited or impossible.

In ideological and political education, risk factors are widely influenced, including the impact of educational purposes and education providers. In this paper, Deep Learning-Based Innovation Path Optimization Methodology (DL-IPOM) has been proposed to strengthen data awareness, improve the way of thinking in ideological and political education. The political instructional collaborative analysis is integrated with DL-IPOM to boost Ideological and political education excellence. The simulation analysis is conducted at (98.22%). The consistency of the proposed framework is demonstrated by efficiency, high accuracy (98.34%), overshoot index rate (94.2%), political thinking rate (93.6%), knowledge retention rate (80.2%), reliability rate (97.6%), performance (94.37%) when compared to other methods.",

    "Abstract": "While there has been recent progress in abstractive summarization as applied to different domains including news articles, scientific articles, and blog posts, the application of these techniques to clinical text summarization has been limited. This is primarily due to the lack of large-scale training data and the messy/unstructured nature of clinical notes as opposed to other domains where massive training data come in structured or semi -structured form. Further, one of the least explored and critical components of clinical text summarization is factual accuracy of clinical summaries. This is specifically crucial in the healthcare domain, cardiology in particular, where an accurate summary generation that preserves the facts in the source notes is critical to the well-being of a patient. In this study, we propose a framework for improving the factual accuracy of abstractive summarization of clinical text using knowledge-guided multi-objective optimization. We propose to jointly optimize three cost functions in our proposed architecture during training: generative loss, entity loss and knowledge loss and evaluate the proposed architecture on 1) clinical notes of patients with heart failure (HF), which we collect for this study; and 2) two benchmark datasets, Indiana University Chest X-ray collection (IU X-Ray), and MIMIC-CXR, that are publicly available. We experiment with three transformer encoder-decoder architectures and demonstrate that optimizing different loss functions leads to improved performance in terms of entity-level factual accuracy.While there has been recent progress in abstractive summarization as applied to different domains including news articles, scientific articles, and blog posts, the application of these techniques to clinical text summarization has been limited.

    "Abstract": "Objectives Information literacy skills are crucial for practicing evidence-based medicine (Kingsley and Kingsley 2009; Saranto and Hovenga 2004). To prepare medical students, the Lane Medical Library provides a 90-minute class for all first-year medical and physician assistant students. The learning goal is to teach health professionals to locate and identify the best available medical evidence efficiently and systematically, and how to effectively share information literacy skills with their patients to discern misinformation. The learning objectives include: 1. understanding PubMed features and literature collection compared to Google Scholar and point-of-care tools; 2. formulating advanced evidence search strategies 3. discussing elements of various critical appraisal tools 4. exploring means and tools to improve patients’ health literacy and combat health misinformation. Method The course was conducted in a flipped classroom format and included examples related to underserved populations. We offered the training at the beginning of the first quarter. A pre-class survey was conducted to assess the literature search experience based on students’ educational backgrounds and familiarity with various literature sources. Before class, students were asked to provide a literature search strategy for a systematic review on ADHD in black communities. Students were divided into small groups to rewrite the PubMed search strategy after learning PubMed features and advanced literature search techniques. Students compared their pre-class and group PubMed search results with the search strategy used in the published systematic review on the same topic. Students also graded three pre-selected articles on their quality to demonstrate the critical appraisal process and identify red flags, like spinning. The end-of-semester examination included questions related to information literacy skills in order to assess knowledge retention. Results In 2021, there were one hundred and nineteen students in this class. Twenty-two students graduated from postgraduate programs. Seventy-six students reported they were very familiar with searching the PubMed database. In a multiple-choice question, ninety-one students selected the correct combination of Boolean operators and parentheses in finding comparative studies. However, only forty-six students used Boolean operators when developing their own PubMed search strategies. Instead of combining keywords and Boolean operators, six students wrote a complete sentence as their PubMed search strategy. One hundred and five students selected the correct Boolean operators for the same multiple-choice question during the final examination. Fifty students incorporated advanced search techniques, such as Medical Subject Headings, to formulate a PubMed search strategy for a clinical question. However, two students still used almost complete sentences instead of appropriate keywords when searching PubMed. Students showed difficulties identifying papers using inappropriate methodologies or exaggerating results during class discussions. Conclusions Advanced Information literacy skills are crucial for students to successfully navigate the exponentially increased volume of medical literature and provide the best care to patients. Even though students rated themselves as experienced PubMed searchers, our pre-class survey showed that most students were unfamiliar with most PubMed features and advanced literature searching techniques. This pre-class exercise helped students experience the challenges encountered by our patients without formal medical training in finding the right medical information. Most students improved their literature searching skills and were able to identify red flags for low-quality papers even after the first 90-minute session. By applying information literacy skills, students could locate and critically appraise medical literature efficiently and systematically. Offering this training at the beginning of the first quarter gives students the opportunity to develop critical skills and be able to apply them during clerkships and share this knowledge with patients to combat health misinformation.",

    "Abstract": "The current study investigated the relations between gamified refutations of COVID-19 misconceptions and individuals’ emotional reactions and knowledge retention within a large-scale public health education campaign. Refutations have a substantial body of evidence supporting their use to correct misconceptions, yet reduced efficacy has been observed for some topics that generate negative emotional responses. We tested whether gamification could mitigate these limits given that it capitalizes on positive affective engagement. From May to December 2020, approximately 200,000 individuals were recruited from social media in Canada to engage with a nongame interactive survey as a control or a fully gamified platform focused on correcting COVID-19 misconceptions. Gamification was associated with a greater number of happiness and anxiety responses and fewer responses of anger and skepticism in reaction to having misconceptions corrected by refutations. Further, participants who engaged with gamified refutations retained correct information after a brief period. Finally, happiness and anxiety were positively associated with and anger and skepticism were negatively associated with retention of refutation information and support for related public health policies. Implications for scaling up and reinforcing the benefits of refutations for public engagement with science are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Most knowledge management (KM) techniques capture knowledge at the end of a project, leading to knowledge loss. Building information modeling (BIM) is a building information management process throughout the project lifecycle. This study uses BIM for lifecycle knowledge capture to address knowledge loss. Knowledge in construction projects is intricate, intensifying the challenges of knowledge retrieval. This study combines natural language processing (NLP) and case-based reasoning (CBR) to improve knowledge retrieval, which not only takes advantage of CBR for retrieving knowledge case context through attributes but also obtains the benefits of NLP for retrieving text descriptions of knowledge cases. The parameters created in BIM correspond to the CBR attributes and NLP case descriptions. Quantitative test and case study confirm that the novel approach proposed in this study can improve knowledge retrieval performance and prevent knowledge loss. It also provides new insights into the transformation from BIM to building knowledge modeling (BKM).",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge management is a multifaceted, complex, end-to-end organizational process dealing with collecting and using data, information, and knowledge generated by a group of individuals. The current study examines the changes required in companies’ quality systems to enhance intergenerational learning and knowledge retention. Our primary objective was to understand the factors that influence the development of an organizational culture encouraging innovation, knowledge sharing, organizational learning, openness, and providing opportunities to create up-to-date knowledge. We collected the viewpoints and needs of industry professionals by using interviews and a survey. Then, we analyzed the factors that influence knowledge management quality and transfer between workforce generations. The professionals’ primary goal is to introduce, integrate, and improve knowledge in their organization. Their second goal is to facilitate knowledge sharing and transfer between workforce generations. Improving transgenerational knowledge sharing and reducing the loss of knowledge are challenges for all industries. A cutting-edge industry such as the defense field deals with sensitive data, and knowledge management is a strategic need in a competitive context. Quality management standards propose guidelines for developing and enhancing the overall knowledge-related processes. However, implementing them requires a shift in the corporate culture team. Organizational knowledge resilience must be developed by involving the workforce in implementing knowledge management systems.",

    "Abstract": "The authors of this article examine the potential for increased student learning and retention through more frequent assignments. They conduct a field experiment that investigates whether student knowledge retention can be improved by increasing the frequency of homework assignments, motivating students to have more exposure to the material, and reducing the incentives for students to procrastinate. They find that the impact of the treatment on student performance varies based on the student’s past academic performance. Students on the lower end of the academic performance distribution benefit from the structure imposed by more frequent assignments and perform better. However, students with high prior academic performance are harmed by the intervention. The final exam scores of high-performing students are lower in courses with higher assignment frequency.",

    "Abstract": "Background Despite the evidence in support of the use of buprenorphine in the treatment of OUD and increasing ability of emergency medicine (EM) clinicians to prescribe it, emergency department (ED)-initiated buprenorphine is uncommon. Many EM clinicians lack training on how to manage acute opioid withdrawal or initiate treatment with buprenorphine. We developed a brief buprenorphine training program and assessed the impact of the training on subsequent buprenorphine initiation and knowledge retention. Methods We conducted a pilot randomized control trial enrolling EM clinicians to receive either a 30-min didactic intervention about buprenorphine (standard arm) or the didactic plus weekly messaging and a monetary inducement to administer and report buprenorphine use (enhanced arm). All participants were incentivized to complete baseline, immediate post-didactic, and 90-day knowledge and attitude assessment surveys. Our objective was to achieve first time ED buprenorphine prescribing events in clinicians who had not previously prescribed buprenorphine in the ED and to improve EM-clinician knowledge and perceptions about ED-initiated buprenorphine. We also assessed whether the incentives and reminder messaging in the enhanced arm led to more clinicians administering buprenorphine than those in the standard arm following the training; we measured changes in knowledge of and attitudes toward ED-initiated buprenorphine. Results Of 104 EM clinicians enrolled, 51 were randomized to the standard arm and 53 to the enhanced arm. Clinical knowledge about buprenorphine improved for all clinicians immediately after the didactic intervention (difference 19.4%, 95% CI 14.4% to 24.5%). In the 90 days following the intervention, one-third (33%) of all participants reported administering buprenorphine for the first time. Clinicians administered buprenorphine more frequently in the enhanced arm compared to the standard arm (40% vs. 26.3%, p  = 0.319), but the difference was not statistically significant. The post-session knowledge improvement was not sustained at 90 days in the enhanced (difference 9.6%, 95% CI − 0.37% to 19.5%) or in the standard arm (difference 3.7%, 95% CI − 5.8% to 13.2%). All the participants reported an increased ability to recognize patients with opioid withdrawal at 90 days (enhanced arm difference .55, 95% CI .01–1.09, standard arm difference .85 95% CI .34–1.37). Conclusions A brief educational intervention targeting EM clinicians can be utilized to achieve first-time prescribing and improve knowledge around buprenorphine and opioid withdrawal. The use of weekly messaging and gain-framed incentivization conferred no additional benefit to the educational intervention alone. In order to further expand evidence-based ED treatment of OUD, focused initiatives that improve clinician competence with buprenorphine should be explored.

    "Abstract": "Purpose > As older adults are increasingly active in virtual communities (VCs), these platforms for knowledge exchange present opportunities for companies to use elder human capital. The purpose of this study is to understand the antecedent factors that motivate older adults’ knowledge contribution and knowledge seeking (KS) behaviors in VCs. Design/methodology/approach > Rooted in socio-emotional selectivity and social cognitive theories, this study included five key variables and developed models for older adults’ knowledge contributing (KC)/KS behaviors. This paper tested the hypotheses using data from a sample of 204 older adults in 3 VCs in China. Findings > The results provide support for most of the hypotheses and show that while other members’ participation (MP) acts as a substitute for meaning in life and attitude toward aging, it acts as a complement for outcome expectations (OE) focused on others and OE focused on oneself in their impacts on KC/KS activities. Practical implications > The study provides practical insights for developing elder human resources via VCs to avoid knowledge loss. Originality/value > This study described older adults’ unique characteristics when modeling their information and communication technologies-related behaviors and built two models to explain their KC/KS behaviors. It confirmed that the same factor has different levels of impact on older adults’ KC/KS behaviors in VCs. In addition, it confirmed and reinforced the complementary and substitutive effects of other MP as an environmental factor on these behaviors.",

Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines four electronic databases were systematically searched. Inclusion criteria: empirical studies using any type of AR intervention in patient education across all medical specialties. Quality assessment of the retrieved literature was carried out. Results: Ten papers, comprising 788 patients, were identified and included (Randomized controlled trial (RCT)(n = 3), non-randomized controlled trial (n = 3), before-and-after study (n = 3), and qualitative survey (n = 1)). Retrieved literature showed itself to be highly heterogeneous. The studied population included patients suffering from a diverse spectrum of chronic diseases (e.g., prostate cancer, diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy). Quantitative results indicated that the use of AR had a positive effect on knowledge retention and patient satisfaction. Qualitative findings suggested that patients liked the technology and felt comfortable with its use for educational purposes. The quality of the retrieved results was shown to be moderate to low. Conclusion: The limited evidence of this topic suggests the possible potential of AR in patient education. Practice implication: More research, using high-quality study designs and more evidence-based interventions, is needed to fully appreciate the value of AR on patient education.

    "Abstract": "To improve understanding of podcast use in medical education by examining current research on descriptive attributes and educational outcomes, highlighting implications of the current evidence base for educational practices, and identifying research gaps to guide future investigation. PURPOSE To improve understanding of podcast use in medical education by examining current research on descriptive attributes and educational outcomes, highlighting implications of the current evidence base for educational practices, and identifying research gaps to guide future investigation.The authors conducted a scoping review, searching PubMed and Embase databases in June-July 2020 for English-language studies of audio-only medical education podcast use in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education. The authors excluded studies without original data or with nonphysician data that could not be separated from physician data. From included studies, the authors extracted data regarding descriptive outcomes (e.g., podcast use, content areas, structure) and educational outcomes (classified using Kirkpatrick's 4 levels of evaluation). METHOD The authors conducted a scoping review, searching PubMed and Embase databases in June-July 2020 for English-language studies of audio-only medical education podcast use in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education. The authors excluded studies without original data or with nonphysician data that could not be separated from physician data. From included studies, the authors extracted data regarding descriptive outcomes (e.g., podcast use, content areas, structure) and educational outcomes (classified using Kirkpatrick's 4 levels of evaluation).Of 491 unique articles, 62 met inclusion criteria. Descriptive outcomes were reported in 44 studies. Analysis of these studies revealed podcast use has increased over time, podcasts are a top resource for resident education, and podcasts are being incorporated into formal medical curricula. Educational outcomes were reported in 38 studies. The 29 studies that assessed learner reaction and attitudes to podcasts (Kirkpatrick level 1) showed learners value podcasts for their portability, efficiency, and combined educational and entertainment value. The 10 studies that assessed knowledge retention (Kirkpatrick level 2) showed podcasts to be noninferior to traditional teaching methods. The 11 studies that assessed behavior change (Kirkpatrick level 3) showed improved documentation skills in medical students and self-reported practice change in residents and practicing physicians after listening to podcasts. None of the studies reported system change or patient outcomes (Kirkpatrick level 4). RESULTS Of 491 unique articles, 62 met inclusion criteria. Descriptive outcomes were reported in 44 studies.

    "Abstract": "Preeclampsia is a life-threatening condition unique to pregnancy that contributes to maternal mortality worldwide. Delays in diagnosis and treatment are contributing factors for most maternal deaths from preeclampsia. Patients who are educated and knowledgeable regarding this disease process may present earlier for care. BACKGROUND Preeclampsia is a life-threatening condition unique to pregnancy that contributes to maternal mortality worldwide. Delays in diagnosis and treatment are contributing factors for most maternal deaths from preeclampsia. Patients who are educated and knowledgeable regarding this disease process may present earlier for care.To assess whether two different visual aids are effective methods to educate patients about preeclampsia, and to evaluate the potential impact of these visual aids on patient anxiety. OBJECTIVE To assess whether two different visual aids are effective methods to educate patients about preeclampsia, and to evaluate the potential impact of these visual aids on patient anxiety.Primigravid participants at a tertiary care center were given a survey regarding preeclampsia knowledge 18-25 weeks gestation. Participants were then randomized to preeclampsia education with a graphic card, an educational video, or through routine prenatal care. Participants completed the survey again at 32-37 weeks gestation. We compared the follow-up preeclampsia knowledge score for each type of education as well as the level of anxiety after viewing the video or graphic card. STUDY DESIGN Primigravid participants at a tertiary care center were given a survey regarding preeclampsia knowledge 18-25 weeks gestation. Participants were then randomized to preeclampsia education with a graphic card, an educational video, or through routine prenatal care. Participants completed the survey again at 32-37 weeks gestation. We compared the follow-up preeclampsia knowledge score for each type of education as well as the level of anxiety after viewing the video or graphic card.Recruitment began 9 May 2016 and ceased 18 January 2017. A total of 179 patients were randomized and 150 participants completed the study, with 56 shown the graphic card, 45 shown the educational video, and 49 who had only routine prenatal counseling. The remaining 28 patients were lost to follow up and 1 was withdrawn. There was no significant difference in preeclampsia knowledge score at follow-up. There was no significant difference in anxiety score before and after viewing either educational tool for those randomized to either the graphic card ( p  = .64) or the video ( p  = .63).

Patient anxiety does not appear to be impacted by preeclampsia education with a graphic card or an educational video. CONCLUSIONS There is no additional improvement of patient knowledge retention when patients receive education with a graphic card versus an educational video over routine prenatal counseling. Patient anxiety does not appear to be impacted by preeclampsia education with a graphic card or an educational video.",

    "Abstract": "In health care today, the ability to predict and prevent adverse events such as post operative pulmonary complications has become increasingly important as a measure of safety and quality of care within the constraints of current health care system economics, workforce shortages and increasing patient care complexity means nurses must take proactive approach in identifying and reducing risk of patient complications. 6 In health care today, the ability to predict and prevent adverse events such as post operative pulmonary complications has become increasingly important as a measure of the safety and quality of care delivered. In this period the number of major abdominal operations performed was 12,897,800, post operative pulmonary complications which occurred after surgery was listed as 3, 88,400 in men (7.8percent) and 4, 52, 800 in women (5.7percent).9 A study was conducted on knowledge retention from pre operative patient information. Sree Siddhartha Medical College and District Government Hospital have 40-50 surgical patients who were consulting in causality and surgical Outpatient Department in a day. The population of this study was pre operative patients in Sree Siddhartha Medical College and Research Center and District Government Hospital, Tumkur, who were admitted for elective surgery in surgical wards.",

    "Abstract": "The notion of teaching experts’ habits of mind (e.g., computational thinking and scientific thinking) to novices seems to have inspired many educators and researchers worldwide. In particular, a great deal of efforts has been invested in computational thinking (CT) and its manifestations in different fields. However, there remain some troubling spots in CT education as far as how to teach it at different levels of education. The same argument applies to teaching scientific thinking (ST) skills. A remedy has been suggested to narrow CT and ST skillsets down to core cognitive competencies so they can be introduced in early and middle grades and continue to be nurtured during secondary and post-secondary years. Neuroscientists suggest that the act of (computational) thinking is strongly linked to the acts of information storage/retrieval by our brain. Plus, years of research have shown that retrieval practices promote not only knowledge retention but also inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning. Not surprisingly, these reasoning skills are core elements of both CT and ST skillsets. This article will mesh the findings of a teacher professional development with the existing literature to lay a claim that retrieval practices enhance CT and ST skills. The study offered training to secondary school teachers (n = 275) who conducted classroom action research to measure the impact of retrieval practices on teaching and learning of STEM and CT concepts. We used a quasi-experimental research design with purposeful sampling and a sequential mixed-methods approach focusing on the impact of professional development on teacher outcomes and, in turn, on student outcomes. A survey of teacher participants showed that the majority (96%) of survey respondents (n = 232) reported a good understanding of retrieval strategies, and how relevant ideas can be implemented and tested in the classroom. A large number of action research (target-control) studies by teachers (n = 122) showed that students who learned STEM and CS concepts through retrieval practices consistently scored 5–30% higher than those using the usual blocked practice. In most cases, the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). While the study contributes to retrieval practices literature, those looking for best practices to teach core CT and ST skills should benefit from it the most. The study concludes with some recommendations for future research based on the limitations of its current findings.

    "Abstract": "Background: The management of patients’ holistic symptom needs are often complex and challenging. The education needs of undergraduate nursing students must be optimally addressed to have a significant positive impact on patient care. Mobile spaced learning has been recognised as a form of online education which can provide a novel approach to delivering effective evidence based healthcare education to undergraduate students. Objective: The objective of this pilot study was to explore the experiences of undergraduate nursing students in a university setting, of using mobile spaced learning as a digital platform for symptom management education. Method: This pilot study used a mixed methods approach. Online spaced learning material, which utilised both case based scenarios and multiple choice questions, was delivered to first year undergraduate nursing students over a period of 2 weeks. Participants were then invited to participate in an online survey related to the usability of mobile spaced learning. A focus group was conducted to further explore the participants’ views. Result: Findings conveyed that students viewed mobile spaced learning as an acceptable platform that enhanced both their learning and their ability to transfer knowledge into clinical practice. Conclusion: Implementation of a digital spaced learning intervention would be acceptable to undergraduate nursing students learning about holistic symptom management. Further research is needed to explore the feasibility of implementing this intervention within the undergraduate nursing curriculum, and also to explore the impact on long-term knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "The current study investigated the relations between gamified refutations of COVID-19 misconceptions and individuals’ emotional reactions and knowledge retention within a large-scale public health education campaign. Refutations have a substantial body of evidence supporting their use to correct misconceptions, yet reduced efficacy has been observed for some topics that generate negative emotional responses. We tested whether gamification could mitigate these limits given that it capitalizes on positive affective engagement. From May to December 2020, approximately 200,000 individuals were recruited from social media in Canada to engage with a nongame interactive survey as a control or a fully gamified platform focused on correcting COVID-19 misconceptions. Gamification was associated with a greater number of happiness and anxiety responses and fewer responses of anger and skepticism in reaction to having misconceptions corrected by refutations. Further, participants who engaged with gamified refutations retained correct information after a brief period. Finally, happiness and anxiety were positively associated with and anger and skepticism were negatively associated with retention of refutation information and support for related public health policies. Implications for scaling up and reinforcing the benefits of refutations for public engagement with science are discussed.

    "Abstract": "Students need to learn and practice computational thinking and skills throughout PreK-12 to be better prepared for entering college and future careers. We designed a math-infused computer science course for third to fifth graders to learn programming. This study aims to investigate the impact of the course on students’ knowledge acquisition of mathematical and computational concepts, motivation, and perceptions of the computing activities. Fifty-one students at a Boys and Girls Club participated in the study. Data collection procedures include pre- and post-tests, pre- and post-surveys, in-class observations, and one-on-one interviews. Results indicate that students have improved significantly on mathematical and computational concepts. They also tended to believe computer programming is fun, comprehensible, enjoyable, and were able to perceive the value of learning it. Implications and recommendations for future research are also discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "In this research, we seek to explore the impact of the shift in pedagogy for management education from a conventional setting to a virtual learning mode. We aim to develop and validate a virtual learning outcome measurement scale to measure the perceptions of current and recent management students on different aspects of learning intake and learning outcomes in a virtual setting as compared to a completely classroom-based environment. We have developed and validated a 12-item scale that has been drafted with the support of prior literature, followed by two Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) (n = 4). We performed exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on the responses gathered to understand if our variables are interrelated and whether they could be grouped into clusters. The three identified constructs of the scale namely \"Acquisition of Knowledge, Retention of Knowledge, and Application of Knowledge\" have been supported by exploratory factor analysis (CFA) and structural modelling using confirmatory factor analysis (n = 104). Measurement of learning outcomes using this scale can be used to develop better learning interventions for management students. The study further can also be extended and generalizable to other higher education domains.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG We studied Hmong medicinal plant knowledge in Thailand, focusing on knowledge transmission and retention. Sixteen herbalist specialists and 210 non-herbalist-specialist informants were interviewed. Hmong medicinal plant knowledge is increasingly being threatened. The non-specialist informants used only a fraction of the medicinal plants that they knew were useful. Many species had not been used for a long time and some had disappeared from the study areas. This is particularly true for younger generations who had higher levels of formal education, literacy skill, and who used more internet and social media.

    "Abstract": "Objectives Information literacy skills are crucial for practicing evidence-based medicine (Kingsley and Kingsley 2009; Saranto and Hovenga 2004). To prepare medical students, the Lane Medical Library provides a 90-minute class for all first-year medical and physician assistant students. The learning goal is to teach health professionals to locate and identify the best available medical evidence efficiently and systematically, and how to effectively share information literacy skills with their patients to discern misinformation. The learning objectives include: 1. understanding PubMed features and literature collection compared to Google Scholar and point-of-care tools; 2. formulating advanced evidence search strategies 3. discussing elements of various critical appraisal tools 4. exploring means and tools to improve patients’ health literacy and combat health misinformation. Method The course was conducted in a flipped classroom format and included examples related to underserved populations. We offered the training at the beginning of the first quarter. A pre-class survey was conducted to assess the literature search experience based on students’ educational backgrounds and familiarity with various literature sources. Before class, students were asked to provide a literature search strategy for a systematic review on ADHD in black communities. Students were divided into small groups to rewrite the PubMed search strategy after learning PubMed features and advanced literature search techniques. Students compared their pre-class and group PubMed search results with the search strategy used in the published systematic review on the same topic. Students also graded three pre-selected articles on their quality to demonstrate the critical appraisal process and identify red flags, like spinning. The end-of-semester examination included questions related to information literacy skills in order to assess knowledge retention. Results In 2021, there were one hundred and nineteen students in this class. Twenty-two students graduated from postgraduate programs. Seventy-six students reported they were very familiar with searching the PubMed database. In a multiple-choice question, ninety-one students selected the correct combination of Boolean operators and parentheses in finding comparative studies. However, only forty-six students used Boolean operators when developing their own PubMed search strategies. Instead of combining keywords and Boolean operators, six students wrote a complete sentence as their PubMed search strategy. One hundred and five students selected the correct Boolean operators for the same multiple-choice question during the final examination. Fifty students incorporated advanced search techniques, such as Medical Subject Headings, to formulate a PubMed search strategy for a clinical question. However, two students still used almost complete sentences instead of appropriate keywords when searching PubMed. Students showed difficulties identifying papers using inappropriate methodologies or exaggerating results during class discussions. Conclusions Advanced Information literacy skills are crucial for students to successfully navigate the exponentially increased volume of medical literature and provide the best care to patients. Even though students rated themselves as experienced PubMed searchers, our pre-class survey showed that most students were unfamiliar with most PubMed features and advanced literature searching techniques. This pre-class exercise helped students experience the challenges encountered by our patients without formal medical training in finding the right medical information. Most students improved their literature searching skills and were able to identify red flags for low-quality papers even after the first 90-minute session. By applying information literacy skills, students could locate and critically appraise medical literature efficiently and systematically. Offering this training at the beginning of the first quarter gives students the opportunity to develop critical skills and be able to apply them during clerkships and share this knowledge with patients to combat health misinformation.",

    "Abstract": "Students need to learn and practice computational thinking and skills throughout PreK-12 to be better prepared for entering college and future careers. We designed a math-infused computer science course for third to fifth graders to learn programming. This study aims to investigate the impact of the course on students’ knowledge acquisition of mathematical and computational concepts, motivation, and perceptions of the computing activities. Fifty-one students at a Boys and Girls Club participated in the study. Data collection procedures include pre- and post-tests, pre- and post-surveys, in-class observations, and one-on-one interviews. Results indicate that students have improved significantly on mathematical and computational concepts. They also tended to believe computer programming is fun, comprehensible, enjoyable, and were able to perceive the value of learning it. Implications and recommendations for future research are also discussed.",

    "Abstract": "The authors of this article examine the potential for increased student learning and retention through more frequent assignments. They conduct a field experiment that investigates whether student knowledge retention can be improved by increasing the frequency of homework assignments, motivating students to have more exposure to the material, and reducing the incentives for students to procrastinate. They find that the impact of the treatment on student performance varies based on the student's past academic performance. Students on the lower end of the academic performance distribution benefit from the structure imposed by more frequent assignments and perform better. However, students with high prior academic performance are harmed by the intervention. The final exam scores of high-performing students are lower in courses with higher assignment frequency.",

    "Abstract": "Background The management of patients’ holistic symptom needs are often complex and challenging. The education needs of undergraduate nursing students must be optimally addressed to have a significant positive impact on patient care. Mobile spaced learning has been recognised as a form of online education which can provide a novel approach to delivering effective evidence based healthcare education to undergraduate students. Objective The objective of this pilot study was to explore the experiences of undergraduate nursing students in a university setting, of using mobile spaced learning as a digital platform for symptom management education. Method This pilot study used a mixed methods approach. Online spaced learning material, which utilised both case based scenarios and multiple choice questions, was delivered to first year undergraduate nursing students over a period of 2 weeks. Participants were then invited to participate in an online survey related to the usability of mobile spaced learning. A focus group was conducted to further explore the participants’ views. Result Findings conveyed that students viewed mobile spaced learning as an acceptable platform that enhanced both their learning and their ability to transfer knowledge into clinical practice. Conclusion Implementation of a digital spaced learning intervention would be acceptable to undergraduate nursing students learning about holistic symptom management. Further research is needed to explore the feasibility of implementing this intervention within the undergraduate nursing curriculum, and also to explore the impact on long-term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Shared decision making (SDM) is ideally suited to abdominal wall surgery in older adults given the breadth of decision making required by the hernia surgeon and the impact on quality of life (QOL) by various treatment options. Given the paucity of literature surrounding SDM in hernia patients, the feasibility of a novel, formalized SDM aid/tool was evaluated in a pilot randomized trial. Methods Patients 60 years or older with a diagnosed ventral hernia were prospectively randomized at an academic hernia center. In the experimental arm, a novel SDM tool, based on the SHARE Approach , guided the consultation. Previously validated SDM assessments and patient’s hernia knowledge retention was measured. Results Eighteen (18) patients were randomized (9 control and 9 experimental). Cohorts were well matched in age ( p  = 0.51), comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Score: p  = 0.43) and frailty (mFI-11: p  = 0.19; Risk Analysis Index: p  = 0.33). Consultation time was 11 min longer in the experimental cohort ( p  < 0.01). There was a trend towards better Decisional Conflict Scores in the experimental group ( p  = 0.25) and the experimental cohort had improved post-visit retained hernia knowledge ( p  < 0.01). All patients in the experimental arm (100%) enjoyed working through the SDM aid/tool and felt it was a worthwhile exercise. Conclusion Incorporating a formalized SDM tool into a busy hernia surgical practice is feasible and well received by patients. In addition, early results suggest it improves retention of basic hernia knowledge and may reduce patient’s decisional conflict. Next steps include condensing the SDM tool to enhance efficiency within the clinic and beginning a large, randomized control trial.",

    "Abstract": "Medical education has seen a shift toward interactive teaching in small groups that actively involves students in learning. However, didactic teaching, despite drawbacks such as student isolation and low stimulation of critical thinking, is still a very commonly used teaching method. For didactic teaching to be effective, teachers must possess strategies and skills that enable them to teach effectively in large groups and increase students' knowledge retention. This can be achieved if class sessions are planned in advance with the aim of making them interactive and engaging with all students. In the following article, I write about my experiences using the CASCADE method, an acronym of the words \"create,\" \"assess,\" \"sequence,\" \"charisma,\" \"activate,\" \"discussion,\" and \"e-device,\" which creates interactive didactic sessions.",

    "Abstract": "Educational systems can benefit from Virtual Reality’s (VR) ability to support experiential learning. In particular, VR based games, especially role-playing serious games (RPGs), can promote learning through the simulation of various educational scenarios. This study proposes an immersive VR-RPG to educate players about the behavior of honeybees. The player adopts the role of a honeybee and experiences a virtual world mimicking the real one from the honeybee’s perspective. Unlike most studies in educational VR, we assess the impact of immersion on knowledge gain by testing the players’ knowledge on the subject before, immediately after, and one week following the use of the system. We also compare the proposed system with both a conventional and a desktop VR-RPG approach. The results indicate that students significantly gained knowledge in all methods compared to the pre-test. We found that the immersion level for both tested VR-RPGs did not have a significant effect on learning. However, the study showed an improvement in knowledge retention for the desktop VR-RPG users compared to those of the conventional method. Moreover, the results revealed that users of the immersive and desktop VR-RPGs were more motivated and engaged compared to those of the conventional method.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose According to World Health Organization, our planet will need more than 40 million new doctors, nurses, frontline healthcare workers, and other healthcare professionals by the year 2030, which is double the current medical workforce (1). The existing training model (a master teaching a limited number of apprentices over the course of several years) is unable to meet the level of healthcare professionals needed. Empirical evidence from other industries demonstrates virtual reality (VR) technology is an effective and efficient way of improving training. Methods VR technology allows users to interact with a computer-simulated environment. VR implementation in medicine focuses on the rapid acceleration of human learning in medical training. It aims to provide technology for medical staff to reskill and upskill more effectively, without a large time investment. The combination of cognitive training in an experience-based learning virtual environment enabled by advanced VR software and hardware provides several advantages: (1) unrestricted training time, increased training access during COVID-19 restrictions; (2) remote training access: growing demand for health professionals in countries with less developed infrastructure; (3) modernizing standards: during simulated training competency evaluations for residents are performed. Results (1) Increased trainee engagement and knowledge retention (70%) compared to videos (10%) or lecturing (5%) (2) Decreased training time, 29% less OR training time due to skill transfer from VR to OR (3) Decreased training costs. Conclusions An intelligent VR training simulation for dental healthcare professionals results in a proven skills transfer and embodied cognition in a fail-safe environment, in scalable training with low-cost and on-demand VR software, as well as in progress achieved through learning curricula faster, at lower cost and with the highest fidelity.",

    "Abstract": "Shared decision making (SDM) is ideally suited to abdominal wall surgery in older adults given the breadth of decision making required by the hernia surgeon and the impact on quality of life (QOL) by various treatment options. Given the paucity of literature surrounding SDM in hernia patients, the feasibility of a novel, formalized SDM aid/tool was evaluated in a pilot randomized trial. PURPOSE Shared decision making (SDM) is ideally suited to abdominal wall surgery in older adults given the breadth of decision making required by the hernia surgeon and the impact on quality of life (QOL) by various treatment options. Given the paucity of literature surrounding SDM in hernia patients, the feasibility of a novel, formalized SDM aid/tool was evaluated in a pilot randomized trial.Patients 60 years or older with a diagnosed ventral hernia were prospectively randomized at an academic hernia center. In the experimental arm, a novel SDM tool, based on the SHARE Approach, guided the consultation. Previously validated SDM assessments and patient's hernia knowledge retention was measured. METHODS Patients 60 years or older with a diagnosed ventral hernia were prospectively randomized at an academic hernia center. In the experimental arm, a novel SDM tool, based on the SHARE Approach, guided the consultation. Previously validated SDM assessments and patient's hernia knowledge retention was measured.Eighteen (18) patients were randomized (9 control and 9 experimental). Cohorts were well matched in age (p = 0.51), comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Score: p = 0.43) and frailty (mFI-11: p = 0.19; Risk Analysis Index: p = 0.33). Consultation time was 11 min longer in the experimental cohort (p < 0.01). There was a trend towards better Decisional Conflict Scores in the experimental group (p = 0.25) and the experimental cohort had improved post-visit retained hernia knowledge (p < 0.01). All patients in the experimental arm (100%) enjoyed working through the SDM aid/tool and felt it was a worthwhile exercise. RESULTS Eighteen (18) patients were randomized (9 control and 9 experimental). Cohorts were well matched in age (p = 0.51), comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Score: p = 0.43) and frailty (mFI-11: p = 0.19; Risk Analysis Index: p = 0.33). Consultation time was 11 min longer in the experimental cohort (p < 0.01). There was a trend towards better Decisional Conflict Scores in the experimental group (p = 0.25) and the experimental cohort had improved post-visit retained hernia knowledge (p < 0.01). All patients in the experimental arm (100%) enjoyed working through the SDM aid/tool and felt it was a worthwhile exercise.Incorporating a formalized SDM tool into a busy hernia surgical practice is feasible and well received by patients. In addition, early results suggest it improves retention of basic hernia knowledge and may reduce patient's decisional conflict. Next steps include condensing the SDM tool to enhance efficiency within the clinic and beginning a large, randomized control trial.

    "Abstract": "Educational systems can benefit from Virtual Reality’s (VR) ability to support experiential learning. In particular, VR based games, especially role-playing serious games (RPGs), can promote learning through the simulation of various educational scenarios. This study proposes an immersive VR-RPG to educate players about the behavior of honeybees. The player adopts the role of a honeybee and experiences a virtual world mimicking the real one from the honeybee’s perspective. Unlike most studies in educational VR, we assess the impact of immersion on knowledge gain by testing the players’ knowledge on the subject before, immediately after, and one week following the use of the system. We also compare the proposed system with both a conventional and a desktop VR-RPG approach. The results indicate that students significantly gained knowledge in all methods compared to the pre-test. We found that the immersion level for both tested VR-RPGs did not have a significant effect on learning. However, the study showed an improvement in knowledge retention for the desktop VR-RPG users compared to those of the conventional method. Moreover, the results revealed that users of the immersive and desktop VR-RPGs were more motivated and engaged compared to those of the conventional method.

    "Abstract": "Even though substance users have the highest hepatitis C virus (HCV) burden, many lack knowledge about the infection. Lack of knowledge is an important obstacle to pursuing HCV care. Although printed materials are conventionally utilized to disseminate HCV-related knowledge, narrative story-telling videos may be an alternative. Data are extremely limited, however, in the ability of storytelling videos to increase HCV knowledge among substance users. In this study, we hypothesized that a story-telling narrative video would increase substance user's immediate and 1-month HCV-related knowledge compared to a printed format. BACKGROUND Even though substance users have the highest hepatitis C virus (HCV) burden, many lack knowledge about the infection. Lack of knowledge is an important obstacle to pursuing HCV care. Although printed materials are conventionally utilized to disseminate HCV-related knowledge, narrative story-telling videos may be an alternative. Data are extremely limited, however, in the ability of storytelling videos to increase HCV knowledge among substance users. In this study, we hypothesized that a story-telling narrative video would increase substance user's immediate and 1-month HCV-related knowledge compared to a printed format.To assess immediate and 1-month HCV-related knowledge retention among substance users comparing education delivered via a storytelling narrative video compared to a printed format. AIM To assess immediate and 1-month HCV-related knowledge retention among substance users comparing education delivered via a storytelling narrative video compared to a printed format.We conducted a prospective matched, case-control study among substance users actively prescribed buprenorphine enrolled from two sites. The intervention site received the video and the control site, the brochure. Participants ( n = 176) were matched on age, gender, and race. We obtained extensive patient and stakeholder input on the video's design, validated the video's content, and developed a recruitment plan to guide participant enrollment. Knowledge was assessed by administration of a 25-item instrument immediately before, immediately after, or one month after the intervention. Data were analyzed using nonparametric and generalized linear mixed-effects models. METHODS We conducted a prospective matched, case-control study among substance users actively prescribed buprenorphine enrolled from two sites. The intervention site received the video and the control site, the brochure. Participants (n = 176) were matched on age, gender, and race. We obtained extensive patient and stakeholder input on the video's design, validated the video's content, and developed a recruitment plan to guide participant enrollment. Knowledge was assessed by administration of a 25-item instrument immediately before, immediately after, or one month after the intervention. Data were analyzed using nonparametric and generalized linear mixed-effects models.We recruited a total of 176 substance users, 90 and 86 individuals, from each site, respectively. One-month follow up occurred in 92% and 94% of enrollees in the control and intervention groups, respectively. In comparison with the pre-intervention scores, immediate knowledge recall increased significantly for both the intervention ( P < 0.0001) and control ( P < 0.0001) groups. Multivariate modeling revealed a significant improvement in HCV-related knowledge and retention ( P = 0.033) among participants who viewed the storytelling video.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Individuals’ conceptual knowledge of contemporary biological issues influences ethical attitudes and life decisions around health, as evidenced by the recent worldwide debate on vaccinations. The reasons for which the public opinion is so critically divided can be partially explained from the didactic approaches used in biology education. In view of the rapid evolution of Virtual Reality (VR) as well as the increasing interest that youths have shown toward Escape Rooms (ER), an unexplored research and development avenue is identified. In this experimental study, we present the design and development steps as well as the evaluation of a VRER dedicated to biology education. For comparison purposes, an educational instructional video utilising the storytelling technique was also prepared. Both approaches were examined in the upper secondary education context with participants (N = 50) emerging from the Applied Sciences academic path. The key-findings suggest that the active learning approach leads to increased knowledge acquisition, in the short term, as opposed to the passive learning approach but no significant differences were identified in the long term (knowledge retention) across the methods. Based on the instructional decisions made and the key-findings emerged we provide implications and guidelines for the design, development, and integration of VRER in education.

    "Abstract": "Mass chemical exposure emergencies are infrequent but can cause injury, illness, or loss of life for large numbers of victims. These emergencies can stretch and challenge the available resources of healthcare systems within the community. Political unrest in the Middle East, including chemical terrorist attacks against civilians in Syria and increasing chemical industry accidents, have highlighted the lack of hospital preparedness for chemical incidents in the region. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a course designed to empower frontline healthcare providers involved in mass casualty incidents with the basic knowledge and essential operational skills for mass chemical exposure incidents in Saudi Arabia. BACKGROUND Mass chemical exposure emergencies are infrequent but can cause injury, illness, or loss of life for large numbers of victims. These emergencies can stretch and challenge the available resources of healthcare systems within the community. Political unrest in the Middle East, including chemical terrorist attacks against civilians in Syria and increasing chemical industry accidents, have highlighted the lack of hospital preparedness for chemical incidents in the region. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a course designed to empower frontline healthcare providers involved in mass casualty incidents with the basic knowledge and essential operational skills for mass chemical exposure incidents in Saudi Arabia.A mixed-methods approach was used to develop a blended learning, simulation enhanced, competency-based course for major chemical incidents for front line healthcare providers. The course was designed by experts from different disciplines (disaster medicine, poisoning / toxicology, and Hazard Material Threat - HAZMAT team) in four stages. The course was piloted over five days at the Officers Club of the Ministry of Interior (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). The 41 participants were from different government health discipline sectors in the country. Pre- and post-tests were used to assess learner knowledge while debriefing sessions after the decontamination triage session and simulation-enhanced exercises were used for team performance assessment.

All four knowledge domains also had significant differences between pre- and post-test results. There were no differences in the pre and post-test scores for healthcare providers from the different health disciplines. A one-year post-event survey demonstrated that participants were satisfied with their knowledge retention. Interestingly, 38.3% had the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice in relation to mass chemical exposure incidents.

    "Abstract": "Increased bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is essential to improve survival after cardiac arrest. Although most studies focus on technical CPR skills, the randomized Lowlands Saves Lives trial prespecified a follow-up survey on other important aspects that affect the widespread performance of CPR. Importance Increased bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is essential to improve survival after cardiac arrest. Although most studies focus on technical CPR skills, the randomized Lowlands Saves Lives trial prespecified a follow-up survey on other important aspects that affect the widespread performance of CPR.To investigate bystander willingness to perform CPR on a stranger, theoretical knowledge retention, and dissemination of CPR awareness 6 months after undergoing short face-to-face and virtual reality (VR) CPR trainings. Objective To investigate bystander willingness to perform CPR on a stranger, theoretical knowledge retention, and dissemination of CPR awareness 6 months after undergoing short face-to-face and virtual reality (VR) CPR trainings.A prespecified 6-month posttraining survey was conducted among 320 participants in the Lowlands Saves Lives trial, a randomized comparison between 20-minute face-to-face, instructor-led CPR training and VR training. Participants were recruited at the Lowlands music festival, with a designated area to conduct scientific projects (August 16-18, 2019; the Netherlands). Statistical analysis was performed from March 1, 2020, to July 31, 2021. Design, Setting, and Participants A prespecified 6-month posttraining survey was conducted among 320 participants in the Lowlands Saves Lives trial, a randomized comparison between 20-minute face-to-face, instructor-led CPR training and VR training. Participants were recruited at the Lowlands music festival, with a designated area to conduct scientific projects (August 16-18, 2019; the Netherlands). Statistical analysis was performed from March 1, 2020, to July 31, 2021.Two standardized 20-minute protocols on CPR and automated external defibrillator use: instructor-led face-to-face training using CPR manikins or VR training using the Resuscitation Council (UK)-endorsed Lifesaver VR smartphone application and a pillow to practice compressions. Interventions Two standardized 20-minute protocols on CPR and automated external defibrillator use: instructor-led face-to-face training using CPR manikins or VR training using the Resuscitation Council (UK)-endorsed Lifesaver VR smartphone application and a pillow to practice compressions.Primary outcomes were willingness to perform CPR on a stranger, theoretical knowledge retention, and dissemination of CPR awareness as reported by the entire cohort. As secondary analyses, the results of the 2 training modalities were compared. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes were willingness to perform CPR on a stranger, theoretical knowledge retention, and dissemination of CPR awareness as reported by the entire cohort. As secondary analyses, the results of the 2 training modalities were compared.Of 381 participants, 320 consented to this follow-up survey; 188 participants (115 women [61%]; median age, 26 years [IQR, 22-32 years]) completed the entire survey and were accordingly included in the secondary analysis. The overall proportion of participants willing to perform CPR on a stranger was 77% (144 of 188): 81% (79 of 97) among face-to-face participants and 71% (65 of 91) among VR participants (P = .02); 103 participants (55%) reported feeling scared to perform CPR (P = .91). Regarding theoretical knowledge retention, a median of 7 (IQR, 6-8) of 9 questions were answered correctly in both groups (P = .81). Regarding dissemination of CPR awareness, 65% of participants (123 of 188) told at least 1 to 10 family members or friends about the importance of CPR, and 15% (29 of 188) had participated in certified, instructor-led training at the time of the survey, without differences between groups. Results Of 381 participants, 320 consented to this follow-up survey; 188 participants (115 women [61%]; median age, 26 years [IQR, 22-32 years]) completed the entire survey and were accordingly included in the secondary analysis.

Theoretical knowledge retention was good, and the high dissemination of awareness suggests that these novel CPR training modules staged at a public event are promising sensitizers for involvement in CPR, although further challenges include mitigating the fear of performing CPR.

    "Abstract": "Occupational health and safety training given to employees is generally evaluated with multiple-choice tests, one of the classic methods. In multiple-choice exams, it is a serious danger that the personnel's perception of danger cannot develop due to accidental errors and that the trainings are not efficient. Therefore, a study was conducted with 174 personnel working in the construction sector in Canakkale, in which classic and alternative measurement and evaluation systems were compared in the field of occupational health and safety. Research data were analyzed with SPSS 24.0 program. As a result of the research, it was determined that both the level of knowledge and the level of knowledge retention were higher in the personnel who applied the alternative system compared to the personnel who applied the classical system. With this study, it is possible to gain a new perspective on measurement and evaluation systems in OHS training.",

    "Abstract": "Augmented, mixed, and virtual reality applications and content have surged into the higher education arena, thereby allowing institutions to engage in research and development projects to better understand their efficacy within curricula. However, despite the increasing interest, there remains a lack of robust empirical evidence to justify the mainstream acceptance of this approach as an effective and efficient learning tool. In this study, the impact of a mixed reality application focused on long spinal cord sensory and motor pathways is explored in comparison to an existing resource already embedded within an active curriculum (e.g., anatomy drawing screencasts). To assess the changes in learner gain, a quasi‐randomized control trial with a pre‐ and post‐test methodology was used on a cohort of Year 2 medical students, with both the absolute and normalized gain calculated. Similar patterns of learner gain were observed between the two groups; only the multiple‐choice questionnaires were shown to be answered significantly higher with the screencast group. This study adds important empirical data to the emerging field of immersive technologies and the specific impact on short‐term knowledge gain for neuroanatomy teaching, specifically that of long sensory and motor pathways. Despite the limitations of the study, it provides important additional data to the field and intends to support colleagues across the education landscape in making evidence‐informed decisions about the value of including such resources into their curricula.

    "Abstract": "Comments on an article by K. Gloy et al. (see record 2022-42238-012). Gloy et al. explored the value of an immersive virtual reality (VR) atlas in anatomy education. It was demonstrated that this teaching method was beneficial for students' knowledge and, thus, it was recommended as a support in cadaveric dissection courses. According to the authors, the effectiveness of the immersive VR atlas could be attributed to the high immersion of the virtual environment or to the possibility of free and interactive exploration of a realistic representation of anatomy. It can be pointed out that the implementation of immersive VR has been accompanied by positive outcomes regarding health professions education. The literature suggests that interaction is a parameter, which seems to play a significant role in the superiority of VR to traditional methods, in terms of anatomy teaching effectiveness. Although the literature so far has not proven that immersive VR is better anatomy pedagogy tool than conventional methods, the findings of the study by Gloy et al. are interesting and could stimulate further research in this field. It seems that, regardless of the immersive nature of VR or not, it is the presence of interaction in VR which is crucial for better anatomy learning outcomes. When anatomy educators consider the implementation of immersive VR, the incorporation of interaction seems necessary for the achievement of the best possible effectiveness of this teaching strategy.

    "Abstract": "In Stieglerian fashion, this paper is concerned with both the loss and the re-creation of knowledge in the field of architecture. The student of architecture must be the one who learns new tools and new forms of knowledge and this has profound implications and applicability for the philosophy of education as it is a question of the recuperation of architecture with negentropic tools. Why? In the realm of the digital, it is the case that architectural student is at risk of dis-individuation, the loss of knowledge of such. Therefore, the paper concerns itself with questions of maturity, critical intelligence, trans-individuation, the crisis of noetic being, the artisanal mode of learning and finally the proletarianization of the faculties. It is concerned with the reclamation of noetic space and the search for negentropic tools. This paper is thus pertinent to the philosophy of education because it pertains to the act of creation, the question of imagination and to the loss of thinking as such. Focusing on the history of architecture it demonstrates the loss of knowledge in the history of architecture and shows this has clear implications for the philosophy of education, which is precisely concerned with the nurturing and maturing of the thinking subject. The crisis in the proletarianization of the faculties in architecture pinpoints the role of the artisan’s mode of learning and its crisis brought by the digitisation of architecture.

Much of the knowledge acquired in the last decades comes from the study of dissociations found in patients with acquired difficulties in language, perception, and action.

In this paper, a new test designed to study the dissociation between function and manipulation is proposed and normative values for a control population are provided. This novel test was additionally administered to and evaluated in a group of Parkinson's disease patients.

    "Abstract": "Background Coagulation testing provides a prime opportunity to make an impact on the reduction of unnecessary laboratory test ordering, as there are clear indications for testing. Despite the prothrombin time/international normalized ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time being validated for specific clinical indications, they are frequently ordered as screening tests and often ordered together, suggesting a gap in understanding of coagulation. Methods Based on a needs assessment, we developed an online educational module on coagulation for trainees, incorporating education on testing cost, specificity, and sensitivity. Fifty participating resident physicians and medical students completed a validated premodule quiz, postmodule quiz after completion of the module, and a latent quiz 3 to 6 months after to assess longer-term knowledge retention. Trainees provided responses regarding their subjective laboratory test-ordering practices before and after module completion. Results The median premodule quiz score was 67% (n = 50; range, 24%-86%) with an increase of 24% to a median postmodule quiz score of 91% (n = 50; range, 64%-100%). There was evidence of sustained knowledge acquisition with a latent quiz median score of 89% (n = 40; range, 67%–100%). Trainees were more likely to consider the sensitivity, specificity, and cost of laboratory investigations before ordering them following completion of the educational module. Conclusions Using the expertise of medical educators and incorporating trainee feedback, we employed a novel approach to the teaching of coagulation to maximize its approachability and clinical relevance. We found sustained knowledge retention regarding coagulation and appropriate coagulation test ordering, and a subjective change to trainee ordering habits following participation in our educational intervention.",

BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease-19 pandemic has created changes in the way medicine is practiced. The move to virtual conferencing to avoid mass gatherings is a significant change to how health care professionals meet, discuss current trends, and share research.Data from exit polls conducted after annual wound care symposiums were reviewed. Physicians, nurses, podiatrists, and other health care professionals attended. Respondents were asked to comment and reflect on their experiences of attending a virtual conference. METHODS Data from exit polls conducted after annual wound care symposiums were reviewed. Physicians, nurses, podiatrists, and other health care professionals attended. Respondents were asked to comment and reflect on their experiences of attending a virtual conference.Over 60% of all (N = 283) respondents stated the virtual conference was better than or on par with a live event. Many respondents had attended this live event in person in previous years. Of all respondents, 83% stated that they planned to access conference materials for the 30 days they remained posted after the event. More than 50% of respondents stated they favored the ability to communicate effectively with colleagues via the instant messaging feature offered by the conference. Approximately 80% of respondents stated that they would like to attend this and other conferences virtually in the future.

    "Abstract": "Indigenous peoples have practiced sustainable mariculture for millennia, but many ocean stewardship traditions were banned or forcibly destroyed following European colonization. The subsequent loss of knowledge and traditional skills was \"a bit like burning down a library\", says Kii'iljuus Barbara Wilson, a Haida Matriarch and Indigenous scholar from the Cumshewa Eagle Clan and one of the collaborators of the recently launched Sea Gardens Across the Pacific: Reawakening Ancestral Mariculture Innovations, an interactive \"story map\" of traditional sea gardens. Produced by Indigenous knowledge holders and academics, the project highlights Indigenous mariculture practices with the aim of revitalizing these techniques to improve food sovereignty and resilience. Wilson worked with the team to highlight the octopus houses of Haida Gwaii, one of 22 innovations featured by the map project that also includes fish ponds, weirs, herring egg gardens, root gardens, clam gardens, and eel ponds.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Increasingly, dental education is using digital strategies to deliver teaching; however, not all of these learning materials are engaging and effective. Aim To evaluate the perception and knowledge retention of undergraduate dental students after using two different digital learning tools: quizzes and PDF. Methods Thirty‐three students from a Dental School in the United Kingdom took part in the research. They received learning material derived from the Prosthodontic (Kennedy classification) or Paediatric dentistry content (Tooth classification). The same content was delivered in two different formats: quiz game ( n  = 17) and PDF file ( n  = 16). The PDF file had ten images and their classifications, whilst the quiz had the same images with a question about the classification, along with alternatives (single best answer). Results All students gave similar performances on the knowledge assessment; however, their perception about the learning material differed. Students using quizzes (88%) agreed that they were fun and an interesting way of learning, while only 37.5% had this opinion about PDF material ( p  = .002). When using quizzes, learners were more motivated and confident. They would frequently recommend quizzes to other colleagues; however, the use of PDF was not suggested as frequently ( p  = .039). As a learning strategy, 100% of the students using quizzes wanted more of the same to study other dental subjects. This was not the case with the PDF format ( p  = .005). Conclusion Despite quizzes and PDF files resulting in a similar understanding of dental subjects, learners prefer quizzes to supplement their studies. Educators should consider using this interactive digital tool to engage students, instead of PDF files.",

    "Abstract": "The mobility of inventors leaves behind their patented inventions at sourcing firms, yet there is little scholarly insight into how firms handle those intellectual properties. We investigate this important issue by developing a framework of tacit-codified knowledge interdependence. We theorize that tacit and codified knowledge offer the intellectual and legal pillars of corporate inventions, which complement each other in value creation. Inventor mobility decouples the two pillars and reduces the maintenance likelihood of the left-behind patents. The negative impact is greater for inventions that are complex or rely less on internal prior art because the tacit knowledge loss is more destructive and unrecoverable. However, when inventors move to competing or litigious target firms, the relationship between mobility and patent maintenance becomes less negative or even turns positive because the left-behind patents can be leveraged to hedge against the risk of knowledge leakage. Applying a two-stage Coarsened Exact Matching approach to construct a sample of 36,204 U.S. patents with comparable leaving and staying inventors from public firms between 1983 and 2010, we find strong evidence supporting our framework. Our findings highlight the intricate interdependence of tacit and codified knowledge in corporate inventions and add to the literatures on inventor mobility and intellectual property management.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose > Because the discontinuous and uncertain characteristics of knowledge-based innovation cannot be reasonably interpreted by conventional management approaches, quantum mechanics which begins with uncertainty and concerns with a dynamic process of the complex system, has been exploratorily used in the management field. Although the theoretical new insights are provided by pioneering studies, quantitative research is in short supply. This paper aims to propose a quantum mechanics-based framework for quantitative research, thus extending the application of quantum mechanics in the knowledge management area from a dynamic system evolutionary standpoint. Design/methodology/approach > Based on the similarity comparison between knowledge-based system evolution and atomic motion, the authors construct the atom-like structure of the knowledge-based system and elaborate the evolutionary mechanism of the knowledge-based system, thereby establishing the quantitative model. Apple and Zhongxing Telecom Equipment were selected for an empirical study to demonstrate the usefulness of the models for research on knowledge-based innovation and explore the unique knowledge-based innovation characteristics of the two firms. Findings > First, the transition force of dynamic knowledge shows an inverted U shape; accumulating dynamic knowledge to a moderate degree not only facilitates transforming dynamic knowledge into static knowledge but also balances the relationship between the influence of knowledge force range and dynamic knowledge transformation. Second, existing knowledge is gradually substituted by new knowledge and knowledge density at a high knowledge energy level distinctly increases with a narrower bandwidth. Third, the investment loss is associated with resource configuration, resource utilization and the amount of accumulative dynamic knowledge before investment. Knowledge loss is negatively correlated with the knowledge compatibility coefficient. Research limitations/implications > The authors use the advanced method in quantum mechanics to legitimately unveil the emergence mechanism of knowledge-based innovation. Meanwhile, the authors capture the non-linear transformation relationship of heterogeneous knowledge and expose the change in ways of both investment loss and knowledge loss that cannot be quantified by conventional models. In doing so, the authors not only reveal the principle of qualitative knowledge change but also offer practical implications for developing flexible and targeted innovation strategies. Originality/value > First, by proposing a complete quantum mechanics-based framework, the authors not only supplement the quantitative research contents to knowledge-based innovation literature which proposed calls to conduct research in way of quantum mechanics but also overcome the difficulties of knowledge-based system conceptualization and measurement. Second, the authors reveal the uncertain change of knowledge transformation and measure the loss of investment and knowledge, which contribute to identifying defects of firms in knowledge-based innovation. Third, the authors explore the internal mechanism that led to knowledge-based innovation exhibits non-linear characteristics and capture unique dynamic relationships between different variables which affect the emergence of knowledge-based innovation.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose > The present study empirically compares maintenance practices under asset performance management (APM), employed by firms in developed and developing countries (Belgium and Kenya, respectively). Design/methodology/approach > Empirical observations and theoretical interpretations on maintenance practices under APM are delineated. A comparative cross-sectional survey study is conducted through an online questionnaire with 151 respondents (101 Kenya, 50 Belgium). Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics like independent t -test and phi coefficient were used for analyzing the data. Findings > In both countries, reduction of maintenance and operational budget, return on assets, asset ageing and compliance aspects were established as critical factors influencing the implementation of asset maintenance and performance management (AMPM). A significant difference in staff competence in managing vibration, ultrasound and others like predictive algorithms was found to exist between the firms of the two countries. The majority of firms across the divide utilize manual and computer-based tools to integrate and analyse various maintenance data sets, while standardization and maintenance knowledge loss were found to adversely affect maintenance data management. Research limitations/implications > The study findings are based on the limited number of returned responses of the survey questionnaire and focused on only two countries representing developed and developing economies. This study not only provides practitioners with the practical guidelines for benchmarking, but also induces the need to improve the asset maintenance strategies and data application practices for asset performance management. Practical implications > The paper provides insights to researchers and practitioners in the articulation of imperative effective maintenance strategies, benchmarking and challenges in their implementation, considering the different operational context. Originality/value > The paper contributes to theory and practice within the field of AMPM where no empirical research comparing developed and developing countries exist.",

We created a guideline-based teaching platform for fellows that incorporates these features, and tested it. BACKGROUND AND AIMS In the digital era of evidence-based medicine, there is a paucity of video endoscopy teaching platforms that use evidence-based medicine principles, or that allow for cognitive simulation of endoscopic management strategies. We created a guideline-based teaching platform for fellows that incorporates these features, and tested it.A pilot video module with embedded questions was drafted, and after incorporation of feedback from several attending gastroenterologists, an additional 2 modules were created. The embedded questions were designed to simulate cognitive management decisions as if the viewer were doing the endoscopy procedure in the video. A narrator explained the evidence behind the task being performed, and its certainty based on endoscopic guidelines. Quizzes and surveys were developed and administered to a sample of attendings and fellows who completed the video modules to test efficacy, usability, and likeability. METHODS A pilot video module with embedded questions was drafted, and after incorporation of feedback from several attending gastroenterologists, an additional 2 modules were created. The embedded questions were designed to simulate cognitive management decisions as if the viewer were doing the endoscopy procedure in the video. A narrator explained the evidence behind the task being performed, and its certainty based on endoscopic guidelines. Quizzes and surveys were developed and administered to a sample of attendings and fellows who completed the video modules to test efficacy, usability, and likeability.Three video modules, named evidence-based endoscopy (EBE), incorporating low fidelity simulation, and utilizing evidence-based medicine principles, were created. Eight fellows and 10 attendings completed the video modules and all quizzes and surveys. Mean test scores improved from before to after completing the video modules (56% to 92%; mean difference = -35%; 95% confidence interval, 27%-47%). Surveys indicated that the product was viewed favorably by participants, and that there is a strong desire for this type of educational product.

OBJECTIVES Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has become integral to critical care. Data informing optimal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation education modalities are lacking. We aimed to compare the effect of high-fidelity simulation versus interactive mobile learning on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation knowledge acquisition and retention among clinicians.Observer-blinded, randomized controlled trial. DESIGN Observer-blinded, randomized controlled trial.A single academic medical center. SETTING A single academic medical center.Forty-four critical care clinicians with limited extracorporeal membrane oxygenation experience. SUBJECTS Forty-four critical care clinicians with limited extracorporeal membrane oxygenation experience.Participants were randomized to receive: 1) simulation: three high-fidelity training scenarios, 2) QuizTime: 15 total multiple-choice questions delivered over 3 weeks via mobile device, or 3) experiential: no formal training. Participants completed a survey, written knowledge examination, and simulation assessment prior to randomization, immediately following the intervention, and 4 month postintervention. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to receive: 1) simulation: three high-fidelity training scenarios, 2) QuizTime: 15 total multiple-choice questions delivered over 3 weeks via mobile device, or 3) experiential: no formal training. Participants completed a survey, written knowledge examination, and simulation assessment prior to randomization, immediately following the intervention, and 4 month postintervention.The primary outcome was knowledge about extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assessed by score on the immediate postintervention written examination. Secondary outcomes included performance in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation simulation postintervention and 4 months later assessed by a rater blinded to group assignment. Clinicians randomized to simulation (n = 15), QuizTime (n = 14), and experiential (n = 15) had similar baseline characteristics. Adjusting for baseline knowledge, postintervention examination scores were higher in the simulation group (90.0%; interquartile range, 85.0-90.0%) than the QuizTime group (70.0%; interquartile range, 65.0-80.0%; p = 0.0003) and the experiential group (75.0%; interquartile range, 65.0-80.0%; p = 0.001). Scores did not differ between the groups at 4 months (p > 0.05 in all analyses). In postintervention extracorporeal membrane oxygenation simulations, the simulation group demonstrated shorter time to critical action compared with QuizTime (80.0 s [interquartile range, 54.0-111.0 s] vs 300.0 s [interquartile range 85.0-300.0 s]; p = 0.02) and compared with both QuizTime (45.0 s [interquartile range, 34.0-92.5 s] vs 255.5 s [interquartile range, 102.0-300.0 s]; p = 0.008) and experiential (300.0 s [interquartile range, 58.0-300.0 s]; p = 0.009) at 4 months. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary outcome was knowledge about extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assessed by score on the immediate postintervention written examination.

Scores did not differ between the groups at 4 months (p > 0.05 in all analyses). In postintervention extracorporeal membrane oxygenation simulations, the simulation group demonstrated shorter time to critical action compared with QuizTime (80.0 s [interquartile range, 54.0-111.0 s] vs 300.0 s [interquartile range 85.0-300.0 s]; p = 0.02) and compared with both QuizTime (45.0 s [interquartile range, 34.0-92.5 s] vs 255.5 s [interquartile range, 102.0-300.0 s]; p = 0.008) and experiential (300.0 s [interquartile range, 58.0-300.0 s]; p = 0.009) at 4 months.Simulation was superior to QuizTime and experiential learning with regard to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation knowledge acquisition. Further studies are needed to ascertain the effect of these interventions on knowledge retention, clinical performance, and patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Simulation was superior to QuizTime and experiential learning with regard to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation knowledge acquisition. Further studies are needed to ascertain the effect of these interventions on knowledge retention, clinical performance, and patient outcomes.",

INTRODUCTION Increasingly, dental education is using digital strategies to deliver teaching; however, not all of these learning materials are engaging and effective.To evaluate the perception and knowledge retention of undergraduate dental students after using two different digital learning tools: quizzes and PDF. AIM To evaluate the perception and knowledge retention of undergraduate dental students after using two different digital learning tools: quizzes and PDF.Thirty-three students from a Dental School in the United Kingdom took part in the research. They received learning material derived from the Prosthodontic (Kennedy classification) or Paediatric dentistry content (Tooth classification). The same content was delivered in two different formats: quiz game (n = 17) and PDF file (n = 16). The PDF file had ten images and their classifications, whilst the quiz had the same images with a question about the classification, along with alternatives (single best answer).

Students using quizzes (88%) agreed that they were fun and an interesting way of learning, while only 37.5% had this opinion about PDF material (p = .002). When using quizzes, learners were more motivated and confident. They would frequently recommend quizzes to other colleagues; however, the use of PDF was not suggested as frequently (p = .039). As a learning strategy, 100% of the students using quizzes wanted more of the same to study other dental subjects. This was not the case with the PDF format (p = .005).

This study aims to standardize informed consent for screening and diagnostic colonoscopies with a supplemental video tool that includes the key components of informed consent. BACKGROUND AND AIM Informed consent for endoscopy is variable across institutions and remains understudied in gastrointestinal endoscopy. This study aims to standardize informed consent for screening and diagnostic colonoscopies with a supplemental video tool that includes the key components of informed consent.A video tool was developed that incorporated the key components of informed consent for colonoscopy. In addition, a 7-question survey was developed to query patients on core aspects of informed consent and satisfaction with the informed consent process. Patients undergoing elective outpatient colonoscopy with conscious sedation were randomized to traditional consent or consent with the addition of a video tool. A pilot study determined the sample size. Traditional consent was standard of practice before the procedure. Patients in the video tool group watched the video tool in the preprocedure area followed by traditional consent. Both groups had the opportunity to address questions with the attending physician before the procedure. All patients were contacted 1 to 2 days following the colonoscopy to answer the question survey.

    "Abstract": "Improving interprofessional communication and collaboration is necessary to facilitate the early identification and treatment of patients with sepsis. Preparing undergraduate medical and nursing students for the knowledge and skills required to assess, escalate, and manage patients with sepsis is crucial for their entry into clinical practice. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures have created the need for interactive distance learning to support collaborative learning. BACKGROUND Improving interprofessional communication and collaboration is necessary to facilitate the early identification and treatment of patients with sepsis. Preparing undergraduate medical and nursing students for the knowledge and skills required to assess, escalate, and manage patients with sepsis is crucial for their entry into clinical practice. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures have created the need for interactive distance learning to support collaborative learning.This study aimed to evaluate the effect of sepsis interprofessional education on medical and nursing students' sepsis knowledge, team communication skills, and skill use in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the effect of sepsis interprofessional education on medical and nursing students' sepsis knowledge, team communication skills, and skill use in clinical practice.A mixed methods design using a 1-group pretest-posttest design and focus group discussions was used. This study involved 415 undergraduate medical and nursing students from a university in Singapore. After a baseline evaluation of the participants' sepsis knowledge and team communication skills, they underwent didactic e-learning followed by virtual telesimulation on early recognition and management of sepsis and team communication strategies. The participants' sepsis knowledge and team communication skills were evaluated immediately and 2 months after the telesimulation. In total, 4 focus group discussions were conducted using a purposive sample of 18 medical and nursing students to explore their transfer of learning to clinical practice.

This study involved 415 undergraduate medical and nursing students from a university in Singapore. After a baseline evaluation of the participants' sepsis knowledge and team communication skills, they underwent didactic e-learning followed by virtual telesimulation on early recognition and management of sepsis and team communication strategies. The participants' sepsis knowledge and team communication skills were evaluated immediately and 2 months after the telesimulation. In total, 4 focus group discussions were conducted using a purposive sample of 18 medical and nursing students to explore their transfer of learning to clinical practice.Compared with the baseline scores, both the medical and nursing students demonstrated a significant improvement in sepsis knowledge (P<.001) and team communication skills (P<.001) in immediate posttest scores. At the 2-month follow-up, the nursing students continued to have statistically significantly higher sepsis knowledge (P<.001) and communication scores (P<.001) than the pretest scores, whereas the medical students had no significant changes in test scores between the 2-month follow-up and pretest time points (P=.99). A total of three themes emerged from the qualitative findings: greater understanding of each other's roles, application of mental models in clinical practice, and theory-practice gaps. The sepsis interprofessional education-particularly the use of virtual telesimulation-fostered participants' understanding and appreciation of each other's interprofessional roles when caring for patients with sepsis. Despite noting some incongruities with the real-world clinical practice and not encountering many sepsis scenarios in clinical settings, participants shared the application of mental models using interprofessional communication strategies and the patient assessment framework in their daily clinical practice.

For a greater clinical effect, future studies could complement virtual telesimulation with a mannequin-based simulation and provide more evidence on the long-term retention of sepsis knowledge and clinical skills performance.

Virtual reality (VR) provides a stimulating, safe and efficient learning environment. We report the design and the evaluation of a three dimensions (3D) video for LP training.We recorded a stereoscopic 180-degrees 3D video from two LPs performed in clinical settings in Fernand Widal Lariboisière University Hospital, Paris, France. The video was administered to third-year medical students as well as to a residents and attendings group during LP simulation-based training sessions. METHODS We recorded a stereoscopic 180-degrees 3D video from two LPs performed in clinical settings in Fernand Widal Lariboisière University Hospital, Paris, France. The video was administered to third-year medical students as well as to a residents and attendings group during LP simulation-based training sessions.On 168 participants (108 novice third-year medical students, and 60 residents and attendings with prior LP experience), satisfaction after video exposure was high (rated 4.7 ± 0.6 on a 5-point scale). No significant discomfort was reported (comfort score graded 4.5 ± 0.8 on 5). LP-naive students displayed higher satisfaction and perceived benefit than users with prior LP experience (overall, P < 0.05). Trainees evaluated favorably the 3D feature and supported the development of similar tutorials for other medical procedures (respectively, 3.9 ± 1.1 and 4.4 ± 0.9 on 5). RESULTS On 168 participants (108 novice third-year medical students, and 60 residents and attendings with prior LP experience), satisfaction after video exposure was high (rated 4.7 ± 0.6 on a 5-point scale). No significant discomfort was reported (comfort score graded 4.5 ± 0.8 on 5). LP-naive students displayed higher satisfaction and perceived benefit than users with prior LP experience (overall, P < 0.05). Trainees evaluated favorably the 3D feature and supported the development of similar tutorials for other medical procedures (respectively, 3.9 ± 1.1 and 4.4 ± 0.9 on 5).We report our experience with a 3D video for LP training. VR support could increase knowledge retention and skill acquisition in association to LP simulation training. CONCLUSION We report our experience with a 3D video for LP training. VR support could increase knowledge retention and skill acquisition in association to LP simulation training.",

    "Abstract": "Objective Catatonia is widely underdiagnosed, in large part due to inaccurate recognition of its specific features. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an online educational module to improve theoretical and practical knowledge of the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) across a broad range of clinicians and medical students. Method A 1-h online module, including a training manual and videos, was disseminated to medical students, psychiatry residents and fellows, and psychiatrists through national Listservs and through the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry. Participants completed pre- and post-module testing consisting of a 50-question multiple-choice test and a 3-min standardized patient video scored using the 23-item BFCRS. Participants accessed the module from October 1, 2020, to April 4, 2021. Immediate improvement and 3-month knowledge retention were assessed using quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results Study enrollment was high with moderate dropout (pre-testing: n  = 482; post-testing: n  = 236; 3-month testing: n  = 105). Adjusting for demographics, large pre-post improvements were found in performance (multiple-choice: 11.3 points; standardized patient scoring: 4.2 points; both p  < 0.001) and for nearly all individual BFCRS items. Knowledge attrition was modest, and improvements persisted at 3 months. Conclusions This educational resource provides descriptive and demonstrative reference standards of the items on the BFCRS. This curriculum improved identification of catatonia’s features on both multiple choice and standardized patient scoring across all ages and training levels with good overall knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: This study evaluates the effectiveness of our game-based pedagogical technique by comparing the learning, enjoyment, interest, and motivation of medical students who learned about best practices for patient surge in a natural disaster with a novel game-based computer application, with those of medical students who learned about it with a traditional lecture. Methods: We conducted our study by modifying an existing optional course in disaster medicine that we taught at Sichuan University. More specifically, in 2017, while our application was still in development, we taught this course by lecture. In this iteration, 63 third-grade medical students voluntarily joined our course as our ‘lecture group.’ Once our application was complete in 2018, 68 third-grade medical students voluntarily joined this course as the ‘game group.’ We examined the different effects of these learning methods on student achievement using pre -, post -, and final tests. Results: Both teaching methods significantly increased short-term knowledge and there was no statistical difference between the 2 methods ( p > 0.05). However, the game group demonstrated significantly higher knowledge retention than the traditional lecture group ( p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our game-based computer application proved to be an effective tool for teaching medical students best practices for caring for patient surge in a natural disaster.",

    "Abstract": "Large lectures are commonly characterized by lacking interactivity and adaptability to individual learning processes. Flipped classroom as a more active learning design has the potential to meet this challenge. For knowledge acquisition in flipped classrooms, students’ regular and timely engagement in watching pre-class videos on new topics is critical to benefit from the learning activities in the in-class sessions. However, there is limited evidence on the relationship between engagement in pre-class video watching and later achievement and particularly in knowledge retention in flipped classroom. Thus, we developed sophisticated pre-class learning videos for a large statistics lecture and set up a flipped course design. We regressed course achievement on students’ timing of watching the pre-class videos. To contrast the relation between preclass video watching and other typically discussed predictors of achievement, we controlled for prior achievement and motivation. We found that students, who watch the videos before the corresponding in-class session perform better, both in the short-term (final exam) and in the long-term (follow-up-test four months later). Our results suggest that timing rather than quantity of video watching matters in terms of academic performance and knowledge retention. The findings highlight the important role of motivational interventions aiming at encouraging students to prepare for class in time to ensure knowledge acquisition in flipped classrooms.

    "Abstract": "Students perceive crossword puzzles as enjoyable. In addition to students' perceptions, crossword puzzles actually improve knowledge retention. However, crossword puzzles increased exam scores for some students but not others. Recommendations have been made for students to create puzzles for their classmates to complete with the rationale that students are encouraged to research and understand the material in order to write meaningful clues for the puzzle. While students enjoy creating their own crossword puzzles, the association between students creating crossword puzzles and knowledge retention is unknown. The purpose of this project was to determine if creating crossword puzzles and completing peers' crossword puzzles were associated with improved knowledge retention indicated by higher scores on quizzes. Students in a research course from two institutions across three semesters had the option each week to upload a blank puzzle they created prior to completing each other's puzzles and taking a quiz. Quiz scores were compared between those who did versus did not create their own puzzles and complete their peers' puzzles. Results varied by institution and programs, as well as the same program within the same institution but different semesters. Results highlight the importance of moving beyond student perceptions and towards assessing knowledge retention while taking into consideration institution, program, and semester.Students perceive crossword puzzles as enjoyable.

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a framework of knowledge risk management in the face of the COVID‐19 crisis, derived from the literature on knowledge management, knowledge security, and COVID‐19. So far, both researchers and practitioners have focused on knowledge as an asset and their efforts have been aimed at the implementation of knowledge management in various organizational contexts. However, with increasing threats related to cyberattacks or hazards associated with knowledge loss (as magnified by the COVID‐19 crisis), there is a growing need to account for knowledge‐related risks. In this conceptual paper, we integrate the contributions from the knowledge management and knowledge security fields, together with research on COVID‐19 to help organizations protect the knowledge they create, store and share. Based on a structured literature review, our investigation provides researchers and managers with a framework for securely handling organizational knowledge in a critical situation. Our framework revolves around two foci: one the one hand, building appropriate knowledge risk measures and controls; on the other hand, holistically tackling knowledge risks as part of knowledge management activities.",

    "Abstract": "Small teaching approaches are well-structured, incremental teaching improvement techniques supported by research in cognitive science, memory, and learning. I systematically implement a series of small teaching activities in an introductory programming course to tackle the teaching and learning challenges faced by instructors and students. The small teaching activities are designed to promote effective learning strategies such as knowledge retrieval, spacing-out practice, and interleaving learning. I examine the impact of such approaches on students' performance through comparative analyses. The test results indicate that small teaching approaches are effective in improving students' lower- and higher-level thinking skills and help boost students' long-term knowledge retention. Because the small teaching approaches are flexible and easy to implement, instructors teaching technical information systems topics can quickly integrate at least some small teaching activities into their classes.",

The large volume of information taught in medical school is delivered with a variety of techniques.

The current study aims to explore what learning activities and teaching strategies first (M1) and second year (M2) medical students use and prefer. Additionally, the study aims to determine if there are cohort differences in classroom and study habits. A group of 95 M1 students and 109 M2 students were recruited to participate in this online survey study. The analyses indicated statistical differences between M1 and M2 student cohorts with M1 students preferring group work and small group discussions more than M2 students. Classic didactic lecturing was preferred by 71.6% of students surveyed. M1 students reported a greater tendency for self-testing and group study versus M2 students. GPA and study technique preference were not correlated. These findings indicate that medical students are not using research-based learning and study strategies at the possible detriment of long-term knowledge retention. Modeling of research-based learning and study strategies by medical educators is one possible solution to encourage medical students to change their study practice.

INTRODUCTION In the doctor of pharmacy curriculum, students are subjected to scenarios where success is contingent upon accurate retention of information learned during class. To provide incentive to students and simultaneously gauge student retention of course material, an optional honors examination was created for a skills laboratory course. The objectives of this research were to determine student pharmacist performance on the examination and to assess student pharmacist interest and motivation for taking (or not taking) the optional examination.An optional comprehensive honors examination was implemented simultaneously within a laboratory course series. Student performance was analyzed across cohorts and students were given a web-based survey prior to the examination to gauge initial interest and engagement. A second survey was conducted after the examination to identify motivation for taking the optional examination. Surveys were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. METHODS An optional comprehensive honors examination was implemented simultaneously within a laboratory course series. Student performance was analyzed across cohorts and students were given a web-based survey prior to the examination to gauge initial interest and engagement. A second survey was conducted after the examination to identify motivation for taking the optional examination. Surveys were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods.There were 238 responses to the initial survey (47%) and 183 (96%) responses to the post-examination survey. Common topics of motivation for taking the examination included enhancing transcripts, gauging their own retention, and assessing readiness for experiential activities. One hundred sixty-one students participated in the optional examination, and 65 achieved a score of 90% and the honors designation. The majority (96%) of students who chose to take the examination thought the activity was valuable to their education. RESULTS There were 238 responses to the initial survey (47%) and 183 (96%) responses to the post-examination survey. Common topics of motivation for taking the examination included enhancing transcripts, gauging their own retention, and assessing readiness for experiential activities. One hundred sixty-one students participated in the optional examination, and 65 achieved a score of 90% and the honors designation. The majority (96%) of students who chose to take the examination thought the activity was valuable to their education.An optional comprehensive honors examination is one method of evaluating student retention of course material and provides an opportunity for students to set themselves apart from colleagues with an honors designation.

    "Abstract": "Background: Improving interprofessional communication and collaboration is necessary to facilitate the early identification and treatment of patients with sepsis. Preparing undergraduate medical and nursing students for the knowledge and skills required to assess, escalate, and manage patients with sepsis is crucial for their entry into clinical practice. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures have created the need for interactive distance learning to support collaborative learning. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of sepsis interprofessional education on medical and nursing students’ sepsis knowledge, team communication skills, and skill use in clinical practice. Methods: A mixed methods design using a 1-group pretest-posttest design and focus group discussions was used. This study involved 415 undergraduate medical and nursing students from a university in Singapore. After a baseline evaluation of the participants’ sepsis knowledge and team communication skills, they underwent didactic e-learning followed by virtual telesimulation on early recognition and management of sepsis and team communication strategies. The participants’ sepsis knowledge and team communication skills were evaluated immediately and 2 months after the telesimulation. In total, 4 focus group discussions were conducted using a purposive sample of 18 medical and nursing students to explore their transfer of learning to clinical practice. Results: Compared with the baseline scores, both the medical and nursing students demonstrated a significant improvement in sepsis knowledge ( P <.001) and team communication skills ( P <.001) in immediate posttest scores. At the 2-month follow-up, the nursing students continued to have statistically significantly higher sepsis knowledge ( P <.001) and communication scores ( P <.001) than the pretest scores, whereas the medical students had no significant changes in test scores between the 2-month follow-up and pretest time points ( P =.99). A total of three themes emerged from the qualitative findings: greater understanding of each other’s roles, application of mental models in clinical practice, and theory-practice gaps. The sepsis interprofessional education—particularly the use of virtual telesimulation—fostered participants’ understanding and appreciation of each other’s interprofessional roles when caring for patients with sepsis. Despite noting some incongruities with the real-world clinical practice and not encountering many sepsis scenarios in clinical settings, participants shared the application of mental models using interprofessional communication strategies and the patient assessment framework in their daily clinical practice. Conclusions: Although the study did not show long-term knowledge retention, the use of virtual telesimulation played a critical role in facilitating the application of mental models for learning transfer and therefore could serve as a promising education modality for sepsis training. For a greater clinical effect, future studies could complement virtual telesimulation with a mannequin-based simulation and provide more evidence on the long-term retention of sepsis knowledge and clinical skills performance.",

    "Abstract": "The advent of new digital technologies changes the nature and forms of knowledge assets defining the organisations' value drivers and the knowledge processes for accessing, assessing and managing critical knowledge resources, defining core competencies and dynamic capabilities of organisations. [...]digital transformation has a holistic impact on organisations requiring to re-think how they create and deliver value to their stakeholders. Considering the rising influence and dependence on digital technologies and applications in many different sectors/industries, the relevance and importance of managing strategic knowledge in organisations has a more significant impact than ever before in the growth and sustenance of organisational competitiveness and value (Dragicevic et al., 2019; Venkitachalam and Willmott, 2015). Besides the significance of strategic knowledge, the extant literature on digitally connected conceptualisations [e.g. cloud computing, Internet of things (IoT), big data and business analytics] also see them as useful pathways to solve organisations' challenges that are often related to attaining and maintaining value for its stakeholders (Pauleen and Wang, 2017; Uden and He, 2017). [...]this can result in reinvention and loss of knowledge assets and massive costs for organisations (Dragicevic et al., 2019; Venkitachalam and Willmott, 2016). [...]adopting technologies aims to enhance the operational capacity of an organisation to perform and deliver superior value to stakeholders. [...]from a strategic point of view, knowledge management and digital transformation can be seen as two aspects of the same reality aiming to equip organisations with an ever-increasing capacity to define, create and deliver stakeholder value.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a framework of knowledge risk management in the face of the COVID‐19 crisis, derived from the literature on knowledge management, knowledge security, and COVID‐19. So far, both researchers and practitioners have focused on knowledge as an asset and their efforts have been aimed at the implementation of knowledge management in various organizational contexts. However, with increasing threats related to cyberattacks or hazards associated with knowledge loss (as magnified by the COVID‐19 crisis), there is a growing need to account for knowledge‐related risks. In this conceptual paper, we integrate the contributions from the knowledge management and knowledge security fields, together with research on COVID‐19 to help organizations protect the knowledge they create, store and share. Based on a structured literature review, our investigation provides researchers and managers with a framework for securely handling organizational knowledge in a critical situation. Our framework revolves around two foci: one the one hand, building appropriate knowledge risk measures and controls; on the other hand, holistically tackling knowledge risks as part of knowledge management activities.

    "Abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in recognizing emotions have several advantages. Still, the success of this study, however, is strongly influenced by: i) the distribution of the data used, ii) consider of differences in participant characteristics, and iii) consider the characteristics of the EEG signals. In response to these issues, this study will examine three important points that affect the success of emotion recognition packaged in several research questions: i) What factors need to be considered to generate and distribute EEG data?, ii) How can EEG signals be generated with consideration of differences in participant characteristics?, and iii) How do EEG signals with characteristics exist among its features for emotion recognition? The results, therefore, indicate some important challenges to be studied further in EEG signals-based emotion recognition research. These include i) determine robust methods for imbalanced EEG signals data, ii) determine the appropriate smoothing method to eliminate disturbances on the baseline signals, iii) determine the best baseline reduction methods to reduce the differences in the characteristics of the participants on the EEG signals, iv) determine the robust architecture of the capsule network method to overcome the loss of knowledge information and apply it in more diverse data set.",

Results were analyzed using paired t tests comparing mean scores before and after podcast.In medical students, the average test score increased by 20% (n = 56, p < .001). Similarly, in residents the average test score increased by 23.1% (n = 22, p < .001). Medical students and residents rated their average preference for using podcasts as compared with other resources at 3.6 and 3.7/5, respectively. Furthermore, in both groups, there was no significant difference between average scores for posttest 1 versus posttest 2 written 2 weeks later suggested excellent knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "Objective: Catatonia is widely underdiagnosed, in large part due to inaccurate recognition of its specific features. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an online educational module to improve theoretical and practical knowledge of the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) across a broad range of clinicians and medical students. Method: A 1-h online module, including a training manual and videos, was disseminated to medical students, psychiatry residents and fellows, and psychiatrists through national Listservs and through the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry. Participants completed pre- and post-module testing consisting of a 50-question multiple-choice test and a 3-min standardized patient video scored using the 23-item BFCRS. Participants accessed the module from October 1, 2020, to April 4, 2021. Immediate improvement and 3-month knowledge retention were assessed using quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results: Study enrollment was high with moderate dropout (pre-testing: n = 482; post-testing: n = 236; 3-month testing: n = 105). Adjusting for demographics, large pre-post improvements were found in performance (multiple-choice: 11.3 points; standardized patient scoring: 4.2 points; both p < 0.001) and for nearly all individual BFCRS items. Knowledge attrition was modest, and improvements persisted at 3 months. Conclusions: This educational resource provides descriptive and demonstrative reference standards of the items on the BFCRS. This curriculum improved identification of catatonia’s features on both multiple choice and standardized patient scoring across all ages and training levels with good overall knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "Advances in 3-dimensional modeling have revolutionized presurgical planning for maxillofacial reconstruction, yet little is known about how this technology may affect patient education. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of 2-dimensional computed tomography versus 3-dimensional computed tomography for patient education in maxillofacial reconstruction. OBJECTIVE Advances in 3-dimensional modeling have revolutionized presurgical planning for maxillofacial reconstruction, yet little is known about how this technology may affect patient education. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of 2-dimensional computed tomography versus 3-dimensional computed tomography for patient education in maxillofacial reconstruction.Crossover study. STUDY DESIGN Crossover study.General otolaryngology outpatients from a tertiary referral center were recruited. SETTING General otolaryngology outpatients from a tertiary referral center were recruited.A single computed tomography data set of a zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture was used to generate 2 educational video tutorials: one in a 2-dimensional format and one in a 3-dimensional format. The tutorials were embedded into the Qualtrics XM platform. Participants were randomly assigned into 2 groups. Group 1 viewed the 2-dimensional tutorial, took a self-assessment survey, took an information recall survey, viewed the 3-dimensional tutorial, and finally took a tutorial comparison survey. Group 2 followed the same sequence but viewed the 3-dimensional tutorial followed by the 2-dimensional tutorial.

Group 2 followed the same sequence but viewed the 3-dimensional tutorial followed by the 2-dimensional tutorial.Group 2 participants (viewing the 3-dimensional tutorial first) scored better on the self-assessment survey than their counterparts in group 1 did ( P = .023). Group 2 also scored better on the recall survey ( P = .042). Of all participants, 61% preferred the 3-dimensional tutorial, and 31% preferred the use of both tutorials together in the comparison survey. RESULTS Group 2 participants (viewing the 3-dimensional tutorial first) scored better on the self-assessment survey than their counterparts in group 1 did (P = .023). Group 2 also scored better on the recall survey (P = .042). Of all participants, 61% preferred the 3-dimensional tutorial, and 31% preferred the use of both tutorials together in the comparison survey.Three-dimensional patient educational tutorial regarding a zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture resulted in better knowledge retention and was preferred over the 2-dimensional format.

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of our game-based pedagogical technique by comparing the learning, enjoyment, interest, and motivation of medical students who learned about best practices for patient surge in a natural disaster with a novel game-based computer application, with those of medical students who learned about it with a traditional lecture. OBJECTIVE This study evaluates the effectiveness of our game-based pedagogical technique by comparing the learning, enjoyment, interest, and motivation of medical students who learned about best practices for patient surge in a natural disaster with a novel game-based computer application, with those of medical students who learned about it with a traditional lecture.We conducted our study by modifying an existing optional course in disaster medicine that we taught at Sichuan University. More specifically, in 2017, while our application was still in development, we taught this course by lecture. In this iteration, 63 third-grade medical students voluntarily joined our course as our 'lecture group.' Once our application was complete in 2018, 68 third-grade medical students voluntarily joined this course as the 'game group.' We examined the different effects of these learning methods on student achievement using pre -, post -, and final tests. METHODS We conducted our study by modifying an existing optional course in disaster medicine that we taught at Sichuan University. More specifically, in 2017, while our application was still in development, we taught this course by lecture. In this iteration, 63 third-grade medical students voluntarily joined our course as our 'lecture group.' Once our application was complete in 2018, 68 third-grade medical students voluntarily joined this course as the 'game group.' We examined the different effects of these learning methods on student achievement using pre -, post -, and final tests.Both teaching methods significantly increased short-term knowledge and there was no statistical difference between the 2 methods ( p > 0.05). However, the game group demonstrated significantly higher knowledge retention than the traditional lecture group ( p 0.05). However, the game group demonstrated significantly higher knowledge retention than the traditional lecture group (p < 0.05).Our game-based computer application proved to be an effective tool for teaching medical students best practices for caring for patient surge in a natural disaster. CONCLUSION Our game-based computer application proved to be an effective tool for teaching medical students best practices for caring for patient surge in a natural disaster.",

This means there is a growing need to integrate UAV training into STEM education. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a UAV education module and laboratory exercise for natural resource science students. The study used a series of reusable learning objects (RLOs) to assess students' prior knowledge of remote sensing and UAVs. Students were taught the steps of UAV data acquisition and processing through lectures and UAV simulation videos. Students applied this knowledge by completing a laboratory exercise that used previously collected UAV data. Student knowledge retention and understanding were evaluated using an online quiz to determine the effectiveness of the education module. The average quiz score was 92%, indicating that the UAV laboratory exercise effectively taught students about UAV data acquisition and processing for natural resource research. Overall, students expressed positive opinions about the UAV education module. Student feedback indicated that the laboratory exercise was engaging, but some students would have preferred a hands-on experience for some parts of the exercise. However, in-person UAV instruction may not be accessible for all educators because of UAV cost or lack of instructor training. This study provides educators with crucial recommendations for designing UAV exercises to improve access to UAV-related educational content.

    "Abstract": "Traditional ecological knowledge enables pastoralists to cope with social-ecological changes, thereby increasing the sustainability of their practices and fostering social-ecological resilience. Yet, there is a significant knowledge gap concerning the extent to which pastoral traditional ecological knowledge has changed over time at the global level. We aim to fill this gap through a systematic literature review of 288 scientific studies on pastoral traditional ecological knowledge. We reviewed 152 papers in detail (selected randomly from the 288) for their content, and focused specifically on 61 papers that explicitly mentioned one of the four types of knowledge transition (i.e., retention, erosion, adaptation, or hybridization). Studies on pastoral traditional knowledge represent less than 3% of all the scholarly literature on traditional ecological knowledge. Geographical distribution of the 288 case studies was largely biased. Knowledge domains of pastoral knowledge such as herd and livestock management, forage and medicinal plants, and landscape and wildlife were relatively equally covered; however, climate-related knowledge was less often studied. Of the 63 papers that explicitly mentioned transition of pastoral traditional ecological knowledge, 52 reported erosion, and only 11 studies documented explicitly knowledge retention, adaptation, or hybridization of traditional knowledge. Thus, adaptation and hybridization was understudied, although some case studies showed that adaptation and hybridization of knowledge can efficiently help pastoralists navigate among social-ecological changes. Based on the review, we found 13 drivers which were mentioned as the main reasons for knowledge transition among which social-cultural changes, formal schooling, abandonment of pastoral activities, and transition to a market economy were most often reported. We conclude that future research should focus more on the diverse dynamics of pastoral traditional knowledge, be more careful in distinguishing the four knowledge transition types, and analyze how changes in knowledge impact change in pastoral practices and lifestyles. Understanding these phenomena could help pastoralists’ adaptations and support their stewardship of their rangeland ecosystems and biocultural diversity.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Approaches to learning have the ability to influence knowledge acquisition, comprehension, retention and even motivation to learn. Previous work indicates that despite age, experience, or prior knowledge, students have a tendency to approach learning differently as a function of the presented content. The purpose of this study is to explore how context influences student approaches to learning science. Design/methodology/approach The authors adopt a question-asking methodology to evaluate if approaches to learning the same science content vary when presented within the context of Pure Science or the History of Science. Findings Results indicate that contextualizing the presentation of science content, shifts the approaches students take in attempting to learn science content as evidenced by the questions they ask to deepen their understanding. Additional variables of prior experience with each scientific concept, task persistence at a distractor task and later recall of the presented concepts were related to different inquiry strategies. Research limitations/implications Implications for instructional design and pedagogy are discussed. Practical implications The framework in which scientific information is presented may impact how students modify existing and create a new schema, impacting their beliefs about scientific knowledge and the way in which students question, hypothesize and engage within the domain of science. Social implications By studying the role of inquiry while students engage in science learning, the authors explore the role of context, content and knowledge retention. Originality/value The current study probes at the nature of student questioning and its reliance on the content, context and its relationship to outcome variables such as learning and, perhaps, even persistence as it relates to students’ prior knowledge within content areas which may, in turn, lead to varying levels of student self-efficacy.",

    "Abstract": "In order to improve learning efficiency and memory retention in medical teaching, furthering active learning seems to be an effective alternative to classical teaching. One option to make active exploration of the subject matter possible is the use of virtual reality (VR) technology. The authors developed an immersive anatomy atlas which allows users to explore human anatomical structures interactively through virtual dissection. Thirty‐two senior‐class students from two German high schools with no prior formal medical training were separated into two groups and tasked with answering an anatomical questionnaire. One group used traditional anatomical textbooks and the other used the immersive virtual reality atlas. The time needed to answer the questions was measured. Several weeks later, the participants answered a similar questionnaire with different anatomical questions in order to test memory retention. The VR group took significantly less time to answer the questionnaire, and participants from the VR group had significantly better results over both tests. Based on the results of this study, VR learning seems to be more efficient and to have better long‐term effects for the study of anatomy. The reason for that could lie in the VR environment's high immersion, and the possibility to freely and interactively explore a realistic representation of human anatomy. Immersive VR technology offers many possibilities for medical teaching and training, especially as a support for cadaver dissection courses.

    "Abstract": "Polarized light imaging (PLI) is a new method which quantifies and visualizes nerve fiber direction. In this study, the educational value of PLI sections of the human brainstem were compared to histological sections stained with Luxol fast blue (LFB) using e‐learning modules. Mental Rotations Test (MRT) was used to assess the spatial ability. Pre‐intervention, post‐intervention, and long‐term (1 week) anatomical tests were provided to assess the baseline knowledge and retention. One‐on‐one electronic interviews after the last test were carried out to understand the students’ perceptions of the intervention. Thirty‐eight medical students, (19 female and 19 males, mean age 21.5 ± SD 2.4; median age: 21.0 years) participated with a mean MRT score of 13.2 ± 5.2 points and a mean pre‐intervention knowledge test score of 49.9 ± 11.8%. A significant improvement in both, post‐intervention and long‐term test scores occurred after learning with either PLI or LFB e‐learning module on brainstem anatomy (both P < 0.001). No difference was observed between groups in post‐intervention test scores and long‐term test scores ( P = 0.913 and P = 0.403, respectively). A higher MRT‐score was significantly correlated with a higher post‐intervention test score ( r k = 0.321; P < 0.05, respectively), but there was not a significant association between the MRT‐ and the long‐term scores ( r k = −0.078; P = 0.509). Interviews ( n = 10) revealed three major topics: Learning (brainstem) anatomy by use of e‐learning modules; The “need” of technological background information when studying brainstem sections; and Mnemonics when studying brainstem anatomy. Future studies should assess the cognitive burden of cross‐sectional learning methods with PLI and/or LFB sections and their effects on knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "A significant role in educational assessment is played by measuring behavioural changes based on clearly specified educational objectives and meaningfully interpreting the results. One of the most significant strategies for evaluating a student's learning performance in the classroom is formative assessment. Formative assessment systems concurrently improve the science and art of teaching and learning. Teachers can help the students grow as students by actively hopeful them to self-assess their skills, test their knowledge retention, giving clear commands and providing the necessary feedback to put them on track. This paper aims to demonstrate the various Formative Assessment Tools for Effective Classroom. The conclusions derived from the teaching fields are then merged to produce an incorporated summing with clear implications for effective didactic academic performance. The assessment of students by the teachers has a powerful direct impact on their learning performance, which may be positive and thus be worthy of very attractive and fruitful learning.",

    "Abstract": "Adult post-graduate teaching is always a challenging and sometimes a frustrating task. Since teaching risk management has to do with adult learning and changing personal and organizational culture and attitudes - the quest for an effective learning method is important and challenging. INTRODUCTION Adult post-graduate teaching is always a challenging and sometimes a frustrating task. Since teaching risk management has to do with adult learning and changing personal and organizational culture and attitudes - the quest for an effective learning method is important and challenging.In this study we examined the preferences of doctors from different medical professions in order to find out if there are any differences among doctors from different professions, since we assume that preferring a certain learning strategy has an impact on the effectivity of learning. AIMS In this study we examined the preferences of doctors from different medical professions in order to find out if there are any differences among doctors from different professions, since we assume that preferring a certain learning strategy has an impact on the effectivity of learning.Participants in the study were randomly divided into three groups of learners - one group participated in a lecture, another group participated in a workshop instruction activity and the third group had an e-learning session. All participants completed questionnaires prior to the learning activity, right after the learning session and two weeks and three months after the learning activity. METHODS Participants in the study were randomly divided into three groups of learners - one group participated in a lecture, another group participated in a workshop instruction activity and the third group had an e-learning session. All participants completed questionnaires prior to the learning activity, right after the learning session and two weeks and three months after the learning activity.Our findings show that there are differences in the preferences of instruction methods in relation to the medical profession and seniority. E-learning was preferred by senior doctors and was the most effective in knowledge gain and the fastest in knowledge loss. RESULTS Our findings show that there are differences in the preferences of instruction methods in relation to the medical profession and seniority. E-learning was preferred by senior doctors and was the most effective in knowledge gain and the fastest in knowledge loss.The risk management learning method should be \"tailor-made\" to the learner's preferences and adjusted in accordance to their medical profession and seniority. CONCLUSIONS The risk management learning method should be \"tailor-made\" to the learner's preferences and adjusted in accordance to their medical profession and seniority.Instruction is an important part of risk management in medicine and has to do with adult learning. In order to achieve effective learning the teaching should be adjusted to the learner's profession and seniority. DISCUSSION Instruction is an important part of risk management in medicine and has to do with adult learning.

    "Abstract": "Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are often used in assessments. Although MCQs can be designed to test higher-order cognitive skills such as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, they are often used to measure recall. This may encourage students to only learn material superficially. To resolve this problem, several variations of MCQs have been proposed to improve learning. We proposed a modified type of MCQ called a \"confirmatory MCQ\" (CMCQ). Optional online CMCQ tests were more effective than MCQs and confidence-based marking tests in helping students study material from a systems programming course because they prompted students to thoroughly evaluate each answer.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction In the course of their pre-deployment training, military students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are instructed on sieve triage, which is used on the battlefield. The objective of this study is to test the retention of knowledge immediately after delivery of the triage course, at Day 30 and Day 60 in military personnel with no previous sieve-triage knowledge and with an undifferentiated professional background. Method Data were collected using a questionnaire based on a survey toolkit designed by the University of Washington Public Health and distributed randomly amongst military personnel after delivery of sieve triage training. The students were randomly selected in consecutive cohorts over a six-week period. Results A total of 456 participants were included in the study. Most of the participants were soldiers (80%); other professions included were officers (9%), nurses (1%), paramedics (1%), and others (9%). The overall mean score for the cohort was 96.81 at Day 0; 87.37 at Day 30; and 76.1 at Day 60. The mean scores depict a decreasing trend for the combined as well as the individual cohorts with the highest mean score at Day 0 and the lowest at Day 60. The mean scores reduced significantly at Day 30 (MD: -9.43; 95% CI: -10.73 to -8.14) and at Day 60 (MD: -20.71; 95% CI: -22.01 to -19.42) compared to Day 0. The mean difference remained significant at Day 30 (MD: -9.42; 95% CI: -10.7 to -8.14) and Day 60 (MD: -20.69; 95% CI: -21.97 to -19.41) compared to Day 0 when adjusted for age and profession. Conclusion Knowledge retention from the delivery of sieve triage training among UAE military personnel decreased after 60 days.

    "Abstract": "The effective utilisation of organisational knowledge may promote organisational success as knowledge is one of an organisation’s most important assets. However, existing literature tends to focus on understanding knowledge sharing behaviour within organisational contexts, where knowledge hiding, a related but distinct phenomenon, has been relatively under-researched. The current study integrates social exchange theory and the theory of interpersonal behaviour to systematically examine knowledge hiding behaviour in knowledge-based companies in Malaysia. A survey with 207 participants was conducted to test the direct effects of nine predictors and the moderating role of market culture on the effects on knowledge hiding dimensions (evasive hiding, playing dumb, and rationalised hiding). Overall, the findings showed that the effects differed across the three dimensions of the phenomenon. Knowledge complexity was found to have significant positive influences on all dimensions, while perceived reciprocal benefits, cognition-based trust, and task-relatedness did not affect knowledge hiding. The other predictors (perceived loss of knowledge power, perceived losing face, perceived organisational incentives, affective-based trust, and self-efficacy) had different impacts on different dimensions of knowledge hiding. Market culture played an important moderating role in employees’ decisions about hiding knowledge. Theoretical and managerial implications and future research directions were formulated based on these findings.",

    "Abstract": "Aim/Objective To determine if video-recorded lecture provided better immediate knowledge retention than live lecture Background In line with the call to increase nationally graduated nurses as recommended by KSU 2030 Vision, educational institutions in Saudi Arabia are required to increase the enrollment to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing program. As a result, there is increased number of sections or groupings which created a need for additional faculty. However, to mitigate the impact of faculty shortage, the Administration embarked on exploring innovative teaching strategies that would ensure that lecture contents across groups of students are uniform and instructions are similar. Hence there is a need to explore innovative teaching strategies that would ensure that contents across groups of students are uniform, and instructions are similar. Design The study employed a quasi-experimental design to examine if video-recorded lectures provided better immediate knowledge retention than live lectures . Methods A total of 160 s -year nursing students were randomly assigned to either of the two teaching strategies (video-recorded lecture or live lecture). Data were collected at a public university in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Both lectures covered the interpretation of arterial blood gases (ABG) and all students had no prior knowledge on the subject. Pretest and posttest using the same 16 questions were administered to both groups. Each item was comprised of a combination of ABG results. Students were to choose the correct answer from four choices of interpretations of the ABG result. ABG is assessed to determine gas exchange, ventilator control and acid-base balance among patients with acute or chronic illnesses. Assessment of immediate knowledge retention was conducted using a questionnaire comprised of 16 multiple-choice items to be used in both the pretest and posttest. Each item was comprised of a combination of ABG results. Results The live lecture group's posttest mean score did not differ significantly from that of the video-recorded lecture group; t (156.52) = 0.47, p = 0.64, d = −0.08. The odds ratio is 1.27 and the probability is 95%. CI:.64, 2.50. Conclusion This study found no difference between video-recorded lectures and live lectures in terms of providing immediate knowledge retention. Video-recorded lectures are a viable complementary teaching strategy. There is a need to enhance the instructional design so that learning objectives are more clearly defined, contents are aligned with the learning objectives, teaching strategies should include active participation from learners and outcomes should be assessed based on the learning objectives.",

OBJECTIVE The primary objective was to evaluate the use of a novel video for enhancing patient knowledge of midurethral sling compared with standard handout.Participants scheduled for midurethral sling were randomized to 1 of 2 preoperative educational interventions, either video or standard handout. The primary outcome was change in knowledge measured via a 15-question questionnaire completed immediately before and after the intervention. Secondary outcomes were knowledge retention, urinary symptoms, decision satisfaction, and regret measured via validated questionnaires at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively. Data are presented as median (interquartile range) and comparisons between intervention groups made using non-parametric statistics. A sample size of 16 per arm was calculated to detect a 20% effect size.

    "Abstract": "Polarized light imaging (PLI) is a new method which quantifies and visualizes nerve fiber direction. In this study, the educational value of PLI sections of the human brainstem were compared to histological sections stained with Luxol fast blue (LFB) using e‐learning modules. Mental Rotations Test (MRT) was used to assess the spatial ability. Pre‐intervention, post‐intervention, and long‐term (1 week) anatomical tests were provided to assess the baseline knowledge and retention. One‐on‐one electronic interviews after the last test were carried out to understand the students’ perceptions of the intervention. Thirty‐eight medical students, (19 female and 19 males, mean age 21.5 ± SD 2.4; median age: 21.0 years) participated with a mean MRT score of 13.2 ± 5.2 points and a mean pre‐intervention knowledge test score of 49.9 ± 11.8%. A significant improvement in both, post‐intervention and long‐term test scores occurred after learning with either PLI or LFB e‐learning module on brainstem anatomy (both P  < 0.001). No difference was observed between groups in post‐intervention test scores and long‐term test scores ( P =  0.913 and P =  0.403, respectively). A higher MRT‐score was significantly correlated with a higher post‐intervention test score ( r k  = 0.321; P  < 0.05, respectively), but there was not a significant association between the MRT‐ and the long‐term scores ( r k = −0.078; P  = 0.509). Interviews ( n  = 10) revealed three major topics: Learning (brainstem) anatomy by use of e‐learning modules; The “need” of technological background information when studying brainstem sections; and Mnemonics when studying brainstem anatomy. Future studies should assess the cognitive burden of cross‐sectional learning methods with PLI and/or LFB sections and their effects on knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "The experience of using an educational application, concerning a major depressive disorder simulation, could be anything but pleasant, so the challenges of creating such an application are ample. In this research, the effects of the emotional experience of the players, deriving from the positive ending of the virtual reality (VR) simulation’s embedded narrative or the lack of it, are evaluated. Alongside the investigation of a possible link between the emotional impact of the simulation and information retention, the overall effect of the application in relation to VR presence and body ownership is appraised. Thirty participants over 18 years old tested the application, using an Oculus Rift head-mounted display with a joystick, and their data were recorded by a pre- and a post-questionnaire. The 30 participants have been separated into groups of 15, where the positive ending was accessible to only one of the two groups. The group which experienced the positive ending reported a significant correlation of emotional impact and knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to evaluate the usability of the augmented reality-based Evoke Education System (EES) to improve service operations in educational settings. The EES uses an animated character (Moe) to interact with children in a classroom by reproducing their teacher's movements and speech. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a quantitative approach for the system usability evaluation. The ESS was evaluated by 71 children aged 6–8 years old, from two primary schools. After interacting with the EES, they completed a system usability questionnaire and participated in a knowledge acquisition test. Findings The knowledge acquisition test undertaken on the initial day showed statistically significant improvements for children taught with the EES, compared to children taught through traditional teaching approaches. However, the retest nine days later was not statistically significant (as only one school participated) due to low power. This study used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), resulting in the identification of five essential factors (likeability, interactiveness, retention, effectiveness/attractiveness and satisfaction) that contribute to the EES's usability. The comparison with existing literature shows that these factors are consistent with the definition of system usability provided by the International Organization for Standardization and current academic literature in this field. Research limitations/implications The findings presented in this study are based on the data from only two schools. The research can be extended by involving children from a greater number of schools. Mixed methods and qualitative research approaches can be used for future research in this area to generalise the results. Originality/value This study proposes an innovative augmented reality-based education system to help teachers deliver their key messages to the children in a fun way that can potentially increase their knowledge retention.",

Hence there is a need to explore innovative teaching strategies that would ensure that contents across groups of students are uniform, and instructions are similar.The study employed a quasi-experimental design to examine if video-recorded lectures provided better immediate knowledge retention than live lectures. DESIGN The study employed a quasi-experimental design to examine if video-recorded lectures provided better immediate knowledge retention than live lectures.A total of 160 s -year nursing students were randomly assigned to either of the two teaching strategies (video-recorded lecture or live lecture). Data were collected at a public university in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Both lectures covered the interpretation of arterial blood gases (ABG) and all students had no prior knowledge on the subject. Pretest and posttest using the same 16 questions were administered to both groups. Each item was comprised of a combination of ABG results. Students were to choose the correct answer from four choices of interpretations of the ABG result. ABG is assessed to determine gas exchange, ventilator control and acid-base balance among patients with acute or chronic illnesses. Assessment of immediate knowledge retention was conducted using a questionnaire comprised of 16 multiple-choice items to be used in both the pretest and posttest.

    "Abstract": "Obtaining a clear Critical View of Safety helps prevent bile duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which can be improved with a structured Safe Critical View of Safety curriculum. We aimed to determine whether the improvement in obtaining Critical View of Safety postcurriculum is retained long-term. BACKGROUND Obtaining a clear Critical View of Safety helps prevent bile duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which can be improved with a structured Safe Critical View of Safety curriculum. We aimed to determine whether the improvement in obtaining Critical View of Safety postcurriculum is retained long-term.A safe Critical View of Safety curriculum was previously implemented for all surgeons who perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy at a regional health system. Recordings of laparoscopic cholecystectomy cases were collected 1 year after completion of the curriculum, deidentified and randomly ordered, and then graded by 2 blinded expert surgeons using a 6-point Critical View of Safety assessment tool. METHODS A safe Critical View of Safety curriculum was previously implemented for all surgeons who perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy at a regional health system. Recordings of laparoscopic cholecystectomy cases were collected 1 year after completion of the curriculum, deidentified and randomly ordered, and then graded by 2 blinded expert surgeons using a 6-point Critical View of Safety assessment tool.A total of 12 surgeons with average experience of 17.9 ± 6.3 years in practice participated in the study. The majority (83%) had performed >700 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, and 4 surgeons (33%) reported 2 or more bile duct injuries in their career. Controlling for gallbladder pathology, Critical View of Safety scores improved from 1.7 ± 0.4 to 4.0 ± 0.4 (P 700 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, and 4 surgeons (33%) reported 2 or more bile duct injuries in their career. Controlling for gallbladder pathology, Critical View of Safety scores improved from 1.7 ± 0.4 to 4.0 ± 0.4 (P < .001) immediately after completion of the curriculum. However, there was a small decrease in Critical View of Safety score after 1 year (3.2 ± 0.3 from 4.0 ± 0.4, P = .055), while still significantly higher compared to precurriculum (3.2 ± 0.3 vs 1.7 ± 0.4, P < .001). Acute care surgeons had lower Critical View of Safety retention scores compared to general surgeons (1.8 ± 0.5 vs 3.3 ± 0.4, P = .01) and minimally invasive surgeons (1.8 ± 0.5 vs 3.8 ± 0.5, P < .01).A structured curriculum helped improve practicing surgeons' attainment of obtaining the Critical View of Safety during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, this improvement decreased after 1 year, suggesting some decay in knowledge retention over time. Therefore, continued educational interventions on Critical View of Safety and safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be needed to enhance long-term retention. CONCLUSION A structured curriculum helped improve practicing surgeons' attainment of obtaining the Critical View of Safety during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, this improvement decreased after 1 year, suggesting some decay in knowledge retention over time. Therefore, continued educational interventions on Critical View of Safety and safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be needed to enhance long-term retention.",

    "Abstract": "Medical settings provide ideal opportunities to identify patients with substance use disorders and provide harm reduction and treatment resources. Medical students often volunteer in the community and can spend substantial time with patients, serving as touchpoints. Accordingly, medical schools have begun training in harm reduction. Initial studies show such training acutely improves knowledge, but sustained effects remain unclear. This pilot study explored longer-term impacts of Opioid Overdose Prevention and Response Training (OOPRT) on medical student knowledge about opioids, overdose, and naloxone. BACKGROUND Medical settings provide ideal opportunities to identify patients with substance use disorders and provide harm reduction and treatment resources. Medical students often volunteer in the community and can spend substantial time with patients, serving as touchpoints. Accordingly, medical schools have begun training in harm reduction. Initial studies show such training acutely improves knowledge, but sustained effects remain unclear. This pilot study explored longer-term impacts of Opioid Overdose Prevention and Response Training (OOPRT) on medical student knowledge about opioids, overdose, and naloxone.Students completed a survey about knowledge of opioid use disorder, overdoses, and attitudes towards patients. This included Opioid Overdose Knowledge (OOKS) and Opioid Overdose Attitudes (OOAS) scales. A subset of students was invited to attend OOPRT and complete a post-training survey. All who completed the baseline survey were invited to complete a 6-month follow-up. We analyzed long-term training effects on OOKS and OOAS scores. METHODS Students completed a survey about knowledge of opioid use disorder, overdoses, and attitudes towards patients.

All who completed the baseline survey were invited to complete a 6-month follow-up. We analyzed long-term training effects on OOKS and OOAS scores.89 students completed baseline and 6-month follow-up surveys; of these, 22 received training. OOPRT yielded significant improvements in knowledge of signs of opioid overdose (F(2,38) = 18.04, P < .001), actions to take during overdose (F(2,38) = 8.32, P = .001), and naloxone use (F(2,38) = 35.46, P < .001), along with attitudes regarding overdose competencies (F(2,38) = 99.40, P < .001) and concerns (F(2,38) = 8.86, P < .001). When comparing over time, students who attended OOPRT retained significantly higher competency scores than those who did not attend F(1,87) = 40.82, P < .001). No other significant differences were observed. RESULTS 89 students completed baseline and 6-month follow-up surveys; of these, 22 received training.

Future research with larger sample sizes is underway to validate these preliminary findings and examine the difference in attitudes and knowledge retention over time. Given that students report interest in receiving OOPRT and consider it worthwhile, systematic study is warranted.

    "Abstract": "Prerecorded video content in medical education has become more common. Increasingly accessible technology coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent need for distanced learning has greatly increased the interest in and need for high-quality video content. The use of short educational videos to augment other teaching methods has been shown to improve learners' experiences, knowledge retention, and understanding of content. Multiple studies have demonstrated that video education can be a highly effective tool for learning, particularly for hard-to-visualize processes and for procedural education. Videos allow learners to view content at their own pace and revisit materials on demand. In addition, well-designed videos can be repurposed by educators, ultimately reducing time needed to create high-quality educational content. Currently available technology allows educators to create high-quality videos at minimal cost and with a modest investment of time. This article details practical tips for creating high-yield educational videos.Prerecorded video content in medical education has become more common.

    "Abstract": "Polarized light imaging (PLI) is a new method which quantifies and visualizes nerve fiber direction. In this study, the educational value of PLI sections of the human brainstem were compared to histological sections stained with Luxol fast blue (LFB) using e-learning modules. Mental Rotations Test (MRT) was used to assess the spatial ability. Pre-intervention, post-intervention, and long-term (1 week) anatomical tests were provided to assess the baseline knowledge and retention. One-on-one electronic interviews after the last test were carried out to understand the students' perceptions of the intervention. Thirty-eight medical students, (19 female and 19 males, mean age 21.5 ± SD 2.4; median age: 21.0 years) participated with a mean MRT score of 13.2 ± 5.2 points and a mean pre-intervention knowledge test score of 49.9 ± 11.8%. A significant improvement in both, post-intervention and long-term test scores occurred after learning with either PLI or LFB e-learning module on brainstem anatomy (both P < 0.001). No difference was observed between groups in post-intervention test scores and long-term test scores (P = 0.913 and P = 0.403, respectively). A higher MRT-score was significantly correlated with a higher post-intervention test score (r k  = 0.321; P < 0.05, respectively), but there was not a significant association between the MRT- and the long-term scores (r k = -0.078; P = 0.509). Interviews (n = 10) revealed three major topics: Learning (brainstem) anatomy by use of e-learning modules; The \"need\" of technological background information when studying brainstem sections; and Mnemonics when studying brainstem anatomy. Future studies should assess the cognitive burden of cross-sectional learning methods with PLI and/or LFB sections and their effects on knowledge retention.Polarized light imaging (PLI) is a new method which quantifies and visualizes nerve fiber direction.

    "Abstract": "The effective utilisation of organisational knowledge may promote organisational success as knowledge is one of an organisation’s most important assets. However, existing literature tends to focus on understanding knowledge sharing behaviour within organisational contexts, where knowledge hiding, a related but distinct phenomenon, has been relatively under-researched. The current study integrates social exchange theory and the theory of interpersonal behaviour to systematically examine knowledge hiding behaviour in knowledge-based companies in Malaysia. A survey with 207 participants was conducted to test the direct effects of nine predictors and the moderating role of market culture on the effects on knowledge hiding dimensions (evasive hiding, playing dumb, and rationalised hiding). Overall, the findings showed that the effects differed across the three dimensions of the phenomenon. Knowledge complexity was found to have significant positive influences on all dimensions, while perceived reciprocal benefits, cognition-based trust, and task-relatedness did not affect knowledge hiding. The other predictors (perceived loss of knowledge power, perceived losing face, perceived organisational incentives, affective-based trust, and self-efficacy) had different impacts on different dimensions of knowledge hiding. Market culture played an important moderating role in employees’ decisions about hiding knowledge. Theoretical and managerial implications and future research directions were formulated based on these findings.

INTRODUCTION Selecting an appropriate teaching methodology is one of the key stages in education. This study is an attempt to delve into the effect of FC through NPE on patient safety knowledge retention in nursing and midwifery students.A randomized controlled trial, using the Solomon design, was conducted in 2019 on 82 nursing and midwifery students enrolled from Bushehr nursing and midwifery school. The Subjects were then allocated to four groups via block randomization. The Subjects in both intervention groups studied the educational content online for 2 weeks and subsequently attended the FC through NPE. Both control groups merely received education based on conventional method. The post-test was once administered to the four study groups immediately after completing the program and once again 2 months after it.

BACKGROUND Problem-based learning (PBL) is a pedagogical approach that shifts the role of the teacher to the student (student-centered) and is based on self-directed learning. Although PBL has been adopted in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education, the effectiveness of the method is still under discussion. The author's purpose was to appraise available international evidence concerning to the effectiveness and usefulness of PBL methodology in undergraduate medical teaching programs.The authors applied the Arksey and O'Malley framework to undertake a scoping review. The search was carried out in February 2021 in PubMed and Web of Science including all publications in English and Spanish with no limits on publication date, study design or country of origin. METHODS The authors applied the Arksey and O'Malley framework to undertake a scoping review. The search was carried out in February 2021 in PubMed and Web of Science including all publications in English and Spanish with no limits on publication date, study design or country of origin.The literature search identified one hundred and twenty-four publications eligible for this review. Despite the fact that this review included many studies, their design was heterogeneous and only a few provided a high scientific evidence methodology (randomized design and/or systematic reviews with meta-analysis). Furthermore, most were single-center experiences with small sample size and there were no large multi-center studies. PBL methodology obtained a high level of satisfaction, especially among students. It was more effective than other more traditional (or lecture-based methods) at improving social and communication skills, problem-solving and self-learning skills. Knowledge retention and academic performance weren't worse (and in many studies were better) than with traditional methods. PBL was not universally widespread, probably because requires greater human resources and continuous training for its implementation.

    "Abstract": "Informal learning environments such as Natural History Museums can introduce visitors to a variety of topics in evolution by providing accessible representations of concepts like geological time, evolutionary mechanisms, biological diversity, geological time, and fossil dating. Our study examined sixth‐grade students' conceptualization of evolutionary ideas following four extracurricular, evolution‐themed “Science Days” at Nature Campus—an informal learning environment that employs an extensive combination of resources, including fossils, mounted specimens, and labs, as well as zoological and botanical gardens. The purpose of this study was to identify changes in the students' personal constructs over time, in order to determine which aspects of what they had learned during the Science Days had been retained. I, therefore, conducted two sets of interviews, which employed Kelly's Repertory Grid technique to elicit “personal constructs” representing these students' perceptions of evolution and the concepts and ideas associated with it. The first round of interviews was held immediately after the program's conclusion, and the second was conducted 3 years later (ninth‐grade). I then compared the results of the two sets of interviews. Our results showed that multiple elements of the Nature Campus learning experience were retained by the students, emphasizing the contribution of its characteristics as an authentic learning environment that uses visualization, tactile, physical examples, and interactive, inquiry‐based activities to promote meaningful learning. They also showed changes in the prominence and complexity of certain constructs that reflect the nature of the relationship between what the students learned in the informal environment of the Nature Campus and what they have since been taught (or not been taught) in the formal environment of their school.

INTRODUCTION Training school children may help to increase the rate of citizen-initiated resuscitation. However, training in school settings exclusively by healthcare professionals would lead to high costs for the Portuguese National Health Service. The aim of this study was to assess the costs and effectiveness of training by school teachers, in comparison with training provided by healthcare professionals.A quasi-experimental study was performed, with assessments before, immediately after, and two and a half months after the intervention. The costs and effectiveness of the training were compared in a sample of 362 students from the 10th, 11th and 12th grades, when performed by school teachers (experimental) versus health professionals (control). METHODS A quasi-experimental study was performed, with assessments before, immediately after, and two and a half months after the intervention. The costs and effectiveness of the training were compared in a sample of 362 students from the 10th, 11th and 12th grades, when performed by school teachers (experimental) versus health professionals (control).Regarding knowledge retention and chest compressions, there was no significant difference between the groups two and a half months later. Regarding practical skills, the experimental group had improved more at two and a half months than the control group. However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the groups using multivariate analysis. The implementation and annual maintenance costs were 4043 and 862 euros, respectively, in the experimental group, and 8561 and 6430 euros in the control group. RESULTS Regarding knowledge retention and chest compressions, there was no significant difference between the groups two and a half months later. Regarding practical skills, the experimental group had improved more at two and a half months than the control group. However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the groups using multivariate analysis. The implementation and annual maintenance costs were 4043 and 862 euros, respectively, in the experimental group, and 8561 and 6430 euros in the control group.The training provided by school teachers presented similar levels of effectiveness obtained at a lower cost, compared to the same training led by health professionals. This result suggests that generalizing training performed by school teachers could be valuable. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The training provided by school teachers presented similar levels of effectiveness obtained at a lower cost, compared to the same training led by health professionals. This result suggests that generalizing training performed by school teachers could be valuable.",

    "Abstract": "Background Anatomy is an important part of health science education. In teaching anatomy, new teaching strategies have been studied in comparison with traditional-based approaches. In this manner, strategies such as the escape room-based approach have been used as an innovative learning approach in nursing education, but little is known about its application in an Anatomy module. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of the escape room for anatomy-related knowledge retention in nursing and the perceived value of the game. Design In the first semesters of the academic years 2017–2018 and 2018–2019, a comparative cross-sectional study was conducted. Settings This study took place at the University of Almeria with students enrolled in the Anatomy module. Participants A total of 248 first-year nursing students took part in the study. Methods The study included two groups: an experimental group (EG) that participated in an escape room in the final session of their Anatomy module, and a control group (CG) that received a traditional-based teaching approach in their final lesson. Results Students enrolled in the Anatomy module were randomly assigned to either the experimental (EG, n = 128) or control groups (CG, n = 120). The escape room was conducted in groups of four and lasted no more than 15 min. In terms of satisfaction with the escape room, EG scored above the mean. The item \"I enjoyed playing\" received the highest score (4.88 ± 0.35). Taking the final scores of each group into account, the EG had a final average score of 8.94 ± 0.96, while the CG had a final average score of 7.70 ± 1.25 (p = 0.001). Conclusions According to the findings, the \"Anatomy Escape Room\" is a game-based approach that motivates students and constitutes a down-to-earth resource for anatomy learning in healthcare students.",

    "Abstract": "Background Concussion can negatively impact a child's ability to learn. School-based health professional staff have a unique opportunity to monitor students during recovery and mitigate the potential negative impact. Little is known about school health professional staff's knowledge and comfort with concussion diagnosis and management. Objectives We aimed to evaluate whether a tailored concussion education session could improve school health professional staff's knowledge about pediatric concussions. A secondary aim was to determine their knowledge retention and comfort with concussion management over the following year, including the impact of periodic follow-up education. We hypothesized that there would be sustained improvement in concussion knowledge and self-reported comfort in concussion management. Study design This study was a pre/post-intervention assessment with longitudinal follow-up. The study investigators provided a three-hour educational presentation about concussions in school-aged children. A survey on knowledge and management of pediatric concussions was administered immediately before and after this educational intervention. Knowledge retention and comfort with management was assessed at six months and at one year post-intervention. Participants and setting Participants included Cincinnati Health Department school health professional staff in attendance at their Back to School in-service, prior to the start of the 2017–2018 school year. Results Sixty school health professional staff from thirty-three schools completed the baseline knowledge survey, and forty completed all four assessments. Among the 40 participants with complete data, on average, the correct response rate (mean number correct, SD) was 82.3% (18.1/22, 11.0) pre-education, 91.8% (20.2/22, 10.3) immediate post-education, 86.4% (19.0/22, 10.8) 6-month follow-up, and 87.3% (19.2/22, 10.9) one-year follow-up. Conclusions A brief didactic educational intervention improved pediatric concussion knowledge and management skills among school health care providers. Periodic and in-person education is likely necessary to optimize knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Remote collaboration using Augmented Reality (AR) has potential to support physically distributed team-members that need to achieve a common goal by increasing knowledge retention, improving understanding and awareness of the problem and its context. In this vein, the path to achieve usable, realistic and impactful solutions must entail an explicit understanding regarding how remote collaboration occurs through AR and how it may help contribute to a more effective work effort. Thus, characterization and evaluation of the collaborative process is paramount, but a particularly challenging endeavor, due to the multitude of aspects that define the collaboration effort. In this context, the work presented here contributes with a critical analysis, discussing current evaluation efforts, identifying limitations and opportunities. Then, we outline a conceptual framework to support researchers in conducting evaluations in a more structured manner. To instrument this vision, an evaluation toolkit is proposed to support contextual data collection and analysis in such scenarios and obtain an additional perspective on selected dimensions of collaboration. We illustrate the usefulness and versatility of the toolkit through a case study on remote maintenance, comparing two distinct methods: sharing of video and AR-based annotations. Last, we discuss the results obtained, showing the proposed vision allows to have an additional level of insights to better understand what happened, eliciting a more complete characterization of the work effort.",

    "Abstract": "The study explores how collaborative based exams (CLBE) affect specified learning outcomes in an Accounting Theory course for final year ‘accounting major’ students. The study proposes Accounting Theory as an avenue to improve the qualitative and problem-solving skills of accounting students and collaborative learning (CL) as a mechanism to enhance students’ teamwork skills. The study uses a mixed-methods approach, applying a quantitative method in analysing the relationships and then using focus groups to gain insights about students’ reaction to CL and collaborative based exams (CLBE). The results confirm that collaborative based exams (CLBE) after a CL mechanism significantly and comparatively improves students’ qualitative and problem-solving based exam scores, reduces pre-exam anxiety and enhances knowledge retention. Both low performing and high CGPA students benefited from CL and collaborative based exams (CLBE). Students, even though appreciative of the visible benefits of CL, contested a group-based grading system, and female students revealed gender biases within group dynamics. This study is the first application of inter and intragroup dependent exam constructs within collaborative based exams (CLBE).",

    "Abstract": "Background The ARMADILLO Study determined whether adolescents able to access SRH information on-demand via SMS were better able to reject contraception-related myths and misconceptions as compared with adolescents receiving pushed SMS or no intervention. Trial design This trial was an unblinded, three-arm, parallel-group, individual RCT with a 1:1:1 allocation. Trial registration: ISRCTN85156148. Methods This study was conducted in Lima, Peru among participants ages 13–17 years. Eligible participants were randomized into one of three arms: Arm 1: access to ARMADILLO’s SMS information on-demand; Arm 2 access to ARMADILLO SMS information pushed to their phone; Arm 3 control (no SMS). The intervention period lasted seven weeks. At baseline, endline, and follow-up (eight weeks following endline), participants were assessed on a variety of contraception-related myths and misconceptions. An index of myths-believed was generated. The primary outcome assessed the subject-specific change in the mean score between baseline and endline. Knowledge retention from endline to follow-up was also assessed, as was a ‘content exposure’ outcome, which assessed change in participants’ knowledge based on relevant SMS received. Results In total, 712 participants were randomized to the three arms: 659 completed an endline assessment and were included in the primary analysis. Arm 2 participants believed fewer myths at endline compared with control arm participants (estimated subject-specific mean difference of -3.69% [-6.17%, -1.21%], p = 0.004). There was no significant difference between participants in Arm 1 vs. the control Arm, or between participants in Arm 1 vs. Arm 2. A further decrease in myths believed between endline and follow-up (knowledge retention) was observed in all arms; however, there was no difference between arms. The content exposure analysis saw significant reductions in myths believed for Arm 1 (estimated subject-specific mean difference of -9.47% [-14.83%, -4.11%], p = .001) and Arm 2 (-5.93% [-8.57%, -3.29%], p < .001) as compared with the control arm; however Arm 1’s reduced sample size (n = 28) is a severe limitation. Discussion The ARMADILLO SMS content has a significant (but small) effect on participants’ contraception-related knowledge. Standalone, adolescent SRH digital health interventions may affect only modest change. Instead, digital is probably best used a complementary channel to expand the reach of existing validated SRH information and service programs.",

    "Abstract": "The flipped classroom (FC) approach and high-fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) training have shown promising effects in short-term acquisition or long-term retention of knowledge in medical education. In this study, we aimed to explore the incorporation of HFPS into the FC and the impact on the long-term (3 months after classes) knowledge retention of medical undergraduate students learning about acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning (AOPP). INTRODUCTION The flipped classroom (FC) approach and high-fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) training have shown promising effects in short-term acquisition or long-term retention of knowledge in medical education. In this study, we aimed to explore the incorporation of HFPS into the FC and the impact on the long-term (3 months after classes) knowledge retention of medical undergraduate students learning about acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning (AOPP).Eighty-two fifth-year medical students were randomly divided into an HFPS group (HG, n = 40) and an FC group (FG, n = 42). A postclass quiz and preinternship quiz were performed to assess the short-term knowledge acquisition and long-term (3 months after classes) knowledge retention of both groups of students. Feedback questionnaires were administered immediately after the class and before the internship to assess the students' self-perceived competency. METHODS Eighty-two fifth-year medical students were randomly divided into an HFPS group (HG, n = 40) and an FC group (FG, n = 42). A postclass quiz and preinternship quiz were performed to assess the short-term knowledge acquisition and long-term (3 months after classes) knowledge retention of both groups of students. Feedback questionnaires were administered immediately after the class and before the internship to assess the students' self-perceived competency.In the postclass quiz, the scores achieved by the students from the HG and FG were 15.58 ± 2.69 and 14.62 ± 2.19, respectively. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups (P = 0.19). In the preinternship quiz, the scores achieved by the students from the HG (14.50 ± 2.16) were significantly higher than those achieved by the students from the FG (11.40 ± 2.07, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the postclass quiz and preinternship quiz scores achieved by the HG students (P = 0.05). However, scores in the preinternship quiz showed a significant decline compared with the postclass quiz for the FG students (P < 0.001). Students in the HG gave significantly higher scores for self-perceived confidence in dealing with AOPP patients in the forthcoming internship on the postclass and preinternship questionnaires. RESULTS In the postclass quiz, the scores achieved by the students from the HG and FG were 15.58 ± 2.69 and 14.62 ± 2.19, respectively. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups (P = 0.19).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES In 2015, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a policy statement to provide best practices on mother-infant discharge criteria, including the delivery of anticipatory guidance to mothers of healthy newborns. In our large health system with a mix of hospital types, no standard approach to or measurement of the effectiveness of newborn discharge guidance exists. At one community well-newborn unit, we aimed to increase maternal knowledge retention of newborn guidance from 69% to 90%.Data about newborn guidance effectiveness were collected by assessing maternal knowledge retention through phone follow-up quizzes. By using quality improvement methodology and informed by American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines and curricular and adult learning theory, we standardized a multidisciplinary approach to this education. Interventions included checklist, scripts, temperature-taking demonstration, gift thermometer, staff education, car seat infant mannequin, and car seat training video for staff.

By using quality improvement methodology and informed by American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines and curricular and adult learning theory, we standardized a multidisciplinary approach to this education. Interventions included checklist, scripts, temperature-taking demonstration, gift thermometer, staff education, car seat infant mannequin, and car seat training video for staff.Over a 1-year period, 333 mothers were interviewed after discharge from the well-newborn unit. Baseline data over the first 3 months (n = 93) showed poor maternal knowledge retention (69% correct answers). Common incorrect answers were on newborn urination habits, car seat harness clip positioning, and fever recognition. After restructuring the educational process, special cause was achieved after 3 months, with a shift of the average of correct answers to 83% followed by a second shift to 86%.

    "Abstract": "Objectives With the 'teach-back' method, patients or carers repeat back what they understand, so that professionals can confirm comprehension and correct misunderstandings. The effectiveness of teach-back has been underexamined, particularly for older patients discharged from the emergency department (ED). We aimed to determine whether teach-back would reduce ED revisits and whether it would increase patients’ retention of discharge instructions, improve self-management at home and increase satisfaction with the provision of instructions. Methods A nonrandomised pre–post pilot evaluation in the ED of one Dutch academic hospital including patients discharged from the ED receiving standard discharge care (pre) and teach-back (post). Primary outcomes were ED-revisits within 7 days and within 8–30 days postdischarge. Secondary outcomes for a subsample of older adults were retention of instructions, self-management 72 hours after discharge and satisfaction with the provision of discharge instructions. Results A total of 648 patients were included, 154 were older adults. ED revisits within 7 days and within 8–30 days were lower in the teach-back group compared with those receiving standard discharge care: adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of 0.23 (95% CI 0.05 to 1.07) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.14 to 1.33), respectively. Participants in the teach-back group had an increased likelihood of full knowledge retention on information related to their ED diagnosis and treatment (AOR 2.19; 95% CI 1.01 to 4.75; p=0.048), medication (AOR 14.89; 95% CI 4.12 to 53.85; p>0.001) and follow-up appointments (AOR 3.86; 95% CI 1.33 to 10.19; p=0.012). Use of teach-back was not significantly associated with improved self-management and higher satisfaction with discharge instructions. Discharge conversations were generally shorter for participants receiving teach-back.

PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING Participants included Cincinnati Health Department school health professional staff in attendance at their Back to School in-service, prior to the start of the 2017-2018 school year.Sixty school health professional staff from thirty-three schools completed the baseline knowledge survey, and forty completed all four assessments. Among the 40 participants with complete data, on average, the correct response rate (mean number correct, SD) was 82.3% (18.1/22, 11.0) pre-education, 91.8% (20.2/22, 10.3) immediate post-education, 86.4% (19.0/22, 10.8) 6-month follow-up, and 87.3% (19.2/22, 10.9) one-year follow-up.

    "Abstract": "Anatomy is an important part of health science education. In teaching anatomy, new teaching strategies have been studied in comparison with traditional-based approaches. In this manner, strategies such as the escape room-based approach have been used as an innovative learning approach in nursing education, but little is known about its application in an Anatomy module. BACKGROUND Anatomy is an important part of health science education. In teaching anatomy, new teaching strategies have been studied in comparison with traditional-based approaches. In this manner, strategies such as the escape room-based approach have been used as an innovative learning approach in nursing education, but little is known about its application in an Anatomy module.To evaluate the effectiveness of the escape room for anatomy-related knowledge retention in nursing and the perceived value of the game. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of the escape room for anatomy-related knowledge retention in nursing and the perceived value of the game.In the first semesters of the academic years 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, a comparative cross-sectional study was conducted. DESIGN In the first semesters of the academic years 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, a comparative cross-sectional study was conducted.This study took place at the University of Almeria with students enrolled in the Anatomy module. SETTINGS This study took place at the University of Almeria with students enrolled in the Anatomy module.A total of 248 first-year nursing students took part in the study. PARTICIPANTS A total of 248 first-year nursing students took part in the study.The study included two groups: an experimental group (EG) that participated in an escape room in the final session of their Anatomy module, and a control group (CG) that received a traditional-based teaching approach in their final lesson. METHODS The study included two groups: an experimental group (EG) that participated in an escape room in the final session of their Anatomy module, and a control group (CG) that received a traditional-based teaching approach in their final lesson.Students enrolled in the Anatomy module were randomly assigned to either the experimental (EG, n = 128) or control groups (CG, n = 120). The escape room was conducted in groups of four and lasted no more than 15 min. In terms of satisfaction with the escape room, EG scored above the mean. The item \"I enjoyed playing\" received the highest score (4.88 ± 0.35). Taking the final scores of each group into account, the EG had a final average score of 8.94 ± 0.96, while the CG had a final average score of 7.70 ± 1.25 (p = 0.001). RESULTS Students enrolled in the Anatomy module were randomly assigned to either the experimental (EG, n = 128) or control groups (CG, n = 120). The escape room was conducted in groups of four and lasted no more than 15 min. In terms of satisfaction with the escape room, EG scored above the mean. The item \"I enjoyed playing\" received the highest score (4.88 ± 0.35). Taking the final scores of each group into account, the EG had a final average score of 8.94 ± 0.96, while the CG had a final average score of 7.70 ± 1.25 (p = 0.001).According to the findings, the \"Anatomy Escape Room\" is a game-based approach that motivates students and constitutes a down-to-earth resource for anatomy learning in healthcare students. CONCLUSIONS According to the findings, the \"Anatomy Escape Room\" is a game-based approach that motivates students and constitutes a down-to-earth resource for anatomy learning in healthcare students.",

    "Abstract": "With the 'teach-back' method, patients or carers repeat back what they understand, so that professionals can confirm comprehension and correct misunderstandings. The effectiveness of teach-back has been underexamined, particularly for older patients discharged from the emergency department (ED). We aimed to determine whether teach-back would reduce ED revisits and whether it would increase patients' retention of discharge instructions, improve self-management at home and increase satisfaction with the provision of instructions. OBJECTIVES With the 'teach-back' method, patients or carers repeat back what they understand, so that professionals can confirm comprehension and correct misunderstandings. The effectiveness of teach-back has been underexamined, particularly for older patients discharged from the emergency department (ED). We aimed to determine whether teach-back would reduce ED revisits and whether it would increase patients' retention of discharge instructions, improve self-management at home and increase satisfaction with the provision of instructions.A nonrandomised pre-post pilot evaluation in the ED of one Dutch academic hospital including patients discharged from the ED receiving standard discharge care (pre) and teach-back (post). Primary outcomes were ED-revisits within 7 days and within 8-30 days postdischarge. Secondary outcomes for a subsample of older adults were retention of instructions, self-management 72 hours after discharge and satisfaction with the provision of discharge instructions. METHODS A nonrandomised pre-post pilot evaluation in the ED of one Dutch academic hospital including patients discharged from the ED receiving standard discharge care (pre) and teach-back (post). Primary outcomes were ED-revisits within 7 days and within 8-30 days postdischarge. Secondary outcomes for a subsample of older adults were retention of instructions, self-management 72 hours after discharge and satisfaction with the provision of discharge instructions.A total of 648 patients were included, 154 were older adults. ED revisits within 7 days and within 8-30 days were lower in the teach-back group compared with those receiving standard discharge care: adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of 0.23 (95% CI 0.05 to 1.07) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.14 to 1.33), respectively. Participants in the teach-back group had an increased likelihood of full knowledge retention on information related to their ED diagnosis and treatment (AOR 2.19; 95% CI 1.01 to 4.75; p=0.048), medication (AOR 14.89; 95% CI 4.12 to 53.85; p>0.001) and follow-up appointments (AOR 3.86; 95% CI 1.33 to 10.19; p=0.012). Use of teach-back was not significantly associated with improved self-management and higher satisfaction with discharge instructions. Discharge conversations were generally shorter for participants receiving teach-back. RESULTS A total of 648 patients were included, 154 were older adults. ED revisits within 7 days and within 8-30 days were lower in the teach-back group compared with those receiving standard discharge care: adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of 0.23 (95% CI 0.05 to 1.07) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.14 to 1.33), respectively.

Use of teach-back was not significantly associated with improved self-management and higher satisfaction with discharge instructions. Discharge conversations were generally shorter for participants receiving teach-back.Discharging patients from the ED with a relatively simple and feasible teach-back method can contribute to safer and better transitional care from the ED to home. CONCLUSIONS Discharging patients from the ED with a relatively simple and feasible teach-back method can contribute to safer and better transitional care from the ED to home.",

INTRODUCTION Knowledge, once acquired, degrades over time. Exams that contain questions related to previously acquired knowledge ('retrieval practice questions') may promote retrieval practice and spaced learning, and subsequently prevent knowledge loss. To investigate this hypothesis, we compare the score of retrieval practice questions to regular questions in exams of a two-year (bio)medical study program.The two-year \"Mechanisms of Health and Disease\"-program for biomedical sciences and medical students in Nijmegen (the Netherlands) contains 14 spaced exams of 80 questions each. The percentages of correct-, false-, and non-answers were compared between regular questions and retrieval practice questions. Using Pearson correlations between question scores and exam scores (RiT-values), the impact of retrieval practice questions on the internal consistency of exams was determined. Mixed model analyses determined changes in outcomes across time. METHODS The two-year \"Mechanisms of Health and Disease\"-program for biomedical sciences and medical students in Nijmegen (the Netherlands) contains 14 spaced exams of 80 questions each. The percentages of correct-, false-, and non-answers were compared between regular questions and retrieval practice questions. Using Pearson correlations between question scores and exam scores (RiT-values), the impact of retrieval practice questions on the internal consistency of exams was determined. Mixed model analyses determined changes in outcomes across time.Analysis of 2006 regular questions and 1728 retrieval practice questions revealed a significantly higher percentage of correct and false answers, and a significantly lower percentage of non-answers, in retrieval practice questions versus regular questions (all P < 0.05). Scores did not change across time. RiT-values were slightly lower in retrieval practice questions, with a small inverse trend across time. RESULTS Analysis of 2006 regular questions and 1728 retrieval practice questions revealed a significantly higher percentage of correct and false answers, and a significantly lower percentage of non-answers, in retrieval practice questions versus regular questions (all P < 0.05). Scores did not change across time. RiT-values were slightly lower in retrieval practice questions, with a small inverse trend across time.Our data indicate preservation of knowledge, possibly related to retrieval practice and/or spaced learning. Although the RiT-values of retrieval practice questions were slightly lower than those of regular questions, the discriminative capacity was well within acceptable range. These data highlight the potency of retrieval practice questions to prevent knowledge decrement, without altering exam quality.

    "Abstract": "The long-term effect of three-dimensional printed heart model (3DPHM) on knowledge acquisition of congenital heart disease (CHD) remains unknown. This prospective cohort study aims to investigate the role of 3DPHM in improving immediate knowledge gain and long-term knowledge retention on CHD among the medical students. BACKGROUND The long-term effect of three-dimensional printed heart model (3DPHM) on knowledge acquisition of congenital heart disease (CHD) remains unknown. This prospective cohort study aims to investigate the role of 3DPHM in improving immediate knowledge gain and long-term knowledge retention on CHD among the medical students.Fifty-three second and third year medical students were assigned into two groups to compare their immediate knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention after an education session on anatomy and pathophysiology of CHD. During the 1.5 hour-long education session, both the control (n = 25) and study groups (n = 28) had access to identical teaching materials: digital 3D heart models, 2D diagrams, and medical images, except for 3DPHM which were only used in the study group. The immediate knowledge gain was assessed via an online quiz, whereas the long-term knowledge retention was assessed using another quiz in 6-weeks' time post-intervention. A survey was also conducted to evaluate the participants' learning experience. METHODS Fifty-three second and third year medical students were assigned into two groups to compare their immediate knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention after an education session on anatomy and pathophysiology of CHD. During the 1.5 hour-long education session, both the control (n = 25) and study groups (n = 28) had access to identical teaching materials: digital 3D heart models, 2D diagrams, and medical images, except for 3DPHM which were only used in the study group. The immediate knowledge gain was assessed via an online quiz, whereas the long-term knowledge retention was assessed using another quiz in 6-weeks' time post-intervention. A survey was also conducted to evaluate the participants' learning experience.There is no significant difference in the immediate knowledge acquisition and long-term knowledge retention between the groups (U = 272, p = 0.16 and r = -0.143, p = 0.15 respectively). Majority of the students (96% in control group and 85% in 3DPHM group) responded that the 3DPHM would have/had improved their learning experience. Despite that, there is no significant difference in the self-perceived knowledge improvement between the groups. RESULTS There is no significant difference in the immediate knowledge acquisition and long-term knowledge retention between the groups (U = 272, p = 0.16 and r = -0.143, p = 0.15 respectively). Majority of the students (96% in control group and 85% in 3DPHM group) responded that the 3DPHM would have/had improved their learning experience. Despite that, there is no significant difference in the self-perceived knowledge improvement between the groups.This study concludes that the 3DPHM do not significantly improve both immediate knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention among the medical students. However, further research with larger sample size, as well as categorizing the type of questions in the quiz, is needed to better assess the role of 3DPHM in different educational components. CONCLUSIONS This study concludes that the 3DPHM do not significantly improve both immediate knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention among the medical students.

    "Abstract": "Learning Objectives: Create an easily digestible infographic including pearls from residency didactics which can be consistently reproduced with minimal time commitment to maximize learning through asynchronous spaced repetition; discover the basic functions of Canva and methods to implement this into your residency. Introduction: The pandemic has introduced drastic fluctuations in clinical experiences for residents. Given these circumstances, maximizing didactic education is even more critical for trainees. Spaced repetition has been deemed a beneficial way to solidify information into long term memory for learners. Despite initiating best practices in virtual didactics, it can be difficult to engage learners adequately in virtual format to ensure active learning and promote knowledge retention. We sought to combat these challenges by designing and distributing weekly infographics summarizing key learning points from didactics. Curricular Design: For any resident academic project, the rigorous schedule is an anticipated barrier to consistent production. The user-friendly graphic design platform, Canva, was used to create a template that could be easily reproduced and modified. Each week, several residents each committed to highlighting a single learning point from each lecture, editing the template, then disseminating the infographic 1 week later via multiple routes including email and social media to utilize spaced repetition. Impact/Effectiveness: A survey of the CORD listserv found most respondents have interest in similar initiatives but have either failed to attempt or failed to operationalize it consistently. Barriers cited include lack of a platform, too arduous, and too time consuming. 6 months after implementing this system, we have been able to produce weekly content. Over half of our faculty and residents read these summaries, and feedback has been exceedingly positive. Faculty state they enjoy rapidly staying abreast of the topics covered in didactics if they didn’t attend, and even use them as rapid reference material. Residents appreciate the reinforcement of critical concepts through spaced repetition. This is engaging learners, faculty, and alumni, reinforcing learning points, and can be disseminated on social media.",

    "Abstract": "Learning Objectives: Covering the domains of knowledge, skills and attitudes, residents were expected to analyze structural violence and health gaps, demonstrate inclusive and trauma-informed care, recognize implicit bias, use strategies to reduce it, and critically assess the EM health equity literature. Introduction/Background: Since the 2003 “Unequal Treatment” report showed that health gaps are not due to access or income, racial injustice and COVID-19 have laid bare worse inequities. In 2021, the ACGME EM Milestones addressed recognition of health gaps and personal bias, however there is no guidance on how to do this. ED patients require an unbiased evaluation to ensure rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment, but implicit bias reigns with high cognitive load. Thus, we describe a deliberate and formal diversity, inclusion and racial equity (DIRE) curriculum. Educational Objectives: Residents were expected to analyze structural violence and health gaps, demonstrate inclusive and trauma-informed care, recognize implicit bias, use strategies to reduce it, and critically assess the EM health equity literature. Curricular Design: An ED survey confirmed the need for this curriculum. Since July 2020, the course has been available to all ED staff but is mandatory for residents. The free online platform, Canvas, was chosen for ease of access and use, and for resource sharing, discussion facilitation, and quiz scoring. Biweekly articles, online videos, a journal club and quarterly book clubs led to health equity discourse. Residents took part in simulated cases involving diverse patients. A workshop reviewed strategies to reduce implicit bias. Residents were assessed with quizzes, reflective writing and direct observation. Based on feedback, sessions are now held monthly with more media resources, live seminars, and diverse content. Impact/Effectiveness: As of July 2021, residents have had positive feedback, 100% completion rates, and high knowledge retention. Structural violence must be included in resident didactics. Simulated cases provide an avenue to assess interpersonal communication skills for residents to develop tools to partner with patients. This model may serve as a blueprint for those seeking to improve DIRE knowledge, skills and attitudes.",

    "Abstract": "Background Clinical reasoning (CR) is a complex process which doctors utilise to diagnose and manage patients’ problems. CR comprises both intuitive, nonanalytical reasoning (NAR) and deliberate, analytical reasoning (AR) interacting with contextual factors. CR development occurs through acquisition of knowledge and experience and consequent development of mental models of disease called illness scripts. Accurate CR is important to provide patients with accurate diagnoses and effective management plans for their problem. Therefore, developing the foundations of CR in medical students is an important aspect of their education. Education to develop CR in the real world is highly complex, with multiple factors or contexts impacting outcome. How educational interventions interact with context to develop CR in medical students as an outcome is understudied. This research aims to examine the ways in which educational interventions develop CR, how, in which circumstances and for which groups they are more likely to be effective. Methodology and methods This research comprises a realist review of the literature and a realist evaluation of CR development in medical students at the University of Nottingham Medical School. A realist methodological approach to research considers the contexts that impact interventions and considers the ways in which interventions produce their results by analysis of interactions between context, mechanism and outcome. Initial programme theory was developed and refined iteratively through a realist review including twenty-eight primary studies. This resulted in a refined programme theory which was further tested and refined using individual and group interviews. The thirty-one participants comprised of medical students, clinical teachers and faculty members. Data were analysed using a realist logic including abductive and retroductive inference to create context mechanism outcome configurations (CMOCs). The output of the research is a refined programme theory which was utilised to suggest recommendations for educational practice and policy. Results Educational interventions, including but not limited to simulation, interacting with patients and discussion with clinical teachers, provide five key resources to students. These include learning about the CR process, participation in CR tasks, learning from mistakes, encouragement of NAR or AR and integration of strategies that promote effective long-term acquisition of knowledge. These educational resources are affected by students’ clinical domain knowledge, self-confidence, clinical experience and goal orientation or mindset; by teachers’ motivation, confidence and rapport or relationship with students; and by the wider organisational factors such as available time, space and resources, perception of assessment practices and curricula prioritisation. The student, teacher and wider organisational contexts impact both how the educational interventions develop CR in individuals and impact opportunities for CR development. Discussion and conclusions This research has determined how, why and in what circumstances CR develops in medical students. The resultant programme theory has enabled a deeper and holistic understanding of CR development in the real world and subsequent recommendations for how this might be improved. To promote the most effective CR development, education should be individualised to students’ clinical domain knowledge, self-confidence, experience and motivation. Teachers will be better able to assess individual students’ characteristics when curricula promote continuity of education through building of positive student-teacher relationships. Building confidence in clinical environments through early years experiences or promotion of interventions such as students working as health care assistants (HCAs) will aid engagement and learning the clinical environments. Students should be taught how to learn effectively through integration of learning strategies to aid long term knowledge retention and through reinforcement of a growth mindset to aid development of mastery goal orientation. Additionally, engagement in the clinical environment is more likely when assessments are aligned with real, uncertain clinical practice which increases opportunities for CR development.",

    "Abstract": "The study investigate the open research problem of overcoming catastrophic forgetting during incremental similarity learning. The study examines the extent of forgetting during regular training on four well-known similarity learning loss functions: angular, contrastive, triplet, and center loss. We adapted three state-of-the-art existing learning techniques for incremental classification learning to incremental similarity learning. Furthermore, we present our novel incremental learning technique inspired by previous research. We compared our approach to the three existing techniques. Finally, we examine the forgetting problem on a variety of simple to complex datasets. We looked into different architecture setups to comprehensively examine how the different methods fare. The results confirm that catastrophic forget-ting does occur during incremental similarity learning. Furthermore, we have shown the importance of good mining techniques for the similarity learning loss functions to reduce catastrophic forgetting. The results show that our approach outperformed the three existing techniques on average for incremental similarity learning. In addition, we note that our technique retained the highest ratio of base knowledge regardless of the training setup with the different datasets or network architectures. However, other methods learn new knowledge better. Nevertheless, our approach yields better average knowledge performance across all experiments. Furthermore, our approach can improve performance on unseen classes during incremental similarity learning. The results show that regularization techniques do not work as well as exemplar retention techniques in most of our experiments. In addition, we have shown that different combinations of training setups affect how each of the different techniques effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting. Further investigation into the relationship between transfer learning and similarity learning and the protection of intermediate layer embedding space for catastrophic forgetting is required.",

    "Abstract": "Sociolinguists suggest language death entails significant cultural, personal, and ecological loss. Socio-cultural and socio-political factors exacerbate language erosion and encourage supplantation by another more dominant language. Hence, we ask: what are the sociocognitive principles which make language death hurtful and symbolic? Within this article, we attempt to outline a sociocognitive account of language death, situating the Hallidayan perspective of language as a “social-semiotic” system alongside a Cognitive Linguistic approach. We further contextualise language as inseparable from culture, drawing insight from the sociological thought of Bourdieu. We contend that language death entails psychological trauma, representing the destruction of cultural genealogy and the loss of knowledge intrinsic to personal self-imagery and identity. To this end, we present a case study of the Māori languaculture in Aotearoa (New Zealand), tracing the impact of colonialism and marginalisation to current efforts and ambitions to ensure the languacultural survival of Māori and reclaim space in Aotearoa as a respected knowledge system and means of expression, particularly in the socio-technical age of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Web. We argue that our analysis bodes practical implications for language maintenance and revitalisation, concluding that sociolinguistic practitioners should consider a socio-cognitivist as well as socio-technical paradigm for language intervention. In closing, we discuss leveraging AI technologies towards language heritage, archival, and preservation to limit the destructive impact of the death of a language.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge exchange has been a critical factor for cross-functional teams to master different tasks and problems and promote innovation. Cross-functional teams rely on the direct cooperation of senior employees from different departments, often with converging aims, leadership, culture, and communication. However, with the ever-increasing complexity in business decisions, decision-makers invested in the manufacturing industry sector need the support of a diverse team as an advisory tool to put well-thought measures into effect. The aim of this study is to analyze how cross-functional teams in commerce and industry rely on different key performance indicators to limit knowledge hiding. This paper conducted a quantitative study of 130 individual participants working in cross-functional teams in Germany. It also adapted multiple linear regression and used a conceptual model impacting the relationship between team performance, trust, and organizational citizenship behavior, including the moderating role of leadership. The disruptive effect of knowledge hiding was contextualized. The results indicate that team performance is directly affected by the selected variables. Furthermore, it is limited to knowledge hiding, while trust and the use of adequate leadership help to retain knowledge retention. Lastly, organizational citizenship behavior was found as the paramount factor, supported by individually tailored leadership methods, to foster information exchange and thereby promote organization-wide learning.",

    "Abstract": "Background : PBL (problem based learning) is new active learning educational strategy that has been extensively tested and used in recent years. Patan Academy of Health Sciences (PAHS) is one of medical schools from Nepal, a Low Income Country (LIC) implementing PBL for undergraduate medical education. This study aims to compare PAHS students' understanding and knowledge retention when taught through PBL and lecture-based classes and compare students' perceptions of PBL and lectures in medical education. Methods : This is a cross-sectional study of medical students of a PBL based medical school in Nepal, a non-Western low-income country. Ethical approval was given by the institutional research committee of the Patan Academy of Health Sciences. Understanding and knowledge retention was assessed with 50 vignette-based multiple-choice questions, half of which were taught through PBL sessions, and the remaining half were taught in didactic lectures during basic science years of medical school. A separate pre-validated perception questionnaire was used to assess students' preferences regarding PBL and lectures. Results : Out of 107 students, 99 participated in the understanding and knowledge retention questionnaires and 107 completed perception questionnaires. Understanding and knowledge retention of students was found to be the same for topics taught by PBL and lectures, with median scores of 17 and s16, respectively. PBL were mostly preferred for the physiology (59.81%), pathology (51.40%) and pharmacology (53.27%) concepts, and lectures were mostly preferred for the anatomy (78.50%), biochemistry (45.79%), and microbiology (42.99%) topics. Students wanted the same concepts to be taught through both PBL and lectures, especially for anatomy. Conclusions : Understanding and knowledge retention is the same for topics taught by either PBL or lectures during the basic science years of undergraduate medical education. Students prefer PBL for physiology, pathology, and pharmacology-related concepts, conventional didactic lecture for physiology and microbiology, and a combination of lecture and PBL sessions for anatomy.Background: PBL (problem based learning) is new active learning educational strategy that has been extensively tested and used in recent years.

    "Abstract": "The term 4.0 was presented at the “Hannover Fair” (Germany) in 2011, as a transfiguring concept of Industry, Education, and Information operations. Currently, looking at education, the acceleration of the technology integration process is an inevitable consequence of the constraints associated with the recent pandemic situation. Thus, the opportunity arises to deepen the study of the harmonization of digital transformation in education to the challenges posed by emergency remote teaching. This study aims to measure and characterize the consequences of the abrupt transition to a fully online system, articulating “Inquiry-based Learning (IBL)” solutions to the emerging concept of “platformization” of education. This purpose forces us to evaluate innovative alternatives to respond to the reduction in levels of communication, personalization, engagement, and knowledge retention, namely through the conceptualization of an institutional digital platform for sharing/consumption of explanatory videos. This study uses a triangulation approach of quantitative and qualitative data to generate assumptions about students' perceptions of remote learning, IBL and the “platformization” of education. The sample is composed of 18 Portuguese higher education students, to allow for a more in-depth and detailed study. Results confirm the drop in the levels of communication, engagement, and knowledge retention in the remote regime, highlighting benefits inherent to autonomous/collaborative research, supported by positive inferences on the conceptualized digital platform in order to counteract academic isolation. Alternate abstract: O termo 4.0 foi apresentado na “Hannover Fair” (Alemanha) no ano de 2011, como um conceito transfigurador das operações na Indústria, Educação e Informação. Lançando o olhar sob o ensino atual, a aceleração do processo de integração da tecnologia foi uma consequência inevitável dos condicionalismos associados à recente situação pandémica. Surge assim a oportunidade de aprofundar o estudo da harmonização da transformação digital na educação aos desafios impostos pelo ensino remoto de emergência. Este estudo propõe-se a analisar as consequências da transição abrupta para um sistema totalmente online, articulando soluções de “Inquiry-based Learning” ao conceito de “platformização” da educação. Este propósito obriga a avaliar alternativas inovadoras para responder à redução dos níveis de comunicação, motivação e retenção de conhecimento, através da conceção de uma plataforma digital institucional para partilha/consumo de vídeos entre alunos. Este estudo utiliza uma abordagem de triangulação de dados quantitativos e qualitativos para gerar assunções sobre as perceções dos alunos relativamente ao ensino remoto, IBL e “platformização” da educação. A amostra é composta por 18 alunos do ensino superior portugueses, para possibilitar a concretização de um estudo mais aprofundado e detalhado. Os resultados confirmam a queda dos níveis de comunicação, motivação e retenção de conhecimento em regime remoto, apontando benefícios inerentes à pesquisa autónoma/colaborativa, acompanhada por inferências positivas sobre a plataforma digital conceptualizada para contrariar o isolamento académico.",

    "Abstract": "A Gestão de Conhecimento ao dia de hoje apresenta uma relevância extrema para as organizações, para empresas que prestam serviços este tema é ainda mais relevante tendo em conta que maioritariamente o “elemento” a ser transacionado é o conhecimento. O principal objetivo deste estudo é criar medidas para a gestão de conhecimento em organizações com base em projetos de consultoria, avaliar tendências, impactos e as principais causas da perda de conhecimento. Para tal foram elaboradas entrevistas, numa consultora, fazendo uso da metodologia “Pereira Problem Solving” a uma amostra de 20 participantes. Os resultados mostraram que embora difícil de realizar a gestão de conhecimento em consultoras. O estudo aponta como principais causas da perda a rotatividade do capital humano, deficiências no processo de armazenamento, e elementos processuais do KM. Estas lacunas após identificadas podem ser trabalhadas por forma a gerar os benefícios apontados pelo estudo, como a apresentação de melhores soluções para os clientes, ou a redução do tempo e esforço aplicado nos projetos, elevando indicadores de eficácia e produtividade. Alternate abstract: Today's Knowledge Management is extremely relevant for organizations, for companies that provide services, this topic is even more relevant, considering that most of the “element” to be transacted is knowledge. The main objective of this study is to create measures for knowledge management in project base organizations based, assess trends, impacts and the main causes of knowledge loss. To this end, interviews were carried out, in a consultant, using the “Pereira Problem Solving” methodology to a sample of 20 participants. The results showed that although it is difficult to carry out knowledge management in consultants, the study points out that the main causes of loss of knowledge are the turnover of human capital, deficiencies in the storage process, and procedural elements of KM. These gaps, once identified, can be worked on, in order to generate the benefits pointed out by the study, such as the presentation of better solutions for customers, the reduction of time and effort applied to projects, increasing efficiency and productivity indicators.",

    "Abstract": "A sinergia entre espaços da organização hospitalar é uma potencialidade que emerge na itinerância de elementos operacionais. O conhecimento circula em cada indivíduo, que o absorve em cada contexto e o transporta para outros, deixando contributos à sua passagem. O seguinte relatório desenvolve-se no contexto de estágio, no âmbito do Mestrado em Enfermagem da Pessoa em Situação Crítica, da Universidade do Minho. Relata a experiência no âmbito da aquisição das competências de enfermeiro especialista da pessoa em situação crítica, como também, apresenta o resultado de um trabalho de investigação desenvolvido em contexto clínico. O problema de investigação surge da preocupação com a perda de conhecimento que acontece nos espaços entre a formação e a prática de Suporte Avançado de Vida no contexto de Medicina Intensiva, onde esses momentos são na sua maioria evitados, cumprindo-se o objetivo de uma monitorização eficaz. A gamificação é aqui apresentada como uma estratégia direcionada à manutenção de conhecimentos, planeando-se deste modo o desenvolvimento de um jogo chamado “Save the Shame!”, do qual se pretende avaliar o impacto. O objetivo principal deste estudo é a avaliação do impacto do jogo “Save the Shame!”, no conhecimento em Suporte Avançado de Vida, de Enfermeiros e Médicos, em contexto de Medicina Intensiva. Como objetivos específicos incluem-se ainda, i) sistematizar a evidência sobre a gamificação, a partir de uma revisão narrativa; ii) construir e validar o conteúdo do jogo “Save the Shame!”; iii) validar um teste de conhecimentos em SAV que servirá como instrumento de recolha de dados. Neste estudo as competências definidas para o enfermeiro especialista, segundo a Ordem dos Enfermeiros, materializam-se. É nossa expectativa contribuir desta parte com resultados de um trabalho de investigação que devolve à globalidade da organização, respostas e ferramentas para a sua transformação. Conclui-se que o jogo “Save the Shame!”, desenvolvido e validado neste estudo, apresenta-se como uma nova estratégia para o desenvolvimento de conhecimentos em Suporte Avançado de Vida de Enfermeiros e Médicos, no contexto de Medicina Intensiva. Alternate abstract: The synergy between spaces of the hospital organization is a potentiality that emerges in the roaming of operational elements. Knowledge circulates in each individual, who absorbs it in each context and transports it to others, leaving contributions in its wake. The following report is developed in the context of an internship, within the scope of the Masters in Nursing for Persons in Critical Situation, at the University of Minho. It reports the experience in the scope of the acquisition of specialist nurse skills of the person in a critical situation, as well as presents the result of a research work carried out in a clinical context. The research problem arises from the concern with the loss of knowledge that occurs in the spaces between the training and the practice of Advanced Life Support in the context of Intensive Medicine, where these moments are mostly avoided, fulfilling the objective of monitoring effective. Gamification is presented here as a strategy aimed at maintaining knowledge, thus planning the development of a game called “Save the Shame!”, whose impact is intended to be evaluated. The main objective of this study is the evaluation of the impact of the game “Save the Shame!”, in the knowledge in Advanced Life Support, of Nurses and Doctors, in the context of Intensive Medicine. Specific objectives include: i) systematizing the evidence on gamification, based on a narrative review; ii) build and validate the game content “Save the Shame!”; iii) validate a knowledge test in VSS that will serve as a data collection instrument. In this study, the competencies defined for the specialist nurse, according to the Ordem dos Enfermeiros, materialize. It is our expectation to contribute in this part with the results of a research work that gives answers and tools for its transformation to the organization as a whole. It is concluded that the game “Save the Shame!”, developed and validated in this study, presents itself as a new strategy for the development of knowledge in Advanced Life Support for Nurses and Doctors, in the context of Intensive Care.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to find how the turnover of host country nationals (HCNs) would be affected by the knowledge transfer from a headquarter to a subsidiary. Knowledge transfer in a multinational corporation (MNC) has been discussed as a critical factor in the MNC’s success. Because HCNs are essential to synergizing with a new knowledge inflow during this knowledge transfer process, their turnover entails negative consequences such as knowledge loss. Design/methodology/approach: This paper empirically tests the unbalance between knowledge received (KR) and absorptive capacity (AC) as the most critical organizational predictor by using the secondary longitudinal records and survey data of 4,915 employees. Multilevel survival analysis is used to calculate the individuals’ turnover hazard. Findings: While finding that the primary effect of transferred knowledge is to reduce turnover, the study demonstrates the unbalance between a subsidiary’s AC and KR increases the likelihood of HCNs’ turnover within the organization. The authors also recognize the possibility of nonlinear trends of KR and AC on the turnover hazard. Originality/value: The authors answer how knowledge transfer shapes a subsidiary’s work environment to prevent or increase turnover, which has been barely examined for HCNs who comprise the crucial demographic group in knowledge transfer. To enhance the originality further, this study empirically observes the actual turnover of HCNs with a conceptually comprehensive view incorporating both learning and political approaches.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to explore how the lived experience of online communities’ participants makes these communities evolve into online communities of practice (CoPs). Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative research design was used among backpackers. Data on backpackers’ lived experience and interactions were collected. Findings: The results suggest a process of how online communities can become genuine online CoPs, thanks to participants’ lived experience. Their activities (information search, perceived benefits and electronic word-of-mouth) result in knowledge sharing and creation. The findings also emphasize the roles of expertise and offline interactions as process moderators. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses on one specific practice to conduct the research (i.e. backpacking), which limits the generalizability of the results. Practical implications: This study offers several implications for companies and stakeholders. First, it describes how the lived experience transforms online communities into CoPs and helps stakeholders obtain knowledge for customers to innovate. Second, it analyzes the processes of participation, interaction and promotion to share and create knowledge for customers to increase stakeholders’ competitiveness. Third, this study integrates members’ offline interactions by highlighting their potential effects on tacit knowledge loss in online CoPs. Originality/value: The literature posits that online communities may evolve into online CoPs through a three-stage hierarchical path, but the underlying mechanisms and members’ contributions to the process have been largely neglected in the literature.

    "Abstract": "As a major source of employment - 7.523 million or 5.03% of the total employment of the United States - the built environment remains mired in challenges, foremost among them the loss of knowledge as experienced professionals age out of the industry. Mentorship is a potential response to these challenges. Yet there has been relatively little scholarship in this area, especially with respect to the built environment. When literature focusing on mentorship and knowledge management was reviewed, mentees were the focus of 70% of the studies. Even mentor-focused studies often focused on mentees; for example, studies that outline mentor characteristics that benefit mentees. Because knowledge sharing is critical to business continuity and competitiveness, and demographic trends point to plummeting levels of trust in the workplace, mentorship and knowledge sharing are becoming even more critical. Tacit knowledge, which predominates in the built environment, makes mentor-mentee relationships a nexus of interest for the researcher. As such, the constructionist/social constructionist view aligned with the researcher's beliefs and was most suitable to addressing the research question, \"Do mentors in New York City's built environment identify mentorship as an effective means of knowledge sharing?\" and the aim of the study: \"... to explore how to improve mentorship programs as a resource for knowledge sharing in the built environment.\" By using a context-specific, detailed, and comprehensive process, this research garnered individual experiences from a series of one-on-one conversations. Analysis of this data led to a deep understanding of the mentorship process, pursued through iterative, inductive/abductive theory development. Open-ended, semi-structured interviews conducted in familiar settings facilitated a deep understanding of mentors' perspectives with respect to the research question and aims. What emerged was a holistic view of the mentoring experience and its relationship to knowledge sharing, providing a comprehensive and complex answer to the research question: \"Mentorship is an important and effective means of knowledge sharing and retention, but cannot be formulated or forced.\" Strict adherence to ethical principles was in place throughout the study. Validation of the data occurred through a series of strategies focused on researcher, participant, and reviewer, and triangulation via multiple techniques of analyzing the semi-structured interview data was pursued. Additionally, a report was shared with participants to confirm the analysis of the aggregated data. Following these efforts, the study focused on several findings that confirmed mentorship as a means of knowledge sharing as expressed through an explicit and implicit linkage between the two best achieved through informal face-to-face, real time feedback loops during in between moments. As these spontaneous, impromptu conversations are not proactively planned, they are not captured by knowledge management systems. When outside forces, i.e., exogenous shocks, occur, these in between moments lessen or completely disappear as mentors revert to contractions of personal investments. Afterwards, critical success factors to counteract these findings were developed, including instilling champions that support mentoring, educating employees and promoting organizational learning as an overall investment. By cultivating communications and encouraging relationships while pursuing agility in response to exogenous shocks, the study also provided recommendations for mentoring programs that will enhance knowledge sharing. These include generating board-level support and creating strategic plans that change business models and build supportive cultures to motivate correct behaviors in mentors and mentees. Thus, these findings contribute new knowledge valuable to both researchers and professionals in the built environment.",

    "Abstract": "Development of Open Educational eXtended Reality (OEXR) resources was driven by a need to provide anatomy models for faculty and students for whom access to formaldehyde-preserved specimens was challenging or impossible due to medical conditions, pregnancy, and other factors that limited access to the lab and the lessons. The OEXR virtual assets were developed using a process called photogrammetry and were made freely available to students and faculty. The rapid transition to remote instruction in March 2020 increased adoption and utilization of these resources dramatically. This study investigates the implementation of the OEXR library in an anatomy lab setting in Spring 2020, relative to the impact on student motivation to learn, as well as knowledge retention and performance. The experimental research design included measures of OEXR efficacy, student motivation to learn, and user experiences within a lab setting. Student responses indicated that experimental group members were more engaged but less confident in their mastery of the material, which was ultimately contrasted by their overall performance. The results provide an adequate alternative to physical lab resources, which presents an opportunity to leverage OEXR virtual models to supplement physical lab specimens in cases where access is limited or impossible.",

    "Abstract": "Increasingly, basic science educators at medical and health science programs are faced with the challenge of delivering fundamental science content using evidence-based pedagogical approaches that build students' fund of knowledge while also supporting their development as self-regulated learners. This has led to an increased use of active learning-based pedagogies such as flipped classroom teaching. However, there are many open questions about the conditions necessary for successful flipped classroom sessions. In particular, the role of student compliance (i.e., participation, engagement, attendance) in mediating performance needs to be evaluated. This is especially important in accelerated curricula where multiple basic science disciplines are integrated together in pass-fail courses, presenting challenges to both students' time and cognitive load. Data on prematriculation performance, in-class participation, weekly quiz performance, and summative assessment performance from three cohorts of medical students (n = 146) at a new medical school were collected and analyzed. We found that historically high-performing students more readily participated in flipped classroom application sessions compared with historically lower-performing students. Correlational analysis of performance on weekly formative quizzes and the summative course exam was not related to in-class participation. However, performance on weekly formative quizzes played the most significant role in students' performance on summative exams. Efforts to understand the benefits of in-class participation beyond short-term assessment performance, such as long-term knowledge retention or development of noncognitive skills, should be undertaken to justify using such time- and human resource-intensive pedagogies.",

    "Abstract": "The authors of this article examine the potential for increased student learning and retention through more frequent assignments. They conduct a field experiment that investigates whether student knowledge retention can be improved by increasing the frequency of homework assignments, motivating students to have more exposure to the material, and reducing the incentives for students to procrastinate. They find that the impact of the treatment on student performance varies based on the student's past academic performance. Students on the lower end of the academic performance distribution benefit from the structure imposed by more frequent assignments and perform better. However, students with high prior academic performance are harmed by the intervention. The final exam scores of high-performing students are lower in courses with higher assignment frequency.",

    "Abstract": "A significant role in educational assessment is played by measuring behavioural changes based on clearly specified educational objectives and meaningfully interpreting the results. One of the most significant strategies for evaluating a student's learning performance in the classroom is formative assessment. Formative assessment systems concurrently improve the science and art of teaching and learning. Teachers can help the students grow as students by actively hopeful them to self-assess their skills, test their knowledge retention, giving clear commands and providing the necessary feedback to put them on track. This paper aims to demonstrate the various Formative Assessment Tools for Effective Classroom. The conclusions derived from the teaching fields are then merged to produce an incorporated summing with clear implications for effective didactic academic performance. The assessment of students by the teachers has a powerful direct impact on their learning performance, which may be positive and thus be worthy of very attractive and fruitful learning.",

    "Abstract": "A significant number of instructors, researchers and students have claimed that chemistry is a challenging subject to teach and learn at all education levels. Its main learning difficulties are in line with certain sights of its phenomena that are abstract, and some chemistry teachers do not specify what to be learned and assessed in chemistry lesson. The current work investigates the use of formative assessment rubrics for supporting secondary school students' progressive learning in organic chemistry through a technology-based learning project approach in Rwanda. The investigators used a convergent parallel research design, and quantitative data were gathered by distributing questionnaires to the students, and the answers were statistically analyzed. Qualitative data were obtained through observation and interview and were narratively analyzed. The results from this study showed that rubric-based formative assessment supported students' learning of organic chemistry \"via\" technology-based learning approach. This is accredited to the fact that students were motivated while doing their assessment and they were able to do self-assessment by applying the provided rubrics \"via\" technology. The students understood instructors' expectations, encouraged their learning, sharpened their technology skills, and their knowledge retention was also increased. The instructors were able to grade the students' tasks fast with the help of an analytic rubric and good formative feedback was availed to students on time. The instructors were also able to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of the learners and give them quick formative feedback.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Evidence indicates that tailored educational resources such as e-Bug in schools can improve students' knowledge of infection prevention. This study aimed to (1) understand the feasibility of using soap use data as a proxy for measuring student handwashing behaviours and (2) refine a study method that could be implemented by local authorities and schools to assess impact as a result of the implementation of e-Bug. Design: A stepped-wedge design was employed, and 10 primary schools were randomly assigned to groups where teachers were trained to use e-Bug, either in July 2019 (early intervention group) or in January 2020 (late intervention group). Pre/post student knowledge-retention questionnaire data and soap use measurements were collected from all schools before and after the early group teachers used e-Bug. The sample included 16 soap use measures, 561 students in the early group and 601 students in the late group. Statistical analysis involved single/multivariable mixed-effects linear and logistic regression. Setting: A local authority in England. Results: In 15-18 questions, there was a significant relationship between training and students answering questions about microbes, hand/respiratory hygiene and antibiotic use/resistance correctly (degree of change varied). There was not enough power to comment on the relationship between the intervention and soap use. Conclusion: This study informs the feasibility of cluster, randomised, controlled trials in educational settings to measure the impact of educational resources. It can be used to inform future studies and highlights the need to ensure adequate sample size to estimate soap use and improve the measurement accuracy of data collection tools.",

    "Abstract": "Agritourism is a type of ecological tourism that combines agricultural activities with tourism. There is a growing interest in this industry worldwide, which poses both opportunities and challenges for social and natural environments. Grounded on the theory of situated learning, we developed an augmented reality-based educational resource to promote eco-agritourism -- namely, to promote agritourism while encouraging tourists to be environmentally responsible. This study presents the results of an educational experiment that compared the scores of students who were instructed using a combination of the augmented reality-based educational resource and the professor's guidance with those of students who were instructed only by the professor. The study analyzed the learning outcomes and the degree of users' motivation to learn about aquaponics in an agritourism farm. The participants were 40 volunteers who had no previous knowledge about aquaponics. The results show that the resource has a medium effect size on learning gains and a large effect on knowledge retention. Likewise, the data indicates that the resource increased users' motivation to learn and practice responsible agritourism. These results seem to indicate that augmented reality-based resources are appropriate for promoting eco-agritourism and encourage tourists to develop a positive bond with nature.",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the use of formative assessment rubrics for supporting the learning of organic chemistry in secondary schools in Rwanda. A mixed research approach was used to collect and analyze data. The target population was 210 senior five chemistry students and 15 chemistry teachers. However, 140 senior five chemistry students and 10 senior five chemistry teachers were purposively selected to participate in the study. The qualitative data were obtained from the interview while quantitative data were obtained from the survey questionnaire. The qualitative data were analyzed by discourse and interpretive approaches while quantitative data were checked by descriptive statistics. The results of this study showed that from rubric formative assessment, students understood instructors' expectations and encouraged individual learning. The students' knowledge retention was also increased. The instructors mentioned that they were able to grade the students' tasks fast with the help of an analytic rubric and good formative feedback was availed to students on time. The students were satisfied with the use of the formative assessment rubric and they affirmed that they were motivated and engaged in learning organic chemistry. It was recommended that chemistry teachers should use rubrics during formative assessment in organic chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "The current study investigated the relations between gamified refutations of COVID-19 misconceptions and individuals' emotional reactions and knowledge retention within a large-scale public health education campaign. Refutations have a substantial body of evidence supporting their use to correct misconceptions, yet reduced efficacy has been observed for some topics that generate negative emotional responses. We tested whether gamification could mitigate these limits given that it capitalizes on positive affective engagement. From May to December 2020, approximately 200,000 individuals were recruited from social media in Canada to engage with a nongame interactive survey as a control or a fully gamified platform focused on correcting COVID-19 misconceptions. Gamification was associated with a greater number of happiness and anxiety responses and fewer responses of anger and skepticism in reaction to having misconceptions corrected by refutations. Further, participants who engaged with gamified refutations retained correct information after a brief period. Finally, happiness and anxiety were positively associated with and anger and skepticism were negatively associated with retention of refutation information and support for related public health policies. Implications for scaling up and reinforcing the benefits of refutations for public engagement with science are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This paper presents an educational virtual reality (VR) game and experiments with different methods of including it into the teaching process. The purpose of this research study is to discover if immersive VR games can be used as an effective pedagogical tool if blended with traditional lectures by assisting learning gain, memory and knowledge retention while increasing edutainment value. Design/methodology/approach: This research design comprises three different methods of learning: lecture-based involving lecture slides, infographics, and a video, game-based involving an immersive VR game of oil rig exploration, and the combination of lecture and game-based. Participants of each method filled up a questionnaire before and after participation to measure the learning gain, memory, and knowledge retention. Findings: From the predominant findings of the study, the combined method demonstrated a significant increase in learning gain, memory, and knowledge retention and maybe a potentially suitable pedagogical tool. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the study include findings based on one VR game with a specific educational topic, additionally, it is suspected that having different participants for each of the three methods may have slightly affected the results, albeit to a limited extent. Practical implications: Findings of this study will provide evidence that VR games can be used alongside traditional lectures to aid in the learning process. Educators can choose to include VR games into their curriculums to improve the educational delivery process. Originality/value: This research contributes to ways of incorporating VR games into educational curriculums through findings of this study highlighting the combination of VR games with lectures.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Approaches to learning have the ability to influence knowledge acquisition, comprehension, retention and even motivation to learn. Previous work indicates that despite age, experience, or prior knowledge, students have a tendency to approach learning differently as a function of the presented content. The purpose of this study is to explore how context influences student approaches to learning science. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt a question-asking methodology to evaluate if approaches to learning the same science content vary when presented within the context of Pure Science or the History of Science. Findings: Results indicate that contextualizing the presentation of science content, shifts the approaches students take in attempting to learn science content as evidenced by the questions they ask to deepen their understanding. Additional variables of prior experience with each scientific concept, task persistence at a distractor task and later recall of the presented concepts were related to different inquiry strategies. Research limitations/implications: Implications for instructional design and pedagogy are discussed. Practical implications: The framework in which scientific information is presented may impact how students modify existing and create a new schema, impacting their beliefs about scientific knowledge and the way in which students question, hypothesize and engage within the domain of science. Social implications: By studying the role of inquiry while students engage in science learning, the authors explore the role of context, content and knowledge retention. Originality/value: The current study probes at the nature of student questioning and its reliance on the content, context and its relationship to outcome variables such as learning and, perhaps, even persistence as it relates to students' prior knowledge within content areas which may, in turn, lead to varying levels of student self-efficacy.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the effectiveness and knowledge retention of elearning models that could solve education problems in rural areas by considering two different examples: massive online open courses (MOOCs) and gamification hybrid learning. The study also proposes suitable and effective features that could influence student abilities in the context of language and science learning in rural areas. Data were collected from 283 students using field testing methods at rural schools in Thailand's Chaiyaphum province. One hundred and sixty students (13-16 years old) in secondary-school grades 7-10 were randomly selected for MOOC-based hybrid learning, and 123 students participated in gamification hybrid learning. The methodology featured two distinct steps. First, content and pattern examinations were conducted to verify the validity, reliability, and consistency of the content. Second, the sample group was tested to indicate and compare the efficiency of the models and the knowledge retention it then produced. Given the approach's quantitative nature, dependent sample t-tests were conducted to indicate differences in pretest and posttest mean scores, with Cohen's d effect size testing used to analyze subsequent effects. The results reveal that both MOOCs and gamification hybrid learning models are effective and suited to solving rural education problems. Both models improved student learning retention compared to traditional elearning models. Nonetheless, focus groups, peer tutoring, forum discussions, and group activities also significantly influenced learning. The study's findings could also benefit course instructors and program designers to help them create appropriate content using a well-designed framework, which could increase accountability and effectiveness and support class demand.",

It may be used as a stand-alone educational tool, as a primer to other instructional methods (eg, simulation, flipped classroom setting, or case discussions), or a just-in-time training tool.A small-scale study was performed to quantify the efficacy of this module as an educational tool. The learner group was comprised of a convenience sample of third-year medical students in the midst of their core clinical clerkships. All third-year students were eligible to participate, regardless of which core clerkship they were currently engaged in. Third-year students were contacted via email regarding participation. Participation was completely optional - no incentive was offered, and students were informed that participation would not in any way affect their clerkship grades. For these reasons, an Instructional Review Board review was not necessary. Ten third-year medical students volunteered to participate. In the course of a single, hour-long session, learners were administered the attached assessment form as a pre-test, shown the video module, and then asked to immediately retake the assessment as a post-test to assess for improvement. Assessments were graded on a 17-point scale, according to the attached answer key. Learners were also given the opportunity to provide subjective feedback on the quality of the module as an educational tool.

The efficacy of dyad learning has been tested in medical education contexts, such as in medical simulation. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that has evaluated the efficacy of dyad learning in a medical simulation context. Methods:  PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library databases were searched in September 2021 and January 2022. Prospective studies of randomized design that compared dyad learning to a single medical student or physician learning in a medical simulation were included.

The methodological quality of these studies was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). The Kirkpatrick model was used to conceptualize study outcomes. Results: The identified papers included eight studies from four countries that totaled 475 participants. Students reported positively on their experiences as dyads, especially regarding the social aspects of it. Studies showed non-inferior learning outcomes for dyads. As most studies were one or two days long, there is limited evidence that this non-inferiority extends to longer term training modules. There is some evidence to suggest that dyad learning outcomes may be replicable in a clinical context following simulation training. Conclusions: Dyad learning in medical simulation is a pleasant experience for students and may be as effective as conventional learning. These findings set the foundation for future studies of longer duration, which is needed to determine the efficacy of dyad learning in lengthier curriculums and long-term knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "Inadequate recognition and treatment of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) pose as a major liability to providers, as EPS can be life-threatening to patients, as they develop into metabolic syndrome, tardive dyskinesia (TD), or even death. Thus, insufficient usage of AIMS testing can negatively impact providers’ ability to meet associated care practice standards, when treating psychotic patients with antipsychotic medications. As a result, an evidence-based practice, quasi-experimental project was completed, utilizing the Iowa Model Revised: Evidence-Based Practice to Promote Excellence in Healthcare. In alignment with this version of the revised Iowa Model, a pilot study was initiated to progress toward a formal practice change. This process was experimental in construct and execution. In this project, a group of novice Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioners, who recently gained employment with iCare and Associates, LLC, were assessed on their baseline knowledge pertaining to Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) testing, using a pretest examination. Each Nurse Practitioner was then provided formal AIMS testing-specific education, in the form of a lecture, handout materials, as well as a teach back-style question-and-answer period before a post-test examination was administered to test their knowledge retention. Upon competition of the education and post-test, a six-week study period was conducted to record and compare the number of AIMS testing documentation occurrences, per provider, as compared with the number of potential documentation occurrences. All documentation occurred within the Electronic Health Record (EHR) system of the organization. Based on statistical analyses, using paired t-testing, research findings indicated a match or increase in the number of AIMS testing and documentation occurrences of Nurse Practitioners post-educational intervention, as compared to the potential calculated number of occurrences possible.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether and how a high turnover rate stimulates employees to engage more in learning behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on self-regulation theory, the authors suggest that the motive for employees to engage in learning behavior is to improve themselves. Such a need can be activated when they reflect on themselves and realize the discrepancy between their current selves and desired future selves. The authors argue that the employees’ perceived poor performance at daily work may induce their desire for self-improvement via making the future work selves salient, and in turn engage more in learning behavior. This is particularly so when turnover rate is high because employees may be alert of and concerned more about their own poor performance. In an experience sampling study, the authors obtained evidence for these hypotheses. Findings: When turnover rate was high, employees’ poor performance increased salience of future work selves, which in turn facilitated their learning behavior. This relationship was not significant when turnover rate was low. Originality/value: Contrary to the typical view that high turnover rate leads to knowledge loss for the companies, the present study findings suggest that it could also serve as a motivational factor facilitating employees’ learning behavior, which is an important way to increase knowledge pool of the companies.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: As older adults are increasingly active in virtual communities (VCs), these platforms for knowledge exchange present opportunities for companies to use elder human capital. The purpose of this study is to understand the antecedent factors that motivate older adults’ knowledge contribution and knowledge seeking (KS) behaviors in VCs. Design/methodology/approach: Rooted in socio-emotional selectivity and social cognitive theories, this study included five key variables and developed models for older adults’ knowledge contributing (KC)/KS behaviors. This paper tested the hypotheses using data from a sample of 204 older adults in 3 VCs in China. Findings: The results provide support for most of the hypotheses and show that while other members’ participation (MP) acts as a substitute for meaning in life and attitude toward aging, it acts as a complement for outcome expectations (OE) focused on others and OE focused on oneself in their impacts on KC/KS activities. Practical implications: The study provides practical insights for developing elder human resources via VCs to avoid knowledge loss. Originality/value: This study described older adults’ unique characteristics when modeling their information and communication technologies-related behaviors and built two models to explain their KC/KS behaviors. It confirmed that the same factor has different levels of impact on older adults’ KC/KS behaviors in VCs. In addition, it confirmed and reinforced the complementary and substitutive effects of other MP as an environmental factor on these behaviors.

    "Abstract": "Research background: Business organizations are open to information and knowledge fluxes crossing their borders from inside out and from outside inside. Also, organizational knowledge may have an internal generation of knowledge, and knowledge sinks. Understanding this organizational knowledge dynamics provides a new perspective on knowledge vulnerabilities and risks. Taking advantage of this perspective, the paper presents a new ontology of knowledge risks contributing this way to the extant literature dedicated to knowledge risks. Purpose of the article: The purpose of the paper is to present a new ontology of knowledge risks based on organizational knowledge dynamics. Methods: The method is based on a conceptual framework of organizational knowledge dynamics (OKD) and on a semantic literature review. The knowledge gap addressed by this research is between the spectrum of knowledge risks and organizational knowledge dynamics. Some of the main types of knowledge risks in the literature are knowledge loss, knowledge leakage, knowledge waste, and knowledge spillover. The research design is based on a literature review, followed by a theoretical proposal of a new classification for knowledge risks, which is also our answer to bridging the knowledge gap. Our methodological approach for analyzing the knowledge risks used key expressions and focused on some key authors. Findings & Value added: The main findings are intended to complete the gaps in the previous knowledge risk categories by using a criteria-based approach for defining a comprehensive classification.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Implementation scientists are identifying evidence-based implementation strategies that support the uptake of evidence-based practices and other clinical innovations. However, there is limited information regarding the development of training methods to educate implementation practitioners on the use of implementation strategies and help them sustain these competencies. Methods: To address this need, we developed, implemented, and evaluated a training program for one strategy, implementation facilitation (IF), that was designed to maximize applicability in diverse clinical settings. Trainees included implementation practitioners, clinical managers, and researchers. From May 2017 to July 2019, we sent trainees an electronic survey via email and asked them to complete the survey at three-time points: approximately 2 weeks before and 2 weeks and 6 months after each training. Participants ranked their knowledge of and confidence in applying IF skills using a 4-point Likert scale. We compared scores at baseline to post-training and at 6 months, as well as post-training to 6 months post-training (nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests). Results: Of the 102 participants (76 in-person, 26 virtual), there was an increase in perceived knowledge and confidence in applying IF skills across all learning objectives from pre- to post-training (95% response rate) and pre- to 6-month (35% response rate) follow-up. There was no significant difference in results between virtual and in-person trainees. When comparing post-training to 6 months (30% response rate), perceptions of knowledge increase remained unchanged, although participants reported reduced perceived confidence in applying IF skills for half of the learning objectives at 6 months. Conclusions: Findings indicated that we have developed a promising IF training program. Lack of differences in results between virtual and in-person participants indicated the training can be provided to a remote site without loss of knowledge/skills transfer but ongoing support may be needed to help sustain perceived confidence in applying these skills.Background: Implementation scientists are identifying evidence-based implementation strategies that support the uptake of evidence-based practices and other clinical innovations.

    "Abstract": "South African engineering organisations face the challenge of a high turnover of engineers; hence the engineering sector needs to pay special attention to turnover intention to control the actual employee turnover. When there is employee turnover, organisations incur considerable costs such as the financial costs of finding and replacing the employees who would have left and recruiting and training new employees. The loss of knowledge and expertise acquired over an extended period also negatively impacts on organisations, particularly in the engineering industry with a shortage of skilled labour. Despite prior empirical studies from researchers on transformational leadership, work engagement and turnover intention, there is very limited research conducted in the South African engineering industry. This study examined the moderating effect of transformational leadership in the relationship between work engagement and turnover intention in a South African engineering organisation. The study used a non-experimental quantitative research approach, while the population comprised a non-probability sampling (N=124) permanently employed engineers in a South African engineering organisation. Hierarchical moderator regression analysis was used to determine the effect of transformational leadership in the relationship between work engagement and turnover intention. The results revealed a significant relationship between transformational leadership, work engagement and turnover intention. Furthermore, the results showed that transformational leadership (idealised influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualised consideration) variables acted as moderators in the relationship between work engagement (vigour and dedication) variables and turnover intention. These findings add value to leadership development and human resource management field. Organisational leaders who portray idealised influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualised consideration, will enhance employee’s dedication and enthusiasm.",

    "Abstract": "The role of anatomy in modern curricula is under reform due to competency of other rapidly evolving subjects and the rapid evolution of several practical aspects and applications dictating modernization of teaching methods as well as of teaching demands. Moreover, modern practice of medicine has put the arterial and vascular system in the center of numerous minimally invasive techniques. Therefore, regardless of their specialty, most doctors should have a very clear and precise knowledge of the vascular anatomy and the basic access techniques from the early years. This viewpoint commentary reflects the experience of the two authors in applying the principles and content of surgical vascular anatomy in undergraduate anatomy teaching and discusses the rationale of this. Moreover, it is suggested that cadaveric dissections should be modified with emphasis on standard surgical vascular exposures and the multidisciplinary teaching of vascular anatomy as a means not only to gain optimal long‐term knowledge retention, but also to emphasize through realistic examples on the practical clinical value of vascular anatomy.

Securing this weak point is essential and this can be done through investment into workplace training. The current basic training methods have many issues that discourage the retention of the information learnt during the training. An example of one such issue is the level of engagement that the basic cyber security training provides the non-experienced participants. Low engagement means inefficient knowledge transfer and retention. This paper presents the results of a study aimed at improving cyber security knowledge retention of participants through the use of a conceptual physical card game that could be developed into an e-learning resource. This paper will document the preliminary research, design process and evaluation of the game.",

The execution of these projects is mainly supported by DS process models such as CRISP-DM. As a high percentage of DS undertakings are failing, revisions to current DS project management practices become necessary. Amongst others, ensuring traceability, reproducibility, and knowledge retention across the project present important success factors in DS projects. Some of the DS process models feature documentation artifacts for this purpose but not comprehensively for the complete DS lifecycle.

    "Abstract": "The dissertation covers the functional difficulties surrounding the tacit knowledge loss occurring as the baby boomer generation exits the governmental workforce of Lea County and other rural New Mexico counties. Ten thousand baby boomers reach their retirement age daily, leaving a knowledge gap in public and private entities that must be managed. Counties in New Mexico, such as Lea County, have few qualified workers who can replace the retiring baby boomers. This issue is partly due to the limited resources and unqualified workers in the rural areas of New Mexico and the insufficient preparedness to replace the retiring workforce (Beckett, 2017; Ejakpomewhe, 2017; Lea County, 2016; Lea County, New Mexico, 2019; United States Department of Agriculture, 2019). The qualitative phenomenological dissertations data were collected using a holistic approach interview method. The interview process' foundation was based on the self-determination theory written by Flannery (2017) and the dimensional model surrounding tacit knowledge and knowledge transfer written by Meyer & Sugiyama (2007). The interview data was collected and analyzed using a triangulation method of having multiple rural county leaders in New Mexico of varying age groups and recent employment experiences with the research topic a leader with any past experiences or lived experiences with the research topic (Creswell, J. W., & Creswell, J. D. (2018); Fink, 2000; Flannery, 2017; Meyer & Sugiyama, 2007). The dissertation found five themes affecting the interview county leadership: generational work ethics and values, working knowledge, retaining knowledge, learning curve, and limited resources . The differences in generations in the rural government offices are creating difficulties in the different age group's ability to bridge the different values held by each generation. They are causing the valued working knowledge held by older generations to be insufficiently transferred to the next generation. The inability to adequately transfer knowledge creates knowledge retention deficiencies. The deficiencies created by the lack of knowledge retention creates a steep learning curve for many individuals filling vacant positions in the county. The limited resources only heighten the previously mentioned difficulties in rural counties. As the final baby boomers and initial Gen X employees begin to exit the workforce, county leadership must implement a strategy to capture their tacit knowledge. The lessons these generations have learned over their career benefit the function of the county and relearning those lessons is due to knowledge loss. Capturing as much knowledge from not only the retiring individuals but as many county workers as possible will only benefit the county's abilities in the future",

    "Abstract": "The topic of this research is the examination of the effectiveness of Virtual Reality (VR) training compared to traditional training methods. The research methodology used a systematic review to compare traditional and VR training methods in the workplace. The systematic review used 12 articles from 2013 thru 2021, and the two main criteria for the article selection included pretest/posttest design and workplace training. The keywords used to narrow the search were virtual reality, knowledge acquisition, workers, workplace, pretest, and posttest. Four themes identified using thematic analysis were increased knowledge acquisition, better knowledge retention, higher knowledge transference, and cost advantages/disadvantages. Although there were instances when the traditional method resulted in better training outcomes, overall, VR training resulted in better training outcomes. The systematic review findings also showed that VR training is not a one-size-fits-all and may not be suitable depending on circumstances. Organizations should conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine if VR training is the right choice for their organizational needs.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This paper poses to discuss and examine the concern of unmonitored and excessive internet use by school-age children, ages eight years to 11 years old, along with the importance of employing a Family Media Use Plan, which is recommended by the American Family of Pediatrics (AAP). This issue, although not often studied, is a common occurrence today and is associated with physical and mental health concerns for this vulnerable population. Method: This quality improvement project was accomplished through educating and surveying the parent population of the Intermediate building of a rural, Southeast Missouri Public School District. The involved parent population completed a pre-education Qualtrics survey, reviewed an education module, then completed an immediate post-education and 3-month post-education Qualtrics survey. Following the completion of the education module and Qualtrics surveys by the parent population survey data was collected and analyzed utilizing paired t-tests which were completed through the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 29.0. Results: The resulting data of comparing the pre-education survey and the immediate post-education survey did offer statistical significance in parental knowledge gain demonstrated by a p value of .018 attained through a paired t-test. Further completion of paired t-testing regarding use and awareness of the Family Media Use Plan, as well as parental knowledge retention, also resulted in findings that are statistically significant as noted by p-values. Conclusion: This quality improvement project resulted in findings that support continual and increased involvement of parents in monitoring of their school age child/children’s daily internet use. Changes noted in the pre vs. immediate post education survey were found to be statistically significance, and all result findings are clinically significant in the school-age child’s overall health and well-being.",

    "Abstract": "Digital educational games have been a part of the educational landscape since the early 1970s. Since then, there has been a proliferation in the quantity, format, type, and quality of digital educational games available to classroom teachers. Despite this, the body of literature surrounding the effectiveness of these digital educational games remains highly fragmented and lacks unifying themes. While some literature exists to support the use of digital educational games in immediate knowledge acquisition, little research has been done on how digital educational games impact the retention of knowledge in the long term. As such, this study examines how the use of a digital educational game impacts both immediate knowledge acquisition and the retention of that knowledge long-term. Outcomes of a digital educational game are compared to outcomes of hands-on instruction in the context of genetics content delivered in a high school biology course. Secondary analysis of an existing data set serves to determine if a digital educational game provides increased knowledge acquisition immediately after instruction when compared to hands-on instructional activities. Additionally, the investigation determines if a digital educational game provides increased knowledge retention thirty days post instruction when compared to hands-on instructional activities. The examination and analysis of the data, which includes pre-test, immediate post-test, and long-term post-test assessment scores was be conducted. The findings from this study help to advance the understanding of the value of digital educational games and their appropriate implementation in science classrooms.",

Many prior studies have explored the potential benefits and challenges to integrating emerging technologies into educational practices. Both internal and external factors may impact the overall adoption of the technology, however there are key benefits identified for the schema building process, which is important for knowledge acquisition. This study aims to elaborate and expand upon prior studies to explore the question does mobile augmented reality provide for stronger knowledge retention compared to other training and education modalities? To address this question this study takes a comparative experimental approach by exposing participants to one of three training modalities (AR, paper manual, or online video) and evaluating their knowledge retention and other educational outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to measure provider level of knowledge, provider level of knowledge retention, and to identify barriers regarding smoking behaviors and treatment considerations for those who are prescribed clozapine and olanzapine at Bayless Integrated Health. Background: Smoking rates remain high among those with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Many psychiatric providers do not routinely screen for smoking behaviors due to limited knowledge, confidence, training, and other barriers. The impact of smoking on pharmacological intervention for these disorders is drastic, with cigarette smoke polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons inducing the CYP1A2 enzyme leading to a significant reduction in plasma concentrations for those prescribed clozapine and olanzapine. Smoking is also implicated in an increase in inflammation and c-reactive protein levels associated with decreased clinical stabilization. The literature recognizes that nicotine replacement therapies and behavioral interventions are effective ways to increase smoking cessation as a treatment consideration. Methods: The design procedure used for this project was a pretest and posttest. The Plan-Do- Study-Act model was used for implementation. The setting occurred at Bayless and included (N=39) employed psychiatrists, psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. An introductory email was sent providing disclosure and consent for participation two weeks prior to implementation. A second email was sent one week before implementation. Implementation began after sending the third email and remained open for five days. A fourth email was sent to remind of a follow-up posttest. The second implementation began after the fifth email was sent and remained open for five days. Results: The first implementation pretest included (n=10), while the following posttest included (n=6). The second implementation posttest included (n=3). The results identified confidence and knowledge as areas of improvement that increased after delivering the educational presentation, while knowledge retention decreased. Conclusion: While the results indicate that the educational intervention increased provider confidence and knowledge, the study was limited by the small sample size. The study revealed that providers report lacking sufficient time along with other barriers to properly screen and recommend appropriate treatment adjustments for smoking patients. Additional research is recommended, along with utilizing the smoking cessation resources provided.",

    "Abstract": "The three-circle model of agricultural education focuses on the importance of in-class instruction, supervised agricultural experiences, and FFA involvement. The agricultural communications career pathway is available to students through agricultural communications supervised agricultural experiences (SAE) programs and career development events within FFA. However, specific curriculum that teaches agricultural communications in the classroom is not readily available. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to examine the interdisciplinary lesson planning and integration process of pre-service teachers with focus on opportunities and limitations to teaching communication in the agriculture, food, and natural resources (AFNR) curriculum. In this case study, four pre-service teachers worked with agricultural communications faculty to develop communication curricula and lesson plans to be incorporated into high school AFNR classrooms. These pre-service teachers developed interdisciplinary lessons prior to student teaching and, when appropriate, used these lessons in their classrooms. While current research regarding teaching science in the AFNR curriculum is ongoing, the literature is silent regarding teaching social sciences such as communication in the AFNR curriculum. These pre-service teachers want more opportunities to develop interdisciplinary lessons. They believe teaching communication skills while tying them to the content area can improve student knowledge, retention, and engagement in the learning process while exposing them to the agricultural communications career pathway.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This quality improvement project aimed to impact participants’ knowledge, knowledge retention, and confidence levels about yoga as a complementary treatment option for adolescents with depression. Background: The American Psychiatric Association identifies depression as an episode of depressed mood or anhedonia lasting at least two weeks in which appetite, sleep, energy, and concentration can be affected, causing significant functional impairment. Calming yogic techniques’ psychological and physical effects can promote self-discipline, sensory withdrawal, relaxation, and emotional regulation helpful for adolescents with depression. Methods: This quality improvement utilized a quantitative approach to measure knowledge and confidence levels using a pretest and posttest questionnaire followed by a posttest four weeks later to measure knowledge retention and confidence. The online surveys contained open-ended questions for providers to identify barriers to referrals and their perceived utility of the presentation. Results: A total of 15 participants between 18 and 45 years old were recruited from the monthly staff meeting and completed all three surveys. Pretests and posttests showed an overall improvement in knowledge following the educational session. Additionally, the subsequent posttest administered at the following monthly meeting showed no statistically significant change in knowledge compared to the initial posttest. Outcomes also show that the participants’ confidence level in the benefits of yoga significantly increased after the informational PowerPoint presentation. Conclusions: Data analysis from the results of this QI project supports the implementation of education to improve their overall knowledge about the benefits of yoga for adolescents with depression. The statistically significant increase in survey scores and self-reported confidence levels may indicate that educational sessions can improve provider knowledge, long-term knowledge, and confidence",

However, assigning reviewing tasks to team members is challenging, particularly in large projects. Code reviewer recommendation has been proposed to assist with this challenge. Traditionally, the performance of reviewer recommenders has been derived based on historical data, where better solutions are those that recommend exactly which reviewers actually performed tasks in the past. More recent work expands the goals of recommenders to include mitigating turnover-based knowledge loss and avoiding overburdening the core development team. In this paper, we set out to explore how reviewer recommendation can incorporate the risk of defect proneness. To this end, we propose the Changeset Safety Ratio (CSR) – an evaluation measurement designed to capture the risk of defect proneness. Through an empirical study of three open source projects, we observe that: (1) existing approaches tend to improve one or two quantities of interest, such as core developers workload while degrading others (especially the CSR); (2) Risk Aware Recommender (RAR) – our proposed enhancement to multi-objective reviewer recommendation – achieves a 12.48% increase in expertise of review assignees and a 80% increase in CSR with respect to historical assignees, all while reducing the files at risk of knowledge loss by 19.39% and imposing a negligible 0.93% increase in workload for the core team; and (3) our dynamic method outperforms static and normalization-based tuning methods in adapting RAR to suit risk-averse and balanced risk usage scenarios to a significant degree (Conover's test, α",

In developed countries people use mobile technology (smartphones or tablets) every day. This fact is reflected in education where mobile technology has become a widely used digital tool. Much of the existing research has focused on the relationship between mobile technology and knowledge acquisition, specifically the effect mobile technology has on knowledge retention, students' imagination and motivation or the comprehensibility of the subject matter. Considering the scope of the existing studies, a question arises as to how mobile technology helps improve key competencies. Key competencies form the basis of modern education, and their development prepares the students for their professional and social life. Communicative competence is one of the main key competencies. The paper presents the design of a research project aimed at determining the effect of the targeted use of mobile technology on the development of students' communicative competence. The first part of the paper introduces the topic and provides theoretical background on key competencies and mobile technology in education. The next part of the paper focuses on the research outcomes. Research will be conducted through an educational experiment where the authors will be comparing the control and experimental group outputs. The control group will be developing its communicative competence through activities that have already been used in class. On the other hand, the experimental group will be using alternative methods where mobile technology plays a key role in developing communicative competence. In this paper the authors define the research questions, research objective and research hypotheses. It also focuses on the target group and the research time frame. Furthermore, the authors introduce the research tools that will be used to determine the level of students' communicative competence. The third chapter focuses on proposed activities for the control and experimental groups.

In this paper, we present a user study that investigates user retention of mobile AR in cultural heritage learning. We developed a mobile AR application that allows users to observe 3D models of museum arti-facts and learn about their culture and history. Participants achieved a knowledge retention rate of 78.21%, indicating the positive effects of mobile AR on cultural heritage learning. We performed a structural equation modeling analysis (N=50) to investigate the effects of usability, satisfaction, emotional attachment, focus of attention, and flow experience on user retention of mobile AR. The analysis results confirmed that user satisfaction and flow experience positively affect user retention. Usability and focus of attention contribute positively to user satisfaction and flow experience respectively.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose. This quality improvement project aimed to improve the knowledge, retention of information, and to increase the satisfaction of education delivery to frontline staff in a large acute care hospital system by using staff Registered Nurse Unit Education Champions (RN UECs) to deliver biweekly education. Background. Current processes for healthcare clinicians to obtain information and education needed for daily practices are not adequate to keep up with the rapidly expanding growth in knowledge. For RNs working in acute care hospitals, this often means that knowledge gaps continue to broaden and may affect the quality-of-care patients receive, especially those with complex medical problems. It is suggested that when there are opportunities to integrate learned information into practice, nurses’ critical thinking and clinical judgment develop quickly. The RN UEC model explores the ability to improve the knowledge and retention of information of nurses by receiving education while they are on shift which allows them to integrate their new knowledge immediately. Methods. The pilot used the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) approach and implemented the RN UEC model in four nursing units with similar patient populations. The education was delivered after a pretest survey was given to establish baseline knowledge of the topic and to evaluate their satisfaction with the current education delivery method. Two posttest surveys were given, one immediately after the education was delivered and the other one to four weeks after the education was completed. These posttest surveys contained the same questions. Results. There was an immediate improvement in knowledge after the delivery of education and while there was a decline in the long-term retention of the information, there continued to be an overall improvement of knowledge from baseline. Additionally, there was improved satisfaction from the frontline staff with the RN UEC model for education delivery. Conclusion. It has been established through this project that the use of the RN UEC model is an effective way to deliver education for the improvement of knowledge and retention of information in a highly satisfying way for the frontline nursing staff.",

    "Abstract": "Rabies is one of the most important zoonotic diseases that mostly affect children. We conducted a rabies education among 129 secondary school children (intervention group = 94 students, control group = 35 students) in two schools in southeast Bhutan and evaluated the effectiveness of the lesson by comparing the knowledge, perception and safety behaviour score about rabies before and after education. We also assessed the knowledge retention capacity of the students at three months post intervention. Our findings indicated that short rabies lesson significantly (P<0.001) improved the mean knowledge score from 19.98(±2.72) to 26.96(±2.24) in the intervention group. Similarly, mean scores for perception and safety behaviour improved significantly (P<0.001) from 10.77 (±1.89) to 13.95 (±1.36) and 9.809 (±1.85) to 12.97 (±1.54), respectively. Although the scores have reduced significantly (P<0.001) at three months post intervention, most of the rabies information was largely retained by the students. In control group, significant increase in mean scores were also observed for perception from 10.17 (±2.38) to 11.2 (±2.44) and safety behaviour from 9.14(±1.44) to 10.74 (±1.95) after 3 months of education. The finding demonstrate that a short rabies lesson is effective in improving knowledge, perceptions and understanding of dog bites safety behaviour among the school children. However, there is a need for a frequent awareness program, at least quarterly or half yearly. Rabies education should focus on critical points such as dog bites being the main source of rabies and the importance washing a dog/animal bite wound with soap and water, and visiting the hospital for medical advice following animal bites.Rabies is one of the most important zoonotic diseases that mostly affect children.

    "Abstract": "This research proposes a novel strategy for constructing a knowledge-based recommender system (RS) based on both structured data and unstructured text data. We present its application to improve the services of heavy equipment repair companies to better adjust to their customers’ needs. The ultimate outcome of this work is a visualized web-based interactive recommendation dashboard that shows options that are predicted to improve the customer loyalty metric, known as Net Promoter Score (NPS). We also present a number of techniques aiming to improve the performance of action rule mining by allowing to have convenient periodic updates of the system’s knowledge base. We describe the preprocessing-based and distributed-processing-based method and present the results of testing them for performance within the RS framework. The proposed modifications for the actionable knowledge miner were implemented and compared with the original method in terms of the mining results/times and generated recommendations. Preprocessing-based methods decreased mining by 10–20×, while distributed mining implementation decreased mining timesby 300–400×, with negligible knowledge loss. The article concludes with the future directions for the scalability of the NPS recommender system and remaining challenges in its big data processing.",

    "Abstract": "The rapidly declining biosphere integrity, representing one of the core planetary boundaries, is alarming. In particular, the global numbers of mammals, birds, fishes, and plants declined by 68% from 1970 to 2016. One of the most widely accepted measures to halt the rate of biodiversity loss is to maintain and expand protected areas that are effectively managed. However, doing so requires substantial finance derived from nature-based tourism, specifically visitors from urban areas. Using the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) for conducting analysis on 535 Vietnamese urban residents, the current study examined how their biodiversity loss perceptions can affect their willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation in protected areas. We found that perceived environmental degradation, loss of economic growth, loss of nature-based recreation opportunities, and loss of knowledge as consequences of biodiversity loss indirectly affect the willingness to pay through the mediation of the attitude towards conservation. Notably, perceived knowledge loss also has a direct positive influence on the willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation. In contrast, perceived loss of health is negatively associated with the attitude towards conservation. Based on these findings, we suggest that building an eco-surplus culture among urban residents by stimulating their subjective cost-benefit judgments towards biodiversity loss can be a promising way to generate more finance from nature-based tourism for conservation in protected areas and ease the domestic government's and international organizations' funding allocation problems. Eco-surplus culture is a set of pro-environmental attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors shared by a group of people to reduce negative anthropogenic impacts on the environment and conserve and restore nature.The rapidly declining biosphere integrity, representing one of the core planetary boundaries, is alarming.

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2022 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Conference Start Date: 2022, Oct. 8 Conference End Date: 2022, Oct. 11 Conference Location: Uppsala, Sweden This Work-in-Progress Research paper focuses on digital game-based learning (DGBL), which refers to the use of a virtual environment to support students’ learning. In this exploratory study, we examine how students engage with GeoExplorer, a digital game-based learning environment that simulates Cone-Penetration Testing (CPT), an on-site test used in geotechnical engineering to investigate soil properties that students typically don’t have access to. In GeoExplorer’s CPT activity, students participate in a virtual internship in which they examine several sites with varied types of soil. This paper investigates DGBL environments by leveraging Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to ask the following research questions: (1) How do \"freedom\" and autonomy within GeoExplorer encourage students’ new emergent learning strategies? and (2) How do emergent learning strategies in GeoExplorer support students’ confidence as they self-guide their learning? Ten open-ended semi-structured interviews were performed with civil engineering students from three U.S.-based institutions. The data are analyzed using narrative analysis and a grounded theory approach. Our preliminary findings indicate that, while GeoExplorer is intended as a complement to in-person learning, it serves both as a complement and supplement to the online learning that helps to engage students during the pandemic. Students share that a felt sense of \"freedom\" within GeoExplorer encourages them to engage in different emergent learning strategies, such as repetition and trial and error. Students also describe that these emergent learning strategies promote knowledge retention and understanding, and further support their confidence in performing CPT. Our preliminary findings provide opportunities for students to practice autonomy and develop competency – two out of three basic psychological needs in SDT – in their educational processes.",

    "Abstract": "Research on perceptions of critical tacit knowledge retention in business is prevalent; however, minimal research has been conducted on participant perceptions of this loss specifically within higher education due to unintentional siloing. The problem addressed in this study was that high employee turnover in higher education may result in the potential loss of critical tacit knowledge needed to support current and future university operations due to a segregated organizational culture. The purpose of this intrinsic qualitative case study was to explore how critical tacit knowledge after employee turnover was transferred and retained by operational employees in a segregated organizational culture, within a higher education institution in New England. Utilizing Sanz and Hovell’s Knowledge Retention Framework, a more detailed conceptualization of critical tacit knowledge loss supported the methodology. For this intrinsic case study, the phenomena examined was the transition planning of the critical tacit knowledge for retention of the remaining team. Thirteen participants employed with the university for a minimum of two years explored critical tacit knowledge transfer and retention within a segregated organizational culture through semi-structured interviews and focus groups. The researcher developed research questions with the help of an expert panel and were semi-structured questions about participant experience with knowledge management within the university at large. The researcher analyzed data using thematic analysis and the results included four themes. Conclusions, implications, and recommendations around the four themes include: (1) Strong Community and Culture can facilitate openness in knowledge sharing, (2) Stakeholder buy-in needed to create a robust learning organization, (3) Transparency assists within breaking down silos, and (4) Training and Consulting can help prevent critical knowledge loss.",

    "Abstract": "Our first study determined if studying prosected cadavers is comparable to cadaveric dissection as a learning tool for veterinary gross anatomy. Student data were collected across two semesters each of three courses (n=51). Prosection students spent 12% less time in lab and similar time studying compared to dissection students. Of 9 unit exams, overall scores were higher ( P <0.05) for prosection students on 4 exams and did not differ on 4 others. Scores were higher ( P <0.05) for prosection students on 8 of 11 retention measures. Student perceptions regarding prosected cadavers were primarily positive. Therefore, we conclude that the study of prosected cadavers was effective for acquiring and retaining gross anatomy knowledge and was more time-efficient than dissection. Our second study determined the effect of maternal hyperandrogenism-associated (i.e., High A4) pubertal conditions in beef heifers on metabolic and inflammatory markers in male offspring. Dams were classified in groups by pubertal onset pattern: 1) Typical, 2) Non-Cycling (presumed High A4), and 3) Start-Stop. Analysis of plasma from 3-month old calves (n=35/group) showed that TNFα, blood urea nitrogen, total cholesterol, and HDL-C were lower ( P <0.05), IL-6 tended to be lower ( P <0.1), and insulin was higher ( P <0.05) in calves of Non-Cycling dams. We conclude that presumed High A4 and other conditions of Non-Cycling dams disrupts these regulators of metabolic homeostasis in male offspring. Our third study determined if daily-injected clenbuterol, a β2 adrenergic agonist, would affect myoblast proliferation in juvenile lambs with maternal heat stress-induced IUGR (n=10) compared to untreated IUGR-born lambs (n=10) and controls (n=11). Immunohistochemistry for pax7 and PCNA revealed that myoblast proliferation was reduced ( P <0.0.5) in biceps femoris and longissimus dorsi muscles of IUGR-born lambs but recovered by clenbuterol. Therefore, β2 adrenergic agonists may help improve deficient skeletal muscle growth in IUGR-born offspring.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction One of the challenges in medical education is effectively assessing basic science knowledge retention. National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) clerkship subject exam performance is reflective of the basic science knowledge accrued during preclinical education. The aim of this study was to determine if students’ retention of basic science knowledge during the clerkship years can be analyzed using a cognitive diagnostic assessment (CDA) of the NBME subject exam data. Methods We acquired a customized NBME item analysis report of our institution’s pediatric clerkship subject exams for the period of 2017–2020 and developed a question-by-content Q-matrix by identifying skills necessary to master content. As a pilot study, students’ content mastery in 12 major basic science content areas was analyzed using a CDA model called DINA (deterministic input, noisy “and” gate). Results The results allowed us to identify strong and weak basic science content areas for students in the pediatric clerkship. For example: “Reproductive systems” and “Skin and subcutaneous tissue” showed a student mastery of 83.8 ± 2.2% and 60.7 ± 3.2%, respectively. Conclusions Our pilot study demonstrates how this new technique can be applicable in quantitatively measuring students’ basic science knowledge retention during any clerkship. Combined data from all the clerkships will allow comparisons of specific content areas and identification of individual variations between different clerkships. In addition, the same technique can be used to analyze internal assessments thereby creating an opportunity for the longitudinal tracking of student performances. Detailed analyses like this can guide specific curricular changes and drive continuous quality improvement in the undergraduate medical school curriculum.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in South Africa compelled medical schools to switch to a purely online curriculum. The innovative changes transformed the standard clinical skills curriculum to increase learning transfer to bridge the theory-practice gap. The efficacy of this intervention remains unknown. This study aims to measure medical students’ clinical competency in the affective, cognitive, and psychomotor domains by assessing clinical skills knowledge retention and transfer from the online platform compared to face-to-face and blended learning. Methods: A non-random cross-sectional quasi-experimental study assessed third-year medical students’ knowledge retention and learning transfer in three domains of clinical skills competence. Data were obtained using a score sheet during a directly observed formative and a trial online summative assessment. One hundred and one third-year medical students volunteered for the formative onsite assessment that tested the psychomotor domain. Two hundred and thirty-nine students were evaluated on the affective and cognitive domains in the summative online trial mini-objective structured clinical examination (tm-OSCE). The OSCE scores were analysed using descriptive statistics. The significance of the findings was evaluated by comparing OSCE scores with the pre-pandemic 2019 third-year medical students. Results: Statistically significant differences were found between the two cohorts of medical students from both years (p < 0.05). The 2021 blended group’s (n = 101) medians were 90%, 95%CI [86, 92], 82%, 95%CI [80, 85], and 87%, 95% CI [84, 90] for the psychomotor, affective, and cognitive skills, respectively. The e-learning group’s affective and cognitive skills medians were 78%, 95%CI [73, 79] and 76%, 95%CI [71, 78], respectively. The 2019 face-to-face cohort (n = 249) achieved medians of 70%, 95% CI [69, 72] and 84%, 95%CI [82, 86] for the affective and psychomotor skills, respectively. Conclusion: Medical students demonstrated near and far transfer bridging the theory-practice gap in three clinical skills domains. The blended group performed significantly better than the e-learning and face-to-face groups. Medical schools and educators play a vital role in overcoming learning challenges and achieving higher transfer levels by adopting multiple student-centered teaching delivery approaches and arranging immediate application opportunities. This study offers medical educators suggestions that encourage the transfer of online learning to face-to-face practice, decentralising medical education with a revised blended learning strategy.",

    "Abstract": "Importance Increased bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is essential to improve survival after cardiac arrest. Although most studies focus on technical CPR skills, the randomized Lowlands Saves Lives trial prespecified a follow-up survey on other important aspects that affect the widespread performance of CPR. Objective To investigate bystander willingness to perform CPR on a stranger, theoretical knowledge retention, and dissemination of CPR awareness 6 months after undergoing short face-to-face and virtual reality (VR) CPR trainings. Design, Setting, and Participants A prespecified 6-month posttraining survey was conducted among 320 participants in the Lowlands Saves Lives trial, a randomized comparison between 20-minute face-to-face, instructor-led CPR training and VR training. Participants were recruited at the Lowlands music festival, with a designated area to conduct scientific projects (August 16-18, 2019; the Netherlands). Statistical analysis was performed from March 1, 2020, to July 31, 2021. Interventions Two standardized 20-minute protocols on CPR and automated external defibrillator use: instructor-led face-to-face training using CPR manikins or VR training using the Resuscitation Council (UK)–endorsed Lifesaver VR smartphone application and a pillow to practice compressions. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes were willingness to perform CPR on a stranger, theoretical knowledge retention, and dissemination of CPR awareness as reported by the entire cohort. As secondary analyses, the results of the 2 training modalities were compared. Results Of 381 participants, 320 consented to this follow-up survey; 188 participants (115 women [61%]; median age, 26 years [IQR, 22-32 years]) completed the entire survey and were accordingly included in the secondary analysis. The overall proportion of participants willing to perform CPR on a stranger was 77% (144 of 188): 81% (79 of 97) among face-to-face participants and 71% (65 of 91) among VR participants (P = .02); 103 participants (55%) reported feeling scared to perform CPR (P = .91). Regarding theoretical knowledge retention, a median of 7 (IQR, 6-8) of 9 questions were answered correctly in both groups (P = .81). Regarding dissemination of CPR awareness, 65% of participants (123 of 188) told at least 1 to 10 family members or friends about the importance of CPR, and 15% (29 of 188) had participated in certified, instructor-led training at the time of the survey, without differences between groups. Conclusions and Relevance In this 6-month posttraining survey, young adult participants of short CPR training modules reported high willingness (77%) to perform CPR on a stranger, with slightly higher rates for face-to-face than for VR participants. Theoretical knowledge retention was good, and the high dissemination of awareness suggests that these novel CPR training modules staged at a public event are promising sensitizers for involvement in CPR, although further challenges include mitigating the fear of performing CPR.

    "Abstract": "The paper presents a case study of the European Space Agency which has been coordinating internal knowledge management activities at the corporate level of the Agency for just over 6 years. In this time, previous, current, and future knowledge management activities have been respectively collected, supported, and planned with the immediate intent of addressing potential knowledge loss due to an on-going retirement wave - which will last until 2030. One of the ranges of knowledge management techniques applied is the lessons learned process, with associated means and tools being realised for the capture and exchange of experience. Through the focus on using the validated and evaluated lessons to achieve systematic learning, the lessons learned process has achieved learning at the point of use, rather than mostly keeping the learning within the established Lessons Learned tool, which has also had (unintentionally) caused an enabling effect for other organisational capabilities relating to not only knowledge but also information and data management. The Agency has then made a relatively rapid transition to adopting a systematic approach to Lessons Learned - by both creating the need for (prerequisite) upstream and \"downstream\" capabilities. The downstream benefits (learning flowing out of the experience capture) has been achieved by identifying the process, product and people involved in the desired learning outcome, and assuring the learning is placed at this point. In taking the approach of broadening the reach of a traditional lessons learned process (mostly with the aim of more effectively addressing user needs), the establishment of lessons learned capabilities has also enabled the needed upstream development activities for the deployment of lessons learned itself. Aspects such as a solid IT infrastructure (common platform), a robust set of classification terms (taxonomy), and the existence of users with a clear identity (communities of practice). The paper will present the current (but rapidly progressing) status of lessons learned at ESA, and the upstream and downstream effects from the perspective of lessons learned as part of an overall organisational strategy to create a culture and climate of openness and sharing (knowledge management) and digitalisation (information and data management).",

    "Abstract": "The chapter aims to present the results of an action research project carried out in years 2018 - 2019, which concerned project knowledge management. The entity in which the study was conducted is one of the largest museums in Poland. The museum under study is an example of a projectified public organization where most of the activities are being performed in the form of a project. The intention of the undertaken action research was to introduce an organizational change - to improve the process of project knowledge management in the museum. Hence, the aim of the paper is to show how can action research support project knowledge management processes in organisations and in which way action research affects the knowledge retention of project workers. Analysis of the obtained data allow us to conclude that action research, is an effective tool and approach in the improvement of project knowledge management. Thanks to this approach, members of the organizations, dispersed among different project teams, can e.g. jointly work out the rules for better project knowledge management in their workplace and improve the project knowledge management process in general. Hence, action research may positively impact knowledge retention among project team members.",

For two mathematical topics, ten high school seniors (six average-achieving and four high-achieving) received instruction, completed a post-instruction test, participated in either a PBL or a Traditional retrieval activity, and completed a post-activity test the day after the activity to measure knowledge gains and a deferred post-test six weeks after the activity to measure knowledge retention. There was no statistically significant difference in either knowledge gains or knowledge retention based on type of retrieval activity. The knowledge gains effect size between the two groups was negligible (Hedges? g = 0.017). The knowledge retention effect size was small (Hedges? g = 0.203) with a preference for the Traditional activity. Within both achievement levels, large effect sizes (Hedges? g > 0.8) were found in knowledge retention, with the high-achieving group showing higher knowledge retention after the PBL activity and the average-achieving group showing higher knowledge retention after the Traditional retrieval activity. These results indicate that PBL activities can be as effective as Traditional activities in the high school mathematics classroom and may be more beneficial to some students. Future research to determine attributes that may contribute to student?s response to different types of retrieval activities is suggested.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge is a strategic resource for any organisation to maintain optimal operational efficiency and competitiveness. Knowledge could be in the knower's mind (tacit) or codified and stored in knowledge repositories for retrieval when needed (explicit). Knowledge retention in organisations is becoming a global concern as the shortage of professionals or knowledge workers persists. Organisations over the years have focused on investing in activities leading to knowledge creation, improving technological capabilities, and increasing performance with less attention given to knowledge retention. The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated this concern leading to the exit of more knowledge workers from organisations voluntarily or involuntarily. The current study seeks to investigate the role of organisational factors on knowledge retention in public organisations using the water sector in a South African metropolitan city. This study seeks to deepen the knowledge management scholarship by viewing knowledge retention as a system rather than a process or strategy only, as explored by most studies. The water sector is a knowledge-driven sector that utilises heterogeneous knowledge (engineers, hydrologists, technicians, IT specialists) to achieve its mandate, making it information and knowledgerich. This study intends to use the knowledge-based view as a sensitising lens to explore how a public organisation systemically integrates and coordinates its heterogeneous knowledge resources to ensure that knowledge is retained as well as maintain optimal operational efficiency. The basic assumptions of the knowledge base view are that knowledge is the most strategic resource in an organisation, and its coordination facilitates optimised efficiency. The study will adopt a pragmatist paradigm to uncover the role of organisational factors on knowledge retention. A purposive sample of supervisors and managers in the water sector will be interviewed. Qualitative data will be collected, and qualitative methods will be used to analyse the data.",

    "Abstract": "Understood that knowledge loss is an imminent risk to organizations as it occurs when employees with valuable knowledge leave the organization, when there are problems with codified knowledge or when the organization does not properly manage knowledge. In this context, organizational resilience can be affected, since intangible resources enable organizational responses to the unexpected. Considering that the aspects that generate losses can be common to organizations, it is also important to identify what are the possible gains that the system has, as a result of these situations. Thus, the objective of this article is to understand the state of the art under knowledge loss in the context of organizational resilience and to identify the possible gains arising from these critical situations. As a proposal, a classification according to the concept of Intellectual Capital based on the three main dimensions: Human Capital, Structural Capital and Relational Capital. Thus, a literature review was carried out in order to identify the impacts of the loss of knowledge on resilient responses, as well as the gains for the organizational system. This theoretical study aimed to contribute to the scientific advancement of knowledge loss, to the advancement of organizational resilience aspects, as well as to Intellectual Capital. Also, it was proposed to advance in the understanding of knowledge gains, since regular aspects to organizations such as turnover, waste of knowledge, low volume of specialists and absences from work generate risks to critical knowledge. These, in turn, affect the resilience and structures of the IC. Presenting knowledge vulnerabilities makes it possible to identify possible positive impacts, in order to ensure proper knowledge management, in favor of organizational resilience and its sustainability. As a result, the study showed that the loss of knowledge is mainly from Human Capital, however there are direct and positive impacts on the structural and relational capital of the organization, as loss mitigation strategies lead to strategies for strengthening relationships and internal improvements in its structure. Furthermore, the creation of unlearning and organizational learning environments can contribute to the resilience of the system.",

    "Abstract": "The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions. This means there is a growing need to integrate UAV training into STEM education. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a UAV education module and laboratory exercise for natural resource science students. The study used a series of reusable learning objects (RLOs) to assess students' prior knowledge of remote sensing and UAVs. Students were taught the steps of UAV data acquisition and processing through lectures and UAV simulation videos. Students applied this knowledge by completing a laboratory exercise that used previously collected UAV data. Student knowledge retention and understanding were evaluated using an online quiz to determine the effectiveness of the education module. The average quiz score was 92%, indicating that the UAV laboratory exercise effectively taught students about UAV data acquisition and processing for natural resource research. Overall, students expressed positive opinions about the UAV education module. Student feedback indicated that the laboratory exercise was engaging, but some students would have preferred a hands-on experience for some parts of the exercise. However, in-person UAV instruction may not be accessible for all educators because of UAV cost or lack of instructor training. This study provides educators with crucial recommendations for designing UAV exercises to improve access to UAV-related educational content. This study indicates that online training can effectively introduce students to UAVs. Given the wide range of UAV uses across STEM fields, students in many STEM disciplines would benefit from UAV education.",

    "Abstract": "Educational systems can benefit from Virtual Reality's (VR) ability to support experiential learning. In particular, VR based games, especially role-playing serious games (RPGs), can promote learning through the simulation of various educational scenarios. This study proposes an immersive VR-RPG to educate players about the behavior of honeybees. The player adopts the role of a honeybee and experiences a virtual world mimicking the real one from the honeybee's perspective. Unlike most studies in educational VR, we assess the impact of immersion on knowledge gain by testing the players' knowledge on the subject before, immediately after, and one week following the use of the system. We also compare the proposed system with both a conventional and a desktop VR-RPG approach. The results indicate that students significantly gained knowledge in all methods compared to the pre-test. We found that the immersion level for both tested VR-RPGs did not have a significant effect on learning. However, the study showed an improvement in knowledge retention for the desktop VR-RPG users compared to those of the conventional method. Moreover, the results revealed that users of the immersive and desktop VR-RPGs were more motivated and engaged compared to those of the conventional method.",

    "Abstract": "Small teaching approaches are well-structured, incremental teaching improvement techniques supported by research in cognitive science, memory, and learning. I systematically implement a series of small teaching activities in an introductory programming course to tackle the teaching and learning challenges faced by instructors and students. The small teaching activities are designed to promote effective learning strategies such as knowledge retrieval, spacing-out practice, and interleaving learning. I examine the impact of such approaches on students' performance through comparative analyses. The test results indicate that small teaching approaches are effective in improving students' lower- and higher-level thinking skills and help boost students' long-term knowledge retention. Because the small teaching approaches are flexible and easy to implement, instructors teaching technical information systems topics can quickly integrate at least some small teaching activities into their classes.",

    "Abstract": "This quasi-experimental quantitative study investigated the effects of different formats of multimediaenhanced instruction on knowledge gain and retention of second language learners. The study focused specifically on assessing Mayer's redundancy principle. Second language learners were randomly assigned into two groups and were presented with two formats of a multimedia-enhanced lesson: (1) images with audio and (2) images with audio and on-screen text. A repeatedmeasures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was carried out to evaluate change between pretest and immediate posttest, mean differences in knowledge gain between the two groups, group differences in growth from pretest to immediate posttest, change between immediate posttest and delayed posttest, and group differences in knowledge retention as indicated by difference scores between immediate posttest and delayed posttest, using gender and English proficiency as control variables. Additionally, an independent samples t-test was performed to assess the effect of the two formats of multimedia-enhanced instruction on the learners' knowledge retention. Results showed that participants engaging with both formats of multimedia-enhanced instruction improved significantly from pretest to posttest. Moreover, participants who engaged with the multimedia-enhanced instruction where on-screen text was included were also found to perform significantly better than participants who were in the group where on-screen text was not present. Second language learners in both groups were also able to retain their knowledge at the same level. These results appear to contradict the redundancy principle as having onscreen text, which is considered redundant, presented together with images and audio in a multimedia-enhanced lesson was not detrimental to learning.",

    "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) provides opportunities to enable high-efficiency wireless communication to dynamically adapt to the local environments and user demands. In this article, a continual learning digital predistortion (DPD) algorithm is proposed to linearize radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) in 6G AI-empowered wireless communication. It is achieved by employing the ability of knowledge retention and knowledge transfer to merge the new PA operating state into the previous model, which makes the model more intelligent when dealing with multiple states. In addition, an augmented self-sensing model is proposed to accurately capture the common characteristics and key dynamic characteristics among different PA operating states to improve the knowledge transfer ability during the continual learning process. The experiments were carried out on a Doherty PA with dynamic configurations associated with power, bandwidth, and signal type. The experimental results have shown that the proposed technique can continuously learn when faced with unpredicted new PA operating states and so as to linearize all known states. The proposed DPD method performs with very low complexity in the long term, which is very suitable for the emerging AI-empowered dynamic scenario.",

BACKGROUND Teaching anatomy in a clinical context can aid students in appreciating how the subject will apply to their future career as nurses as well as in other administrative roles. Anatomy is voluminous, making it difficult to retain the factual information in the long run; therefore, this study primarily focuses on whether case-based learning (CBL) with integrated anatomy learning can help in retention of the information over short as well as long spans of time. It also focuses on how profitable would the students be with this different style of learning, and whether it can facilitate in better understanding of the basic and clinical concepts.The current study was conducted in the Nursing College of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, India to integrate CBL and evaluate its effect compared to the highly compartmentalized, didactic lectures among the nursing students. The extent of knowledge retention was analyzed by conducting a series of tests before as well as after CBL intervention. Feedback and suggestions were obtained from the students by using the 5-point Likert scale method. MATERIALS AND METHODS The current study was conducted in the Nursing College of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, India to integrate CBL and evaluate its effect compared to the highly compartmentalized, didactic lectures among the nursing students. The extent of knowledge retention was analyzed by conducting a series of tests before as well as after CBL intervention. Feedback and suggestions were obtained from the students by using the 5-point Likert scale method.The post-test scores of the students improved by 21% after the CBL. More than 85% of the students opined that CBL improves critical thinking, team work, self-directed learning, and communication skills. RESULTS The post-test scores of the students improved by 21% after the CBL. More than 85% of the students opined that CBL improves critical thinking, team work, self-directed learning, and communication skills.CBL promotes effective short-term retention and facilitates comprehension of key concepts. CBL also plays an important role in improving the professional skills of the students, which otherwise is not taught, and equips them for their future careers. CONCLUSION CBL promotes effective short-term retention and facilitates comprehension of key concepts. CBL also plays an important role in improving the professional skills of the students, which otherwise is not taught, and equips them for their future careers.",

    "Abstract": "Information systems development (ISD) is an integral part of organizational agility in today’s competitive business environment. High turnover, agile ways of working, and fluid work environments pose challenges for ISD. This paper explores the erosion of knowledge retention (KR) arising from ISD staff churn in a New Zealand-based financial organization in the aftermath of a major earthquake. In this exploratory study, the authors develop a causal model of KR in the ISD context, which articulates the challenges to and consequences of ineffective KR at the routine and exiting stages of KR. The model identifies four challenges—coordination complexity, insufficient resources for knowledge retention, insufficient attention to knowledge retention, and slow staff replacement and handover processes—that can affect the loss of ISD knowledge when routine and exiting KR fall into disarray. This study also reveals that role stress and reduced ISD agility reinforce the cycle of knowledge loss. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

A commonly used approach for multi-label task is binary relevance technique which usually needs large amounts of resources and suffers from loss of knowledge on characteristics of other labels in data during training. In this study, we propose to implement multi-task learning during Transformers finetune on binary relevance data, which aims to reduce resource consumption by utilizing parameter sharing and increase performance by obtaining other label characteristics during training. Our experiments had shown that our method outperformed vanilla multi-label finetune. Using 1599 instances of training data and 400 instances of testing data with 16 classes, our method achieved.8817 for classification and achieved.9083 in F1 for classification of 3 sampling classes.",

    "Abstract": "Background : Case-based learning has been shown to increase student perception and performance in multiple topics in pharmacy education. However, no studies have evaluated the impact of virtual patients and case-based learning on student knowledge and knowledge retention of therapeutic drug monitoring and dosing. Innovation : Due to a curriculum overhaul promoting integration and application-based learning, the traditional third-year (P3) therapeutic drug monitoring course was reduced from four (4) credit hours to two (2), in order to add time to pharmacotherapy and skills labs. In order to adapt to this change, the course was shifted to a case-based learning format utilizing virtual patients within a simulated electronic health record (EHR) where the course grade distribution shifted in favor of patient cases versus exam questions. An analysis of student knowledge and knowledge retention of antibiotic dosing and monitoring was conducted comparing students who completed the traditional course versus those who completed the case-based course. Findings : Despite the decrease in credit hours, there was no significant difference shown in the initial knowledge assessment between the traditional and case-based courses (87.0 vs 85.5%). Knowledge retention actually improved in the students who completed the case-based course (78.1% vs 82.5%). Conclusion : Utilizing case-based instruction to teach antibiotic dosing and monitoring was successful in preparing students for these skills during their experiential rotations. Even though students had half the instruction time, they were able to perform calculations and retain knowledge as well as students in the traditional curriculum.Background: Case-based learning has been shown to increase student perception and performance in multiple topics in pharmacy education.

    "Abstract": "Knowledge can play an important role in ascertaining an organization’s competitive edge if the knowledge of employees is nurtured and utilized as an asset with a potential to improve service delivery. The study focused on knowledge sharing at the Thomas Mofolo Library in Lesotho to determine if knowledge sharing was being used to improve service delivery at the library. A case study design that triangulated interviews and questionnaires was used in this study. Quantitative data was processed using software packages. Data from the interviews was analyzed through content analysis based on the objectives of the study. This study established that staff recognized the need to share knowledge. However, knowledge sharing occurred on an ad hoc basis. There was a limited use of technology-based and human-based mechanisms of sharing knowledge. The study suggests practical knowledge-sharing practices that may contribute to improved service delivery in a library setup. As a case study, the study may also contribute to the development of theory about the phenomenon. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "This research investigates how experiencing virtual embodiment in a wheelchair affects implicit bias towards people who use wheelchairs. We also investigate how receiving information from a virtual instructor who uses a wheelchair affects implicit bias towards people who use wheelchairs. Implicit biases are actions or judgments of people towards various concepts or stereotypes (e.g., races). We hypothesized that experiencing a Disability Simulation (DS) through an avatar in a wheelchair and receiving information from an instructor with a disability will have a significant effect on participants’ ability to recall disability-related information and will reduce implicit biases towards people who use wheelchairs. To investigate this hypothesis, a 2x2 between-subjects user study was conducted where participants experienced an immersive VR DS that presents information about Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with factors of instructor (i.e., instructor with a disability versus instructor without a disability) and locomotion interface (i.e., without a disability – locomotion through in-place-walking, with a disability – locomotion in a wheelchair). Participants took a disability-focused Implicit Association Test two times, once before and once after experiencing the DS. They also took a test of knowledge retention about MS. The primary result is: experiencing the DS through locomotion in a wheelchair was better for both the disability-related information recall task and reducing implicit bias towards people who use wheelchairs.",

    "Abstract": "Public safety is prime concern in rail industry and driver training on hazard perception is crucial. Additionally, a new driver’s skill set determines the productivity and quality of existing driver training methods. Apprentice train drivers are required to complete massive hours under supervision of experienced drivers to attain the required skill sets causing productivity issues. Traditional driver training is paper based, and assessments are individually evaluated without any scientific rigor, resulting in quality challenges. This paper proposes a Metaverse embedded learning and training framework for drivers in rolling stock. The framework includes driver vision analysis by eye tracking and pupil dilation focusing on enhancing the productivity and quality of driver training and hazard detection for drivers in rolling stock. Metaverse embedded training and learning enhances experiential learning with unique benefits. In this paper, a metaverse-based training framework is proposed for train drivers to enhance productivity, quality, and safety aspects through case studies including: (i) driver sightline studies and (ii) vision analysis. The studies developed quantifying driver hazard perceptions and related comprehension rates based on eye tracking and vision studies. In conclusion, the overall savings on cost and time are 95% effective using Metaverse-based training method compared to traditional methods. Stakeholders need to supervise on driver tasks, knowledge retention, damage control due to the occurrence of hazards. The framework substantially reduced hazards to 50% with saving up to 3696 man-hours. The assessment was completely automated to provide real time assessment thus providing 93% more positive results compared to traditional methods.",

    "Abstract": "Being a professor at the university is associated with the acquisition of sufficient domain knowledge and skills to teach. On the other hand, there is a constant need to update and strengthen teaching skills and contribute to an effective learning process. Neuroscience research provides evidence on facilitating factors to student engagement and lasting, durable learning. Toward the improvement of the learning quality in Higher Education, the development of an innovative didactic proposal based on neuroscience was undertaken. For that reason, a mixed research method was designed with the purpose of exploring instructors’ opinions and practices. Participants were sixty academics from five Greek universities. Findings include the recognition of the validity and importance of neuroeducation training. It was also revealed that academics’ theoretical declarations are not always aligned with teaching practice. Equally important is their need to deepen the comprehension of memory function for the enhancement of students’ knowledge retention. Eventual misconceptions about the brain might be present, while not all employed pedagogical methods lead to desired student outcomes such as creativity and critical thinking. In addition, it is considered useful to apply alternative, creative and authentic assessment methods based on neuroscience evidence to increase students’ interest and engagement.",

    "Abstract": "In the industrial domain, maintenance is essential to guarantee the correct operations, availability, and efficiency of machinery and systems. With the advent of Industry 4.0, solutions based on machine learning can be used for the prediction of future failures by exploiting historical failure data. Most of the time, these historical data have been collected by companies without a specific structure, schema, or even best practices, resulting in a potential loss of knowledge. In this paper, we analyze the historical data on maintenance alerts of the components of a revamping topping plant (referred to as RT2) belonging to the SARAS group. This analysis is done in collaboration with the ITALTELECO company, a partner of SARAS, that provided the necessary data. The pre-processing methodology to clean and fill these data and extract features useful for a prediction task will be shown. More in detail, we show the process to fill missing fields of these data to provide (i) a category for each fault by using simple natural language processing techniques and performing a clustering, and (ii) a data structure that can enable machine learning models and statistical approaches to perform reliable failure predictions. The data domain in which this methodology is applied is oil and gas, but it may be generalized and reformulated in various industrial and/or academic fields. The ultimate goal of our work is to obtain a procedure that is simple and can be applied to provide strategic support for the definition of an adequate maintenance plan.",

    "Abstract": "Approximately 8% of African Americans born annually have sickle cell trait (SCT), a public health concern that may contribute to health disparities if individuals with SCT do not know it and lack access to understandable information about reproductive implications. Pre-pandemic, Ohio offered in-person SCT education for parents of SCT-affected children but many did not attend. Those with limited health literacy (HL) were less likely to achieve high knowledge. We used a HL-focused evaluation of this education to develop a virtual program (SCTaware) to communicate clear, actionable information and promote knowledge retention. Background Approximately 8% of African Americans born annually have sickle cell trait (SCT), a public health concern that may contribute to health disparities if individuals with SCT do not know it and lack access to understandable information about reproductive implications. Pre-pandemic, Ohio offered in-person SCT education for parents of SCT-affected children but many did not attend. Those with limited health literacy (HL) were less likely to achieve high knowledge. We used a HL-focused evaluation of this education to develop a virtual program (SCTaware) to communicate clear, actionable information and promote knowledge retention.Seven English-speaking parents, three with limited HL, were recruited in 2019 for in-person session videotaping and SCT knowledge assessments. Clinicians, HL experts, educators, genetic counselors, and parent stakeholders (evaluators) reviewed sessions, assessments, and accompanying visuals. Methods Seven English-speaking parents, three with limited HL, were recruited in 2019 for in-person session videotaping and SCT knowledge assessments. Clinicians, HL experts, educators, genetic counselors, and parent stakeholders (evaluators) reviewed sessions, assessments, and accompanying visuals.Evaluators: observed parents asked few questions; noted undefined technical terms, closed questions, key concept omission, and limited explanation of visuals scoring low for understandability, actionability, and clarity; and developed SCTaware for individual videoconference delivery (knowledge objectives; plain language guide; HL-informed communication strategies; new visuals scoring highly for understandability, actionability, and clarity; narrated post-education version; standardized educator training). Results Evaluators: observed parents asked few questions; noted undefined technical terms, closed questions, key concept omission, and limited explanation of visuals scoring low for understandability, actionability, and clarity; and developed SCTaware for individual videoconference delivery (knowledge objectives; plain language guide; HL-informed communication strategies; new visuals scoring highly for understandability, actionability, and clarity; narrated post-education version; standardized educator training).Using a HL-focused evaluation, our diverse team created a promising virtual SCT education program addressing a common issue affecting populations at risk for disparities. Given virtual education will likely continue post-pandemic and limited HL is common, this approach may be essential and replicable for other public health education programs, especially those transitioning to virtual formats, to convey clear, actionable information and promote health equity.

    "Abstract": "Background: Many state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in South Africa face the serious problem of knowledge-unfriendly organisational cultures, structures and human resource management (HRM) practices that hinder the reduction of the risks associated with tacit knowledge loss. Objective: The article examines the role of HRM in facilitating knowledge-driven organisational cultures and structures for the reduction of tacit knowledge loss in South African SOEs. Methods: The study deployed an exploratory sequential mixed methods research design to examine the role of HRM in facilitating organisational cultures and structures that are supportive of knowledge management (KM). In the qualitative phase, data were collected through interviews with 20 purposively selected HR managers in nine SOEs. In the quantitative phase, a questionnaire was distributed to 585 randomly selected employees in three state-owned companies. The instrument was considered reliable with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.94 and a response rate of 25%. Results: The research findings revealed that a majority of organisational cultures and structures in SOEs did not facilitate or assist to propel and support KM activities, behaviours and practices. On a positive note, human resource managers acknowledge that they have a crucial role to play in influencing culture management and structural designs in their companies to boost KM activities, behaviours and cultures. Conclusion: Numerous SOEs did not exhibit certain knowledge-driven behaviours and cultures because of a lack of structures to drive KM. Human resource managers did not exert their role in driving and influencing such knowledge-based behaviours, cultures and structures to lessen potential tacit knowledge loss.",

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, virtual teams are gaining importance because it has given organizations and employees the ability to work from anywhere in the world without relocating them. Employees no longer need to be physically co-located to work on the same project. Many organizations have been taking advantage of globalization and communication advances to enter new markets from anywhere and anytime. Additionally, the COVID-19 spreading in the world, this has resulted to seek alternative work arrangements, including the information technology (IT) industry. Many companies implement the global virtual teams in globalized business environments across space, time, organizational and cultural boundaries via communication and information technologies. Despite the advancement of technology, there are still many challenges in communication and collaboration for global virtual teams. Hence, identifying challenges that may face virtual teams and factors that may influence the effectiveness of virtual teams is very important. Moreover, understanding the role of the team members, team staffing strategy, planning collaborative work processes, and continuous knowledge management systems in virtual settings can help organizations work effectively. Working in a virtual environment has many challenges and advantages. When team members are dispersed across time zones and cultural differences, challenges occur, such as language barriers, misunderstandings, lack of trust, distance, lack of planning, etc. On the other hand, virtual teams can save money by cutting costs which is a major concern in many organizations. Global companies prefer working with a dispersed workforce to be quick and more agile. But face-to-face communication, at least from time to time, appears still significant for virtual environments. Organizations start to establish teams to bring individuals together with the specific expertise and skills to collaborate on complex tasks. Collaboration is an important factor in virtual teamwork. Team members need to collaborate to achieve the project goal. The advantage of a virtual team is that distributed knowledge is integrated to achieve more effective results. However, knowledge sharing is dependent on the willingness of individual team members and sharing knowledge may lead to a loss of knowledge ownership. This can lead to a reluctance to share knowledge by employees. As knowledge sharing is crucial for team collaboration, an effective virtual team requires regular idea exchange. Another key factor is trust which can affect team effectiveness and success. However, building trust among team members is a complex task in virtual environments. Virtual team members are unable to meet face-to-face therefore, they need to rely on virtual settings to assess trustworthiness and compensate for the lack of physically observed behaviors. This research describes several important factors that affect global virtual team efficiency, especially in IT projects and underlying solutions are addressed to reduce the barriers. Hence, this research extends the literature on virtual teams through investigating the relationship between knowledge sharing, trust, language difference, cultural difference, distance, time zone difference, and team effectiveness factors, and collaboration among team members and how these factors ultimately affect virtual team effectiveness. A conceptual model is proposed which explains the relationship between the factors (that affect virtual team efficiency) and team effectiveness. Alternate abstract: Heutzutage gewinnen virtuelle Teams immer mehr an Bedeutung, da sie Unternehmen und Mitarbeitern die Möglichkeit geben, von jedem Ort der Welt aus zu arbeiten, ohne dass sie ihren Standort verändern müssen. Die Mitarbeiter müssen nicht mehr physisch an einem Ort sein, um an demselben Projekt arbeiten zu können. Viele Unternehmen nutzen die Globalisierung und die Fortschritte in der Kommunikation, um von jedem Ort und zu jeder Zeit neue Märkte zu erschließen. Darüber hinaus hat die weltweite Verbreitung von COVID-19 dazu geführt, dass auch in der Informationstechnologie (IT) alternative Arbeitsformen gesucht werden. Viele Unternehmen setzen mithilfe von Kommunikations- und Informationstechnologien globale virtuelle Teams in globalisierten Geschäftsumgebungen über räumliche, zeitliche, organisatorische und kulturelle Grenzen hinweg ein. Trotz des technologischen Fortschritts gibt es immer noch viele Herausforderungen bei der Kommunikation und Zusammenarbeit in globalen virtuellen Teams. Daher ist es sehr wichtig, die Herausforderungen, denen virtuelle Teams gegenüberstehen, und die Faktoren, die die Effektivität virtueller Teams beeinflussen können, zu ermitteln. Darüber hinaus kann das Verständnis der Rolle der Teammitglieder, der Teambesetzungsstrategie, der Planung kollaborativer Arbeitsprozesse und kontinuierlicher Wissensmanagementsysteme in virtuellen Umgebungen Organisationen helfen, effektiv zu arbeiten. Die Arbeit in einem virtuellen Umfeld hat viele Herausforderungen und Vorteile. Wenn die Teammitglieder über Zeitzonen und kulturelle Unterschiede hinweg verstreut sind, ergeben sich Herausforderungen wie Sprachbarrieren, Missverständnisse, mangelndes Vertrauen, Entfernung, fehlende Planung usw. Andererseits können virtuelle Teams durch Kostenminimierung Geld sparen, was in vielen Unternehmen von großem Interesse ist. Global tätige Unternehmen bevorzugen es, mit verstreuten Mitarbeitern zu arbeiten, um schneller und flexibler zu sein. Die face-to-face Kommunikation, zumindest von Zeit zu Zeit, scheint jedoch auch in virtuellen Umgebungen wichtig zu sein. Unternehmen beginnen, Teams zu bilden, um Personen mit spezifischen Fachkenntnissen und Fähigkeiten zusammenzubringen, die an komplexen Aufgaben zusammenarbeiten. Das Zusammenwirken ist ein wichtiger Faktor in der virtuellen Teamarbeit. Die Teammitglieder müssen zusammenarbeiten, um das Projektziel zu erreichen. Der Vorteil eines virtuellen Teams ist, dass verteiltes Wissen integriert wird, um effektivere Ergebnisse zu erzielen. Die gemeinsame Nutzung von Wissen hängt jedoch von der Bereitschaft der einzelnen Teammitglieder ab, und die gemeinsame Nutzung von Wissen kann zu einem Verlust des eigenenWissens jedes einzelnen führen. Dies kann dazu führen, dass die Mitarbeiter nicht bereit sind, ihr Wissen zu teilen. Da der Wissensaustausch für die Communication Mechanisms in Global Virtual Teams and Influencing Factors of Team Effectiveness Zusammenarbeit im Team von entscheidender Bedeutung ist, erfordert ein effektives virtuelles Team einen regelmäßigen Ideenaustausch. Ein weiterer Schlüsselfaktor ist das Vertrauen, das die Effektivität und den Erfolg eines Teams beeinflussen kann. Der Aufbau von Vertrauen zwischen den Teammitgliedern ist jedoch in virtuellen Umgebungen eine komplexe Aufgabe. Virtuelle Teammitglieder können sich nicht persönlich treffen und müssen sich daher auf virtuelle Umgebungen verlassen, um die Vertrauenswürdigkeit zu beurteilen und den Mangel an physisch beobachteten Verhaltensweisen auszugleichen. Diese Studie beschreibt mehrere wichtige Faktoren, die sich insbesondere bei IT-Projekten auf die Effizienz globaler, virtueller Teams auswirken, , und es werden die zugrunde liegenden Lösungen zum Abbau der Hindernisse behandelt. Daher erweitert diese Forschungsarbeit die Literatur über virtuelle Teams durch die Untersuchung der Beziehung zwischen Wissensaustausch, Vertrauen, Sprachunterschied, kulturellem Unterschied, Entfernung, Zeitzonenunterschied und Faktoren der Teameffektivität sowie der Zusammenarbeit zwischen den Teammitgliedern und wie diese Faktoren letztendlich die Effektivität virtueller Teams beeinflussen.",

    "Abstract": "Medical education has seen a shift toward interactive teaching in small groups that actively involves students in learning. However, didactic teaching, despite drawbacks such as student isolation and low stimulation of critical thinking, is still a very commonly used teaching method. For didactic teaching to be effective, teachers must possess strategies and skills that enable them to teach effectively in large groups and increase students' knowledge retention. This can be achieved if class sessions are planned in advance with the aim of making them interactive and engaging with all students. In the following article, I write about my experiences using the CASCADE method, an acronym of the words \"create,\" \"assess,\" \"sequence,\" \"charisma,\" \"activate,\" \"discussion,\" and \"e-device,\" which creates interactive didactic sessions.",

    "Abstract": "In Stieglerian fashion, this paper is concerned with both the loss and the re-creation of knowledge in the field of architecture. The student of architecture must be the one who learns new tools and new forms of knowledge and this has profound implications and applicability for the philosophy of education as it is a question of the recuperation of architecture with negentropic tools. Why? In the realm of the digital, it is the case that architectural student is at risk of dis-individuation, the loss of knowledge of such. Therefore, the paper concerns itself with questions of maturity, critical intelligence, trans-individuation, the crisis of noetic being, the artisanal mode of learning and finally the proletarianization of the faculties. It is concerned with the reclamation of noetic space and the search for negentropic tools. This paper is thus pertinent to the philosophy of education because it pertains to the act of creation, the question of imagination and to the loss of thinking as such. Focusing on the history of architecture it demonstrates the loss of knowledge in the history of architecture and shows this has clear implications for the philosophy of education, which is precisely concerned with the nurturing and maturing of the thinking subject. The crisis in the proletarianization of the faculties in architecture pinpoints the role of the artisan's mode of learning and its crisis brought by the digitisation of architecture. The conclusion shows that Stiegler's philosophy of the pharmakon is appropriate to understand this movement as it points to new and embraces new modes of learning in the present.",

    "Abstract": "Recent calls for reform in K-12 science education and the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st Century emphasize improving science teaching, students' engagement, and learning. In this study, we designed and implemented a curriculum unit for sixth-grade students (i = 1305). The curriculum unit integrated science and engineering content and practices to teach ecology, water pollution, and engineering design. We investigated the designed integrated STEM unit's effectiveness in students' science learning outcomes on pre-, post-, and delayed post-assessments. We collected pre-and post-assessment data of students' science learning outcomes for both the baseline group (taught via existing district-adopted curriculum) and an intervention group (taught with integrated life science and engineering curriculum). We used a quasi-experimental research design and examined differences between baseline and intervention groups. We used ANCOVA to explore differences in students' learning in baseline and intervention groups. Furthermore, for students in the intervention group, we conducted repeated-measures ANOVA to investigate knowledge retention. Our analyses also accounted for students' gender and People of Color (POC) status. We conducted multiple regression analyses to explore the relationship between students' gender, POC status, and their learning outcomes. The results indicated that the intervention group students performed significantly better than the students in the baseline group. The repeated measures ANOVA showed that students in the intervention group retained science knowledge after 8 weeks of instruction. Finally, the regression analysis for the baseline group showed that gender and POC status were not significant predictors of their post-assessment scores. However, POC status was a significant predictor of post-assessment scores and knowledge retention for the intervention group. Overall, this study provides valuable findings on how an integrated STEM curriculum designed with engineering design and practices improves students' science learning outcomes.",

We designed a math-infused computer science course for third to fifth graders to learn programming. This study aims to investigate the impact of the course on students' knowledge acquisition of mathematical and computational concepts, motivation, and perceptions of the computing activities. Fifty-one students at a Boys and Girls Club participated in the study. Data collection procedures include pre- and post-tests, pre- and post-surveys, in-class observations, and one-on-one interviews. Results indicate that students have improved significantly on mathematical and computational concepts. They also tended to believe computer programming is fun, comprehensible, enjoyable, and were able to perceive the value of learning it. Implications and recommendations for future research are also discussed.",

    "Abstract": "The United States fire service is at a critical crossroads. Can it continue relying on outdated educational methodology to teach the 21st century fire instructor, or does it enact change to create an innovative, modern approach to instructor education? Fire Departments are rapidly losing decades of knowledge through retirement of their senior members. With the statistical drop in fires annually, there is less opportunity for real world skills application and knowledge acquisition. The reliance on instructors for their ability to pass on learned information is critical. In addition to the loss of knowledge, inadequate standards for instructor education drastically limit the ability for this to occur, steepening the learning curve for newer firefighters and increasing the risk to lives and property during the process. Better teaching methodology must be developed for educating the modern, all-hazards fire service instructor and help stem the unchecked loss of information the service is currently witnessing. Without good instructors, the knowledge gained from these horrific events will continue to be lost. Through qualitative inquiry, current and former members of the fire service were surveyed and interviewed regarding their opinions on the national fire instructor curriculum. The results of the research elucidate a need for continued investigation with a concentration on improving fire instructor training and professional development.

    "Abstract": "The small group teaching (SGT) is gaining popularity in medical education since it improves the student's thinking capacity and aids knowledge retention. Several studies have been conducted to analyze students' attitudes regarding SGT. Faculty, on the other hand, have mixed perception about SGT methodology. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to explore medical faculties' perceptions of SGT effectiveness in the medical curriculum. BACKGROUND The small group teaching (SGT) is gaining popularity in medical education since it improves the student's thinking capacity and aids knowledge retention. Several studies have been conducted to analyze students' attitudes regarding SGT. Faculty, on the other hand, have mixed perception about SGT methodology. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to explore medical faculties' perceptions of SGT effectiveness in the medical curriculum.A cross-sectional, descriptive survey was conducted among 50 medical college teachers. We have developed set of 12 questionnaires to assess the perception of teachers on SGT methods. Content validation of the survey questionnaire was done by Lawshe method, and Cronbach's alpha was calculated for estimating the internal consistency. Teacher's perception responses were presented as proportion and percentage. We performed principal component analysis, structural equation modelling, Chi-squared test (χ 2 /df), goodness-of-fit index (GFI), adjusted GFI, comparative fit index, and root mean square error of approximation.

    "Abstract": "Background and objective Face-to-face hospital induction has been reported to lead to information overload with poor knowledge retention. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has provided an opportunity to redesign the induction process, thereby taking it into the digital age. In this study, we aimed to discuss a comprehensive and effective approach toward the induction of medical students. Methods A video was filmed on an iPhone (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA), edited using the iMovie program (Apple Inc.), and shared with students before the start of the placement. It included a walk-through of the hospital and an explanation of educational opportunities. Pre- and post-placement questionnaires were distributed and focus groups were conducted. Results Our findings revealed that the participants strongly preferred virtual induction, feeling more confident about where to go, and who to contact, and better orientated on day one of their placement. They felt that being able to re-watch the induction at their convenience was invaluable. Discussion COVID-19 has brought about rapid digitalisation of medical services. The feedback from our study shows that virtual induction improved the well-being of students during their placement. By using easily accessible equipment, we have produced a useful resource that can be easily recreated by others.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Conference Start Date: 2022, June 18 Conference End Date: 2022, June 24 Conference Location: New Orleans, LA, USA Continual Learning (CL) research typically focuses on tackling the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. Catastrophic forgetting is associated with an abrupt loss of knowledge previously learned by a model when the task, or more broadly the data distribution, being trained on changes. In supervised learning problems this forgetting, resulting from a change in the model's representation, is typically measured or observed by evaluating the decrease in old task performance. However, a model's representation can change without losing knowledge about prior tasks. In this work we consider the concept of representation forgetting, observed by using the difference in performance of an optimal linear classifier before and after a new task is introduced. Using this tool we revisit a number of standard continual learning benchmarks and observe that, through this lens, model representations trained without any explicit control for forgetting often experience small representation forgetting and can sometimes be comparable to methods which explicitly control for forgetting, especially in longer task sequences. We also show that representation forgetting can lead to new insights on the effect of model capacity and loss function used in continual learning. Based on our results, we show that a simple yet competitive approach is to learn representations continually with standard supervised contrastive learning while constructing prototypes of class samples when queried on old samples.11The code to reproduce our results is publicly available at: https://github.com/rezazzr/Probing-Representation-Forgetting",

    "Abstract": "The current study investigates accent effects using virtual agents in the context of a multimedia learning environment. In a 2 (voice type: human, synthetic) x 2 (voice accent: English, Russian) between-subjects factorial design, the source and accent of the agent’s voice were manipulated. Research has shown that an instructor’s accent can have an impact on learning outcomes and perceptions of the instructor. However, these outcomes and perceptions have yet to be fully understood in the context of a virtual human instructor. Outcome measures collected included: knowledge retention, knowledge transfer, and cognitive load. Perception measures were collected using the Agent Persona Instrument-Revised, API-R, and a speaker-rating survey. Overall, there were no significant differences between the accented conditions. However, the synthetic condition had significantly lower knowledge retention, knowledge transfer, and mental effort efficiency than the professional voices in the human condition. Participants rated the human recordings higher on speaker-rating and API-R measures. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering the quality of the voice when designing multimedia learning environments.",

    "Abstract": "In the twenty-first century, the use of software is growing due to many applications requiring large and complex software. Many people do not realise that the use of software has influenced the operation of computer hardware to move indirectly as it affects the hardware’s energy consumption and carbon emissions. Previous studies focused more on models and tools to measure the impact of power consumption and energy efficiency from hardware than on software development studies. Energy consumption can be optimised by the greening software process throughout all phases of development activity. Besides, the current green software process models are more focused on environmental and economic elements and do not integrate with the waste elements in the development phase. Integrating sustainability and waste elements is essential to ensure that the development process complies with green process standards. A qualitative method is used through interviews involving eight informants from Malaysia’s public and private sectors. The objectives of the empirical study are to reveal the current practices of the green software process in industry, identify software process waste and determine green factors associated with the software process. The analysis is guided by a thematic approach using Atlas.ti 8 software. This paper describes the results from the qualitative study that consists of three main themes: best practices of a software process, nine software wastes (building the wrong feature, rework, unnecessarily complex solutions, extraneous cognitive load, psychological distress, waiting, knowledge loss, ineffective communication, delay), and six green factors (resources, people, organisational, technical, environmental, technology). The analysis findings indicate that the software industry needs elements of best practices, green practices, and software technologies in each development phase to produce a green and sustainable software process. The advancement of computing today presents technology as an essential factor in green elements to ensure that the software process is constantly updated and always green.",

    "Abstract": "As medication errors among nurses increase, nursing programs must adopt strategies and design instructional courses to promote pharmacology knowledge and knowledge retention among nursing students. The purpose of this study was to compare the difference in pharmacology knowledge acquisition among students who participated in a one credit-hour applied pharmacology course and students who did not participate in the course. Pharmacology knowledge acquisition was measured by proficiency levels and composite test scores on a standardized pharmacology test. The theoretical framework that guided the study was constructivist learning theory. A quantitative retrospective comparative design was used to determine pharmacology knowledge acquisition in senior-level nursing students after completing a one credit-hour applied pharmacology course. A nonprobability convenience sample composed of 241 senior-level nursing students who completed the proctored Assessment Technology Institute (ATI) Pharmacology test was used as the study sample. Retrospective data were retrieved by gathering participants' test scores and proficiency levels on the ATI 2016 RN Proctored Pharmacology Assessment. A chi-square test was conducted on the proficiency levels, and an independent t-test was conducted on the pharmacology assessment scores among students who were enrolled in the one credit-hour applied pharmacology course and students who were not enrolled in the course. Neither test revealed a statistically significant difference.

    "Abstract": "Defining complex piping specifications is a profitable business for ABB. However, key engineers with years of experience are approaching retirement, leaving a knowledge chasm. Can Artificial Intelligence (AI) be trained to capture and learn this expertise to help advise and augment the knowledge of junior engineers? A cross-functional team of scientists, manufacturing experts, and engineers produce Piping Specifications for ABB clients' new and existing projects. They are based on deep technical expertise which engineers have built over four decades of client engagements. Our AI solution unlocks and ingests this knowledge into a relational database. It uses an unsupervised association machine learning model (MLM) to understand what pipes and components were used in previous specifications based on various attributes. Given the constraints (i.e., fluid type, material, temperature, etc.), the engineer is presented with several recommendations detailing pipe configurations (i.e., the pipe standard, thickness, flanges, reducers, etc.) that have been most used in similar settings. The MLM is inherently interpretable following Explainable AI and the recommendations are presented in a human-centric, evidence-based web application which is hosted on an open hybrid multi-cloud platform. The AI solution supports ABB to capture and curate the wealth of knowledge that has been developed over several decades. This allows ABB to maintain and expand the piping specification offering with reduced costs while augmenting many future engineers. This solution is problem agnostic and has been built in a flexible and reusable manner, applicable to any industry where knowledge retention brings a crucial competitive advantage.",

    "Abstract": "Self-regulation is an important aspect of learning. Students who are capable of self-regulation, plan self-monitoring at different points during the process of knowledge acquisition to increase their likelihood of success and knowledge retention. Using self-monitoring, self-instruction, and self-evaluation processes enables students to become decisive in their learning. Previous studies have confirmed that self-regulated students have great success in college courses, and provided evidence for the positive benefits of self-regulation interventions. Still, nursing education lacks empirical research that focuses on self-regulation quality. The current study explored individual differences in third and fourth-year nursing students' perceptions of self-regulation profiles in Saudi Arabia before and after the use of a researcher developed self-regulation intervention. A quasi-experimental, pretest/posttest interventional design with a comparison group was used to achieve the aims of the study. A convenience sample of 306 third and fourth year Saudi nursing students participated in this study. The Self-Regulated Learning Scale in Clinical Practice was used to measure the variables of interest before and after the use of a self-regulation intervention taught in the classroom setting. The researcher developed a self-regulation intervention from the literature using learning plans and goal setting method. Data were collected at the start and end of the semester. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, independent t-test, Spearman rank correlation, and repeated measures ANOVA. This research provided preliminary empirical evidence for Saudi baccalaureate nursing students' perceptions of self-regulation within the applied theoretical framework of Meleis' (2015) Transitions Theory. The perception of self-regulation scores increased over the course of the semester for both groups, but there were statistically significant differences in the intervention group only. Therefore, the research hypothesis was accepted. These findings were discussed in light of previous research. Potential reasons for these findings were described. Identifying self-regulation profiles that contribute to behavioral and professional outcomes may assist nurse educators to enhance students' success by identifying students' needs, readiness to learn, and their use of learning strategies during college and thereafter. This study has implications for nursing science and research, nursing education, and practice. Findings of this study may assist nursing researchers to develop and use more sensitive instruments that accurately measure self-regulation. Also, nursing faculty are challenged with implementing self-regulation interventions that enhance and increase students' perceptions of self-regulation in clinical settings. Further testing of the self-regulation intervention provides support for the current findings. Recommendations for future research include the replication of this study using first and second year nursing students, conducting a longitudinal study and repeated measures to determine the ongoing and contextual approaches to learning self-regulation over time, and to assess the effect of gender differences on self-regulation perceptions.

This is primarily due to the lack of large-scale training data and the messy/unstructured nature of clinical notes as opposed to other domains where massive training data come in structured or semi -structured form. Further, one of the least explored and critical components of clinical text summarization is factual accuracy of clinical summaries. This is specifically crucial in the healthcare domain, cardiology in particular, where an accurate summary generation that preserves the facts in the source notes is critical to the well-being of a patient. In this study, we propose a framework for improving the factual accuracy of abstractive summarization of clinical text using knowledge-guided multi-objective optimization. We propose to jointly optimize three cost functions in our proposed architecture during training: generative loss, entity loss and knowledge loss and evaluate the proposed architecture on 1) clinical notes of patients with heart failure (HF), which we collect for this study; and 2) two benchmark datasets, Indiana University Chest X-ray collection (IU X-Ray), and MIMIC-CXR, that are publicly available. We experiment with three transformer encoder-decoder architectures and demonstrate that optimizing different loss functions leads to improved performance in terms of entity-level factual accuracy.",

    "Abstract": "Construction professionals need to understand collaboration within the context of jobsites. Consequently, many construction programs utilize learning activities to enable student learning of collaboration. One of those key learning activities used by construction programs is site visits. Although site visits are greatly beneficial for students, these present several challenges to be completed. This study centers on developing and testing a multiuser online system to support student learning of collaboration within the context of site visits. A case study virtual site visit was completed with 14 student dyads to understand collaboration in terms of teamwork perception, spatial visualization, and knowledge retention. It was found students perceived iVisit-Collaborate as a medium that supported effective teamwork with scores greater than five on a 7-point Likert scale. Furthermore, it was noticed the average student score 42% in spatial visualization and 64% in knowledge retention. However, it was observed that spatial visualization was not correlated to knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose > This paper aims to explore how the lived experience of online communities’ participants makes these communities evolve into online communities of practice (CoPs). Design/methodology/approach > A quantitative research design was used among backpackers. Data on backpackers’ lived experience and interactions were collected. Findings > The results suggest a process of how online communities can become genuine online CoPs, thanks to participants’ lived experience. Their activities (information search, perceived benefits and electronic word-of-mouth) result in knowledge sharing and creation. The findings also emphasize the roles of expertise and offline interactions as process moderators. Research limitations/implications > This study focuses on one specific practice to conduct the research (i.e. backpacking), which limits the generalizability of the results. Practical implications > This study offers several implications for companies and stakeholders. First, it describes how the lived experience transforms online communities into CoPs and helps stakeholders obtain knowledge for customers to innovate. Second, it analyzes the processes of participation, interaction and promotion to share and create knowledge for customers to increase stakeholders’ competitiveness. Third, this study integrates members’ offline interactions by highlighting their potential effects on tacit knowledge loss in online CoPs.

    "Abstract": "The lack of innovative employee performance in the automotive industry leads to failure when it comes to the execution of organizational strategies. Senior automotive managers are concerned with innovative employee performance, as it has the potential loss of knowledge and the skillset by the employee. Grounded in Vroom’s expectancy theory, the purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore strategies automotive managers use that encourage innovative employee performance. The participants were three senior automotive managers in Southeastern Michigan with at least three years of knowledge in employee work performance. Data were collected through semistructured interviews. Through thematic analysis, four themes were identified: (a) expectations, (b) communication strategies, (c) integrity, and (d) benchmarking. A key recommendation is for automotive managers to use multiple communication methods to engage staff and keep them informed. An implication for positive social change includes the potential to increase and accomplish community growth, encouraging development and innovation by helping stimulate economic growth with employment opportunities, continuing expansion, and long-term prosperity.",

    "Abstract": "While we might know anecdotally that the implementation of knowledge management in an organization improves job satisfaction and job performance, there are limited empirical studies that assess this assumption. There have been studies done in this area but the results vary in terms of which knowledge management processes have an impact upon job satisfaction and which do not. Similarly, many studies make assumptions that job satisfaction leads to improved job performance without testing for that variable. The goal of this dissertation is to assess whether the knowledge management processes have a positive impact upon job satisfaction and job performance and if job satisfaction itself impacts job performance. A secondary goal is to examine if the results vary based upon demographic factors such as job classification, location or functional group. This research is a survey-based, cross sectional quantitative study which examined knowledge management workers in one organization with multiple locations with a focus on North America but included other areas as well. Of the five knowledge management processes studied (acquisition, sharing, creation, codification and retention) only knowledge sharing and knowledge retention demonstrated a positive impact upon worker job satisfaction. This finding supports, in part, previous findings in other studies of the impact of knowledge management processes. Knowledge management worker job satisfaction overall showed a positive impact on worker job performance. Prior studies have made the assumption that there is a connection between job satisfaction and job performance without actually measuring this connection. This study, however, did measure this connection and verifies that a connection exists. Separately this study found that none of the five knowledge management processes individually showed a positive direct impact upon worker job performance when measured collectively or by job level. In a new finding, this study demonstrates that the impact of knowledge management processes on job satisfaction varies based upon job level, location, and functions.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Nearly two-thirds of military pregnancies are unintended, with 5.5% of military women experiencing unintended pregnancy in 2015. Education-based interventions are effective at improving contraceptive knowledge as well as contraceptive behaviors among military populations. However, traditional education-based interventions often require multiple hours or days of staff and participants’ time. Additionally, little is known about baseline contraceptive knowledge of Army service members. We assessed the impact of a one-hour contraceptive education course embedded within a same-day contraceptive clinic. Methods: Participants were recruited from a convenience sample of active-duty service members presenting for a scheduled bi-weekly contraceptive clinic. All service-members participating in the contraceptive clinic were offered the opportunity to participate in the contraceptive education course. Education course participants were asked to complete a pre and post intervention questionnaire. Pre and post course questionnaires included a validated 25-question contraceptive knowledge assessment and asked about preferred contraceptive method. The post-course survey included an additional validated 16-question contraceptive decision conflict scale. A control group consisted of active-duty Army women presenting for routine appointments to the same primary care clinic who did not complete the education course. The control group participants were asked to complete pre and post appointment questionnaires for contraceptive knowledge, preference, and decision conflict. Implementation of the contraceptive clinic and education course was qualitatively assessed using the RE-AIM evaluation model as described by Glasgow et al. Findings: Fourteen contraceptive class participants and ten control participants enrolled in the study and completed baseline surveys. Baseline contraceptive knowledge was similar between groups, with mean aggregate score of 13.58 out of a possible 25. The questions most frequently missed pertained to proper use of contraceptive methods, method side effects, and medical contraindications. Follow-up surveys were only completed by 4% of total study participants. As a result, change in contraceptive knowledge and preferred contraceptive method could not be assessed. In qualitative program evaluation, several threats to program adoption were identified at the provider and clinic level. Discussion: This study was unable to assess the primary outcome of change in contraceptive knowledge or preferred contraceptive method. However, it provides valuable information about specific contraceptive knowledge deficits among Army women. This information can be used to design future education interventions. Additional studies are needed to assess the impact of this contraceptive education program on contraceptive knowledge retention, contraceptive behaviors, and pregnancy.",

    "Abstract": "Background CPs and PPMVs are an important source of modern contraceptives in Nigeria, yet many lack the requisite knowledge and skills to capably provide these services. This skills gap might be addressed through targeted family planning (FP) training. This study measures family planning knowledge retention of CPs and PPMVs after receiving training in FP counseling and services in Kaduna and Lagos States, in Nigeria. Methods In a quasi-experimental longitudinal design without a comparison group, 559 CPs and PPMVs who were enrolled in the IntegratE project between January and December 2019, completed a self-administered questionnaire to assess their knowledge related to the provision of FP counseling, and injectable and implant contraceptive services at three points in time: 1) before the training; 2) immediately after the training; and 3) 9-months after the training in Kaduna and Lagos states, Nigeria. Adjusted multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effect of provider characteristics and receipt of job aids on FP knowledge retention 9 months after the training. 95% confidence intervals and p -values were used to assess statistical significance. Results Majority of study participants were females (60.3%) and between 30 and 49 years old (63.4%). The study revealed the importance of jobs aids as influence on knowledge retention. CPs and PPMVs who reported having the Balanced Counseling Strategy plus (BCS+) counseling cards, were more likely to retain knowledge (AOR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.01–8.40, p -value = 0.05) at 9 months follow-up. Similarly, in terms of knowledge of injectable contraceptives, CPs and Tier 2 PPMVs who reported receiving the Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) Wheel were 2.1 times more likely to retain knowledge of injectable contraceptives 9-months later on (95% CI: 1.14–3.99, p -value = 0.02). Conclusion Community Pharmacists and Proprietary Medicine Vendors had good retention of family planning knowledge, especially when combined with job aids. Training and providing them with job aids on FP will therefore support task shifting and task sharing on family planning services provision in Nigeria.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics are underutilized as an evidence-based treatment for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to determine if a web-based LAI education module changed advance practice prescribers’ knowledge, attitudes, and practice behaviors regarding LAI antipsychotics one month after receiving LAI education at a community-based mental health organization. Methods: This QI project was an observational pre- post-educational design. The 20-item Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) questionnaire was used to assess advanced practice providers’ knowledge retention, attitude changes, and practice modifications regarding LAI antipsychotics and prospective patient chart reviews were performed.Results: Participants (N = 17) included 14 nurse practitioners, two physician assistants, and one psychiatrist. Friedman tests and pairwise comparisons determined practices subsection KAP scores were statistically significantly different between pre- and posttest scores (p = .021). Total KAP, knowledge and attitudes subsection scores were determined by Friedman tests to be statistically insignificant (p > .05). An exact sign test and descriptive statistics determined there was an increase in LAIs prescribed in eight participants post-education, whereas six participants decreased LAIs prescribed post-education and three participants saw no improvement. There was no statistically significant median increase in LAIs prescribed (Mdn = 0.00) from pre-education (Mdn = 18.00) to post-education (Mdn = 19.00, p = .791).

    "Abstract": "The problem is generational attrition occurs at elevated rates, and seasoned employees depart with specific knowledge, leading to organizational knowledge loss. The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to examine the perceptions of baby boomer employees and leaders of baby boomer employees who participated in this study through exploring and identifying generational knowledge transfer and retention strategies at a large federal agency. The findings of this study may help strengthen the lack of the body of knowledge for large federal agencies who need to identify knowledge transfer and retention strategies to support succession planning efforts. This qualitative exploratory case study data was collected from the NIWC, Atlantic population through in-depth interviews of 14 baby boomer employees and 14 leaders of baby boomer employees, a review of TED TALK videos, and analysis through content analysis sheets archival data. Participants responded to questions about their experiences, perceptions, and thoughts regarding knowledge transfer and retention, benefits, challenges, and incentives to delay generational attrition to support succession planning efforts. Suggestions for future research and recommendations include interviewing Generation X, Y, and Z employee populations, seeking out government agencies well recognized for low attrition rates, and seeking out federal agencies with successful mentoring programs. These studies could be done with a mixed-method case study to include quantitative surveys to gauge interest in incentive programs and other benefits to delay retirement to provide time to focus on succession planning efforts.

    "Abstract": "This study describes how wearable devices can be used in elementary schools to compare some aspects of different teaching approaches. Upper arm wearables were used as an objective tool to compare three approaches when teaching science: (i) classical frontal teaching, (ii) embodied (kinesthetic) teaching, and (iii) a distance teaching approach. Using the wearables, the approaches were compared in terms of their impact on students’ psychological arousal and perceived well-being. In addition, short-term and long-term knowledge gain and physiological synchronization between teacher and students during the lecture were assessed. A synchronization index was defined to estimate the degree of physiological synchronization. During distance teaching, by means of measurements with wearables, students were significantly less physically active and significantly less psychologically aroused. Embodied teaching allowed significantly higher physical activation than during the other two approaches. The synchronization index for all three teaching approaches was positive with the highest values for distance and frontal teaching. Moreover, knowledge gain immediately after the embodied lessons was higher than after frontal lessons. No significant differences in the long-term knowledge retention between the three different teaching methods were found. This pilot study proved that wearables are a useful tool in research in the field of education and have the potential to contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in learning, even in complex environments such as an elementary school classroom.",

    "Abstract": "Gamification is “the use of game design elements in non-game contexts” (Deterding et al., 2011, p.2). Gamification has gained exponential interest within the research world in the past few years, probably due to the increased use of technology in various fields. Gamification has been found to increase the motivation and engagement of the targeted audience. Given the rise of emergency online instruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic that has seen schools closed to accommodate sanitary measures, this study looked at the potential benefit of gamification in an online teaching setting. This interventional comparative study was conducted using mixed methods and focused on the implementation of a gamified system in an online teaching setting for primary French as a Second Language (FSL) students. Through the analysis of class observations, satisfaction surveys, individual interviews, and knowledge tests, the study concluded that there was no significant difference in student satisfaction and knowledge retention between the control and the experimental (gamification) group. The notion of challenge appeared to be an important factor for student satisfaction in both groups. The researcher provided insights on the implementation of the gamified system and its evolution. The gamification components used in this study were: storyline, coins, and badges. It was concluded that the badges were the participants’ favorite component and that the storyline had potential for increased vocabulary acquisition. Lastly, findings regarding online teaching were presented such as the use of relaxation activities as well as students’ need for social interaction. Alternate abstract: La gamification (ou ludification) est l’utilisation d’éléments de jeux dans un contexte qui n’est pas le jeu (Deterding et al., 2011). L’intérêt pour la gamification dans le secteur de recherche a augmenté exponentiellement dans les dernières années, probablement dû au développement de l’utilisation de la technologie dans des secteurs variés. Les recherches démontrent que la gamification augmente la motivation et l’engagement de l’audience ciblée. Étant donné la hausse de l’éducation en ligne d’urgence due à la pandémie du Covid-19 qui a vu les écoles fermées urgemment pour respecter les mesures sanitaires, cette étude porte sur les bénéfices potentiels de la gamification dans un contexte d’enseignement en ligne, spécifiquement pour la satisfaction des élèves et la retenue de connaissances. Cette étude d’intervention comparative a été menée en utilisant des méthodes de recherches mixtes et se focalise sur l’implémentation d’un système de gamification pour l’enseignement du français langue seconde (FSL) en ligne à des élèves de primaire. À travers l’analyse d’observations de classes, d’études de satisfaction, d’interviews individuelles et de tests de connaissances, l’étude a conclu qu’il n’y avait pas de différence significative par rapport à la satisfaction des élèves et la retenue de connaissances entre le groupe de contrôle et le groupe expérimental (gamification). La notion de défi apparait comme un facteur important pour la satisfaction des élèves dans les deux groupes. La chercheuse a détaillé l’implémentation du système de gamification et son évolution. Les éléments de gamification utilisés dans cette étude étaient le scénario, les pièces et les badges. Il a été conclu que les badges étaient l’élément favoris des participants, et que le scenario avait un potentiel pour augmenter l’acquisition de vocabulaire. Pour finir, des résultats par rapport à l’enseignement en ligne ont été présentés, notamment l’implémentation d’activités de relaxation et le besoin d’interaction sociale des élèves.",

    "Abstract": "Students perceive crossword puzzles as enjoyable. In addition to students' perceptions, crossword puzzles actually improve knowledge retention. However, crossword puzzles increased exam scores for some students but not others. Recommendations have been made for students to create puzzles for their classmates to complete with the rationale that students are encouraged to research and understand the material in order to write meaningful clues for the puzzle. While students enjoy creating their own crossword puzzles, the association between students creating crossword puzzles and knowledge retention is unknown. The purpose of this project was to determine if creating crossword puzzles and completing peers' crossword puzzles were associated with improved knowledge retention indicated by higher scores on quizzes. Students in a research course from two institutions across three semesters had the option each week to upload a blank puzzle they created prior to completing each other's puzzles and taking a quiz. Quiz scores were compared between those who did versus did not create their own puzzles and complete their peers' puzzles. Results varied by institution and programs as well as the same program within the same institution but different semesters. Results highlight the importance of moving beyond student perceptions and towards assessing knowledge retention while taking into consideration institution, program, and semester.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: stroke is a major health problem. One of the factors of delay in care is the population's ignorance of the disease. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of the teaching of cerebrovascular accident in children who are attending compulsory primary education (EPO) at La Trinidad school in Córdoba. MethodologY: descriptive observational study. Through an anonymous questionnaire, the knowledge they presented before and after a 30-minute training session is investigated. Results: Two hundred and eighty-seven participants, 146 (50.9%) boys and 141 (49.1%) girls, divided into 12 different classes. After the intervention, we had a higher number of correct answers than non-correct answers in the questionnaire, and as P <0.01 in most of the questions in range 1 with respect to range 2 and 3, so the best age for knowledge retention is rank 2, 9-10 years. Conclusion: this work, despite its limitations, has shown that educational intervention on stroke improves students' level of knowledge.

    "Abstract": "Operational turnover is double-edged. On the one hand, operational turnover may lead to the infusion of necessary fresh perspectives, while on the other it can lead to undesirable loss of knowledge. Additionally, operational turnover can occur at multiple levels, including across supply chains, among executives and among front-line workers. Turnover, as it relates to operations management, is an under-studied and important domain to explore as it may be influenced by, or lead to changes in, pivotal operational performance measures. While many firms manage employee turnover in light of operational requirements, operational decisions of the firm themselves impact turnover rates. In aggregate, a firm’s operational decisions may impact the turnover rate which can, in turn impact the operational performance. Thus, both the operational antecedents to and consequences of turnover must be understood. This dissertation addresses these questions, with two essays that study the operational impacts of turnover and one that studies the operational antecedents of turnover using large scale data and econometric methods. The first and third essay look at performance following turnover of CEOs and suppliers, respectively. The second essay examines the impact of scheduling decisions on nurse-aide turnover.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose > The construction site operates under a hazardous environment that requires a high level of understanding in building systems to minimise accidents. However, the current building education generally adopts paper-based learning approaches that lack hands-on experiences. Furthermore, to achieve Industrial Revolution 4.0 in line with any unforeseen pandemic, the most optimum solution is to transition from physical to technological-based building education. This paper aims to address the problems by proposing a game-based virtual reality (GBVR) for building utility inspection training. Design/methodology/approach > The feasibility of the GBVR for building the utility inspection training approach is validated on a sample of undergraduate engineering students through user experience (survey) and performance-based comparisons against traditional paper-based training method. Findings > The results show that the developed GBVR training has higher system usability in terms of visual output and knowledge retention than paper-based training due to visualisation technologies. The GBVR training method has also higher user-friendliness because of the higher motivational and engagement factors through the adoption of virtual reality and game-based learning. Research limitations/implications > GBVR training required a longer training duration and achieved a lower performance score (effectiveness) but can be improved by transitioning into hands-on tasks. This study has the potentials to be extended to vocational training platforms for competency development in the construction workforce by using cutting-edge extended reality technologies. Originality/value > This paper portrays the benefits of integrating virtual reality technology in building education to overcome the low practicality and engagement of paper-based training.",

However, restricted computational resources associated with wearable devices, i.e., smartwatch, failed to directly support such advanced methods. To tackle this issue, this study introduces an end-to-end Vision-to-Sensor Knowledge Distillation (VSKD) framework. In this VSKD framework, only time-series data, i.e., accelerometer data, is needed from wearable devices during the testing phase. Therefore, this framework will not only reduce the computational demands on wearable devices, but also produce a learning model that closely matches the performance of the computational expensive multi-modal approach. In order to retain the local temporal relationship and facilitate visual deep learning models, we first convert time-series data to two-dimensional images by applying the Gramian Angular Field (GAF) based encoding method. We adopted multi-scale TRN with BN-Inception and ResNet18 as the teacher and student network in this study, respectively. A novel loss function, named Distance and Angle-wised Semantic Knowledge loss (DASK), is proposed to mitigate the modality variations between the vision and the sensor domain. Extensive experimental results on UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and Berkeley-MHAD datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed VSKD model which can be deployed on wearable devices.",

    "Abstract": "Challenging the notion of “teaching by telling,” active learning utilizes a student-oriented approach by emphasizing the concept of knowledge retention through peer interaction. To further examine the potential of active learning, we created a workshop based on didactic education and student collaboration. Participants included undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented and disadvantaged backgrounds. The workshop was part of our summer academic enrichment program run in an urban, medically underserved community. The workshop focused on clinical and biochemical nutrition, wherein students synthesized information by discussing dietary choices and the socioeconomic aspects of nutrition. Student reception of the workshop was adjudged by anonymous surveys. The survey questions were designed to gauge how the workshop objectives were achieved. Cronbach alpha (0.276) confirmed that there was more than a single theme contained in the questions. The majority of students (97%) agreed that the workshop met the learning objectives: (1) acquire basic clinical knowledge, (2) gain a better understanding of nutrition, (3) formulate a linkage between clinical nutrition and disease, and (4) benefit from peer interaction. Students’ performance in the post-quiz (100% correct answers) had improved significantly compared to the pre-quiz (25% correct answers) suggesting acquisition, understanding and application of nutrition aspects taught in the workshop. Overall, the present study demonstrated the engagement and understanding of students with respect to learning about nutrition and community health in an active learning setting. These types of active-learning-based sessions may have broad applicability for any academic discipline to improve student engagement and knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To assess the impact of an interprofessional case-based training programme to enhance clinical knowledge and confidence among clinicians working in high HIV-burden settings in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Setting Health professions training institutions and their affiliated clinical training sites in 12 high HIV-burden countries in SSA. Participants Cohort comprising preservice and in-service learners, from diverse health professions, engaged in HIV service delivery. Intervention A standardised, interprofessional, case-based curriculum designed to enhance HIV clinical competency, implemented between October 2019 and April 2020. Main outcome measures The primary outcomes measured were knowledge and clinical confidence related to topics addressed in the curriculum. These outcomes were assessed using a standardised online assessment, completed before and after course completion. A secondary outcome was knowledge retention at least 6 months postintervention, measured using the same standardised assessment, 6 months after training completion. We also sought to determine what lessons could be learnt from this training programme to inform interprofessional training in other contexts. Results Data from 3027 learners were collected: together nurses (n=1145, 37.9%) and physicians (n=902, 29.8%) constituted the majority of participants; 58.1% were preservice learners (n=1755) and 24.1% (n=727) had graduated from training within the prior year. Knowledge scores were significantly higher, postparticipation compared with preparticipation, across all content domains, regardless of training level and cadre (all p 6 months, knowledge and self-reported confidence scores were greater compared with precourse scores (all p<0.05). Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the largest interprofessional, multicountry training programme established to improve HIV knowledge and clinical confidence among healthcare professional workers in SSA. The findings are notable given the size and geographical reach and demonstration of sustained confidence and knowledge retention post course completion. The findings highlight the utility of interprofessional approaches to enhance clinical training in SSA.",

    "Abstract": "Background Antibiotic resistance is one of the main public health problems worldwide. One key tool to optimize antibiotic prescription is medical training. The aim of this study is to compare the impact of training in infectious diseases on students’ knowledge of the antibiotic resistance problem and the rational use of antibiotics. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study in the medical school of the University of Navarra. We conducted an anonymous in situ survey of students in each year of training. Data were analyzed grouping the students as follows: GROUP 1: first three years of education, no training in Clinical Microbiology (CM) or in Infectious Diseases (ID); GROUP 2: fourth-year students, training in CM but not ID; GROUP 3: Fifth and sixth-year students who have completed the training in CM and ID. Chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test when appropriate) was performed to evaluate potential associations. Wilcoxon’s test was used to compare the median correct answers between groups. We used Spearman’s test for correlation between year of training and performance in questionnaire. Results A total of 994 students respond to the survey, 80.4% of the eligible students. Almost all students who had completed infectious diseases training perceive antibiotic resistance as an important problem in comparison with students who had not completed the formation (99.5% in group 3 vs 94.5% in group 1, p = 0.02). Knowledge of antibiotic stewardship underwent a statistically significant change after training in infectious diseases (from 9.2% in group 1 to 52.2% in group 3, p < 0.001). In the training questions block we also found an increase in the average number of correct answers (21.4% in group 1 vs 44.7% in group 3, p < 0.001). When comparing the results of subgroups 3A and 3B we found a significant loss of knowledge as we moved away from training (49% vs 40.9%, p < 0.001). Conclusions The training of medical students is the key to improving both perception and knowledge of infectious diseases. However, we have an opportunity for educational improvement as far as infectious diseases are concerned, regarding both the acquisition of knowledge and its loss as time lapses after training.",

    "Abstract": "The notion of teaching experts' habits of mind (e.g., computational thinking and scientific thinking) to novices seems to have inspired many educators and researchers worldwide. In particular, a great deal of efforts has been invested in computational thinking (CT) and its manifestations in different fields. However, there remain some troubling spots in CT education as far as how to teach it at different levels of education. The same argument applies to teaching scientific thinking (ST) skills. A remedy has been suggested to narrow CT and ST skillsets down to core cognitive competencies so they can be introduced in early and middle grades and continue to be nurtured during secondary and post-secondary years. Neuroscientists suggest that the act of (computational) thinking is strongly linked to the acts of information storage/retrieval by our brain. Plus, years of research have shown that retrieval practices promote not only knowledge retention but also inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning. Not surprisingly, these reasoning skills are core elements of both CT and ST skillsets. This article will mesh the findings of a teacher professional development with the existing literature to lay a claim that retrieval practices enhance CT and ST skills. The study offered training to secondary school teachers ( n  = 275) who conducted classroom action research to measure the impact of retrieval practices on teaching and learning of STEM and CT concepts. We used a quasi-experimental research design with purposeful sampling and a sequential mixed-methods approach focusing on the impact of professional development on teacher outcomes and, in turn, on student outcomes. A survey of teacher participants showed that the majority (96%) of survey respondents ( n  = 232) reported a good understanding of retrieval strategies, and how relevant ideas can be implemented and tested in the classroom. A large number of action research (target-control) studies by teachers ( n  = 122) showed that students who learned STEM and CS concepts through retrieval practices consistently scored 5-30% higher than those using the usual blocked practice. In most cases, the difference was statistically significant ( p  < 0.05). While the study contributes to retrieval practices literature, those looking for best practices to teach core CT and ST skills should benefit from it the most. The study concludes with some recommendations for future research based on the limitations of its current findings.The notion of teaching experts' habits of mind (e.g., computational thinking and scientific thinking) to novices seems to have inspired many educators and researchers worldwide.

The use of automated devices to support CPR training through real-time feedback are considered an important educational tool, optimizing CPR skills acquisition and knowledge retention. Considering this educational need, this paper presents the development of a controlled-cost feedback device for CPR training, with focus on chest compression quality. Several sensory approaches were tested for functionality and performance, leading to the selection of a digital infrared sensor combined with a piezoresistive pressure sensor. This approach showed a good response and robustness to chest compressions during CPR training, providing accurate assessment of specific parameters of chest compressions. Usability testing, mimicking a training-like situation, showed promising results and confirmed the applicability of this approach to real-time training or post-training analysis. It is expected that the proposed solution could provide an alternative or a complementary tool for CPR skills acquisition and maintenance, promoting regular training and to a broader population.",

    "Abstract": "Simulation technologies are used in simulation-based education however retention of knowledge, skills, and abilities have yet to be determined. This study evolved from areas of research that do not adequately show or address measurements of retention of knowledge, skills, and abilities in the professional environments after training with simulation technologies. The research question was what is the perception of health care professional’s long-term retention of KSAs using simulation technologies ? A generic qualitative analysis was best for investigating and developing an understanding of individual experiences and identifying how those experiences affected perceptions of the participants. The participants in the study were health care professionals who had participated in simulation-based education using simulation technologies within the last 2 to 5 years. Eleven participants were interviewed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using the VOIP Zoom Meeting platform. After the interviews, analysis of the data, coding and theming were conducted. The analysis produced 3 themes from the data collected. The first theme is retention of knowledge, skills, and abilities; second theme is realism of simulation technologies; and the third theme is confidence in learning and practicing. The findings of the research provided the foundation for future research in simulation technologies and how retention is affected. Participants explained that KSA’s were affected positively with the use of simulation technologies, had positive perceptions with the use of simulation technologies and indicated comfort and confidence levels increased. However, there needs to be more studies conducted at different intervals to provide more concise data collection and results for providing more analysis.",

    "Abstract": "Many residency programs utilize passive didactic lectures despite mixed evidence for knowledge retention. This prospective study investigated the efficacy of \"relay,\" an active-learning technique, as measured by residents' knowledge retention and attitudes compared to traditional format. Introduction Many residency programs utilize passive didactic lectures despite mixed evidence for knowledge retention. This prospective study investigated the efficacy of \"relay,\" an active-learning technique, as measured by residents' knowledge retention and attitudes compared to traditional format.Faculty presented lectures to four family medicine residency programs on a randomized schedule. Lectures were followed by a 15-minute question-and-answer (Q&A) session or relay session. A relay is a collaborative, question-based game. The primary outcome was knowledge retention at 3 months, comparing Q&A to relay sessions as measured by a multiple-choice assessment. Responses were only included if a given resident completed knowledge assessments for both Q&A and relay sessions, to allow for intraresident adjustments, in addition to program, training year, and lecturer/topic. Secondary outcomes included residents' self-perceived knowledge and engagement as surveyed by an ordinal scale immediately following the learning session.

    "Abstract": "Objectives The WHO developed a 5-day basic emergency care (BEC) course using the traditional lecture format. However, adult learning theory suggests that lecture-based courses alone may not promote long-term knowledge retention. We assessed whether a mobile application adjunct (BEC app) can have positive impact on knowledge acquisition and retention compared with the BEC course alone and evaluated perceptions, acceptability and barriers to adoption of such a tool. Design Mixed-methods prospective cohort study. Participants Adult healthcare workers in six health facilities in Tanzania who enrolled in the BEC course and were divided into the control arm (BEC course) or the intervention arm (BEC course plus BEC app). Main outcome measures Changes in knowledge assessment scores, self-efficacy and perceptions of BEC app. Results 92 enrolees, 46 (50%) in each arm, completed the BEC course. 71 (77%) returned for the 4-month follow-up. Mean test scores were not different between the two arms at any time period. Both arms had significantly improved test scores from enrolment (prior to distribution of materials) to day 1 of the BEC course and from day 1 of BEC course to immediately after BEC course completion. The drop-off in mean scores from immediately after BEC course completion to 4 months after course completion was not significant for either arm. No differences were observed between the two arms for any self-efficacy question at any time point. Focus groups revealed five major themes related to BEC app adoption: educational utility, clinical utility, user experience, barriers to access and barriers to use. Conclusion The BEC app was well received, but no differences in knowledge retention and self-efficacy were observed between the two arms and only a very small number of participants reported using the app. Technologic-based, linguistic-based and content-based barriers likely limited its impact.",

Objective Care of the critically ill child is a rare but stressful event for emergency medical services (EMS) providers. Simulation training can improve resuscitation care and prehospital outcomes but limited access to experts, simulation equipment, and cost have limited adoption by EMS systems. Our objective was to form a statewide collaboration to develop, deliver, and evaluate a pediatric critical care simulation curriculum for EMS providers.We describe a statewide collaboration between five academic centers to develop a simulation curriculum and deliver it to EMS providers. Cases were developed by the collaborating PEM faculty, reviewed by EMS regional directors, and based on previously published EMS curricula, a statewide needs assessment, and updated state EMS protocols. The simulation curriculum was comprised of 3 scenarios requiring recognition and acute management of critically ill infants and children. The curriculum was implemented through 5 separate education sessions, led by a faculty lead at each site, over a 6 month time period. We evaluated curriculum effectiveness with a prospective, interventional, single-arm educational study using pre-post assessment design to assess the impact on EMS provider knowledge and confidence. To assess the intervention effect on knowledge scores while accounting for nested data, we estimated a mixed effects generalized regression model with random effects for region and participant. We assessed for knowledge retention and self-reported practice change at 6 months post-curriculum. Qualitative analysis of participants' written responses immediately following the curriculum and at 6 month follow-up was performed using the framework method.

We assessed for knowledge retention and self-reported practice change at 6 months post-curriculum. Qualitative analysis of participants' written responses immediately following the curriculum and at 6 month follow-up was performed using the framework method.Overall, 78 emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and 109 paramedics participated in the curriculum over five separate sessions. Most participants were male (69%) and paramedics (58%). One third had over 15 years of clinical experience. In the regression analysis, mean pediatric knowledge scores increased by 9.8% (95% CI: 7.2%, 12.4%). Most (93% [95% CI: 87.2%, 96.5%]) participants reported improved confidence caring for pediatric patients. Though follow-up responses were limited, participants who completed follow up surveys reported they had used skills acquired during the curriculum in clinical practice.

    "Abstract": "A expatriação é uma oportunidade de auferir conhecimento no exterior e a repatriação representa a possibilidade de o indivíduo disseminar e aplicar esse conhecimento na organização. A organização, por sua vez, pode reter o conhecimento, aprimorar seus processos e aumentar seu capital intelectual. O expatriado é importante como fonte de capital humano e para a transferência de conhecimento. Contudo, verifica-se uma lacuna de estudos com o objetivo de investigar questões estratégicas resultantes do processo de expatriação, principalmente referente às questões estratégicas que envolvam retenção do conhecimento. O objetivo desta pesquisa é identificar e compreender a retenção de conhecimentos por expatriados brasileiros e a análise é o indivíduo. Trata-se de um estudo qualitativo, realizado com vinte expatriados brasileiros, tendo como unidade de análise, o indivíduo. A coleta de dados foi realizada por meio de entrevistas individuais com roteiro semiestruturado e aconteceram no modo virtual. Os resultados apresentam um conjunto de aprendizados resultantes da expatriação, com efeitos para os indivíduos, para o grupo que compartilhar relações de trabalho e para as organizações. Este estudo contribuiu para o campo da Gestão do Conhecimento, no sentido de ampliar o conhecimento em torno de conhecimentos retidos provenientes de experiências vividas por expatriados. Como limitação do estudo, destaca-se o fato de todos os expatriados terem sido expatriados para a África. Sugere-se que futuros estudos ampliem o destino dos expatriados, o que pode ampliar os tipos de aprendizados durante a expatriação. Alternate abstract: Expatriation is an opportunity to gain knowledge abroad and repatriation represents the possibility for the individual to disseminate and apply this knowledge in the organization. The organization, in turn, can retain knowledge, improve its processes and increase its intellectual capital. The expatriate is important as a source of human capital and for the transfer of knowledge. However, there is a gap in studies aimed at investigating strategic issues resulting from the expatriation process, mainly referring to strategic issues that involve knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "To evaluate the immediate and sustained knowledge retention and sense of self-efficacy of homecare nurses following completion of a standardized competency-based tracheostomy education course. Safe discharge of children requiring tracheostomy with or without ventilation relies on the competence of homecare nurses. Objective To evaluate the immediate and sustained knowledge retention and sense of self-efficacy of homecare nurses following completion of a standardized competency-based tracheostomy education course. Safe discharge of children requiring tracheostomy with or without ventilation relies on the competence of homecare nurses.Pragmatic, randomized controlled trial of 44 homecare nurses. Participants were randomized into the intervention group ( n = 21), which received the tracheostomy course, or the control group ( n = 23), which received an enterostomy and vascular access course. Multiple-choice question (MCQ) knowledge assessments and self-efficacy questionnaires were administered to both groups pre-course and post-course at 6 week, 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month follow-ups. Study Design Pragmatic, randomized controlled trial of 44 homecare nurses. Participants were randomized into the intervention group (n = 21), which received the tracheostomy course, or the control group (n = 23), which received an enterostomy and vascular access course. Multiple-choice question (MCQ) knowledge assessments and self-efficacy questionnaires were administered to both groups pre-course and post-course at 6 week, 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month follow-ups.Twenty participants in the intervention group and 19 in the control group were included. Four withdrew from the study and two crossed over from the control into the intervention arm. The change in mean self-efficacy scores (total score = 100) was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group at 6 weeks (intervention (mean ± SD): 18.6 ± 14.5; control: 6.6 ± 20.4; p = 0.04) and 3 months (intervention: 19.6 ± 14.2; control: 5.2 ± 17.0; p = 0.007), and trended higher at 6 months (intervention: 18.0 ± 14.5; control: 6.9 ± 24.1; p = 0.1). The change in mean MCQ assessment scores (total score = 20) trended higher in the intervention group than in the control group at 6 weeks (intervention (mean ± SD): 1.8 ± 2.2; control: 1.6, ± 2.9; p = 0.8).

    "Abstract": "A cultural ritual is a central tenet of one’s identity that can only truly continue through active participation by interested members. Chinese New Year is a cultural festival overflowing with cultural rituals and thousands of years of cultural history, yet a growing number of younger generations are forgoing celebrating the festival altogether. This is the result of a number of factors including loss of knowledge, personal connection, and relatability among rituals practiced in one’s parent’s generation. I believe that cultural continuation rests in individuals continuing to celebrate rituals in a way that is relatable to one’s identity and thus perpetuating rituals into modernity through constant adaptations. I designed a party service design that welcomes people — regardless of their identity or level of familiarity — into Chinese New Year celebrations and rituals. The party service design consists of an illustrated autoethnographic zine, a ritual & customs card set, and a cultural reflection guestbook. Through my party service design, I encourage people to explore how their own personal identities have uniquely shaped their cultural celebrations, educate my audience about Chinese New Year rituals, and inspire my audience to imagine how we might engage with both new and familiar rituals. The hope is that the party service design makes traditions more accessible and allows interested members to decide for themselves what way of celebrating is best for them. This will then encourage people to continually engage with the rituals; thus, aiding its survival for future generations.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge is the primary factor for firm creativity that is mostly embedded in employees. Meanwhile, R&D employee mobility is quite frequently in high technology firms. This situation suggests a critical management task of firm creativity and innovation: how to retain the knowledge of the current R&D employee and benefit from the knowledge brought by new R&D employees to improve firm creativity. Based on extant studies which found that the collaboration network correlated with employees’ knowledge retention, knowledge flow, and cognitive lock-in this article proposed that the characteristics of a firm's co-inventive network and industrial co-inventive network moderate the influence of R&D employees’ mobility on firm creativity. Empirical results based on the Chinese firms’ invention patents in the information and communication technology industry demonstrate that the highly connected firm's co-inventive networks impair the damage of R&D employees’ outward mobility to firm creativity. Moreover, the firm's low degree of centrality in the industrial co-inventive network decreases the contribution of R&D employees’ inward mobility to firm creativity, and the firm's low betweenness centrality in the industrial co-inventive network helps it obtain the benefit from R&D employees’ inward mobility.

    "Abstract": "Architects and urbanists help to shape the built environment, which is both highly impactful and indispensable to support the sustainable development of any society. Hence, they must not only have a basic understanding but also be trained to routinely incorporate sustainability checks into their design practice. Published pedagogical experience with teaching life cycle assessment (LCA) in higher education usually covers students with engineering backgrounds, often at the graduate level. No records of regular courses for architecture and urbanism undergraduates were found. After eight years of teaching, and involving 213 students, this paper shares experience and insights gained in the only undergraduate architecture and urbanism course in Brazil openly dedicated to teaching LCA and circular design metrics within the design studio atmosphere. To encourage and inspire other initiatives, the article emphasizes the last four course offers. The current course design is aligned with recent recommendations and international practice. Still, the total workload is insufficient to adequately tackle complex design objects. Students’ final grades across different years show improvements, but actual knowledge retention evaluation requires some post-course follow-up. We confirmed that undergraduate students can successfully apply LCA during design development with compatible additional effort if equipped with adequate tools. An online calculator was developed and is expected to allow expanded design experimentations in future editions.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To standardize health education about low carbohydrate diets, portion size control, and nutritional label literacy in an outpatient setting to increase patient’s knowledge and facilitate behavior change as a means to better manage Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a growing public health concern that affects nearly 29 million and now is the seventh leading cause of death in U.S. residents; 10% of U.S. residents were T2DM-affected in 2017, as many as 33% may be affected by 2025. Standardization of nutritional education for diabetes management can improve health outcomes and achieve glycemic control. Nutritional interventions focused on calorie reduction, and minimal carbohydrate intake are recognized to be the basis of treatment. Methods: Participants (n=14) received standardized evidence-based nutrition education intervention focused on a low carbohydrate diet, portion size control, and nutrition label literacy within a primary care setting. Participants had an eight-week follow up visit with the same provider to reinforce subject matter and collect data. The primary outcome of the intervention was HgbA1c, and secondary outcomes were knowledge retention, improved BMI, and improved TTM stage of change which were measured at the baseline and eight-week follow-up visit. Patient satisfaction were also measured at eight-week follow up. Results: Of the 14 participants, nine showed lower HgbA1c at the post-intervention visit, one showed no change, and four showed a higher measurement; with mean and median measures of 7.53% (SD 0.90) and 7.2%, respectively. Changes in knowledge score between the pre and post intervention visits were positive, meaning participants either scored the same or higher of up to six points increase on their post-intervention score. Specifically, the mean of the pre- and post-intervention knowledge scores were 5.7 (SD 1.48) and 7.3 (SD 2.02), respectively, and the difference in knowledge across individuals was 1.64 (SD=1.5). No statistical significance in pre and post intervention for BMI. Overall, positive feedback was received on the patient satisfaction survey. Conclusions and Implications: Implementing a standardized, low-cost approach to include nutritional education focusing on portion size control, nutrition label literacy, and low carbohydrate in primary care may help achieve glycemic control. Focusing on preventive care may sustain potential return of investment through limited expenditures on specialty care services.",

    "Abstract": "Objective Evaluate the change in participant emergency care knowledge and skill confidence after implementation of the WHO-International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Basic Emergency Care (BEC) course. Design Pretest/post-test quasi-experimental study. Setting Mechnikov Hospital in Dnipro, Ukraine. Participants Seventy-nine participants engaged in the course, of whom 50 (63.3%) completed all assessment tools. The course was open to healthcare providers of any level who assess and treat emergency conditions as part of their practice. The most common participant profession was resident physician (24%), followed by health educator (18%) and prehospital provider (14%). Interventions The 5-day WHO-ICRC BEC course. Primary and secondary outcome measures Change in pre-course and post-course knowledge and skill confidence assessments. Open-ended written feedback was collected upon course completion and analysed for common themes. Results Participant knowledge assessment scores improved from 19 (IQR 15–20) to 22 (IQR 19–23) on a 25-point scale (p<0.001). Participant skill confidence self-assessment scores improved from 2.5 (IQR 2.1–2.8) to 2.9 (IQR 2.5–3.3) on a 4-point scale (p<0.001). The most common positive feedback themes were high-quality teaching and useful skill sessions. The most common constructive feedback themes were translation challenges and request for additional skill session time. Conclusions This first implementation of the WHO-ICRC BEC course for front-line healthcare providers in Ukraine was successful and well received by participants. This is also the first report of a BEC implementation outside of Africa and suggests that the course is also effective in the European context, particularly in humanitarian crisis and conflict settings. Future research should evaluate long-term knowledge retention and the impact on patient outcomes. Further iterations should emphasise local language translation and consider expanding clinical skills sessions.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this phenomenological study was to understand perceptions held by School Resource Officers (SROs) of their personal ability to intervene during a mental health crisis on campus. SROs are uniquely positioned to quickly identify and intervene during a mental health crisis situation if properly training. Currently, training mandated for South Carolina SROs does not contain de-escalation skills and leaves officers with low confidence of their ability, based on training, to adequately intervene. While crisis intervention training is available to officers, such as Crisis Intervention Team (CIT), it does not address students in the educational setting. Crisis intervention training in the school setting is crucial to stem the tide of ever-increasing numbers of students with mental illness being inappropriately referred to the criminal justice system, expelled from school, hospitalized or, in many cases, a combination of all of these. Furthermore, the training must be presented in a method resulting in the highest level of knowledge retention and self-confidence by the officer employing the training in real-life situations. Utilizing an anonymous online survey and interviews, this research discovered significant role ambiguity among 13 participants. A lack of adequate crisis intervention training as well as the lack of collaboration between SROs and schools to develop response protocols during mental health crisis episodes were also noted. Although participants desired training, the study found SROs perceived a lack of training with regards to the handling of students experiencing a mental health crisis. Lacking proper training and protocols, officers lacked critical support needed to help all students in the schools, perpetuating the school to prison pipeline. Additional research is needed to further discover methods to adequately equip SROs in the collaborative effort to help students. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

BACKGROUND The management of patients' holistic symptom needs are often complex and challenging. The education needs of undergraduate nursing students must be optimally addressed to have a significant positive impact on patient care. Mobile spaced learning has been recognised as a form of online education which can provide a novel approach to delivering effective evidence based healthcare education to undergraduate students.The objective of this pilot study was to explore the experiences of undergraduate nursing students in a university setting, of using mobile spaced learning as a digital platform for symptom management education. OBJECTIVE The objective of this pilot study was to explore the experiences of undergraduate nursing students in a university setting, of using mobile spaced learning as a digital platform for symptom management education.This pilot study used a mixed methods approach. Online spaced learning material, which utilised both case based scenarios and multiple choice questions, was delivered to first year undergraduate nursing students over a period of 2 weeks. Participants were then invited to participate in an online survey related to the usability of mobile spaced learning. A focus group was conducted to further explore the participants' views.

    "Abstract": "The study explores how collaborative based exams (CLBE) affect specified learning outcomes in an Accounting Theory course for final year 'accounting major' students. The study proposes Accounting Theory as an avenue to improve the qualitative and problem-solving skills of accounting students and collaborative learning (CL) as a mechanism to enhance students' teamwork skills. The study uses a mixed-methods approach, applying a quantitative method in analysing the relationships and then using focus groups to gain insights about students' reaction to CL and collaborative based exams (CLBE). The results confirm that collaborative based exams (CLBE) after a CL mechanism significantly and comparatively improves students' qualitative and problem-solving based exam scores, reduces pre-exam anxiety and enhances knowledge retention. Both low performing and high CGPA students benefited from CL and collaborative based exams (CLBE). Students, even though appreciative of the visible benefits of CL, contested a group-based grading system, and female students revealed gender biases within group dynamics. This study is the first application of inter and intragroup dependent exam constructs within collaborative based exams (CLBE).",

    "Abstract": "Agricultural education is critical in addressing complex problems around food and agriculture systems. One such method for educating citizens about agriculture is postsecondary agricultural education programming. Specifically, experiential learning is widely used at the post-secondary level to achieve powerful, goal-oriented, academic learning. However, college faculty are often hired for their content expertise, not necessarily their pedagogical skills and experience. In a needs assessment of teaching competencies conducted on college faculty of agricultural and life sciences, some of the highest ranked needs of faculty included getting students engaged in learning, teaching critical thinking, questioning techniques, and active learning strategies, all of which can be accomplished though experiential learning approaches. Therefore, the purpose of this dissertation is to examine the effects of experiential learning approaches when used in a post-secondary agricultural education setting. Specifically, this study will examine the effects of reflection and application methods on students' knowledge gains, knowledge retention, and knowledge transfer. Data were collected from an undergraduate, introductory animal science laboratory course in which 123 students participated. This study employed a 3x2 factorial ANCOVA design which included the independent variables of reflection mode and transfer level and the three dependent variables of students' content knowledge, post-course retention, and transfer skills. A pre-test was given to be used as a covariate to control for students' prior knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "The New Jersey Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (NJ EFNEP) is a federally funded program that focuses on serving diverse, low-income families across the state. After the 2015 national EFNEP meeting, where it was emphasized that outreach to older youth, i.e., teenage children ranging from 13 to 18 years old (teens), was inadequate, the NJ EFNEP staff focused on this objective. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that education curricula addressing teens' nutrition and physical activity issues were scarce. The purpose of this dissertation was to develop and evaluate an evidence-based nutrition and physical activity curriculum to use with EFNEP teens. A comprehensive 5-phase model (Figure 4.1) was created to guide the curriculum's development, using best practices and lessons learned from previous curricula development experiences. It provides applications of these steps and considerations for effective implementation during each phase, (i.e., activities entailing formative research and process evaluation, and key activities required for summative or outcome assessment), and flexibility in case of conflict with program policies, funding limitations, etc.The curriculum development methods closely followed the steps listed in the model. During the pilot test, qualitative impacts were collected using face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with participating teens. Teens (n=24) reported making behavior changes after attending the lessons providing evidence of the curriculum's effectiveness. Most teens reported making >1 behavior change and changed behaviors in an average of three key topic areas. Moreover, teens reported a number of changes in behavioral antecedents, such as their attitudes, social norms, and perceived barriers to behavior modifications. Researchers also observed increased knowledge regarding the key topics among the teens. Lastly, the author of this dissertation provided recommendations for curriculum improvements based on the findings from interviews conducted with high school teachers (n=6) and NJ EFNEP educators (n=9) as a part of the curriculum's process evaluation. Improvements were suggested to: enhance teens' knowledge retention; improve classroom management and discipline; increase communication with teachers so they may be better informed as to how they may assist the educators, and manage activity timings during class periods. Other suggestions made were to modify specific lessons' content.Future research that may follow this dissertation warrants quantitative assessment of the teen curriculum using a suitable questionnaire that inquires on curriculum's impacts in its entirety. An implication of this research was to provide researchers and professionals with a structured model for the adoption or development of new, evidence-based nutrition education curricula.

Many processes are operated sub-optimally due to the effect of sensor calibration drift, whereby over time in the process the thermometer output is changed by environmental factors including, but not limited to, high temperature, vibration, ionizing radiation and contamination which result in a progressive loss of knowledge of the true process temperature. Here we describe a number of new developments aimed at overcoming sensor calibration drift by providing assured temperature measurement in-process. New techniques include self-validating thermometers, embedded temperature reference standards, and practical primary thermometry where the temperature is measured directly without recourse to sensor calibration.",

    "Abstract": "Background Mass chemical exposure emergencies are infrequent but can cause injury, illness, or loss of life for large numbers of victims. These emergencies can stretch and challenge the available resources of healthcare systems within the community. Political unrest in the Middle East, including chemical terrorist attacks against civilians in Syria and increasing chemical industry accidents, have highlighted the lack of hospital preparedness for chemical incidents in the region. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a course designed to empower frontline healthcare providers involved in mass casualty incidents with the basic knowledge and essential operational skills for mass chemical exposure incidents in Saudi Arabia. Methods A mixed-methods approach was used to develop a blended learning, simulation enhanced, competency-based course for major chemical incidents for front line healthcare providers. The course was designed by experts from different disciplines (disaster medicine, poisoning / toxicology, and Hazard Material Threat - HAZMAT team) in four stages. The course was piloted over five days at the Officers Club of the Ministry of Interior (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). The 41 participants were from different government health discipline sectors in the country. Pre- and post-tests were used to assess learner knowledge while debriefing sessions after the decontamination triage session and simulation-enhanced exercises were used for team performance assessment. Results The overall knowledge scores were significantly higher in the post-test (69.47%) than the pre-test (46.3%). All four knowledge domains also had significant differences between pre- and post-test results. There were no differences in the pre and post-test scores for healthcare providers from the different health disciplines. A one-year post-event survey demonstrated that participants were satisfied with their knowledge retention. Interestingly, 38.3% had the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice in relation to mass chemical exposure incidents. Conclusion Delivering a foundation level competency-based blended learning course with enhanced simulation training in major chemical incidents for front line healthcare providers may improve their knowledge and skills in response to such incidents. This in turn can improve the level of national preparedness and staff availability and make a crucial difference in reducing the health impacts among victims.",

    "Abstract": "Professional development is a critical component in organizations today. Many organizations dedicate a significant amount of time and money to focusing on this topic. Professional development serves multiple purposes for organizations, including employee retention, developing a learned workforce, safety, building a strong culture, and career progression within the company, to name a few. This qualitative case study looks at adult learning theories and their importance in a professional development program by exploring employee experiences. This case study examined employee experiences currently employed with CSI Concrete. Open-ended questions were asked in the form of questionnaires, interviews, and a focus group. The adult learning theory-centric open-ended questions explicitly focused on employee experiences to reveal if adult learning theory elements played an important role in their experiences. These elements were motivation, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, active experimentation, readiness to learn, orientation to learning, proximal development, and repetition. The findings from this study revealed many things, including direct relationships between these elements and the participant's experiences and increased knowledge transfer when elements were present in their experiences. Also, participants showed long-term knowledge retention when some of these elements were present during the experience. Findings from participants' experiences show that elements of adult learning theories should be present in professional development programs to increase the positive effects professional development can have on an organization. Some of these positive effects include positive knowledge transfer and increased knowledge transfer retention.",

Furthermore, the complexity of these exposed systems as well as the adversaries’ sophisticated technical arsenal makes it increasingly difficult to plan and implement an organization’s defense. Understanding the link between specific attacks and effective mitigating measures is particularly challenging – as is understanding the underlying information security concepts. To support the training of current, and more importantly, nascent security engineers, we propose PenQuest, a digital attack and defense game where an attacker attempts to compromise an abstracted IT infrastructure and the defender works to prevent or mitigate the threat. The game is based on MITRE ATT&CK, D3FEND, and the NIST SP 800-53 security standard and incorporates a multitude of concepts such as cyber kill chains, attack vectors, network segmentation, and more. PenQuest is built to support security education and risk assessment and was evaluated with a class of engineering students as well as independent security experts. Initial results show a significant increase in knowledge retention and attest to the game’s feasibility for educational use.",

    "Abstract": "While cadaver dissection and prosection are deemed quintessential methods for studying anatomy, these methods are attenuated by the flat, 2-D structures incorporated into didactic segments of the anatomy courses that minimize students' ability to comprehend anatomy, leading to constraints in the teaching and learning experience. Several tools, such as 3-D virtual anatomy apps and anatomical models, enhance teaching and students' understanding of gross human anatomy. The Anatomage, a virtual anatomy dissection table (VDT), is a compelling technological development with dissection capabilities and a prosection of the human body and its segments. This study intends to explore incorporating a VDT into a physical therapy anatomy course as an enhanced anatomical learning technique. The methods encompass the inclusion of the VDT as an extra dissection table within the cadaver lab setting. Each group of scholars was required to locate the anatomical configurations and dissections assigned to the topic on the VDT. The anatomy course included four examinations covering the entire human body. The results suggest advancements in knowledge retention following the incorporation of VDT in the cadaver dissection portion of the course. Therefore, we ascertained that the VDT is an exemplary tool to adopt in anatomy courses to aid in the comprehension of complex anatomical structures. Integrating VDT is paramount to the assimilation and application of human anatomy in students' future health careers.",

    "Abstract": "Polarized light imaging (PLI) is a new method which quantifies and visualizes nerve fiber direction. In this study, the educational value of PLI sections of the human brainstem were compared to histological sections stained with Luxol fast blue (LFB) using e-learning modules. Mental Rotations Test (MRT) was used to assess the spatial ability. Pre-intervention, post-intervention, and long-term (1 week) anatomical tests were provided to assess the baseline knowledge and retention. One-on-one electronic interviews after the last test were carried out to understand the students' perceptions of the intervention. Thirty-eight medical students, (19 female and 19 males, mean age 21.5 ± SD 2.4; median age: 21.0 years) participated with a mean MRT score of 13.2 ± 5.2 points and a mean pre-intervention knowledge test score of 49.9 ± 11.8%. A significant improvement in both, post-intervention and long-term test scores occurred after learning with either PLI or LFB e-learning module on brainstem anatomy (both P < 0.001). No difference was observed between groups in post-intervention test scores and long-term test scores (P = 0.913 and P = 0.403, respectively). A higher MRT-score was significantly correlated with a higher post-intervention test score (r[subscript k] = 0.321; P < 0.05, respectively), but there was not a significant association between the MRT- and the long-term scores (r[subscript k] = -0.078; P = 0.509). Interviews (n = 10) revealed three major topics: Learning (brainstem) anatomy by use of e-learning modules; The \"need\" of technological background information when studying brainstem sections; and Mnemonics when studying brainstem anatomy. Future studies should assess the cognitive burden of cross-sectional learning methods with PLI and/or LFB sections and their effects on knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we investigated whether playing an escape room game after explicit instruction (instruction-first group, N = 20) is more effective to learn about copyright and media law than playing the game before explicit instruction (problem-solving-first group, N = 21). This is an important question as escape room games are complex, problem-based learning environments that can overwhelm learners and thus hinder the acquisition of knowledge and skills. According to cognitive load theory, preparing learners with explicit instruction before problem-solving activities can overcome this problem leading to better learning. However, in the productive failure paradigm problem-solving before explicit instruction is seen as more effective, especially when it comes to the application of newly acquired knowledge to solve novel problems. Based on these two theories, we conducted an experiment and found that playing the developed digital escape room game after explicit instruction was more effective for knowledge retention and domain-specific self-efficacy with at the same time lower cognitive load. However, we found no differences regarding the application of knowledge as both groups scored equally high on transfer tasks. The result is discussed considering previous productive failure studies mostly conducted in the science and engineering domain. In sum, the instruction first approach proved to be effective for both knowledge acquisition and knowledge application, leading to higher domain-specific self-efficacy and lower cognitive load. Therefore, we conclude that the implementation of escape room games after instruction is an effective instructional approach and better suited to promote learning than playing escape room games before instruction.",

    "Abstract": "The United States fire service is at a critical crossroads. Can it continue relying on outdated educational methodology to teach the 21 st century fire instructor, or does it enact change to create an innovative, modern approach to instructor education? Fire Departments are rapidly losing decades of knowledge through retirement of their senior members. With the statistical drop in fires annually, there is less opportunity for real world skills application and knowledge acquisition. The reliance on instructors for their ability to pass on learned information is critical. In addition to the loss of knowledge, inadequate standards for instructor education drastically limit the ability for this to occur, steepening the learning curve for newer firefighters and increasing the risk to lives and property during the process. Better teaching methodology must be developed for educating the modern, all-hazards fire service instructor and help stem the unchecked loss of information the service is currently witnessing. Without good instructors, the knowledge gained from these horrific events will continue to be lost. Through qualitative inquiry, current and former members of the fire service were surveyed and interviewed regarding their opinions on the national fire instructor curriculum. The results of the research elucidate a need for continued investigation with a concentration on improving fire instructor training and professional development.",

    "Abstract": "Self-regulation is an important aspect of learning. Students who are capable of self-regulation, plan self-monitoring at different points during the process of knowledge acquisition to increase their likelihood of success and knowledge retention. Using self-monitoring, self-instruction, and self-evaluation processes enables students to become decisive in their learning. Previous studies have confirmed that self-regulated students have great success in college courses, and provided evidence for the positive benefits of self-regulation interventions. Still, nursing education lacks empirical research that focuses on self-regulation quality. The current study explored individual differences in third and fourth-year nursing students’ perceptions of self-regulation profiles in Saudi Arabia before and after the use of a researcher developed self-regulation intervention. A quasi-experimental, pretest/posttest interventional design with a comparison group was used to achieve the aims of the study. A convenience sample of 306 third and fourth year Saudi nursing students participated in this study. The Self-Regulated Learning Scale in Clinical Practice was used to measure the variables of interest before and after the use of a self-regulation intervention taught in the classroom setting. The researcher developed a self-regulation intervention from the literature using learning plans and goal setting method. Data were collected at the start and end of the semester. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, independent t-test, Spearman rank correlation, and repeated measures ANOVA. This research provided preliminary empirical evidence for Saudi baccalaureate nursing students’ perceptions of self-regulation within the applied theoretical framework of Meleis’ (2015) Transitions Theory. The perception of self-regulation scores increased over the course of the semester for both groups, but there were statistically significant differences in the intervention group only. Therefore, the research hypothesis was accepted. These findings were discussed in light of previous research. Potential reasons for these findings were described. Identifying self-regulation profiles that contribute to behavioral and professional outcomes may assist nurse educators to enhance students’ success by identifying students’ needs, readiness to learn, and their use of learning strategies during college and thereafter. This study has implications for nursing science and research, nursing education, and practice. Findings of this study may assist nursing researchers to develop and use more sensitive instruments that accurately measure self-regulation. Also, nursing faculty are challenged with implementing self-regulation interventions that enhance and increase students’ perceptions of self-regulation in clinical settings. Further testing of the self-regulation intervention provides support for the current findings. Recommendations for future research include the replication of this study using first and second year nursing students, conducting a longitudinal study and repeated measures to determine the ongoing and contextual approaches to learning self-regulation over time, and to assess the effect of gender differences on self-regulation perceptions.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction:  The Clinical Presentation (CP) curriculum was first formulated in 1990 at the University of Calgary, Canada. Since then, it has been adopted at various medical schools, including Patan Academy of Health Sciences (PAHS), a state-funded medical school in a low-income country (LIC), Nepal. This study aims to evaluate the perceived effectiveness of the CP curriculum by students and faculty at PAHS, and test knowledge retention through a surprise non-routine exam administered to students.  Method:  This is a cross-sectional study to evaluate the efficacy of the CP curriculum in teaching clinical medicine to the first batch of MBBS students of PAHS School of Medicine. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Committee (IRC)-PAHS (Ref no std1505911069). Perceived effectiveness was evaluated using a set of questionnaires for faculty and students. A total of 33 students and 34 faculty filled the perception questionnaires. Subsequently, a questionnaire consisting of 50 Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) from different clinical medicine disciplines was administered to test students’ knowledge retention. Out of 49 students, 38 participated in the surprise non-routine exam.   Result:  A significantly higher number of faculty preferred the CP curriculum compared to the traditional system of teaching clinical medicine (16 vs 11, Kruskal Wallis: 0.023, ie. P-value < 0.05). A significantly higher number of the students liked and recommended CP curriculum in the clinical year of medical education (20 vs. 13 with p-value < 0.05). In the non-routine surprise exam, two thirds of the students scored 60% or above.  Conclusion: Both faculty and students perceive that the CP curriculum system is an effective teaching and learning method in medical education, irrespective of their different demographic and positional characteristics. The students’ overall performance was good in surprise, non-routine exams taken without scheduling or reminders.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction In the course of their pre-deployment training, military students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are instructed on sieve triage, which is used on the battlefield. The objective of this study is to test the retention of knowledge immediately after delivery of the triage course, at Day 30 and Day 60 in military personnel with no previous sieve-triage knowledge and with an undifferentiated professional background. Method Data were collected using a questionnaire based on a survey toolkit designed by the University of Washington Public Health and distributed randomly amongst military personnel after delivery of sieve triage training. The students were randomly selected in consecutive cohorts over a six-week period. Results A total of 456 participants were included in the study. Most of the participants were soldiers (80%); other professions included were officers (9%), nurses (1%), paramedics (1%), and others (9%). The overall mean score for the cohort was 96.81 at Day 0; 87.37 at Day 30; and 76.1 at Day 60. The mean scores depict a decreasing trend for the combined as well as the individual cohorts with the highest mean score at Day 0 and the lowest at Day 60. The mean scores reduced significantly at Day 30 (MD: -9.43; 95% CI: -10.73 to -8.14) and at Day 60 (MD: -20.71; 95% CI: -22.01 to -19.42) compared to Day 0. The mean difference remained significant at Day 30 (MD: -9.42; 95% CI: -10.7 to -8.14) and Day 60 (MD: -20.69; 95% CI: -21.97 to -19.41) compared to Day 0 when adjusted for age and profession. Conclusion Knowledge retention from the delivery of sieve triage training among UAE military personnel decreased after 60 days. Therefore, there is a need for regular and periodic refresher courses and training, especially for topics that are not applied regularly.",

    "Abstract": "Background Lumbar puncture (LP) is a commonly performed medical procedure in a wide range of indications. Virtual reality (VR) provides a stimulating, safe and efficient learning environment. We report the design and the evaluation of a three dimensions (3D) video for LP training. Methods We recorded a stereoscopic 180-degrees 3D video from two LPs performed in clinical settings in Fernand Widal Lariboisière University Hospital, Paris, France. The video was administered to third-year medical students as well as to a residents and attendings group during LP simulation-based training sessions. Results On 168 participants (108 novice third-year medical students, and 60 residents and attendings with prior LP experience), satisfaction after video exposure was high (rated 4.7 ± 0.6 on a 5-point scale). No significant discomfort was reported (comfort score graded 4.5 ± 0.8 on 5). LP-naive students displayed higher satisfaction and perceived benefit than users with prior LP experience (overall, P  < 0.05). Trainees evaluated favorably the 3D feature and supported the development of similar tutorials for other medical procedures (respectively, 3.9 ± 1.1 and 4.4 ± 0.9 on 5). Conclusion We report our experience with a 3D video for LP training. VR support could increase knowledge retention and skill acquisition in association to LP simulation training.",

    "Abstract": "Serious games, and especially digital game based learning (DGBL) methodologies, have the potential to strengthen classic learning methodology in all medical procedures characterized by a flowchart (e.g., neonatal resuscitation algorithm). However, few studies have compared short- and long-term knowledge retention in DGBL methodologies with a control group undergoing specialist training led by experienced operators. In particular, resident doctors' learning still has limited representation in simulation-based education literature. Background Serious games, and especially digital game based learning (DGBL) methodologies, have the potential to strengthen classic learning methodology in all medical procedures characterized by a flowchart (e.g., neonatal resuscitation algorithm). However, few studies have compared short- and long-term knowledge retention in DGBL methodologies with a control group undergoing specialist training led by experienced operators. In particular, resident doctors' learning still has limited representation in simulation-based education literature.A serious computer game DIANA ( DI gital A pplication in N ewborn A ssessment) was developed, according to newborn resuscitation algorithm, to train pediatric/neonatology residents in neonatal resuscitation algorithm knowledge and implementation (from procedure knowledge to ventilation/chest compressions rate). We analyzed user learning curves after each session and compared knowledge retention against a classic theoretical teaching session. Objective A serious computer game DIANA (DIgital Application in Newborn Assessment) was developed, according to newborn resuscitation algorithm, to train pediatric/neonatology residents in neonatal resuscitation algorithm knowledge and implementation (from procedure knowledge to ventilation/chest compressions rate). We analyzed user learning curves after each session and compared knowledge retention against a classic theoretical teaching session.Pediatric/neonatology residents of the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Pisana (AOUP) were invited to take part in the study and were split into a game group or a control group; both groups were homogeneous in terms of previous training and baseline scores. The control group attended a classic 80 min teaching session with a neonatal trainer, while game group participants played four 20 min sessions over four different days. Three written tests (pre/immediately post-training and at 28 days) were used to evaluate and compare the two groups' performances. Methods Pediatric/neonatology residents of the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Pisana (AOUP) were invited to take part in the study and were split into a game group or a control group; both groups were homogeneous in terms of previous training and baseline scores. The control group attended a classic 80 min teaching session with a neonatal trainer, while game group participants played four 20 min sessions over four different days. Three written tests (pre/immediately post-training and at 28 days) were used to evaluate and compare the two groups' performances.Forty-eight pediatric/neonatology residents participated in the study. While classic training by a neonatal trainer demonstrated an excellent effectiveness in short/long-term knowledge retention, DGBL methodology proved to be equivalent or better. Furthermore, after each game session, DGBL score improved for both procedure knowledge and ventilation/chest compressions rate. Results Forty-eight pediatric/neonatology residents participated in the study. While classic training by a neonatal trainer demonstrated an excellent effectiveness in short/long-term knowledge retention, DGBL methodology proved to be equivalent or better. Furthermore, after each game session, DGBL score improved for both procedure knowledge and ventilation/chest compressions rate.In this study, DGBL was as effective as classic specialist training for neonatal resuscitation in terms of both algorithm memorization and knowledge retention. User appreciation for the methodology and ease of administration, including remotely, support the use of DGBL methodologies for pediatric/neonatology residents education. Conclusions In this study, DGBL was as effective as classic specialist training for neonatal resuscitation in terms of both algorithm memorization and knowledge retention. User appreciation for the methodology and ease of administration, including remotely, support the use of DGBL methodologies for pediatric/neonatology residents education.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction:  The Clinical Presentation (CP) curriculum was first formulated in 1990 at the University of Calgary, Canada. Since then, it has been adopted at various medical schools, including Patan Academy of Health Sciences (PAHS), a state-funded medical school in a low-income country (LIC), Nepal. This study aims to evaluate the perceived effectiveness of the CP curriculum by students and faculty at PAHS, and test knowledge retention through a surprise non-routine exam administered to students.  Method:  This is a cross-sectional study to evaluate the efficacy of the CP curriculum in teaching clinical medicine to the first batch of MBBS students of PAHS School of Medicine. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Committee (IRC)-PAHS (Ref no std1505911069). Perceived effectiveness was evaluated using a set of questionnaires for faculty and students. A total of 33 students and 34 faculty filled the perception questionnaires. Subsequently, a questionnaire consisting of 50 Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) from different clinical medicine disciplines was administered to test students' knowledge retention. Out of 49 students, 38 participated in the surprise non-routine exam.   Result:  A significantly higher number of faculty preferred the CP curriculum compared to the traditional system of teaching clinical medicine (16 vs 11, Kruskal Wallis: 0.023, ie.

In the non-routine surprise exam, two thirds of the students scored 60% or above.  Conclusion: Both faculty and students perceive that the CP curriculum system is an effective teaching and learning method in medical education, irrespective of their different demographic and positional characteristics. The students' overall performance was good in surprise, non-routine exams taken without scheduling or reminders.Introduction: The Clinical Presentation (CP) curriculum was first formulated in 1990 at the University of Calgary, Canada. Since then, it has been adopted at various medical schools, including Patan Academy of Health Sciences (PAHS), a state-funded medical school in a low-income country (LIC), Nepal. This study aims to evaluate the perceived effectiveness of the CP curriculum by students and faculty at PAHS, and test knowledge retention through a surprise non-routine exam administered to students.  Method: This is a cross-sectional study to evaluate the efficacy of the CP curriculum in teaching clinical medicine to the first batch of MBBS students of PAHS School of Medicine. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Committee (IRC)-PAHS (Ref no std1505911069). Perceived effectiveness was evaluated using a set of questionnaires for faculty and students. A total of 33 students and 34 faculty filled the perception questionnaires. Subsequently, a questionnaire consisting of 50 Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) from different clinical medicine disciplines was administered to test students' knowledge retention. Out of 49 students, 38 participated in the surprise non-routine exam.   Result: A significantly higher number of faculty preferred the CP curriculum compared to the traditional system of teaching clinical medicine (16 vs 11, Kruskal Wallis: 0.023, ie. P-value < 0.05). A significantly higher number of the students liked and recommended CP curriculum in the clinical year of medical education (20 vs. 13 with p-value < 0.05). In the non-routine surprise exam, two thirds of the students scored 60% or above.  Conclusion: Both faculty and students perceive that the CP curriculum system is an effective teaching and learning method in medical education, irrespective of their different demographic and positional characteristics. The students' overall performance was good in surprise, non-routine exams taken without scheduling or reminders.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to find how the turnover of host country nationals (HCNs) would be affected by the knowledge transfer from a headquarter to a subsidiary. Knowledge transfer in a multinational corporation (MNC) has been discussed as a critical factor in the MNC’s success. Because HCNs are essential to synergizing with a new knowledge inflow during this knowledge transfer process, their turnover entails negative consequences such as knowledge loss. Design/methodology/approach This paper empirically tests the unbalance between knowledge received (KR) and absorptive capacity (AC) as the most critical organizational predictor by using the secondary longitudinal records and survey data of 4,915 employees. Multilevel survival analysis is used to calculate the individuals’ turnover hazard. Findings While finding that the primary effect of transferred knowledge is to reduce turnover, the study demonstrates the unbalance between a subsidiary’s AC and KR increases the likelihood of HCNs’ turnover within the organization. The authors also recognize the possibility of nonlinear trends of KR and AC on the turnover hazard. Originality/value The authors answer how knowledge transfer shapes a subsidiary’s work environment to prevent or increase turnover, which has been barely examined for HCNs who comprise the crucial demographic group in knowledge transfer. To enhance the originality further, this study empirically observes the actual turnover of HCNs with a conceptually comprehensive view incorporating both learning and political approaches.",

    "Abstract": "The role of anatomy in modern curricula is under reform due to competency of other rapidly evolving subjects and the rapid evolution of several practical aspects and applications dictating modernization of teaching methods as well as of teaching demands. Moreover, modern practice of medicine has put the arterial and vascular system in the center of numerous minimally invasive techniques. Therefore, regardless of their specialty, most doctors should have a very clear and precise knowledge of the vascular anatomy and the basic access techniques from the early years. This viewpoint commentary reflects the experience of the two authors in applying the principles and content of surgical vascular anatomy in undergraduate anatomy teaching and discusses the rationale of this. Moreover, it is suggested that cadaveric dissections should be modified with emphasis on standard surgical vascular exposures and the multidisciplinary teaching of vascular anatomy as a means not only to gain optimal long-term knowledge retention, but also to emphasize through realistic examples on the practical clinical value of vascular anatomy.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to analyse the effects of the Interactive Learning Materials Triangle (iLMT) on the learning and knowledge retention of 12-year-old students. The iLMT is a digital version of the standard school learning materials in Serbia, and is characterized by a high degree of interactivity and immediate feedback during the learning process. We conducted an experiment to explore whether iLMT influences student success in solving mathematical tasks that require different types of mathematical reasoning. Based on previous extensive research by Lithner, 4 types of tasks are discussed: high relatedness answer, high relatedness algorithm, local low relatedness, and global low relatedness. The study involved 633 students and 13 teachers of mathematics, equally distributed in control and test groups. The main findings indicate that student success on a knowledge test for high relatedness answer and local low relatedness tasks for the test group was significantly higher than for the control group. On the knowledge retention test, students in the test group outperformed students in the control group at high relatedness algorithm and local low relatedness tasks. Our results also suggest that, even when learning materials are carefully digitalized with the use of available technological advantages, student success in global low relatedness tasks may still be lacking.",

    "Abstract": "The active participation of citizens in scientific research, through citizen science, has been proven successful. However, knowledge on the potential of citizen science within formal chemistry learning, at the conceptual and procedural levels, remains insufficiently explored. We developed a citizen science project -- PVC: Perceiving the Value of Chemistry behind water and microplastics -- which sought to involve students in monitoring the physicochemical parameters of coastal water quality, through the detection of microplastics in these waters, in addition to the qualitative identification of plastic contaminants on beaches. The project was conducted throughout the 2018/2019 school year and involved 442 middle school students (Key Stage 3 (KS3) aged 12-14, in Portuguese schools) and 9 chemistry teachers, in the northern coastal region of Portugal. The data on learning outcomes was collected through knowledge tests, applied after project conclusion, and was then compared to data collected up to six months later (retention test). In addition, interviews were conducted with participants, and researchers' field notes were recorded and analyzed. Data analysis suggests the PVC project promoted conceptual chemistry learning related to the analysis of physicochemical water parameters (pH, temperature, turbidity, salinity, nitrate and nitrite concentrations and dissolved oxygen), as well as polymers (polymer types, formation and structure). A positive knowledge retention was registered a few months after the project conclusion. At a process level, participants learned laboratory techniques (sieving, gravity and reduced pressure filtrations and crystallization) and the handling of laboratory materials. Furthermore, teachers recognized that their students' participation in the PVC project fostered the development of their argumentation skills, as well as their reflexive and critical thinking skills. The ability to communicate ideas and results, along with the development of students' digital skills, was also mentioned.",

    "Abstract": "Background : No existing research has determined which teaching sequence strategy is the best for nursing students. Purpose : To find out which sequence is most effective in knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention and to further verify knowledge acquisition between problem-based learning (PBL) and lecture-based learning (LBL). Methods : This was a quasi-experimental design with a comparison of two nursing student groups selected from students in their final program year who were invited to participate. Generalized estimating equation was used to compare Group I (LBL-PBL-clinical practicum) and Group II (PBL-LBL-clinical practicum) by using knowledge acquisition and knowledge retention as outcome variables. Findings : Fifty-six senior students joined this study. Group I was significantly better than Group II on both knowledge acquisition (β = 7.05, p = 0.04) and knowledge retention (β = 9.40, p = 0.03). Discussion : The sequence of LBL-PBL-clinical practicum or policy of allowing practicum and courses in the same semester might be the best strategy to enhance knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions. This means there is a growing need to integrate UAV training into STEM education. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a UAV education module and laboratory exercise for natural resource science students. The study used a series of reusable learning objects (RLOs) to assess students’ prior knowledge of remote sensing and UAVs. Students were taught the steps of UAV data acquisition and processing through lectures and UAV simulation videos. Students applied this knowledge by completing a laboratory exercise that used previously collected UAV data. Student knowledge retention and understanding were evaluated using an online quiz to determine the effectiveness of the education module. The average quiz score was 92%, indicating that the UAV laboratory exercise effectively taught students about UAV data acquisition and processing for natural resource research. Overall, students expressed positive opinions about the UAV education module. Student feedback indicated that the laboratory exercise was engaging, but some students would have preferred a hands-on experience for some parts of the exercise. However, in-person UAV instruction may not be accessible for all educators because of UAV cost or lack of instructor training. This study provides educators with crucial recommendations for designing UAV exercises to improve access to UAV-related educational content. This study indicates that online training can effectively introduce students to UAVs. Given the wide range of UAV uses across STEM fields, students in many STEM disciplines would benefit from UAV education.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we investigated whether playing an escape room game after explicit instruction (instruction-first group, N  = 20) is more effective to learn about copyright and media law than playing the game before explicit instruction (problem-solving-first group, N  = 21). This is an important question as escape room games are complex, problem-based learning environments that can overwhelm learners and thus hinder the acquisition of knowledge and skills. According to cognitive load theory, preparing learners with explicit instruction before problem-solving activities can overcome this problem leading to better learning. However, in the productive failure paradigm problem-solving before explicit instruction is seen as more effective, especially when it comes to the application of newly acquired knowledge to solve novel problems. Based on these two theories, we conducted an experiment and found that playing the developed digital escape room game after explicit instruction was more effective for knowledge retention and domain-specific self-efficacy with at the same time lower cognitive load. However, we found no differences regarding the application of knowledge as both groups scored equally high on transfer tasks. The result is discussed considering previous productive failure studies mostly conducted in the science and engineering domain. In sum, the instruction first approach proved to be effective for both knowledge acquisition and knowledge application, leading to higher domain-specific self-efficacy and lower cognitive load. Therefore, we conclude that the implementation of escape room games after instruction is an effective instructional approach and better suited to promote learning than playing escape room games before instruction.In this study, we investigated whether playing an escape room game after explicit instruction (instruction-first group, N = 20) is more effective to learn about copyright and media law than playing the game before explicit instruction (problem-solving-first group, N = 21).

    "Abstract": "Retirement of baby boomers results in institutional knowledge loss and gaps in business continuity. The specific management problem is that managers in American higher education institutions have challenges maintaining business continuity as they lose institutional knowledge when baby boomers retire and millennials assume those positions. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore how organizational managers in online universities are transferring tacit knowledge from the retiring baby boomers to their millennial replacements to maintain business continuity. The conceptual framework of this study was based on Bridges's model on transition to capture the effects of the generational changes occurring in the workforce. The overarching research questions focused on how managers in an online higher education institution manage knowledge to transfer to new managers and support business continuity for their institution. Data were collected through interviews and documents from 20 baby boomers, Gen Xers, and millennial managers employed with the institution for at least three years. Yin's five steps for qualitative data analysis and thematic coding were used to identify three key findings. One finding suggested that knowledge management should be a strategic priority, supported by institutional technology systems, procedures, and policies. Another finding identified the importance of succession planning and knowledge sharing to support business continuity through change and transition. This research study could lead to positive social change by aiding universities to prepare for future workforce changes by developing strategies to retain tacit knowledge, which will support business continuity efforts and allow them to support the communities they serve.

We have developed a virtual cybersecurity escape room based on the three-dimensional Unity game development platform to improve cybersecurity awareness. Unlike most prior efforts, this application is based on the proven Octalysis gamification framework, which has been shown to improve user engagement and knowledge retention. Further, we integrate ethical decision making based on the IEEE Code of Ethics. Following a discussion of the application design, we present play testing results and experimentally quantify the application's performance based on eight gamification metrics.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose > This study aims to explore how the fact of belonging to clusters of dissimilar form or characteristics modify the application of human resource management (HRM) practices, as well as those knowledge-sharing processes that guide and encourage the intrapreneurial behavior of employees (IPB) in firms belonging to the cluster. The main thesis is that the application of HRM practices and some knowledge management processes are strongly conditioned by the form or characteristics of the cluster, all this in a knowledge-intensive context that requires a contingent application of such practices. Design/methodology/approach > The research strategy chosen was a qualitative case study, given that the insight the authors were seeking could only be obtained through a fine-grained analysis inside the firm where it is very difficult to decouple the phenomenon to be observed from the context where it takes place. Two cases were selected to analyze the phenomenon in-depth and compare their results; they were big and technologically advanced firms but belonging to clusters of different forms and characteristics. Findings > Results show that the influence of the cluster based on location is greater than the effects of the cluster formed by networks, where globalization and external ties play an important role. HRM practices and knowledge sharing processes that lead to intrapreneurial behavior are conditioned, only in part, by the characteristics of the cluster. Particularly, the geographical cluster encourages knowledge sharing with competitors and customers, mainly for technical training processes and because of belonging to a sectoral association. However, HRM practices, with the exception of training and compensation policies, are mainly conditioned by the company's culture and internal factors, rather than by belonging to a specific cluster. Practical implications > Firms belonging to an organized cluster should encourage the development of practical training-oriented programs, not only on technical aspects but also on other skill and competence-based areas. In addition, training based on strategic issues both for top and middle managers could be an interesting initiative. Additionally, clustered firms should develop more knowledge-retention policies to limit the degree of rivalry in the sector, as it is very common for a firm to search for new and specialized talent in the rest of competing firms in the cluster. Social implications > Considering the economic impact of the geographical cluster, its effect on the employment and development of a region and taking into account the relevant and dynamic role of research institutions and associations, policymakers should support and facilitate the activity of those institutions, reinforcing the relevance of industrial districts or geographical clusters that are threatened by the pressures of globalization. Originality/value > This study brings new insight into the effect of the form and characteristics of the cluster on HRM practices and knowledge sharing processes that lead to intrapreneurial behavior. The study may open the field for additional studies that, from a qualitative and quantitative perspective, analyze this topic in depth. The paper shows that IPB depends not only on the support of the institutions created in the cluster but also on the culture and competitive strategy of the company. Belonging to a geographical cluster can have an influence on firms’ behavior and can, through the trust generated among its members, facilitate knowledge-sharing processes and intrapreneurial behavior.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Knowledge, once acquired, degrades over time. Exams that contain questions related to previously acquired knowledge (‘retrieval practice questions’) may promote retrieval practice and spaced learning, and subsequently prevent knowledge loss. To investigate this hypothesis, we compare the score of retrieval practice questions to regular questions in exams of a two-year (bio)medical study program. Methods The two-year “Mechanisms of Health and Disease”-program for biomedical sciences and medical students in Nijmegen (the Netherlands) contains 14 spaced exams of 80 questions each. The percentages of correct-, false-, and non-answers were compared between regular questions and retrieval practice questions. Using Pearson correlations between question scores and exam scores ( RiT -values), the impact of retrieval practice questions on the internal consistency of exams was determined. Mixed model analyses determined changes in outcomes across time. Results Analysis of 2006 regular questions and 1728 retrieval practice questions revealed a significantly higher percentage of correct and false answers, and a significantly lower percentage of non-answers, in retrieval practice questions versus regular questions (all P  < 0.05). Scores did not change across time. RiT -values were slightly lower in retrieval practice questions, with a small inverse trend across time. Conclusion Our data indicate preservation of knowledge, possibly related to retrieval practice and/or spaced learning. Although the RiT -values of retrieval practice questions were slightly lower than those of regular questions, the discriminative capacity was well within acceptable range. These data highlight the potency of retrieval practice questions to prevent knowledge decrement, without altering exam quality.",

    "Abstract": "Background Problem-based learning (PBL) is a pedagogical approach that shifts the role of the teacher to the student (student-centered) and is based on self-directed learning. Although PBL has been adopted in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education, the effectiveness of the method is still under discussion. The author’s purpose was to appraise available international evidence concerning to the effectiveness and usefulness of PBL methodology in undergraduate medical teaching programs. Methods The authors applied the Arksey and O’Malley framework to undertake a scoping review. The search was carried out in February 2021 in PubMed and Web of Science including all publications in English and Spanish with no limits on publication date, study design or country of origin. Results The literature search identified one hundred and twenty-four publications eligible for this review. Despite the fact that this review included many studies, their design was heterogeneous and only a few provided a high scientific evidence methodology (randomized design and/or systematic reviews with meta-analysis). Furthermore, most were single-center experiences with small sample size and there were no large multi-center studies. PBL methodology obtained a high level of satisfaction, especially among students. It was more effective than other more traditional (or lecture-based methods) at improving social and communication skills, problem-solving and self-learning skills. Knowledge retention and academic performance weren’t worse (and in many studies were better) than with traditional methods. PBL was not universally widespread, probably because requires greater human resources and continuous training for its implementation. Conclusion PBL is an effective and satisfactory methodology for medical education. It is likely that through PBL medical students will not only acquire knowledge but also other competencies that are needed in medical professionalism.",

    "Abstract": "Background: State-owned enterprises (SOEs) in South Africa face a serious challenge of knowledge loss caused largely by resignations, the ageing workforce and a lack of knowledge management (KM) practices. Objective: This article explores KM practices in the South African SOEs to mitigate the risks inherent in tacit knowledge loss. Methods: The study adopted a mixed methods research strategy using an exploratory sequential design to identify KM practices and their effectiveness in addressing the issue of tacit knowledge loss. The qualitative data was collected through the interviews and document analysis of 2018 annual reports in nine SOEs across five market sectors. A survey questionnaire was distributed to 585 respondents, with a 25% response rate (145) for quantitative data in three SOEs. Results: The results revealed that the majority of the SOEs lacked KM practices in their structures. The lack of KM practices implies that the SOEs are lagging behind in knowledge protective capacities to mitigate the risks inherent in the organisational tacit knowledge loss. With many South African SOEs, facing all these sorts of knowledge loss risks and a lack of KM practices to mitigate them, achieving the objectives of a developmental state remains a far-fetched idea. Conclusion: The absence of KM practices negatively affected knowledge transfer and retention in most of the SOEs. A lack of KM practices will negatively affect their performance and their sustainability to deliver on their developmental mandate.

    "Abstract": "Information systems development (ISD) is an integral part of organizational agility in today’s competitive business environment. High turnover, agile ways of working, and fluid work environments pose challenges for ISD. This paper explores the erosion of knowledge retention (KR) arising from ISD staff churn in a New Zealand-based financial organization in the aftermath of a major earthquake. In this exploratory study, the authors develop a causal model of KR in the ISD context, which articulates the challenges to and consequences of ineffective KR at the routine and exiting stages of KR. The model identifies four challenges—coordination complexity, insufficient resources for knowledge retention, insufficient attention to knowledge retention, and slow staff replacement and handover processes—that can affect the loss of ISD knowledge when routine and exiting KR fall into disarray. This study also reveals that role stress and reduced ISD agility reinforce the cycle of knowledge loss.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study assesses outsourcing risks using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP). Design/methodology/approach This descriptive research combines both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Risks identified in the literature review were classified with FAHP using questionnaire data from respondents in operations, procurement and risk management in Brazilian Navy Industrial Military Organizations (OMPS-I, by its Portuguese acronym). Findings The results indicate that FAHP is a method capable of producing relevant information to decision-making in the risk management process. A framework was created incorporating 16 major risks related to outsourcing. The results point to higher inherent risk levels related to outsourcing in the context of OMPS-Is: in order, hidden costs and unrealized savings; loss of knowledge/skills and/or corporate memory and difficulty in reacquiring a function; and loss of opportunities and reputation. The category of economic risk was revealed as the most important. Originality/value This study improves understanding of outsourcing risks and improves risk assessment by refining decision-making information and developing a system of decision analysis with several criteria. It also contributes to the development and implementation of a usable version of decision analysis with several criteria at a managerial level.",

    "Abstract": "The ARMADILLO Study determined whether adolescents able to access SRH information on-demand via SMS were better able to reject contraception-related myths and misconceptions as compared with adolescents receiving pushed SMS or no intervention. BACKGROUND The ARMADILLO Study determined whether adolescents able to access SRH information on-demand via SMS were better able to reject contraception-related myths and misconceptions as compared with adolescents receiving pushed SMS or no intervention.This trial was an unblinded, three-arm, parallel-group, individual RCT with a 1:1:1 allocation. Trial registration: ISRCTN85156148. TRIAL DESIGN This trial was an unblinded, three-arm, parallel-group, individual RCT with a 1:1:1 allocation. Trial registration: ISRCTN85156148.This study was conducted in Lima, Peru among participants ages 13-17 years. Eligible participants were randomized into one of three arms: Arm 1: access to ARMADILLO's SMS information on-demand; Arm 2 access to ARMADILLO SMS information pushed to their phone; Arm 3 control (no SMS). The intervention period lasted seven weeks. At baseline, endline, and follow-up (eight weeks following endline), participants were assessed on a variety of contraception-related myths and misconceptions. An index of myths-believed was generated. The primary outcome assessed the subject-specific change in the mean score between baseline and endline. Knowledge retention from endline to follow-up was also assessed, as was a 'content exposure' outcome, which assessed change in participants' knowledge based on relevant SMS received. METHODS This study was conducted in Lima, Peru among participants ages 13-17 years. Eligible participants were randomized into one of three arms: Arm 1: access to ARMADILLO's SMS information on-demand; Arm 2 access to ARMADILLO SMS information pushed to their phone; Arm 3 control (no SMS).

Knowledge retention from endline to follow-up was also assessed, as was a 'content exposure' outcome, which assessed change in participants' knowledge based on relevant SMS received.In total, 712 participants were randomized to the three arms: 659 completed an endline assessment and were included in the primary analysis. Arm 2 participants believed fewer myths at endline compared with control arm participants (estimated subject-specific mean difference of -3.69% [-6.17%, -1.21%], p = 0.004). There was no significant difference between participants in Arm 1 vs. the control Arm, or between participants in Arm 1 vs. Arm 2. A further decrease in myths believed between endline and follow-up (knowledge retention) was observed in all arms; however, there was no difference between arms. The content exposure analysis saw significant reductions in myths believed for Arm 1 (estimated subject-specific mean difference of -9.47% [-14.83%, -4.11%], p = .001) and Arm 2 (-5.93% [-8.57%, -3.29%], p < .001) as compared with the control arm; however Arm 1's reduced sample size (n = 28) is a severe limitation.

Standalone, adolescent SRH digital health interventions may affect only modest change. Instead, digital is probably best used a complementary channel to expand the reach of existing validated SRH information and service programs.

    "Abstract": "Modern medical curricula adopt the use self-directed learning approaches, which frequently include the use of technology enhanced learning resources. Often, students prefer those which are available via mobile devices because it can facilitate flexibility and autonomy with their learning, more so than with traditional modalities. Although the production value of resources may be appealing to users, those that work most effectively for education align well to existing pedagogies. One such pedagogy is the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. It is a framework that can be used to facilitate the construction of educational video, that can benefit learning gain through reducing the cognitive load.Although much research has been conducted on how information should be presented in video resources, there is very limited evidence within the subject of clinical anatomy and physiology or when applying different types of educational video, such as screencasts, or interactive video. In the field of anatomy education recent approaches have sought to standardize a robust methodology to evaluate digital resources. This procedure utilizes a combination of normalized learning gain and learner perceptions to gain an accurate picture of educational impact.The current study investigated the impact of both interactive educational videos and screencasts compared with traditional teaching techniques in the challenging subjects of histology and pain physiology. A quasi-randomized, cross-sectional study was conducted with 135 medical students enrolled at the University of Southampton. Sixty fourth- and fifth-year students assessed the histology resources, and 75 second-year students assessed the pain histology resources. Participants were randomly assigned to either a text-based resource, interactive video, or screencast group. Outcomes measured were: 1. Normalized knowledge gain (and retention) assessed using one-best-answer multiple choice question tests 2. Student perceptions using 1-10 Likert-scale style questionnaires. A significant improvement in mean normalized knowledge gain was observed for all teaching modalities. For pain physiology, the means were: Text-49.0% (n = 23), interactive video-70.1% (n = 26), and screencast-53.8% (n = 26). For all learning gains, P < 0.001. For histology, there was a mean normalized learning gain for text-80.0% (n = 20), interactive video-74.4% (n = 20), and screencast groups-68.3% (n = 20). For all learning gains, P < 0.001.For pain physiology resources, interactive videos significantly improved learning gain compared to the screencast (P < 0.05) and the text resource groups (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between those who used the text or screencast resources. There was also no significant difference in knowledge retention between the different teaching methods for each subject.Following teaching, all three teaching modalities had similar effects on student confidence in the subjects, desire for educational channels dedicated to each topic, and preference for locally produced vs. externally produced videos. These findings have the potential to inform educators on which types of resources to create or to select for their students to have the best impact on learning.Modern medical curricula adopt the use self-directed learning approaches, which frequently include the use of technology enhanced learning resources.

Sixty fourth- and fifth-year students assessed the histology resources, and 75 second-year students assessed the pain histology resources. Participants were randomly assigned to either a text-based resource, interactive video, or screencast group. Outcomes measured were: 1. Normalized knowledge gain (and retention) assessed using one-best-answer multiple choice question tests 2. Student perceptions using 1-10 Likert-scale style questionnaires. A significant improvement in mean normalized knowledge gain was observed for all teaching modalities. For pain physiology, the means were: Text-49.0% (n = 23), interactive video-70.1% (n = 26), and screencast-53.8% (n = 26). For all learning gains, P < 0.001. For histology, there was a mean normalized learning gain for text-80.0% (n = 20), interactive video-74.4% (n = 20), and screencast groups-68.3% (n = 20). For all learning gains, P < 0.001.For pain physiology resources, interactive videos significantly improved learning gain compared to the screencast (P < 0.05) and the text resource groups (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between those who used the text or screencast resources. There was also no significant difference in knowledge retention between the different teaching methods for each subject.Following teaching, all three teaching modalities had similar effects on student confidence in the subjects, desire for educational channels dedicated to each topic, and preference for locally produced vs. externally produced videos. These findings have the potential to inform educators on which types of resources to create or to select for their students to have the best impact on learning.",

    "Abstract": "The role of anatomy in modern curricula is under reform due to competency of other rapidly evolving subjects and the rapid evolution of several practical aspects and applications dictating modernization of teaching methods as well as of teaching demands. Moreover, modern practice of medicine has put the arterial and vascular system in the center of numerous minimally invasive techniques. Therefore, regardless of their specialty, most doctors should have a very clear and precise knowledge of the vascular anatomy and the basic access techniques from the early years. This viewpoint commentary reflects the experience of the two authors in applying the principles and content of surgical vascular anatomy in undergraduate anatomy teaching and discusses the rationale of this. Moreover, it is suggested that cadaveric dissections should be modified with emphasis on standard surgical vascular exposures and the multidisciplinary teaching of vascular anatomy as a means not only to gain optimal long‐term knowledge retention, but also to emphasize through realistic examples on the practical clinical value of vascular anatomy.",

    "Abstract": "The active participation of citizens in scientific research, through citizen science, has been proven successful. However, knowledge on the potential of citizen science within formal chemistry learning, at the conceptual and procedural levels, remains insufficiently explored. We developed a citizen science project – PVC: Perceiving the Value of Chemistry behind water and microplastics – which sought to involve students in monitoring the physicochemical parameters of coastal water quality, through the detection of microplastics in these waters, in addition to the qualitative identification of plastic contaminants on beaches. The project was conducted throughout the 2018/2019 school year and involved 442 middle school students (Key Stage 3 (KS3) aged 12–14, in Portuguese schools) and 9 chemistry teachers, in the northern coastal region of Portugal. The data on learning outcomes was collected through knowledge tests, applied after project conclusion, and was then compared to data collected up to six months later (retention test). In addition, interviews were conducted with participants, and researchers’ field notes were recorded and analyzed. Data analysis suggests the PVC project promoted conceptual chemistry learning related to the analysis of physicochemical water parameters (pH, temperature, turbidity, salinity, nitrate and nitrite concentrations and dissolved oxygen), as well as polymers (polymer types, formation and structure). A positive knowledge retention was registered a few months after the project conclusion. At a process level, participants learned laboratory techniques (sieving, gravity and reduced pressure filtrations and crystallization) and the handling of laboratory materials. Furthermore, teachers recognized that their students’ participation in the PVC project fostered the development of their argumentation skills, as well as their reflexive and critical thinking skills. The ability to communicate ideas and results, along with the development of students’ digital skills, was also mentioned.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to analyse the effects of the Interactive Learning Materials Triangle (iLMT) on the learning and knowledge retention of 12-year-old students. The iLMT is a digital version of the standard school learning materials in Serbia, and is characterized by a high degree of interactivity and immediate feedback during the learning process. We conducted an experiment to explore whether iLMT influences student success in solving mathematical tasks that require different types of mathematical reasoning. Based on previous extensive research by Lithner, 4 types of tasks are discussed: high relatedness answer, high relatedness algorithm, local low relatedness, and global low relatedness. The study involved 633 students and 13 teachers of mathematics, equally distributed in control and test groups. The main findings indicate that student success on a knowledge test for high relatedness answer and local low relatedness tasks for the test group was significantly higher than for the control group. On the knowledge retention test, students in the test group outperformed students in the control group at high relatedness algorithm and local low relatedness tasks. Our results also suggest that, even when learning materials are carefully digitalized with the use of available technological advantages, student success in global low relatedness tasks may still be lacking.",

    "Abstract": "Several studies have warranted the need to explore the relationship between pedagogical agents in the learning environment and the cognitive load on the learners, specifically, to study the influence on learner populations with different learning and motivation needs. The present work investigates the effects of the presence of a pedagogical agent in the learning environment on intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load for the dyscalculia and non- learner population. The proposed system intelligently investigates the learner, recommends an exclusive learning dyscalculia path and after tutoring assesses learning gain, and retention. Learner experience and effects of the pedagogical agent on types of cognitive loads are discussed on basis of post tutoring analysis. Samples of 82 learners have been studied, experimental findings based on research questions have been reported and conclusions discussed. Our assumption that ‘a well-articulated and well-designed instructional design exerts a minimal extraneous cognitive load on learners and facilitates learning gain and retention’ is consistent with the obtained results. The result concludes that pedagogical agent does not add to intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load. An improved Germane Cognitive load and a good amount of knowledge retention are noticed post learning.",

    "Abstract": "Designing reflective activities for online video learning could enhance learning outcomes and, to some extent, influence learning processes (ie, attentional processes and emotional experiences). It is necessary to select different levels of reflective activities in online video learning according to learning processes and outcomes. This study examined to what extent different levels of reflection may affect the learning outcomes, and further explored the impact of reflection on learning processes. Participants, comprising 60 undergraduates, were randomly and equally assigned to two different groups: a reflection group and a critical reflection group, and each group member completed specific learning tasks. The results of the learning outcomes showed that critical reflection led to better transfer performance than reflection, but retention performance was the same in both conditions. Regarding process measures, eye‐tracking data indicated that the embedding of critical reflection strategies facilitated learners' visual attention, and controlled the difficulty of processing. Meanwhile, physiological data showed that the learners' reflection was accompanied by stress, and there was no significant difference between the two levels of reflection. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic - Embedding reflections within videos is an effective instructional strategy for online learning which can facilitate students' deep learning. - Recent studies have evaluated the effectiveness of reflection mostly through its impact on learning outcomes, yet focusing on the process of reflection is equally valuable. - How to choose the level of reflection is critical and challenging. Whether it should combine the processes (including attentional processes and emotional experiences) and outcomes of reflection can be addressed through experimental research. What this paper adds - Selecting different levels of reflection (ie, reflection and critical reflection) according to Kember's model and suggesting strategies (ie, retrospective interpretation reports and evaluation reports of problem solving) to guide reflection. - The experimental design combined outcomes and processes in order to identify the most appropriate level of reflection in the context of video learning, and both offline and online measurements were taken (including eye tracking and physiological measures). - Critical reflection leads to superior learning outcomes and has advantages for attentional processes. Additionally, reflection itself is the main factor influencing participants' stress, and there is no significant difference between the levels of reflection. Implications for practice and/or policy - Providing guidance for different levels of reflection (ie, retrospective interpretation reports and evaluation report of problem solving), which helps inform the design of instructional videos and foster learners' reflective awareness. - Educators should focus not only on the learning outcomes caused by reflection but also on the learning processes of reflection and the emotional experiences that accompany it, in order to choose an appropriate level of reflection. - Whether the teaching goal is knowledge retention or transfer, educators should embed a high level of reflection for learners in instructional videos to promote deep thinking and processing.",

    "Abstract": "The University of Bologna School of Medicine in 2003 adopted a near-peer teaching (NPT) program with senior medical students teaching and assisting younger students in human anatomy laboratories. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and outcomes of this program—unique on the Italian academic panorama—from the tutors’ perspective. An anonymous online survey was administered to all those who acted as peer tutors in the period from 2003 to 2021; it evaluated tutors’ perceptions regarding the influence of the tutoring experience on their skillset gains, academic performance, and professional career. Furthermore, tutors were asked to express their views on the value of cadaver dissection in medical education and professional development. The overall perception of the NPT program was overwhelmingly positive and the main reported benefits were improved long-term knowledge retention and academic performance, improved communication, team-working and time management skills, and enhanced self-confidence and motivation. Most tutors strongly believed that cadaver dissection was an invaluable learning tool in medical education, helped them to develop professionalism and human values, and positively influenced the caring of their future patients. Nearly all the participants highlighted the importance of voluntary body donation for medical education and research. The present results supported the thesis that tutors themselves benefited from the act of teaching peers; this impactful experience equipped them with a wide range of transferable skills that they could draw on as future educators and healthcare professionals.",

    "Abstract": "Background Informed consent is of paramount importance in surgery. Digital media can be used to enhance patient’s comprehension of the proposed operation. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of adding a digital educational platform (DEP) to a standard verbal consent (SVC) for a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) on patient’s knowledge of the procedure, satisfaction with the clinical encounter and duration of the consent appointment. Methods This prospective non-blinded randomized controlled trial allocated 51 patients, who were candidates for a LRYGB, into DEP+SVC (intervention, n  = 26) or SVC (control, n  = 25) groups. Data were collected at one Bariatric Centre of Excellence (Ontario, Canada) between December 2018 and December 2019. DEP consisted of a 29-slide video-supplemented module detailing the risks, benefits, expectations and outcomes for the LRYGB. Primary outcome was knowledge about the LRYGB operation following the consent discussion. Secondary outcomes were knowledge retention, patient satisfaction, and duration of time required to obtain an informed consent. Results Baseline demographic data were equivalent between groups except for a greater proportion of male patients in the DEP+SVC group (7/19 vs 0/25; p  < 0.01). Baseline procedure-specific knowledge was equivalent between the groups (72.3 ± 11.3% vs 74.7 ± 9.6%; p  = 0.41). Post-consent knowledge was significantly higher in the DEP + SVC vs SVC group (85.0 ± 8.8% vs 78.7 ± 8.7%; p  = 0.01; ES = 0.72). The duration of time to obtain informed consent was significantly shorter for the DEP + SVC vs SVC group (358 ± 198 sec vs 751 ± 212 sec; p  < 0.01; ES = 1.92). There was no difference in knowledge retention at 4–6 weeks (84.4 ± 10.2% vs 82.9 ± 6.8%; p  = 0.55) and in patient satisfaction (31.5 ± 1.1 vs 31 ± 2.7; p  = 0.10). Conclusion The addition of a DEP online module to a standard verbal consent for LRYGB resulted in improved patient’s understanding of the procedure-specific risks and benefits, high patient satisfaction, and over 50% time savings for the bariatric surgeon conducting the consent discussion.",

    "Abstract": "In US government courses, simulations have been shown to increase students’ engagement and knowledge retention. We present an original simulation that focuses on both the interactions between political institutions that contribute to policy making and the normative ideas underlying politics. By exploring a civil rights or liberties policy area, students learn about the importance of both political institutions and foundational political ideas such as liberty and equality. Students role-play members of Congress, lobbyists for a pro- or anti-natural gas pipeline group, and Supreme Court justices. Although the goal of simulations in many US government courses is to teach students about the ways that institutions shape policy, this is the first (to our knowledge) that also integrates normative reflection on the ideas behind political arguments. Assessment indicates that the simulation was effective in increasing students’ knowledge of and/or interest in American political institutions and eminent domain.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to analyse the effects of the Interactive Learning Materials Triangle (iLMT) on the learning and knowledge retention of 12-year-old students. The iLMT is a digital version of the standard school learning materials in Serbia, and is characterized by a high degree of interactivity and immediate feedback during the learning process. We conducted an experiment to explore whether iLMT influences student success in solving mathematical tasks that require different types of mathematical reasoning. Based on previous extensive research by Lithner, 4 types of tasks are discussed: high relatedness answer, high relatedness algorithm, local low relatedness, and global low relatedness. The study involved 633 students and 13 teachers of mathematics, equally distributed in control and test groups. The main findings indicate that student success on a knowledge test for high relatedness answer and local low relatedness tasks for the test group was significantly higher than for the control group. On the knowledge retention test, students in the test group outperformed students in the control group at high relatedness algorithm and local low relatedness tasks. Our results also suggest that, even when learning materials are carefully digitalized with the use of available technological advantages, student success in global low relatedness tasks may still be lacking.The purpose of this study is to analyse the effects of the Interactive Learning Materials Triangle (iLMT) on the learning and knowledge retention of 12-year-old students.

    "Abstract": "Informed consent is of paramount importance in surgery. Digital media can be used to enhance patient's comprehension of the proposed operation. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of adding a digital educational platform (DEP) to a standard verbal consent (SVC) for a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) on patient's knowledge of the procedure, satisfaction with the clinical encounter and duration of the consent appointment. BACKGROUND Informed consent is of paramount importance in surgery. Digital media can be used to enhance patient's comprehension of the proposed operation. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of adding a digital educational platform (DEP) to a standard verbal consent (SVC) for a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) on patient's knowledge of the procedure, satisfaction with the clinical encounter and duration of the consent appointment.This prospective non-blinded randomized controlled trial allocated 51 patients, who were candidates for a LRYGB, into DEP+SVC (intervention, n = 26) or SVC (control, n = 25) groups. Data were collected at one Bariatric Centre of Excellence (Ontario, Canada) between December 2018 and December 2019. DEP consisted of a 29-slide video-supplemented module detailing the risks, benefits, expectations and outcomes for the LRYGB. Primary outcome was knowledge about the LRYGB operation following the consent discussion. Secondary outcomes were knowledge retention, patient satisfaction, and duration of time required to obtain an informed consent. METHODS This prospective non-blinded randomized controlled trial allocated 51 patients, who were candidates for a LRYGB, into DEP+SVC (intervention, n = 26) or SVC (control, n = 25) groups. Data were collected at one Bariatric Centre of Excellence (Ontario, Canada) between December 2018 and December 2019. DEP consisted of a 29-slide video-supplemented module detailing the risks, benefits, expectations and outcomes for the LRYGB. Primary outcome was knowledge about the LRYGB operation following the consent discussion. Secondary outcomes were knowledge retention, patient satisfaction, and duration of time required to obtain an informed consent.Baseline demographic data were equivalent between groups except for a greater proportion of male patients in the DEP+SVC group (7/19 vs 0/25; p < 0.01). Baseline procedure-specific knowledge was equivalent between the groups (72.3 ± 11.3% vs 74.7 ± 9.6%; p = 0.41). Post-consent knowledge was significantly higher in the DEP + SVC vs SVC group (85.0 ± 8.8% vs 78.7 ± 8.7%; p = 0.01; ES = 0.72). The duration of time to obtain informed consent was significantly shorter for the DEP + SVC vs SVC group (358 ± 198 sec vs 751 ± 212 sec; p < 0.01; ES = 1.92). There was no difference in knowledge retention at 4-6 weeks (84.4 ± 10.2% vs 82.9 ± 6.8%; p = 0.55) and in patient satisfaction (31.5 ± 1.1 vs 31 ± 2.7; p = 0.10).

    "Abstract": "The Republic of Georgia is part of the Caucasus biodiversity hotspot, and human agricultural plant use dates back at least 6000 years. Over the last years, lots of ethnobotanical research on the area has been published. In this paper, we analyze the use of food plants in the 80% of Georgia not occupied by Russian forces. We hypothesized that (1) given the long tradition of plant use, and the isolation under Soviet rule, plant use both based on home gardens and wild harvesting would be more pronounced in Georgia than in the wider region, (2) food plant use knowledge would be widely and equally spread in most of Georgia, (3) there would still be incidence of knowledge loss despite wide plant use, especially in climatically favored agricultural regions in Western and Eastern Georgia. BACKGROUND The Republic of Georgia is part of the Caucasus biodiversity hotspot, and human agricultural plant use dates back at least 6000 years. Over the last years, lots of ethnobotanical research on the area has been published. In this paper, we analyze the use of food plants in the 80% of Georgia not occupied by Russian forces. We hypothesized that (1) given the long tradition of plant use, and the isolation under Soviet rule, plant use both based on home gardens and wild harvesting would be more pronounced in Georgia than in the wider region, (2) food plant use knowledge would be widely and equally spread in most of Georgia, (3) there would still be incidence of knowledge loss despite wide plant use, especially in climatically favored agricultural regions in Western and Eastern Georgia.From 2013 to 2019, we interviewed over 380 participants in all regions of Georgia not occupied by Russian forces and recorded over 19,800 mentions of food plants. All interviews were carried out in the participants' homes and gardens by native speakers of Georgian and its dialects (Imeretian, Rachian, Lechkhumian, Tush, Khevsurian, Psavian, Kakhetian), other Kartvelian languages (Megrelian, Svan) and minority languages (Ossetian, Ude, Azeri, Armenian, Greek). METHODS From 2013 to 2019, we interviewed over 380 participants in all regions of Georgia not occupied by Russian forces and recorded over 19,800 mentions of food plants. All interviews were carried out in the participants' homes and gardens by native speakers of Georgian and its dialects (Imeretian, Rachian, Lechkhumian, Tush, Khevsurian, Psavian, Kakhetian), other Kartvelian languages (Megrelian, Svan) and minority languages (Ossetian, Ude, Azeri, Armenian, Greek).The regional division was based primarily on historic provinces of Georgia, which often coincides with the current administrative borders. The total number of taxa, mostly identified to species, including their varieties, was 527. Taxonomically, the difference between two food plant groups-garden versus wild-was strongly pronounced even at family level. The richness of plant families was 65 versus 97 families in garden versus wild plants, respectively, and the difference was highly significant. Other diversity indices also unequivocally pointed to considerably more diverse family composition of wild collected versus garden plants as the differences between all the tested diversity indices appeared to be highly significant. The wide use of leaves for herb pies and lactofermented is of particular interest. Some of the ingredients are toxic in larger quantities, and the participants pointed out that careful preparation was needed. The authors explicitly decided to not give any recipes, given that many of the species are widespread, and compound composition-and with it possible toxic effects-might vary across the distribution range, so that a preparation method that sufficiently reduces toxicity in the Caucasus might not necessary be applicable in other areas.

Adjacent regions cluster together (Kvemo Zemo Racha, and Zemo Imereti; Samegrelo, Guria, Adjara, Lechkhumi and Kvemo and Zemo Svaneti; Meskheti, Javakheti, Kvemo Kartli; Mtianeti, Kakheti, Khevsureti, Tusheti. Like in the case of the garden food plants, species diversity of wild food plants mentioned varied strongly. Climate severity and traditions of the use of wild food plants might play role in this variation. Overall food plant knowledge is widely spread all-across Georgia, and broadly maintained.

    "Abstract": "The University of Bologna School of Medicine in 2003 adopted a near-peer teaching (NPT) program with senior medical students teaching and assisting younger students in human anatomy laboratories. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and outcomes of this program-unique on the Italian academic panorama-from the tutors' perspective. An anonymous online survey was administered to all those who acted as peer tutors in the period from 2003 to 2021; it evaluated tutors' perceptions regarding the influence of the tutoring experience on their skillset gains, academic performance, and professional career. Furthermore, tutors were asked to express their views on the value of cadaver dissection in medical education and professional development. The overall perception of the NPT program was overwhelmingly positive and the main reported benefits were improved long-term knowledge retention and academic performance, improved communication, team-working and time management skills, and enhanced self-confidence and motivation. Most tutors strongly believed that cadaver dissection was an invaluable learning tool in medical education, helped them to develop professionalism and human values, and positively influenced the caring of their future patients. Nearly all the participants highlighted the importance of voluntary body donation for medical education and research. The present results supported the thesis that tutors themselves benefited from the act of teaching peers; this impactful experience equipped them with a wide range of transferable skills that they could draw on as future educators and healthcare professionals.The University of Bologna School of Medicine in 2003 adopted a near-peer teaching (NPT) program with senior medical students teaching and assisting younger students in human anatomy laboratories.

    "Abstract": "Birth asphyxia is one of the significant causes of neonatal deaths in Pakistan. Poor newborn resuscitation skills of birth attendants are a major cause of neonatal mortality in low resource settings across the globe. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Simulation-Based High-Frequency training of the Helping Babies Breathe for Community Midwives (CMW), in district Gujrat, Pakistan. BACKGROUND Birth asphyxia is one of the significant causes of neonatal deaths in Pakistan. Poor newborn resuscitation skills of birth attendants are a major cause of neonatal mortality in low resource settings across the globe. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Simulation-Based High-Frequency training of the Helping Babies Breathe for Community Midwives (CMW), in district Gujrat, Pakistan.A pre-post-test interventional study design was used. The universal sampling technique was employed to recruit 50 deployed CMWs in the entire district of Gujrat. The pre-tested module and tools of Helping Babies Breathe (2nd edition) were used in the intervention. Using the High Frequency training approach, three one-day training sessions were conducted for CMWs at an interval of 2 months. During the 2 months interval, participants were monitored and supported to practice their skills at their birthing centers. Knowledge and skills were assessed before and after each session. The McNemar and Cochran's Q tests were applied for data analysis. Participants' feedback was also obtained at the end of each training, which was analyzed through descriptive statistics.

The McNemar and Cochran's Q tests were applied for data analysis. Participants' feedback was also obtained at the end of each training, which was analyzed through descriptive statistics.Data from 34 CMWs were analyzed as they completed all three training sessions and assessments. The results were statistically different after each training session for OSCE B (p-value < 0.05). However, for knowledge and OSCE A, significant improvement was observed after training sessions 1 and 2 only. Pairwise comparison showed that pre-assessment at training 1 was significantly different from most of the repeated measures of knowledge, OSCE A, and OSCE B. Moreover, the learners appreciated the overall training in terms of organization, content, material, assessment, and overall competency. Additionally, due to a small sample size of the CMWs, and a short time of the intervention, significant differences in morbidity and mortality outcomes could not be detected.

    "Abstract": "Background Traditional, instructor led, in-person training of CPR skills has become more challenging due to COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the learning outcomes of standard in-person CPR training (ST) with alternative methods of training such as hybrid or online-only training (AT) on CPR performance, quality, and knowledge among laypersons with no previous CPR training. Methods We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for relevant articles from January 1995 to May 2020. Covidence was used to review articles by two independent researchers. Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool was used to assess quality of the manuscripts. Results Of the 978 articles screened, twenty met the final inclusion criteria. All included studies had an experimental design and moderate to strong global quality rating. The trainees in ST group performed better on calling 911, time to initiate chest compressions, hand placement and chest compression depth. Trainees in AT group performed better in assessing scene safety, calling for help, response time including initiating first rescue breathing, adequate ventilation volume, compression rates, shorter hands-off time, confidence, willingness to perform CPR, ability to follow CPR algorithm, and equivalent or better knowledge retention than standard teaching methodology. Conclusion AT methods of CPR training provide an effective alternative to the standard in-person CPR for large scale public training.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG BACKGROUND: The use and knowledge of medicinal plants play an essential role in community health in rural Mexico. Medicinal plants are part of the local heritage and provide a source of economic income. Nevertheless, knowledge of their use has declined due to factors like accelerated urbanization. Some authors have proposed that by reducing natural spaces, urbanization generates changes that impact the recognition, use, and management of natural resources. Here, we evaluate how urbanization affects the knowledge, use, and perception of medicinal plants in a Biosphere Reserve in Mexico. METHODS: Using a mixed methodology including quantitative and qualitative analyses, we generated a list of medicinal plants, methods of preparation, prevalence of illness, and use in two communities with different degrees of urbanization. RESULTS: A total of 217 medicinal plants were identified. The more urbanized community had greater knowledge of, and used, a larger number of introduced plant species, while the less urbanized community used and had more knowledge about wild plants. One of the factors explaining these differences was occupation, with people who work outdoors showing greater knowledge of wild plants. CONCLUSIONS: Urbanization can lead to a loss of knowledge of the use and management of local wild species, with implications for the conservation of biocultural heritage.

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG Organisational forgetting is associated with unintentional knowledge loss that makes both food businesses and consumers vulnerable to a food safety incident. It is essential that food businesses have strategies and processes in place to minimise unintentional knowledge loss to ensure that essential knowledge is retained, maintained and stays valid.The aim of this paper is to consider the risk associated with unintentional food safety knowledge loss at individual, organisational and inter-organisational levels. The research approach employed was to undertake a review of existing literature to frame the conceptual research. Screening of both academic and grey literature demonstrated a distinct knowledge gap i.e., there is limited previous research considering the concept of unintentional knowledge loss and its impact on food safety. Case study examples explore the academic theory in more depth.Three aspects of organisational forgetting are considered in the context of food safety: organisational amnesia, organisational memory decay, and supply chain déjà-vu. The first two aspects operate at the organisational level and the third at the supply chain level. To overcome the risk of unintentional loss, organisational and interorganisational knowledge needs to be effectively mapped and a knowledge retention policy needs to be developed, implemented and maintained that addresses all types of organisational and interorganisational knowledge, but especially food safety knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG BACKGROUND: The Republic of Georgia is part of the Caucasus biodiversity hotspot, and human agricultural plant use dates back at least 6000 years. Over the last years, lots of ethnobotanical research on the area has been published. In this paper, we analyze the use of food plants in the 80% of Georgia not occupied by Russian forces. We hypothesized that (1) given the long tradition of plant use, and the isolation under Soviet rule, plant use both based on home gardens and wild harvesting would be more pronounced in Georgia than in the wider region, (2) food plant use knowledge would be widely and equally spread in most of Georgia, (3) there would still be incidence of knowledge loss despite wide plant use, especially in climatically favored agricultural regions in Western and Eastern Georgia. METHODS: From 2013 to 2019, we interviewed over 380 participants in all regions of Georgia not occupied by Russian forces and recorded over 19,800 mentions of food plants. All interviews were carried out in the participants’ homes and gardens by native speakers of Georgian and its dialects (Imeretian, Rachian, Lechkhumian, Tush, Khevsurian, Psavian, Kakhetian), other Kartvelian languages (Megrelian, Svan) and minority languages (Ossetian, Ude, Azeri, Armenian, Greek). RESULTS: The regional division was based primarily on historic provinces of Georgia, which often coincides with the current administrative borders. The total number of taxa, mostly identified to species, including their varieties, was 527. Taxonomically, the difference between two food plant groups—garden versus wild—was strongly pronounced even at family level. The richness of plant families was 65 versus 97 families in garden versus wild plants, respectively, and the difference was highly significant. Other diversity indices also unequivocally pointed to considerably more diverse family composition of wild collected versus garden plants as the differences between all the tested diversity indices appeared to be highly significant. The wide use of leaves for herb pies and lactofermented is of particular interest. Some of the ingredients are toxic in larger quantities, and the participants pointed out that careful preparation was needed. The authors explicitly decided to not give any recipes, given that many of the species are widespread, and compound composition—and with it possible toxic effects—might vary across the distribution range, so that a preparation method that sufficiently reduces toxicity in the Caucasus might not necessary be applicable in other areas. CONCLUSIONS: Relationships among the regions in the case of wild food plants show a different and clearer pattern. Adjacent regions cluster together (Kvemo Zemo Racha, and Zemo Imereti; Samegrelo, Guria, Adjara, Lechkhumi and Kvemo and Zemo Svaneti; Meskheti, Javakheti, Kvemo Kartli; Mtianeti, Kakheti, Khevsureti, Tusheti. Like in the case of the garden food plants, species diversity of wild food plants mentioned varied strongly. Climate severity and traditions of the use of wild food plants might play role in this variation. Overall food plant knowledge is widely spread all-across Georgia, and broadly maintained.",

BACKGROUND Simulation-based training's impact on learning outcomes may be related to cognitive load or emotions during training. We evaluated the association of validated measures of cognitive load and emotion with learning outcomes in simulation-based obstetric internal medicine cases.All internal medicine learners (n = 15) who completed the knowledge test pre-training, post-training (knowledge acquisition), and at 3-6 months (knowledge retention) for all three simulation cases were included. METHODS All internal medicine learners (n = 15) who completed the knowledge test pre-training, post-training (knowledge acquisition), and at 3-6 months (knowledge retention) for all three simulation cases were included.Mean knowledge scores differed over time in all three cases (p < 0.0001 for all). Knowledge retention scores were significantly higher only for cases 1 and 3. Cognitive load associated with frustration was positively associated with knowledge acquisition for case 2 (beta = 5.18, P = 0.007), while excitement was negatively associated with knowledge retention in case 1 (beta = -33.07, p = 0.04). RESULTS Mean knowledge scores differed over time in all three cases (p < 0.0001 for all). Knowledge retention scores were significantly higher only for cases 1 and 3. Cognitive load associated with frustration was positively associated with knowledge acquisition for case 2 (beta = 5.18, P = 0.007), while excitement was negatively associated with knowledge retention in case 1 (beta = -33.07, p = 0.04).Simulation-based education for obstetric internal medicine can be effective in select cases.

The present study was taken up to know the effectiveness of CBL as a teaching-learning method in Anatomy in improving the knowledge and retention of acquired knowledge. Material and Methods This was an interventional cross-over study carried out at NRI Medical College and General Hospital, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh. Two hundred students studying in first-year MBBS were included in the study and divided into two batches. The batches - A and B - were exposed to CBL and didactic lecture, respectively, in the first month for Topic I, and then cross-over was done in the second month for Topic II. The knowledge of the students before and after the sessions was assessed by pre-session and post-session multiple-choice question (MCQ) tests. Knowledge retention was assessed by another MCQ test conducted four weeks after the post-session test. Results The average difference of the scores between pre-session and post-session tests in the CBL group for Topics I and II (4.01±1.17 and 3.8±1.6) are significantly more compared to the didactic lecture method (3.3±1.3 and 1.9±1.2). The average difference of the scores between the post-session tests and retention-tests in the CBL group (0.122±1.05 and 0.18±1.04) were further compared to the lecture method (0.016±0.95 and 0.09±0.8) for Topics I and II, respectively. There was a significant increase in the proportion of students with scores above 50% in the post-session test and retention test in the CBL group compared to the didactic lecture group.

    "Abstract": "Background Organisational forgetting is associated with unintentional knowledge loss that makes both food businesses and consumers vulnerable to a food safety incident. It is essential that food businesses have strategies and processes in place to minimise unintentional knowledge loss to ensure that essential knowledge is retained, maintained and stays valid. Scope and approach The aim of this paper is to consider the risk associated with unintentional food safety knowledge loss at individual, organisational and inter-organisational levels. The research approach employed was to undertake a review of existing literature to frame the conceptual research. Screening of both academic and grey literature demonstrated a distinct knowledge gap i.e., there is limited previous research considering the concept of unintentional knowledge loss and its impact on food safety. Case study examples explore the academic theory in more depth. Key findings and conclusions Three aspects of organisational forgetting are considered in the context of food safety: organisational amnesia, organisational memory decay, and supply chain déjà-vu. The first two aspects operate at the organisational level and the third at the supply chain level. To overcome the risk of unintentional loss, organisational and interorganisational knowledge needs to be effectively mapped and a knowledge retention policy needs to be developed, implemented and maintained that addresses all types of organisational and interorganisational knowledge, but especially food safety knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "Pathology teaching, an intensively image loaded discipline, poses a significant challenge in its delivery. A lot of effort has been placed into sourcing teaching methods that could effectively enhance students' understanding and knowledge retention in this discipline. We describe for the first time in the literature the use of an image-based quiz (IBQ) to deliver a neuropathology lecture. The participating medical students were randomised into either the study group (IBQ) or the control group (traditional lecture, TL). The students were asked to complete the pre- and post-multiple choice question (MCQ) test before and after attending either of the allocated interventions. In the IBQ group, the students were presented with image-based quizzes, and answers to the quizzes were projected in real-time on screen. The students in the TL group were given the usual, traditional lecture. A total of 75 third-year medical students participated in this study. The participants were recruited from third-year medical students representing two different academic years. There was no significant difference in the pre- and post-MCQ scores between the IBQ and TL groups. However, a significant improvement in the mean scores for the pre- and post-MCQ results in both the study ( p  = 0.001; 95% CI 0.572-1.954) and control ( p  < 0.001; 95% CI 0.561-1.763) groups was observed. We found that the IBQ was a simple, personalised, and cost-effective digitalised tool which our study suggests it to be as effective as the traditional lecture in the delivery of pathology knowledge in undergraduate medical students.Pathology teaching, an intensively image loaded discipline, poses a significant challenge in its delivery.

    "Abstract": "As medical schools condense the basic science phase of undergraduate medical education, it has become increasingly important to identify methods and tools that facilitate learning, mastery, and application of medical knowledge. One increasingly popular tool that promotes engagement with content is Anki, a web-based flash card system.

The objective of this study was to identify Anki use and its association to USMLE Step 1 performance. INTRODUCTION As medical schools condense the basic science phase of undergraduate medical education, it has become increasingly important to identify methods and tools that facilitate learning, mastery, and application of medical knowledge. One increasingly popular tool that promotes engagement with content is Anki, a web-based flash card system. Using Anki, medical students can access pre-made flash cards specifically tailored to prepare students for the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 1 exam. The objective of this study was to identify Anki use and its association to USMLE Step 1 performance.In March 2020, medical students in years 2, 3, and 4 who had completed USMLE Step 1 were administered a survey to measure Anki usage. The survey was locally developed and was reviewed by survey experts on campus. Survey responses were paired with USMLE Step 1 results for analyses. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for analysis. METHODS In March 2020, medical students in years 2, 3, and 4 who had completed USMLE Step 1 were administered a survey to measure Anki usage. The survey was locally developed and was reviewed by survey experts on campus. Survey responses were paired with USMLE Step 1 results for analyses. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for analysis.Anki usage was associated with higher USMLE Step 1 scores. Additionally, amongst those who used Anki, those with more consistent use had higher USMLE Step 1 scores and higher perceived levels of knowledge retention. RESULTS Anki usage was associated with higher USMLE Step 1 scores. Additionally, amongst those who used Anki, those with more consistent use had higher USMLE Step 1 scores and higher perceived levels of knowledge retention.This research suggests that Anki is an effective educational tool that should be recommended to medical students alongside other evidenced-based study tools, such as the popular question bank USMLE World. Future research should attempt to identify a relationship between Anki usage and future clinical performance to demonstrate the implications that Anki has on clinical skills. CONCLUSIONS This research suggests that Anki is an effective educational tool that should be recommended to medical students alongside other evidenced-based study tools, such as the popular question bank USMLE World.

    "Abstract": "References to settled case law permeate the decisions of the European Court of Justice. Legal literature commonly deems them elements of stability and constraint. By contrast, this article highlights their transformative effect. That effect occurs in the process of repetition, conceptualized as a process that permits alteration. The article identifies and explores three types of alteration, or three mechanisms of instability: (1) the substitution of cited cases in citation strings; (2) the alternation between expressions found in settled case law and alternative expressions; and (3) the un-anchoring or detachment of legal statements from cases in which they initially appeared. The analysis illustrates how substitution leads to diverging interpretive outcomes, how alternation unsettles the normative force and the relevance of the acquis, and how un-anchoring results in a loss of knowledge. From this perspective, references to settled cases result in complex changes to the law – changes which are multi-directional and lack a clear progression. The article contributes to a better understanding of legal change, and it illuminates the role of past cases in the Court's decision making.",

    "Abstract": "To assess knowledge retention of physicians after participating in a webinar series and its perceived benefits on daily practice and career development. PURPOSE To assess knowledge retention of physicians after participating in a webinar series and its perceived benefits on daily practice and career development.The webinar series comprised six separate webinars about daily practice. Online questionnaires were sent to all participating physicians via email 3 months after the webinars. The questionnaire assessed knowledge retention through the difference between initial and follow-up post-test as well as the webinar series' benefits on daily practice and career development. Participants' demographic information, including their age, gender, education, year of graduation, and work details, were collected to compare outcomes between demographic groups. METHODS The webinar series comprised six separate webinars about daily practice. Online questionnaires were sent to all participating physicians via email 3 months after the webinars. The questionnaire assessed knowledge retention through the difference between initial and follow-up post-test as well as the webinar series' benefits on daily practice and career development. Participants' demographic information, including their age, gender, education, year of graduation, and work details, were collected to compare outcomes between demographic groups.A total of 689 responses were gathered, and 622 were analyzed. At follow-up, the median knowledge score was significantly lower than the initial median knowledge score (Z=-6.973, p<0.001). Participants' perception of the webinar series' benefits on daily practice and career development was very positive. A significant weak negative correlation was found between age and knowledge score at follow-up (rs=-0.157, p<0.001). Physicians who graduated more recently and worked for less than 3 years scored significantly higher on knowledge tests at follow-up. Meanwhile, perception score towards webinar series' benefits on daily practice was significantly higher among physicians with more extended work history. Male physicians scored significantly higher on perception score towards webinar series' benefits on career development. RESULTS A total of 689 responses were gathered, and 622 were analyzed. At follow-up, the median knowledge score was significantly lower than the initial median knowledge score (Z=-6.973, p<0.001). Participants' perception of the webinar series' benefits on daily practice and career development was very positive.

Meanwhile, perception score towards webinar series' benefits on daily practice was significantly higher among physicians with more extended work history. Male physicians scored significantly higher on perception score towards webinar series' benefits on career development.Online continuing medical education programs like webinars can encourage physicians to maintain their competence, but further research on improving knowledge retention over time is necessary. Overall, physicians perceived webinars to be beneficial for their professional development. CONCLUSION Online continuing medical education programs like webinars can encourage physicians to maintain their competence, but further research on improving knowledge retention over time is necessary.

BACKGROUND Understanding respiratory physiology and mechanical ventilation is a challenge for healthcare workers, particularly, medical residents. A team of French-speaking experts developed an innovative MOOC incorporating interactive simulation-based videos and serious games aiming at improving knowledge and skills in mechanical ventilation. Our objective was to evaluate the long-term knowledge retention regarding key concepts presented in this MOOC.French residents registered for the MOOC 2020's winter session were invited to participate in a two-step study. The first step consisted in evaluating students' pre-course knowledge of respiratory physiology and mechanical ventilation fusing a 20 five-item multiple choice questions test with a total score ranging from 0 to 100. For the second step, the same students answered the same test (after shuffling the questions) six months after the completion of the course. We assessed the impact of this MOOC on the students' knowledge retention by comparing pre-course and post-course scores.

We assessed the impact of this MOOC on the students' knowledge retention by comparing pre-course and post-course scores.Of the 102 residents who agreed to participate in the study, 80 completed the course and their mean ± SD pre-course score was 76.0 ± 8.0. Fifty-one respondents also completed the second and their post-course score was significantly higher than the baseline one (83.1 ± 7.3 vs. 77.5 ± 7.6, p < 0.001). Scores of the first and second rounds did not differ upon comparing respondents' background specialty or number of years of residency. For the vast majority of individual questions (96%), the success rate was higher at the post-course than at the pre-course assessment.

We evaluated the association of validated measures of cognitive load and emotion with learning outcomes in simulation-based obstetric internal medicine cases. Methods All internal medicine learners (n = 15) who completed the knowledge test pre-training, post-training (knowledge acquisition), and at 3–6 months (knowledge retention) for all three simulation cases were included. Results Mean knowledge scores differed over time in all three cases (p < 0.0001 for all). Knowledge retention scores were significantly higher only for cases 1 and 3. Cognitive load associated with frustration was positively associated with knowledge acquisition for case 2 (beta = 5.18, P = 0.007), while excitement was negatively associated with knowledge retention in case 1 (beta = –33.07, p = 0.04).

    "Abstract": "A traditional definition of cultural heritage, tangible and intangible, includes all assets that have a symbolic cultural value: from historic towns, buildings, cultural landscapes and cultural objects to intangible manifestations that usually fall into the category of folklore and ‘popular culture’. They are a unique set of cultural manifestations created under particular social, cultural, and economic circumstances, which are impossible to recreate truly. The speed with which the world is changing places heritage at a risk of being lost through physical destruction or loss of knowledge. National and international organisations have sought to establish a formal system of identifying a sample of that heritage and conserving it for the future. As it cannot include everything, determining the best or most representative samples or things to preserve is not always a politically or ideologically neutral decision (Messenger and Smith, Citation 2010,Waterton Citation 2012). The UNESCO and the Council of Europe have been very active in the area of cultural heritage. Among the issues of interest for these organisations in the broad field of culture are cultural identity and the recognition of minorities (Richards Citation 1996). Since the 1990s, studies on ‘place’ and ‘space’ have contributed to rethinking the concept of heritage (Brauch, Lipphardt, Nocke Citation 2008). If the concept of ‘heritage’ refers to the past, the concept of ‘space’ refers to the dynamic relationships that occur – alongside many other areas – around heritage, its use, interpretation, (re)creation of identities, and construction of social relationships (Breglia Citation 2006). That is, not as something stable and fixed but as something symbolic and fluid (Gromova and Voigt, Citation 2015). As Diana Pinto pointed out, in the mid-1990s, when she coined the concept of ‘Jewish space’, cultural heritage and other Jewish cultural spaces in Europe would inevitably come from the hand not only of Jews but often of non-Jews (Pinto Citation 1996). The transformation in tourist products of old Jewish neighbourhoods in Europe is one such example for a form of co-construction of memories and, even, identities (Eszter Citation 2014). As Joan and Jean Comaroff have argued, ethnicity and cultural heritage have become a commodity, a market product (of those in the margins, the exoticised ‘others’) to be consumed (Comaroff and Comaroff, Citation 2009). This raises crucial questions about who’s heritage and identity are distinguished for preservation, by whom, why, and how. The ethnographic gaze can help us see beyond the superficial representations, often stereotyped, sometimes offensive, of the ethnicities that supposedly represent Jewish cultural heritage and Jewish cultural spaces in the flourishing ethnocultural tourism in Europe and beyond. A more in-depth look will reveal a much more complex picture, with the social interactions and projects that arise from this (re)creation of ‘Jewish’ spaces, shared by Jews and non-Jews (Lehrer Citation 2013). This phenomenon, widely studied in Central and Eastern Europe (Gromova, Heinert, Voigt Citation 2015), has received little attention in other contexts, such as the Iberian context and North Africa, this monographic dossier’s object.",

    "Abstract": "Wireless communication network attack detection is important in the field of wireless communication network data mining. Transfer learning is a powerful tool to solve the problem of link prediction in unlabeled wireless networks. In the feature mapping process of transfer learning, the loss of source domain information is very serious, which leads to the loss of knowledge in inverse mapping. To obtain more specific and complete information in the source domain, a link prediction method based on the distribution function fitting method of domain orthogonal term family is proposed. The key samples in the source domain are used to construct a family of orthogonal polynomials, and the least square approximation of the distribution function is obtained by using the family of orthogonal polynomials. The feature vector set of the key samples is extracted from the source domain, and the pseudo label is assigned to the target training set, so that the link classifier can complete the supervised link prediction task. In addition, an advanced performance of TLAD is obtained by comparing with other state‐of‐the‐art models in practice.",

    "Abstract": "The testing effect—the power of retrieval practice to enhance long-term knowledge retention more than restudying does—is a well-known phenomenon in learning. However, retrieval practice is hardly appreciated by students and underutilized when studying. One of the reasons is that learners usually do not experience immediate benefits of such practice which often present only after a delay. We therefore conducted 2 experiments to examine whether students choose retrieval practice more often as their learning strategy after having experienced its benefits. In Experiment 1, students received individual feedback about the extent to which their 7-day delayed test scores after retrieval practice differed from their test scores after restudy. Those students who had actually experienced the benefits of retrieval practice appreciated the strategy more and used it more often after receiving feedback. In Experiment 2, we compared the short-term and long-term effects on retrieval practice use of individual performance feedback and general instruction about the testing effect. Although both interventions enhanced its use in the short term, only the individual feedback led to enhanced use in the long term by those who had actually experienced its benefits, demonstrating the superiority of the individual feedback in terms of its ability to promote retrieval practice use.",

Introduction Teaching human anatomy to produce deeper understandings and knowledge retention in learners requires meaningful, engaging, and practical activities. Previous studies identify that most students who participated in body painting (BP) reported improved understanding of surface anatomy (SA). This study investigates the key factors underpinning how BP helps students learn SA.The study involved an explanatory mixed-methods approach. Towards the end of an anatomy course, a survey was administered to three cohorts of first-year chiropractic, osteopathy, and Chinese medicine students and second-year biomedical sciences students over 3 years ( n  = 311; response rate = 30%). The survey assessed the effectiveness of BP as a hands-on, group-based approach for learning SA in practical class. Three student focus groups ( n  = 13) explored the key survey findings. Methods The study involved an explanatory mixed-methods approach. Towards the end of an anatomy course, a survey was administered to three cohorts of first-year chiropractic, osteopathy, and Chinese medicine students and second-year biomedical sciences students over 3 years (n = 311; response rate = 30%). The survey assessed the effectiveness of BP as a hands-on, group-based approach for learning SA in practical class. Three student focus groups (n = 13) explored the key survey findings.Overall, 72% of student respondents reported BP activities helped them learn SA \"quite a bit\" or \"very much\". Multivariate analysis identified students found BP helped them learn SA by \"remembering the position of the bones, joints, muscles, actions and insertions\" (POR = 5.7; P  < 0.001); \"integrating textbook and other knowledge on a real live person\" (POR = 2.4; P  = 0.027); and \"achieving a deeper understanding of SA\" (POR = 5.2; P  < 0.001). The qualitative findings describe specifically how BP helps students learn, understand, and remember SA.

The qualitative findings describe specifically how BP helps students learn, understand, and remember SA.The findings show the majority of students believed BP benefitted their learning of SA through enhancing engagement in self-directed classroom and out-of-hours learning opportunities, deeper understandings of form and function, retention of knowledge, and practical physical examination experiences palpating the variations in form between individuals. Conclusions The findings show the majority of students believed BP benefitted their learning of SA through enhancing engagement in self-directed classroom and out-of-hours learning opportunities, deeper understandings of form and function, retention of knowledge, and practical physical examination experiences palpating the variations in form between individuals.",

BACKGROUND Most mortality in trauma occurs in prehospital settings when the golden hour is spent accessing healthcare facilities rather than resuscitating and stabilizing. Assessments performed in the rural community of Nanakpur, India demonstrated a significant paucity of, and limited access to healthcare facilities. To address deficiencies in prehospital care, the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) constructed the Basic Emergency Care Course (BECC). This study evaluated the BECCs efficacy in Nanakpur.The first responder courses took place in 2017 in Nanakpur. Local community health workers, known as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) were recruited as participants. Participants completed both a pre- and post-course evaluation to assess baseline knowledge and improvement. Participants then took a one-year post-course assessment to evaluate retention. METHODS The first responder courses took place in 2017 in Nanakpur. Local community health workers, known as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) were recruited as participants. Participants completed both a pre- and post-course evaluation to assess baseline knowledge and improvement. Participants then took a one-year post-course assessment to evaluate retention.The course included 204 individuals, and over half (109/204) were ASHAs. Pre- and post-course test results were available for 70 participants and demonstrated a significant improvement in knowledge (P < 0.0001). The one-year knowledge retention assessment was completed by 48.6% (n = 53/109) of the original ASHAs. Comparisons between both the pre- and post-course assessment tests with the 12-mo retention assessment revealed a significant decay in knowledge (P < 0.0001). RESULTS The course included 204 individuals, and over half (109/204) were ASHAs. Pre- and post-course test results were available for 70 participants and demonstrated a significant improvement in knowledge (P < 0.0001). The one-year knowledge retention assessment was completed by 48.6% (n = 53/109) of the original ASHAs. Comparisons between both the pre- and post-course assessment tests with the 12-mo retention assessment revealed a significant decay in knowledge (P < 0.0001).This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing BECC to train ASHAs in Nanakpur as first responders. Participants demonstrated a significant improvement in knowledge immediately after the course. After one year, there was a significant loss in knowledge, highlighting the need for refresher courses. These data suggest potential for the use of BECC for training ASHAs countrywide to strengthen India's prehospital care system. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing BECC to train ASHAs in Nanakpur as first responders.

INTRODUCTION Modern radiation therapy undergraduate education comprises the illustration of theoretical, technical concepts in a classroom setting, coupled with the acquisition of practical handling and patient communication skills within the clinical environment. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the application of virtual environments to education, despite ongoing inconclusive evidence on the use of virtual environments for enhancing student educational achievement.The aim of our research is to evaluate a custom-built 3D virtual radiation oncology department created within Second Life®, an online virtual world, as an alternative to traditional physical classroom-based didactic instruction, in tandem with a Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training (VERT) system, for the peer support and training of junior radiation therapy students in their first and second year of undergraduate studies. To achieve this aim, we investigated learning achievement outcomes, knowledge retention over a 2-week time interval and learner self-perceived confidence post-instruction, using both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Student participants were randomised into two groups; the control group attended a face-to-face classroom session centred on the illustration of theoretical, technical concepts, while the intervention group attended a virtual classroom session online on Second Life®, where similar content was delivered. Both groups then attended a VERT practical session to acquire practical handling and communication skills in radiation therapy. Upon completion of the sessions, confidence surveys, knowledge-based written and practical assessments were administered to the student participants.

Both groups then attended a VERT practical session to acquire practical handling and communication skills in radiation therapy. Upon completion of the sessions, confidence surveys, knowledge-based written and practical assessments were administered to the student participants.We found that the instructional session conducted within the custom-built 3D virtual radiation oncology department in Second Life® compared to the traditional didactic classroom setting increased undergraduate Year 1 radiation therapy students' perceived confidence to a greater extent compared to Year 2 students, in performing radiation therapy treatment procedures. In addition, our findings revealed that overall learning achievement outcomes and knowledge retention scores between Second Life® and non- Second Life® student participants were closely similar and statistically insignificant. Thematic analysis of the confidence survey questionnaires revealed that the students in general desired more clinical hands-on practice. RESULTS We found that the instructional session conducted within the custom-built 3D virtual radiation oncology department in Second Life® compared to the traditional didactic classroom setting increased undergraduate Year 1 radiation therapy students' perceived confidence to a greater extent compared to Year 2 students, in performing radiation therapy treatment procedures. In addition, our findings revealed that overall learning achievement outcomes and knowledge retention scores between Second Life® and non- Second Life® student participants were closely similar and statistically insignificant. Thematic analysis of the confidence survey questionnaires revealed that the students in general desired more clinical hands-on practice.Second Life® is equally effective in disseminating theoretical, technical course content delivery to undergraduate radiation therapy students. The use of virtual environments appears to have increased the perceived confidence of the Year 1 undergraduate students to a greater extent compared to the Year 2 undergraduates, suggesting that the adoption of virtual environments early in the students' educational journey can have a positive effect on students' learning experience. DISCUSSION Second Life® is equally effective in disseminating theoretical, technical course content delivery to undergraduate radiation therapy students. The use of virtual environments appears to have increased the perceived confidence of the Year 1 undergraduate students to a greater extent compared to the Year 2 undergraduates, suggesting that the adoption of virtual environments early in the students' educational journey can have a positive effect on students' learning experience.The development and use of our custom-built Second Life® radiation oncology department provides a novel way of delivering remote, virtual training instruction to undergraduate radiation therapy students over traditional, didactic classroom instructional delivery. We recommend, based on the results of this pilot study, that future research can involve a larger study sample of undergraduate RT students, to explore both the short-term and long-term impact of virtual environments on student learning outcomes across their enrolled years of study. This would in turn mean progressive attempts to revamp our existing curricula structure, to deliberately incorporate the use of virtual environments, especially during early undergraduate years, towards enhanced modern RT education.

    "Abstract": "The testing effect—the power of retrieval practice to enhance long-term knowledge retention more than restudying does—is a well-known phenomenon in learning. However, retrieval practice is hardly appreciated by students and underutilized when studying. One of the reasons is that learners usually do not experience immediate benefits of such practice which often present only after a delay. We therefore conducted 2 experiments to examine whether students choose retrieval practice more often as their learning strategy after having experienced its benefits. In Experiment 1, students received individual feedback about the extent to which their 7-day delayed test scores after retrieval practice differed from their test scores after restudy. Those students who had actually experienced the benefits of retrieval practice appreciated the strategy more and used it more often after receiving feedback. In Experiment 2, we compared the short-term and long-term effects on retrieval practice use of individual performance feedback and general instruction about the testing effect. Although both interventions enhanced its use in the short term, only the individual feedback led to enhanced use in the long term by those who had actually experienced its benefits, demonstrating the superiority of the individual feedback in terms of its ability to promote retrieval practice use.

    "Abstract": "There is a concern over long-term retention of knowledge in professional programs. The goal of this study was to evaluate the retention of veterinary clinical pathology knowledge between the fourth-semester and fourth-year clinical pathology courses. We hypothesize that students will forget a significant amount of content area knowledge between the fourth semester and fourth year in the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) program. We further hypothesize that a review of material during the fourth-year clinical pathology rotation will help students rebuild existing knowledge and increase performance on specific test questions, between T2 (rotation pre-test) and T3 (rotation post-test). Initial mastery of course material was assessed via a 94-item multiple-choice final exam (T1) given in the semester 4 clinical pathology course. Retention of course material from semester 4 to year 4 was assessed via a 55-item multiple-choice pre-test, administered at the start of the clinical pathology rotation in year 4 while learning/mastery during the clinical rotation was assessed via a 55-item multiple-choice post-test, administered at the end of each clinical pathology rotation. In this study, evidence of knowledge retention between semester 4 and year 4 was 55.5%. There is a small increase in the measure of knowledge gain from the beginning to the end of the rotation. As an added benefit, we were able to use identified trends for retention of knowledge within specific subject areas as a mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of our course and reallocate additional instructional time to topics with poorer retention.There is a concern over long-term retention of knowledge in professional programs.

    "Abstract": "Improving nursing students' understanding of the novel COVID-19 is an essential component of their education. We designed and developed a serious game-based computer learning application that requires nursing students to solve problems through simulated cases. This study aimed to compare knowledge mastery among nursing students who used this teaching method versus those who received online lectures. A retrospective observational study was conducted using preclass, postclass, and final test scores of 130 students retrieved from the university's database of test scores. Both teaching methods produced significant increases in short-term knowledge of COVID-19. There was no statistical difference between the two methods in pre- and postclass scores; however, the serious game group scored higher than the online lecture group in knowledge retention. In summary, the serious game application is a potentially effective method for COVID-19 education among nursing students, particularly in terms of its capacity for improved knowledge retention.Improving nursing students' understanding of the novel COVID-19 is an essential component of their education.

    "Abstract": "Due to the role expansion of radiotherapists in dosimetric aspect, radiotherapists have taken up organs at risk (OARs) contouring work in many clinical settings. However, training of newly qualified radiotherapists in OARs contouring can be time consuming, it may also cause extra burden to experienced radiotherapists. As web-based open-source radiotherapy delineation software (WORDS) has become more readily available, it has provided a free and interactive alternative to conventional one-to-one coaching approach during OARs contouring training. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of WORDS in training OARs contouring skills of newly qualified radiotherapists, compared to those trained by conventional one-to-one coaching approach. BACKGROUND Due to the role expansion of radiotherapists in dosimetric aspect, radiotherapists have taken up organs at risk (OARs) contouring work in many clinical settings. However, training of newly qualified radiotherapists in OARs contouring can be time consuming, it may also cause extra burden to experienced radiotherapists. As web-based open-source radiotherapy delineation software (WORDS) has become more readily available, it has provided a free and interactive alternative to conventional one-to-one coaching approach during OARs contouring training. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of WORDS in training OARs contouring skills of newly qualified radiotherapists, compared to those trained by conventional one-to-one coaching approach.Nine newly qualified radiotherapists (licensed in 2017 - 2018) were enrolled to the conventional one-to-one coaching group (control group), while 11 newly qualified radiotherapists (licensed in 2019 - 2021) were assigned to WORDS training group (measured group). Ten OARs were selected to be contoured in this 3-phases quantitative study. Participants were required to undergo phase 1 OARs contouring in the beginning of the training session. Afterwards, conventional one-to-one training or WORDS training session was provided to participants according to their assigned group. Then the participants did phase 2 and 3 OARs contouring which were separated 1 week apart. Phase 1 - 3 OARs contouring aimed to demonstrate participants' pre-training OARs contouring ability, post-training OARs contouring ability and knowledge retention after one-week interval respectively using either training approach. To prevent bias, the computed tomography dataset for OARs contouring in each phase were different. Variations in the contouring scores for the selected OARs were evaluated between 3 phases using Kruskal-Wallis tests with Dunn tests for pairwise comparisons. Variations in the contouring scores between control and measured group in phase 1 - 3 contouring were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A p-value  0.05) were observed in all OARs between both groups. RESULTS In both control group and measured group, significant improvement (p  0.05) were observed in all OARs between both groups.The results in this study have demonstrated that the outcome of OARs contouring training using WORDS is comparable to the conventional training approach. In addition, WORDS can offer flexibility to newly qualified radiotherapists to practice OARs contouring at will, as well as reduce staff training burden of experienced radiotherapists. CONCLUSIONS The results in this study have demonstrated that the outcome of OARs contouring training using WORDS is comparable to the conventional training approach. In addition, WORDS can offer flexibility to newly qualified radiotherapists to practice OARs contouring at will, as well as reduce staff training burden of experienced radiotherapists.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to evaluate best strategies for teaching intimate partner violence (IPV) education in an undergraduate community health nursing course. Results suggest gaming was a more effective strategy than storytelling for knowledge acquisition and storytelling was more effective for knowledge retention. IPV-related nursing interventions can impact client outcomes; therefore, education is needed prior to entering the workforce. The evaluation of strategies to improve knowledge acquisition and retention of IPV content is essential to ensure best practices for detection and intervention.",

    "Abstract": "Learning by teaching others is a potent educational strategy, but its implementation is typically cumbersome. This study ( N = 108) investigated “silent teaching”—writing a verbatim teaching script—as a convenient approach for independent learning, while assessing whether the teaching benefit is a production benefit. Learners studied a science text on the Doppler effect using one of three learning methods: (1) generating and studying their own notes (restudying control), (2) preparing to teach and then verbally teaching (verbal teaching), or (3) preparing to teach and then writing a verbatim teaching script (silent teaching). On a conceptual knowledge retention test 1 week later, participants who wrote teaching scripts performed as well as those who taught verbally; both teaching groups outperformed control learners. Verbal and silent teaching significantly increased social presence and elaboration to comparable extents, relative to restudying. “Silent teaching” is a promising and efficient alternative learning approach to traditional verbal teaching.

Edible plants have been used as a food source and have had other purposes since ancient times, but urbanization and modernization might be obscuring traditional knowledge. Therefore, this research aimed to conduct a study on the ethnobotany of indigenous people in Muang District, Kalasin Province based on edible plants by focusing on their specific uses. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions from March 2019 to February 2021. Quantitative analysis was applied using the Cultural Important Index (CI), Fidelity Level (FL) and Informant Consensus Factor (ICF). Cluster analysis based on the Jaccard’s Similarity Index (JI) was calculated for the similarity of edible plant uses in four communities is as follows: urban/semi-urban (UB), forest community (FC), wetland community (WC) and community in valley (CV). There were 140 edible plant species that belonged to 125 genera and 62 families. The most important edible plants species were Tamarindus indica which had a CI of 2.65 followed by Bambusa bambos (2.00) and Citrus hystrix (1.90). The highest FL value is given for 51 edible plant species with 100% FL. The ICF is a range of 0 to 1; the most consensus of ailment categories was the treatment of wound (ICF = 1.00). The JI varied between 0.2640 and 0.2971; the highest JI was the pairs of WC and FC. UPGMA cluster analysis indicated that UB is isolated as they have less similarity to other communities. The results show a risk of traditional knowledge loss due to the expansion of the economic system at all levels and the advancement of modern medicine.",

    "Abstract": "A study was conducted to assess the economic impact and knowledge retention of participants that attended the Northeast Georgia Beef Cattle Short course over an eight-year period. The course is an educational program hosted by the University of Georgia Extension Service that brings evidence-based science, technology, and economic and management strategies to Georgia beef cattle producers. The short course is taught annually, lasts a full day, and offers guest speakers and demonstrations from University of Georgia faculty and staff along with industry professionals. Non-formal feedback received from participants showcases its value and supports its continuation, but little is known about how the program impacts beef production in Georgia. The goal of the study was to quantify the long-term impact of the short course while developing an assessment tool that can be used to analyze and improve the course moving forward. Qualtrics was used to distribute a survey to 308 attendees of the short course to gather information on respondents’ role in the cattle industry, knowledge of the concepts taught, comfort level utilizing what was learned, and self-reported economic impact. The response rate was 22% for this study. 41% of respondents are retired individuals, 18% were involved in agricultural production and the remainder of participants represented outside professions. 14% of respondents reported that they believed the knowledge they gained during the short course allowed them to save or gain more than $20 per head. An additional 84% reported an economic impact up to $20/head. The most frequently reported source of cattle information was extension programs, at 17%. Based on these data, Extension has a significant impact on the Georgia cattle industry. In order to further develop the program, the recommendation is made that future courses can be developed to further build relationships with cattle producers and larger operations across the state.",

    "Abstract": "Background An appreciation for complex three-dimensional relationships in neuroanatomy forms a fundamental tenet of neurosurgical education. The value of experience in the cadaver lab is indisputable; however, it is expensive and often inaccessible. The wide availability of 3D technologies has opened new possibilities, although scientific inaccuracy has hitherto limited their use. Objective In the present study, we aim to describe a novel, literature-based process of scientific 3D modeling for the creation of neuroanatomical models adapted for mobile technology. Methods A systematic literature review regarding current resources in neuroanatomy education was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The composition of the team and the workflow behind the 3D Head Atlas app are also described. Results A total of 101 manuscripts were reviewed, and 24 included. Cadaveric dissections improve the learning process, although high costs limit their availability. Digital advancements have partially overcome the limitations of dissection, and have been associated with improved knowledge retention. Nevertheless, 3D models are often inaccurate, poorly adapted to mobile hardware, and expensive. Recent technological advances provide a new way to widely disseminate complex 3D models, with a revolutionary impact on learning. The approach behind the 3D Head Atlas app, based on the synergistic work of scientific and development teams, facilitates the creation of interactive 3D scientific material with high accuracy and wide accessibility. Conclusion The study of neuroanatomy is intimately related to the evolution of digital technology. Traditional methods (i.e. cadaveric dissections) have undisputed value but high costs. High-fidelity 3D scenarios and mobile devices may revolutionize learning if based on a sound evidence-based approach.",

    "Abstract": "Learning by teaching others is a potent educational strategy, but its implementation is typically cumbersome. This study ( N  = 108) investigated “silent teaching”—writing a verbatim teaching script—as a convenient approach for independent learning, while assessing whether the teaching benefit is a production benefit. Learners studied a science text on the Doppler effect using one of three learning methods: (1) generating and studying their own notes (restudying control), (2) preparing to teach and then verbally teaching (verbal teaching), or (3) preparing to teach and then writing a verbatim teaching script (silent teaching). On a conceptual knowledge retention test 1 week later, participants who wrote teaching scripts performed as well as those who taught verbally; both teaching groups outperformed control learners. Verbal and silent teaching significantly increased social presence and elaboration to comparable extents, relative to restudying. “Silent teaching” is a promising and efficient alternative learning approach to traditional verbal teaching.",

    "Abstract": "Biomedical educators have turned to technologies, like social media, to supplement progressive reductions in time spent in class. Many studies of social media have been limited to quantifying learner satisfaction and studies on the effects on learning outcomes are sparse. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of using Snapchat on learner satisfaction and learning outcomes. A Snapchat account was used to share blood flow diagrams during the anatomy course of a physical therapist education program. Viewing statistics were recorded, a survey was distributed, and learning outcomes quantified at the end of the course and 12 months later were compared with a control group that did not have access to the account. Eighty-two percent of the class subscribed to the Snapchat account and 86.7% of the subscribers completed viewing of the five drawings posted. Learners rated the account as extremely accurate, were quite interested in more content presented, and felt quite confident in the diagrams. Performance on blood flow questions on the end of course examinations were similar between experimental and control groups. Assessments administered 12 months later revealed greater scores for the Snapchat group (90.7% correct) compared with the control group (86.7% correct, p  = 0.04). These findings suggest that Snapchat is an effective way to deliver educational content and that learners found the content useful, accurate, and helpful in preparing them for the assessment. The ephemeral nature of disappearing content has potential to garner greater student attention and can be leveraged to improve knowledge retention.Biomedical educators have turned to technologies, like social media, to supplement progressive reductions in time spent in class.

    "Abstract": "An appreciation for complex three-dimensional relationships in neuroanatomy forms a fundamental tenet of neurosurgical education.

BACKGROUND An appreciation for complex three-dimensional relationships in neuroanatomy forms a fundamental tenet of neurosurgical education. The value of experience in the cadaver lab is indisputable; however, it is expensive and often inaccessible. The wide availability of 3D technologies has opened new possibilities, although scientific inaccuracy has hitherto limited their use.In the present study, we aim to describe a novel, literature-based process of scientific 3D modeling for the creation of neuroanatomical models adapted for mobile technology. OBJECTIVE In the present study, we aim to describe a novel, literature-based process of scientific 3D modeling for the creation of neuroanatomical models adapted for mobile technology.A systematic literature review regarding current resources in neuroanatomy education was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The composition of the team and the workflow behind the 3D Head Atlas app are also described. METHODS A systematic literature review regarding current resources in neuroanatomy education was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The composition of the team and the workflow behind the 3D Head Atlas app are also described.A total of 101 manuscripts were reviewed, and 24 included. Cadaveric dissections improve the learning process, although high costs limit their availability. Digital advancements have partially overcome the limitations of dissection, and have been associated with improved knowledge retention. Nevertheless, 3D models are often inaccurate, poorly adapted to mobile hardware, and expensive. Recent technological advances provide a new way to widely disseminate complex 3D models, with a revolutionary impact on learning. The approach behind the 3D Head Atlas app, based on the synergistic work of scientific and development teams, facilitates the creation of interactive 3D scientific material with high accuracy and wide accessibility.

Traditional methods (i.e. cadaveric dissections) have undisputed value but high costs. High-fidelity 3D scenarios and mobile devices may revolutionize learning if based on a sound evidence-based approach.

    "Abstract": "Introduction The application of video‐based learning in dentistry has been widely investigated; however, the nature of on‐screen video enhancements of the video has been minimally explored in the literature. This study investigated the effectiveness of an in‐class and on‐demand enhanced video to support learning on removable partial dentures in terms of knowledge acquisition, perception and clinical skill performance. Methods Fifty‐four dental students enrolled in 2018 were recruited as participants and assigned to two groups. Both groups were given the same lecture and asked to watch the same video in either the enhanced or non‐enhanced version. The enhanced video was modified with the contemporaneous subtitle of the presenters’ dialogue, text bullet points and summary text pages. The knowledge acquisition from the two types of video was subjected to pre‐ and post‐tests one month after the students watched the video. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the students’ perceptions of the learning experience and a performance test on practical skills was performed after six weeks. All the students responded to the test (100%). Results The enhanced video demonstration improved the students’ short‐term knowledge acquisition after they watched the video, with an average score of 1.59 points higher in the enhanced group than in the non‐enhanced group ( p  < .05). The practical performance did not differ between the two groups. The students were more likely accepted the enhanced video as a replacement of the existing teaching method rather than a teaching supplement (70.3%). Conclusion The application of the enhanced video demonstration resulted in a better theoretical knowledge retention but not practical performance. Students also preferred watching video to using conventional learning methods.",

    "Abstract": "The authors aim to evaluate the \"point-of-care\" transfontanellar ultrasound (TU) as an extension to pediatric physical examination and suggest a TU teaching protocol. OBJECTIVES The authors aim to evaluate the \"point-of-care\" transfontanellar ultrasound (TU) as an extension to pediatric physical examination and suggest a TU teaching protocol.The students were randomly divided into two groups, group A (12 participants) and group B (15 participants). The first group only received theoretical training, while the second group received theoretical and practical training. A third group, group C, included 15 pediatricians and interns who also received theoretical and practical training. All the participants underwent multiple-choice testing before and after a four-hour short course on TU. Six months later, another evaluation was performed to analyze the retained knowledge. Furthermore, a questionnaire based on the Likert scale was administered to evaluate satisfaction. METHODS The students were randomly divided into two groups, group A (12 participants) and group B (15 participants). The first group only received theoretical training, while the second group received theoretical and practical training. A third group, group C, included 15 pediatricians and interns who also received theoretical and practical training. All the participants underwent multiple-choice testing before and after a four-hour short course on TU. Six months later, another evaluation was performed to analyze the retained knowledge. Furthermore, a questionnaire based on the Likert scale was administered to evaluate satisfaction.The cognitive evaluation (maximum score=10 points) before and after training increased in group A from 4,0±1,04 to 7,5±1,2 (p<0.001) and, 6 months later, to 6,5±1,16 (p<0.003); in group B from 3,8±1,24 to 8,8±1,01 (p<0.001) and, 6 months later, to 8,46±0,91 (p<0.001); and in group C from 6,0±0,75 to 9,0±0,75 (p<0.001) and, 6 months later, to 8,8±0,77 (p<0.001). The average satisfaction estimated by the Likert scale was over 80% for all questions. RESULTS The cognitive evaluation (maximum score=10 points) before and after training increased in group A from 4,0±1,04 to 7,5±1,2 (p<0.001) and, 6 months later, to 6,5±1,16 (p<0.003); in group B from 3,8±1,24 to 8,8±1,01 (p<0.001) and, 6 months later, to 8,46±0,91 (p<0.001); and in group C from 6,0±0,75 to 9,0±0,75 (p<0.001) and, 6 months later, to 8,8±0,77 (p<0.001). The average satisfaction estimated by the Likert scale was over 80% for all questions.Cognitive assessment before and after classes and training reveals progress in learning, with knowledge retention in 6 months.

    "Abstract": "The application of video-based learning in dentistry has been widely investigated; however, the nature of on-screen video enhancements of the video has been minimally explored in the literature. This study investigated the effectiveness of an in-class and on-demand enhanced video to support learning on removable partial dentures in terms of knowledge acquisition, perception and clinical skill performance. INTRODUCTION The application of video-based learning in dentistry has been widely investigated; however, the nature of on-screen video enhancements of the video has been minimally explored in the literature. This study investigated the effectiveness of an in-class and on-demand enhanced video to support learning on removable partial dentures in terms of knowledge acquisition, perception and clinical skill performance.Fifty-four dental students enrolled in 2018 were recruited as participants and assigned to two groups. Both groups were given the same lecture and asked to watch the same video in either the enhanced or non-enhanced version. The enhanced video was modified with the contemporaneous subtitle of the presenters' dialogue, text bullet points and summary text pages. The knowledge acquisition from the two types of video was subjected to pre- and post-tests one month after the students watched the video. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the students' perceptions of the learning experience and a performance test on practical skills was performed after six weeks. All the students responded to the test (100%). METHODS Fifty-four dental students enrolled in 2018 were recruited as participants and assigned to two groups.

The enhanced video was modified with the contemporaneous subtitle of the presenters' dialogue, text bullet points and summary text pages.

A questionnaire was used to evaluate the students' perceptions of the learning experience and a performance test on practical skills was performed after six weeks. All the students responded to the test (100%).The enhanced video demonstration improved the students' short-term knowledge acquisition after they watched the video, with an average score of 1.59 points higher in the enhanced group than in the non-enhanced group (p < .05). The practical performance did not differ between the two groups. The students were more likely accepted the enhanced video as a replacement of the existing teaching method rather than a teaching supplement (70.3%). RESULTS The enhanced video demonstration improved the students' short-term knowledge acquisition after they watched the video, with an average score of 1.59 points higher in the enhanced group than in the non-enhanced group (p < .05). The practical performance did not differ between the two groups. The students were more likely accepted the enhanced video as a replacement of the existing teaching method rather than a teaching supplement (70.3%).The application of the enhanced video demonstration resulted in a better theoretical knowledge retention but not practical performance. Students also preferred watching video to using conventional learning methods. CONCLUSION The application of the enhanced video demonstration resulted in a better theoretical knowledge retention but not practical performance. Students also preferred watching video to using conventional learning methods.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose > The literature on supply chain risk management (SCRM) has investigated a multitude of supply chain risks. This paper aims to make a case for the importance of managing the risk of knowledge loss in the supply chain management (SCM) function and incorporating knowledge loss as a critical risk within the SCRM process. Design/methodology/approach > This paper adopts a knowledge-based view of the SCRM process and attempts to bring to light insights based on a synthesis of the relevant literature. The authors conducted a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed articles published between 1998 and 2019. Further, a case study was conducted to illustrate the significance of the risk of knowledge loss in the SCM function in terms of how it operates and why it has such a significant impact on performance. Findings > Knowledge loss is a relatively neglected type of supply chain risk that can be added to the existing typologies. This paper argues that knowledge loss in the SCM function has the propensity to significantly impact the performance of the focal firm, exacerbate other types of supply chain risk and impede risk mitigation efforts. We put forth several strategies that supply chain managers can adopt to mitigate the risk of knowledge loss in their function. Research limitations/implications > This paper generates an exploratory opening that could pave the way for a systematic theory of knowledge loss as a supply chain risk and future empirical research. The study culminates in a number of important insights and initiatives for supply chain managers to recognize and manage the risk of knowledge loss. Originality/value > This paper argues for the importance of incorporating the risk of knowledge loss in SCRM research and practice. It also provides an examination of some promising angles for future research in SCRM from a knowledge-based perspective.",

    "Abstract": "The 201 k National Curriculum for geography in England states that students should be able to interpret different sources of geographical information with the aid of Geographical Information Systems (GIS): they develop students' problem solving skills, and can help create meaningful, authentic lessons (Department for Education (DfE), 2013; Egiebor and Foster, 2019). Studying the Antarctic biome enables you to introduce students to the concept of interactions between terrestrial and marine environments and the implications of different geographical processes, such as how ecosystems operate, climate change, or Antarctica's contribution to global sea level rise and coastal flooding. Because they include investigative tools that allow students to explore and interpret data, this can help develop participatory learning (Pike, 2020), increase knowledge retention, make learning fun, and encourage critical thinking, as well as improve knowledge about maps (Egiebor and Foster, 2019). [...]StoryMaps can help connect local and global themes (cf.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: We aimed to compare traditional basic life support (BLS) education with specific and abstract innovative educative didactic material that has been previously designed and validated. Methods: Fifteen classes of schoolchildren aged 5 to 8 years ( n = 237) were randomly assigned to 4 groups in which different didactic and complementary materials were used: (1) the Rescube tool with a cuddly toy ( n = 61), (2) the Endless Book tool with a cuddly toy ( n = 74), (3) traditional teaching with a cuddly toy ( n = 46), and (4) traditional teaching with a manikin ( n = 55). The BLS sequence was assessed at baseline (T0). After that, children took part in a one-hour theory and practice session in their assigned training modality. BLS sequence was assessed again within one week (T1) and after one month (T2). Results: The 4 modalities were successful in improving children’s skills when comparing T0 with both T1 and T2 ( P < .05). At T2, more schoolchildren remembered the complete BLS sequence after using the Rescube (75%) compared with the number of schoolchildren who remember the complete BLS sequence after using the Endless Book (53%), a manikin (42%), or a cuddly toy (13%) ( P < .05). A higher proportion of participants who used the Rescube correctly performed all the BLS steps analyzed compared with those who used only the manikin or a cuddly toy during the learning phase. The Endless Book was also more effective except for learning to check consciousness and breathing. Conclusion: Better BLS learning and knowledge retention outcomes were achieved by using our specific and adapted didactic materials (Rescube and Endless Book). These new educational tools have the potential to substantially support BLS school education programs (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "Based on the Involvement Load Hypothesis, the present study investigated the differential effects of three post-listening output tasks (gap-filling, translation, and sentence-making) on immediate acquisition and retention of such vocabulary dimensions as productive knowledge of orthography, receptive recall of meaning and form, and productive knowledge of grammatical functions. Ninety second-year English majors were divided into three groups to finish listening plus one of the post-listening tasks. The results showed that the post-listening output tasks had positive effects on immediate acquisition of productive vocabulary knowledge, partially in agreement with the Involvement Load Hypothesis. However, the effects on vocabulary knowledge retention were found to be largely inconsistent with the Involvement Load Hypothesis. The finding thus challenges this hypothesis in that involvement load is not the only determining factor and suggests that the theoretical construct of involvement load should be constructed with more caution. Alternate abstract: 本文基于投入量假设，对比研究了填空、翻译、造句三种不同的听后输出任务在产出性词形、接受性 词义以及产出性语法功能三个知识侧面对即时词汇习得和词汇保持的作用。90名英语专业的大二学生被 分成三组，分别完成一项听力与听后输出任务。实验结果表明听后输出任务对产出性词汇知识的即时习得 有积极作用，部分上与投入量假设相吻合；然而，词汇知识的延时记忆效果与投入量假设基本不符。因此， 本研究对部分的投入量假设提出质疑，认为投入量并不是决定任务有效性的唯一因素，且投入量的理论建 构应该更加审慎。",

    "Abstract": "Background: Patient safety is in jeopardy due to a rise in the preparation of adulterated parenteral products with poor technique identified as a significant contributing factor. Pharmacy technicians perform an overwhelming majority of aseptic compounding practices; however, this group's progressive loss of aseptic technique knowledge has not been documented. Objective: The purpose of this correlational research study was to investigate the association between sterile compounding knowledge and years in the field controlling for formal training in sterile compounding techniques. Methods: An assessment tool of fundamental sterile compounding content was electronically distributed to sterile compounding technician members of pharmacy organizations in the southeastern United States. A multiple regression was conducted to predict sterile compounding knowledge from number of years in the field and prior years of formal compounding training. Results: Sixty-eight assessments were returned complete. The overall model was significant ( P < .0005), explaining 22% of the variance in knowledge retention. Years in the field was the only significant predictor ( P < .001). Each additional year of work experience was associated with a 0.18 drop in the assessment score. Conclusions: The longer pharmacy technicians remain in the field, the more aseptic technique knowledge they will lose. Modeling of poor sterile compounding techniques in the workplace may promote loss of competency of the skill. As a result, a plan to address continuing education for pharmacy technician sterile compounders is necessary to ensure patient safety.Background: Patient safety is in jeopardy due to a rise in the preparation of adulterated parenteral products with poor technique identified as a significant contributing factor.

    "Abstract": "Objetivo: Avaliar o efeito de intervençöes educativas no conhecimento e aplicabilidade de eletrocirurgia da equipe de enfermagem. Material e Método: Quase-experimento, com pré e pós-testes em um único grupo desenvolvido no centro cirúrgico de um hospital universitário terciário brasileiro. Foi desenvolvido em sete etapas, com aplicaçâo de questionário semi-estruturado para avaliaçâo do conhecimento dos participantes. Os participantes foram expostos a duas intervençöes educativas (aula expositiva, dialogada e vídeo aula) e após cada uma das intervençöes, foram avaliados quanto a retençâo do conhecimento. Também foram avaliados indicadores da aplicaçâo da unidade de eletrocirurgia durante os procedimentos cirúrgicos. Resultados: Participaram do estudo quatro enfermeiros e 28 técnicos de enfermagem. Os enfermeiros apresentaram conhecimento prévio do tema na maioria dos tópicos. Entre os técnicos de enfermagem, observou-se melhora nos itens checagem do equipamento e posicionamento da placa eletrodispersiva. Conclusöes: Os profissionais apresentaram um bom rendimento teórico, porém o mesmo nâo fica evidente na prática pois os profissionais relutam em ter uma prática diferente da teoria. Pesquisas dessa natureza sâo oportunas pois proporcionam aos gestores uma possibilidade de propor projetos de melhoria continua da assistencia perioperatória.

Material y método: Cuasiexperimento, con evaluaciones antes y después en un solo grupo, llevado a cabo en el centro quirúrgico de un hospital universitario terciario brasileño. Se realizó en siete etapas, se aplicó un cuestionario semiestructurado para evaluar los conocimientos de los participantes. Los participantes fueron expuestos a dos intervenciones educativas (clase expositiva, dialogada y video clase) y después de cada intervención se evaluó la retención de conocimientos. También se evaluaron indicadores de la aplicación de la unidad de electrocirugía durante los procedimientos quirúrgicos. Resultados: Participaron del estudio 4 enfermeros y 28 técnicos en enfermería. Los enfermeros tenían conocimientos previos sobre el tema de la mayor parte de los tópicos. Los técnicos en enfermería, mejoraron en los ítems verificación del equipamiento y colocación de la placa. Conclusiones: Los profesionales presentaron un buen desempeño teórico pero el mismo no se refleja en la práctica porque los profesionales son reacios a realizar prácticas que no coincidan con la teoría. La realización de este tipo de investigaciones es conveniente porque les permite a los gestores la posibilidad de proponer proyectos para una mejora continua de la asistencia perioperatoria. Alternate abstract: Objective: To evaluate the effect of educational interventions on the Nursing team's knowledge and applicability of electrosurgery. Material and Method: A quasi-experiment, with pre- and post-tests in a single group developed in the operating room of a Brazilian tertiary-level university hospital. It was developed in seven stages, with the application of a semi-structured questionnaire to assess the participants' knowledge. The participants were exposed to two educational interventions (lecture, dialogue and video-lesson) and, after each intervention, they were evaluated for knowledge retention. Indicators of the application of the electrosurgery unit during surgical procedures were also evaluated. Results: Four nurses and 28 nursing technicians participated in the study. The nurses had prior knowledge of the theme on most of the topics. Among the nursing technicians, there was an improvement in the \"equipment check\" and \"electrodispersive plate positioning\" items. Conclusions: The professionals presented good theoretical performance but the same is not evidenced in the practice because they are reluctant to having a practice different from the theory. Research of this nature is timely because it provides managers with a possibility to propose projects for continuous improvement of perioperative assistance.",

    "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic impacted both healthcare delivery and the education of healthcare students, with a shift to remote delivery of coursework and assessment alongside the expansion of the scope of practice of Alberta pharmacists. The objective of this research was to understand how the learning of pharmacy students at the University of Alberta was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic impacted both healthcare delivery and the education of healthcare students, with a shift to remote delivery of coursework and assessment alongside the expansion of the scope of practice of Alberta pharmacists. The objective of this research was to understand how the learning of pharmacy students at the University of Alberta was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.A cross-sectional survey was distributed to 397 pharmacy students in years one through three. Students responded to three short-answer reflection questions: (1) how has the COVID-19 pandemic situation affected your learning; (2) from a pharmacy and pharmacy school perspective, what have you learned since the COVID-19 pandemic began; and (3) from a personal perspective, what have you learned about yourself since the COVID-19 pandemic began? A thematic analysis was undertaken of students' responses to these reflection questions. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was distributed to 397 pharmacy students in years one through three. Students responded to three short-answer reflection questions: (1) how has the COVID-19 pandemic situation affected your learning; (2) from a pharmacy and pharmacy school perspective, what have you learned since the COVID-19 pandemic began; and (3) from a personal perspective, what have you learned about yourself since the COVID-19 pandemic began? A thematic analysis was undertaken of students' responses to these reflection questions.A total of 53 students responded to the survey (response rate 13%). Two major themes were identified across all three reflection questions, with several subthemes: remote learning (learning environment, knowledge transfer, knowledge retention, assessment) and mental health (appreciation, stress, extroversion, motivation). Adaptability, routine, professional identity, and the role of the pharmacist were also identified as less prevalent themes. RESULTS A total of 53 students responded to the survey (response rate 13%). Two major themes were identified across all three reflection questions, with several subthemes: remote learning (learning environment, knowledge transfer, knowledge retention, assessment) and mental health (appreciation, stress, extroversion, motivation). Adaptability, routine, professional identity, and the role of the pharmacist were also identified as less prevalent themes.Pharmacy students' responses led to the identification of several themes related to their learning given the changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. This increased understanding of student perceptions has the potential to improve the remote delivery of education, support increased university-wide mental health resourcing, and shape pharmacy curriculum development. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacy students' responses led to the identification of several themes related to their learning given the changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. This increased understanding of student perceptions has the potential to improve the remote delivery of education, support increased university-wide mental health resourcing, and shape pharmacy curriculum development.",

    "Abstract": "Providing preparatory information is a pretraining intervention method suitable for high cognitive loads and high-pressure training environments and can significantly improve training effects. In this study, we investigated the impact of the media immersion level and pretraining intervention on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training. We conducted a 2 [immersive embodied virtual reality (IEVR) vs. video] by 2 [pretraining intervention vs. no pretraining intervention] between-subject randomised experiment in Yixin, China. The results demonstrated that regardless of the media immersion level, embodied training combined with body movements is effective in improving self-efficacy, knowledge retention, and skill transfer. Although the subjects’ self-efficacy and CPR knowledge were significantly improved after training, the media level did not significantly improve knowledge retention and self-efficacy. Our study suggested that the media immersion level and pretraining intervention strategy have a significant interaction effect on the level of skill transfer. Moreover, the pretraining intervention promoted skills transfer in IEVR training but did not have a similar effect on video embodied training. These results indicate that incorporating a pretraining intervention by providing preparatory information can enhance the learning outcomes in IEVR training.

This research considered the implementation of three-dimensional (3D) modeling using Play-Doh with learners to consider whether they were able to make effective representations that may then support further learning. The evidence from teacher observations and student feedback suggests that, despite some initial hesitation surrounding the use of what some might perceive as a toy in the higher education classroom, the learners believed that the approach allowed improvement in terms of their understanding, knowledge retention and recall. They reported that the approach enabled greater visualization of the structures they were representing. For teachers, the approach has the advantage that the material is cheap, readily available, easily manipulated, can be reused, and needs no sophisticated technology.Teaching anatomy to veterinary students is challenging, and using two-dimensional (2D) representations may limit the opportunity for learners to make the connections required to fully appreciate the complex structures involved and the relationships between them.

    "Abstract": "A radiology sign that references a resemblance to something which is not actually present within an image has been termed a 'metaphoric' sign. Metaphoric signs are widely described in the literature and commonly used in teaching as a form of pattern recognition, or 'pareidolia'. However, the educational benefit of metaphoric signs has not been previously assessed. We aimed to assess the utility of metaphoric signs in medical student teaching. OBJECTIVE A radiology sign that references a resemblance to something which is not actually present within an image has been termed a 'metaphoric' sign. Metaphoric signs are widely described in the literature and commonly used in teaching as a form of pattern recognition, or 'pareidolia'. However, the educational benefit of metaphoric signs has not been previously assessed. We aimed to assess the utility of metaphoric signs in medical student teaching.Fifteen radiology cases were prepared into two lecture formats for medical student education. A 'test' lecture utilizing metaphoric radiology signs to describe the appearance of the cases and a 'control' lecture where pathology was compared to normal anatomical appearances without reference to metaphoric signs. Forty-nine volunteer medical students were randomized with cluster sampling to receive either the test or control lecture. Four days later, students were quizzed to determine retention of knowledge and to assess interest in the lecture on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifteen radiology cases were prepared into two lecture formats for medical student education. A 'test' lecture utilizing metaphoric radiology signs to describe the appearance of the cases and a 'control' lecture where pathology was compared to normal anatomical appearances without reference to metaphoric signs. Forty-nine volunteer medical students were randomized with cluster sampling to receive either the test or control lecture. Four days later, students were quizzed to determine retention of knowledge and to assess interest in the lecture on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100.The median interest level of the test group (69.5) was higher than the control group (50) (p = 0.001). The mean quiz score was higher in the test group (34.5) than in the control group (29) (Difference 5.5, 95% confidence interval 0.08-10.92, p = 0.047). RESULTS The median interest level of the test group (69.5) was higher than the control group (50) (p = 0.001). The mean quiz score was higher in the test group (34.5) than in the control group (29) (Difference 5.5, 95% confidence interval 0.08-10.92, p = 0.047).The use of metaphoric signs in radiology education of medical students increased interest, descriptive ability and short-term knowledge retention, compared to the same material taught with normal anatomy correlation. Metaphoric signs should be considered as a useful radiology teaching tool. CONCLUSION The use of metaphoric signs in radiology education of medical students increased interest, descriptive ability and short-term knowledge retention, compared to the same material taught with normal anatomy correlation. Metaphoric signs should be considered as a useful radiology teaching tool.",
