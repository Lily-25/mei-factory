    "Abstract": "Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of short-duration self-learning (SSL) and mastery learning (ML) strategies on the acquisition and 6-month retention of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills and basic life support (BLS) knowledge among hospital administrative staff in Thailand. Design Comparative assessment of two CPR training strategies. Setting Tertiary-level academic institution in Thailand. Participants A total of 163 hospital administrative staff aged ≥18 years without prior BLS certification were enrolled and randomly allocated to either the SSL group (n=82) or the ML group (n=81). Participants with previous CPR certification, medical limitations preventing chest compressions or those unwilling to attend the 6-month retention test were excluded. 71 participants in each group completed the 6-month follow-up. Interventions All participants viewed an 8 min self-directed instructional video on BLS and subsequently performed CPR practice using real-time feedback manikins. The SSL group practised independently for up to five 1 min sessions, while the ML group practised until achieving a predefined mastery threshold (QCPR (Quality Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) score >90%). Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was CPR skill retention at 6 months, measured by QCPR overall performance score. Secondary outcomes included observational BLS performance (scene safety, responsiveness, emergency activation, breathing assessment and correct hand placement), knowledge retention scores and the number of attempts required to achieve mastery in the ML group. Results Both SSL and ML groups demonstrated significant improvement in CPR performance and BLS knowledge immediately after training (p<0.001). At 6 months, no statistically significant differences were found between groups in CPR skill retention (mean difference 0.7%, 95% CI −1.9% to 3.3%, p=0.62) or BLS knowledge retention (mean difference 0.2, 95% CI −0.4 to 0.8, p=0.51). Female participants required more attempts to achieve mastery compared with males (mean 3.0 vs 2.1, p=0.007). Conclusions Both SSL and ML effectively enhanced CPR performance and knowledge retention among non-medical hospital staff. SSL offers a practical, resource-efficient and scalable approach for CPR training in large-scale community or institutional settings. Future studies should investigate the cost-effectiveness and optimal refresher frequency for sustaining CPR competency. Trial registration number TCTR20210521003.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The primary purpose of this study is to explore and critically evaluate existing research on the application of gamification in employee training and development. By synthesising current empirical and theoretical evidence, the review seeks to understand how gamification influences learner motivation, engagement, knowledge retention and overall organisational performance. Design/methodology/approach A systematic methodological review was conducted, drawing on 49 empirical studies published between 2014 and 2024, supplemented by 19 foundational works for theoretical grounding. Searches were carried out in Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar using structured keywords. Inclusion criteria required a workplace focus, empirical methodology and relevance to employee training or development. Studies were screened following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines and data were synthesised qualitatively to identify trends, benefits, limitations and gaps. Findings The literature review reveals that gamification has emerged as a significant pedagogical and motivational strategy within employee training and development. Across empirical and theoretical studies, gamification demonstrates considerable potential to enhance learning engagement, motivation, knowledge retention and overall performance outcomes. However, its effectiveness is moderated by factors such as design quality, contextual fit, learner characteristics and organisational culture. Research limitations/implications Despite offering valuable insights into the role of gamification in employee training and development, this literature review is subject to some limitations that must be acknowledged. One of them is the scope and selection bias. The review is limited to studies published primarily in English and indexed in major academic databases such as Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Consequently, relevant works published in other languages or regional journals may have been excluded, potentially introducing a publication and language bias. Practical implications The findings from this literature review have significant practical implications for organisations, learning and development (L&D) professionals, human resource ( HR ) managers and instructional designers seeking to enhance the effectiveness of employee training through gamification. Gamification offers a powerful mechanism for increasing employee engagement and intrinsic motivation during training. By integrating game elements such as points, badges, leaderboards, progress tracking and feedback loops, organisations can create more immersive and interactive learning experiences. These elements trigger psychological drivers such as competition, achievement and recognition – factors known to sustain learner participation and reduce training fatigue. Social implications The integration of gamification into employee training and development has broader social implications that extend beyond individual learning outcomes and organisational performance. These implications influence workplace culture, employee well-being, social interaction and societal perceptions of work and learning. Gamification can promote inclusivity by creating learning environments that encourage participation from diverse employee groups. Through team-based challenges, cooperative missions and social leaderboards, employees are encouraged to collaborate, share knowledge and support peers. This collective learning approach reduces social isolation, enhances trust and fosters a sense of belonging across hierarchical and departmental boundaries. Originality/value This study contributes original value to the growing body of literature on gamification by offering a comprehensive synthesis of current research on its application within employee training and development. While gamification has been widely examined in educational and consumer contexts, its integration into corporate learning and human resource development remains comparatively underexplored and fragmented. This review therefore provides a structured, evidence-based understanding of how gamification influences motivation, engagement, skills acquisition and performance outcomes in organisational settings.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to systematically review extant global literature on knowledge transfer and retention in the context of postgraduate supervision in the higher education institutions (HEIs) sector. Design/methodology/approach To rationally explore knowledge transfer and retention in higher education, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis technique was used as a methodology. Findings The research findings of the study point to limited verified research in the global literature linking knowledge transfer, retention and postgraduate supervision in HEIs. Knowledge management is underdeveloped within the context of postgraduate supervision scholarship, albeit with potential serious knowledge loss risks within the HEIs sector. Moreover, knowledge transfer, retention and postgraduate supervision in HEIs are blurred. Therefore, future interdisciplinary studies are recommended to advance the scholarship of knowledge transfer and retention and postgraduate supervision in HEIs. Research limitations/implications Future research directions should focus on the critical role and capabilities of the supervisor, the student and other atmospherics. Practical implications This study proposes that 21st-century higher education systems depend heavily on the design of organisational knowledge-driven structures, transfer, retention strategies and policies within the context of postgraduate supervision. Originality/value This study presents global insights relating to knowledge transfer and strategies in the context of postgraduate supervision scholarship. Moreover, there is limited knowledge transfer and retention research aligned to ageing postgraduate supervisors and voluntary turnover in HEIs globally. Future interdisciplinary studies are recommended to advance the scholarship of knowledge transfer and retention and postgraduate supervision in HEIs.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine how transformational leadership (TL) fosters organizational knowledge creation (OKC) through the sequential mediation of quality interpersonal relationships (QIRs) and learning organizations (LOs). While TL’s role in knowledge management and innovation is well-documented, its combined impact on relational and structural mechanisms remains underexplored. By integrating insights from social exchange theory and OKC theory, this study seeks to clarify how TL facilitates sustainable knowledge-sharing processes. Understanding these mechanisms can help organizations develop leadership strategies that enhance both informal and structured knowledge-sharing, ensuring robust knowledge retention and competitive advantage in rapidly changing business environments. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a quantitative research approach using survey data from 288 US white-collar employees across various industries. Structural equation modeling (SEM) path analysis was conducted to examine the direct and mediated effects of TL on OKC through QIRs and LOs. The analysis tested a sequential mediation model to assess whether TL enhances interpersonal trust and collaboration (QIRs), which subsequently strengthen structured learning environments (LOs), leading to sustained knowledge. Findings The findings of this study confirm that TL positively influences OKC both directly and indirectly through QIRs and LOs. Specifically, TL enhances trust-based collaboration (QIRs), which fosters structured learning environments (LOs), ensuring that knowledge-sharing behaviors become embedded rather than remaining ad hoc. This sequential relationship highlights the interplay between interpersonal and structural mechanisms in knowledge retention. Originality/value This study extends existing research by demonstrating how TL simultaneously influences interpersonal and structural mechanisms in knowledge creation. Unlike previous studies that examine trust-based or structured learning environments separately, this study highlights their sequential relationship under TL. By integrating social exchange theory and OKC theory, this study provides a novel perspective on how leadership transforms knowledge sharing from informal interactions into structured, institutionalized processes. The findings offer valuable insights for both scholars and practitioners, emphasizing the role of leadership in balancing relational and structural elements to sustain OKC.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study explores the potential impact of enterprise social media (ESM) communication visibility on knowledge sabotage to reduce knowledge sabotage within organizations. Design/methodology/approach We collected data from 389 Chinese employees across three stages and used hierarchical regression analysis and the bootstrap method to test our hypotheses. Findings Communication visibility negatively affects knowledge sabotage, and the loss of knowledge power mediates the relationship between communication visibility and knowledge sabotage. Digital work connectivity strengthens the negative relationship between message transparency and loss of knowledge power but weakens the negative relationship between network translucence and loss of knowledge power. Therefore, digital work connectivity plays a dual role. Practical implications Managers can encourage employees to share their knowledge advantages through ESM and seek cross-disciplinary knowledge cooperation, which helps restrain knowledge sabotage from the source. At the same time, maintaining appropriate digital work connectivity enables employees to leverage their knowledge interaction advantages of ESM, thereby fostering their knowledge competitiveness. Originality/value This study is the first to reveal the internal mechanism (loss of knowledge power) through which ESM communication visibility affects knowledge sabotage and explores the boundary condition (digital work connectivity) impacting the effectiveness of communication visibility. It contributes to a deeper understanding of the inherent nature of knowledge sabotage from an information technology perspective and offers novel technical insights into its management.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Knowledge loss (KL) is still an unfortunate fact, causing many challenges, including poor organisational performance, despite prior efforts to investigate knowledge retention methods. Therefore, this study identifies early approaches to combat KL and poor organisational performance, shifting focus on employee personality traits. Design/methodology/approach Grounded on the social exchange theory (SET) cross-section data from 400 Chinese construction knowledge employees were used to investigate the role of internal work locus of control (IWLC) on job rotation (JR), KL and organisational performance. The data were analysed through IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and SmartPLS 4 software. Findings The results demonstrated that IWLC minimises KL and positively influences JR. Then, JR negatively influences KL and decreases in organisational performance. The negative mediating effect of JR in the relationship between IWLC, KL and decreased organisational performance were also found. Finally, KL proved to positively influence a decrease in organisational performance. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to the new understanding of individual behaviour and its influence on organisational outcome variables. Specifically, for ultimate KL prevention and organisational performance improvement, an organisation should understand its employees' behaviours to establish progressive collective learning and knowledge sharing.

    "Abstract": "Purpose Considering the inherent tensions between the structured, long-cycle approaches of Knowledge Management (KM) and the dynamic, short-term nature of agile environments, the paper’s objective is to propose a Scrum-based extension designed to facilitate the seamless integration of KM practices within agile projects. Design/methodology/approach The research methodology employed a three-stage approach: thematic literature review, framework development, and framework validation. The thematic review encompassed works in the fields of KM, Information System and Agile Project Management literature with a focus on studies proposing KM and Agile frameworks, and systematic literature reviews. A lightweight Scrum-KM was designed to delineate appropriate KM activities, artifacts and structures throughout the Scrum cycles. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 senior project managers from large Brazilian and Canadian companies to endorse the proposal. Findings The results unveiled a lack of a structured KM strategy and short-term perspective, resulting in rework, knowledge loss, and limited knowledge exchange between projects. The proposed Scrum-KM extension reinforces the KM responsibilities of PMO and offers guidelines for structuring project knowledge repositories within scaling agile contexts. Practical implications The Scrum-KM extension guides practitioners in establishing inter-project forums to foster knowledge sharing, leverage project analytics, and nourish project knowledge repositories. Originality/value The Scrum-KM extension considers squad dynamics and the PMO’s role in fostering inter-project knowledge sharing, the importance of Content Management Systems for structuring knowledge bases, the challenge of leveraging Kanban charts for Project Management Analytics, and retrospective meetings as crucial opportunities for capturing lessons learned.",

    "Abstract": "Background: With the adoption of competency-based medical education (CBME) by the National Medical Commission of India in 2019, assessment methods such as objective structured clinical/practical examination (OSCE/OSPE) have gained importance for objectively evaluating clinical and practical competencies. However, the success of such methods largely depends on effective faculty training and subsequent transfer of training (TOT) to the workplace. Aim and Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the immediate and long-term TOT among medical faculty following a structured OSCE/OSPE workshop and subsequent implementation in respective departments. The objectives included to design and conduct the training workshop on OSCE/OSPE and to assess knowledge retention, skill application, and impact on student learning using Kirkpatrick’s four-level evaluation model. Materials and Methods: A prospective, interventional study was conducted over 3 years at a medical college with an annual intake of 150 MBBS students. The first phase involved training 29 faculty members across 16 departments through a 1-day OSCE/OSPE workshop. The second phase involved implementation in respective departments. Data were collected from trained faculty, peer faculty and students using reflective writing, self-efficacy questionnaires, Likert-scale feedback, and open-ended responses. Quantitative data were analyzed in terms of medians, percentages and satisfaction indices and represented in graphs, whereas qualitative data were transcribed and thematic analysis was conducted. Results: A total of 29 trained faculty, 53 peer faculty, and 410 students participated in the study. Following the OSCE/OSPE workshop, 94% of departments implemented it in their workplace. Faculty showed significant improvement in knowledge, confidence, and self-efficacy, with satisfaction indices ranging from 80% to 90%. Peer faculty validated the effective application and teamwork of trained faculty. Students found OSCE/OSPE more structured, equitable, and less stressful, with improved confidence and skill retention. The study demonstrated successful TOT at all levels of Kirkpatrick’s model, with sustained implementation across 3 years and regular practice thereafter, indicating strong institutional integration and impact. Conclusions: OSCE/OSPE-based assessment was perceived positively by faculty, peers, and students, reinforcing its value in CBME. Continuous follow-up and institutional commitment are essential for long-term success. The study provides strong evidence that well-structured faculty training, followed by support and evaluation, facilitates effective and sustainable TOT.",

    "Abstract": "Background The National Health Service Long-Term Workforce Plan calls for improving clinical pathways for surgery. Four wrist and hand surgeries, including carpal tunnel syndrome release, Dupuytren’s contracture release, ganglion excision and trigger finger release, are described as procedures of limited clinical value and are included in the 2018 Evidence-based Interventions programme, as well as local guidance in Greater Manchester (GM). Local problem A pre-scoping exercise audit at a single musculoskeletal service in GM conducted from May 2021 to June 2023 highlighted that clinician compliance rates for these referrals were 15% below the service provider’s internal national average and 25% below the service provider’s internal national target, demonstrating the need for a quality improvement project. Methods The Model for Improvement was implemented using four Plan–Do–Study–Act (PDSA) cycles. These cycles were executed over 14 weeks and aimed to improve compliance through educational sessions, clinical resources, interactive learning and practical tools. Intervention The project comprised four PDSA cycles: PDSA 1 introduced educational sessions and case discussions, PDSA 2 implemented a clinical flowchart to guide decision-making, PDSA 3 included a knowledge retention quiz and PDSA 4 involved a repeat quiz and further discussions to consolidate learning. The target was to increase compliance rates from 70% to 85% or more. Results The project successfully improved compliance rates by 30%, with the final compliance rate reaching 100%, surpassing the service provider’s internal national average and target, respectively. 100% compliance was achieved and sustained during PDSA 4 until the end of the project. Clinician confidence and quiz scores also increased during the intervention. Conclusions Educational initiatives, combined with practical tools like clinical flowcharts and quizzes, significantly improved compliance rates.

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine how transformational leadership (TL) fosters organizational knowledge creation (OKC) through the sequential mediation of quality interpersonal relationships (QIRs) and learning organizations (LOs). While TL’s role in knowledge management and innovation is well-documented, its combined impact on relational and structural mechanisms remains underexplored. By integrating insights from social exchange theory and OKC theory, this study seeks to clarify how TL facilitates sustainable knowledge-sharing processes. Understanding these mechanisms can help organizations develop leadership strategies that enhance both informal and structured knowledge-sharing, ensuring robust knowledge retention and competitive advantage in rapidly changing business environments. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a quantitative research approach using survey data from 288 US white-collar employees across various industries. Structural equation modeling (SEM) path analysis was conducted to examine the direct and mediated effects of TL on OKC through QIRs and LOs. The analysis tested a sequential mediation model to assess whether TL enhances interpersonal trust and collaboration (QIRs), which subsequently strengthen structured learning environments (LOs), leading to sustained knowledge. Findings The findings of this study confirm that TL positively influences OKC both directly and indirectly through QIRs and LOs. Specifically, TL enhances trust-based collaboration (QIRs), which fosters structured learning environments (LOs), ensuring that knowledge-sharing behaviors become embedded rather than remaining ad hoc. This sequential relationship highlights the interplay between interpersonal and structural mechanisms in knowledge retention. Originality/value This study extends existing research by demonstrating how TL simultaneously influences interpersonal and structural mechanisms in knowledge creation. Unlike previous studies that examine trust-based or structured learning environments separately, this study highlights their sequential relationship under TL. By integrating social exchange theory and OKC theory, this study provides a novel perspective on how leadership transforms knowledge sharing from informal interactions into structured, institutionalized processes. The findings offer valuable insights for both scholars and practitioners, emphasizing the role of leadership in balancing relational and structural elements to sustain OKC.",

    "Abstract": "This research explains Sustainable Development (SD) and explores the significance of sustainability education in the 21 century. The research points out the potential of gamification as a tool to enhance sustainable education. By integrating game elements into learning experiences, gamification can increase student engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention. The research goes deep into the benefits of gamification in promoting sustainable behaviours, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and collaboration. However, it also acknowledges the challenges associated with implementing gamification, such as technical infrastructure, pedagogical alignment, and the complexity of sustainability issues and suggests some simple feasible remedial measures that can be implemented. By addressing these challenges and utilizing the opportunities offered by gamification, educators can create innovative and effective learning experiences that foster a sustainable future.",

    "Abstract": "This paper examines the author's progression in comprehending and formulating an educational philosophy throughout his MScN journey. The author explores fundamental educational concepts, encompassing instructional and learning tactics, assessment and evaluation techniques, curriculum design, and problem-based learning. The examination of philosophy in education is emphasized as a cornerstone for critical thinking, ethical decision-making, and enhanced teaching methodologies. A primary concept is student-centered learning, which prioritizes active student engagement and autonomy in the learning process and positions educators as facilitators rather than simple distributors of knowledge. This paper addresses the importance of assessment methodologies, micro-teaching, and the development of e-portfolios as vital elements of contemporary education. Moreover, it emphasizes the significance of diversity, cooperation, and continuous learning in developing effective educational experiences. The author asserts that a student-centered approach improves motivation, knowledge retention, and professional readiness, consistent with pedagogical research in nursing education. The author intends to include these concepts into their teaching methodology to promote significant learning experiences.",

    "Abstract": "The risk entailed is not up for debate: cyber conflict has already produced significant loss of knowledge, wealth, and even human life (Miller, 2022; Center for Strategic & International Studies, n.d.). [...]we offer a few critical considerations for policymakers as the cyber era continues to unfold to assist them in making cyber policy that is more intentionally ethical while retaining competitive advantage. [...]the Western legal tradition places state conflict and private conflict on the same spectrum, seeking to regulate both through legal systems built by consensus and accumulated historical tradition and interpretation, and grounded in moral and ethical reasoning. [...]identifying where and how cyber conflict may depart from existing tradition and reasoning is an essential step to incorporating ethical cyber action into the larger societal framework of conflict management. While they are by no means exhaustive, we feel these categories cover the majority of reasoning underlying statecraft: * Teleological egoism, or realism, in which agents make decisions to optimize their own utility, however, they may define and measure it. * Teleological utilitarianism, in which agents decide to optimize a global notion of utility, however, they may define and measure it. * Kantianism, used here to represent Kant's assertion of persons as inherent ends and his prohibition against using any person as merely a means to an end, thereby prioritizing human dignity over all other concerns. * Virtue, in which agents make decisions based on attributes they purport, or aspire, to embody. * Contractarianism, in which agents make decisions in accordance with a set of rules that are, or would theoretically be, agreed upon by all, or a significant portion of, the agents governed by those rules. 2.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG Unlike aboveground utility systems, for which very detailed and accurate information exists, there is generally a dearth of good-quality data about underground utility infrastructures that provide vital services. To identify key strategies to improve the resilience of these underground systems, this paper presents mechanisms for successful engagement and collaboration among stakeholders and shared cross-sector system vulnerability concerns (including data availability) based on the innovative use of focus groups. Outputs from two virtual focus groups were used to obtain information from New York City area utilities and other stakeholders affected by underground infrastructure. There was strong agreement among participants that (1) a trusted agency in New York City government should manage a detailed map of underground infrastructure that would allow stakeholders to securely access appropriate information about underground systems on a need-to-know basis; (2) environmental risk factors, such as infrastructure age and condition, as well as location should be included; and (3) improved mechanisms for collaboration and sharing information are needed, especially during non-emergency situations. Stakeholders also highlighted the need for a regularly updated central database of relevant contacts at key organizations, since institutions often have a high employee turnover rate, which creates knowledge loss. The focus group script developed as part of this research was designed to be transferable to other cities to assess data needs and potential obstacles to stakeholder collaboration in the areas of underground infrastructure mapping and modeling.",

    "Abstract": "ENG English ENG The modernization of agriculture in Northern countries has led to a loss of crop diversity, as well as a loss of knowledge, know-how and rights of farmers regarding on-farm seed breeding. In France, the Réseau Semences Paysannes (RSP) brings together collectives of actors (farmers, bakers, citizens, gardeners) mobilized in a quest to reclaim these aspects. Within the framework of the decentralized participatory breeding program conducted in collaboration with INRAE, farmers have co-constructed knowledge in terms of dynamic management of heterogeneous wheat populations. Yet, as the RSP network grows, these actors face new types of challenges regarding collective action. To address them, we proposed to consider peasant seeds as « common unknowns » rather than « common goods » and we adapted and applied an innovative design approach drawing upon the KCP (Knowledge-Concept-Proposals) method. This approach consisted in implementing, from 2019 to 2021, five decentralized design workshops with local seed breeding collectives. The replication of design workshops in different contexts provided a framework for interaction among RSP members, allowed the sharing of both scientific and experiential knowledge. Noteworthily, it fostered the generation of many proposals for enhancing collective action, and led to the development of operational proposals with a view to implement them in the future. This methodology-oriented paper mainly describes the decentralized design approach implemented, its outputs and outcomes, as well as its interests and limits in the context of crop diversity management. It also analyses how the workshop outputs enriches previous works in the field; in particular how such a participatory design approach leads to produce original operational solutions to respond to challenges identified in the literature.",

    "Abstract": "Science education is fundamental in fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and scientific inquiry among students. Traditional teacher-centered approaches often fail to engage students actively, leading to passive learning and limited conceptual understanding. To address this challenge, constructivist-based models like the 7E instructional model have gained attention for enhancing student engagement, knowledge retention, and higher-order thinking skills. This study examines the effectiveness of the 7E instructional model on the academic achievement of upper primary students in science education. Using a quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test design, this study involved 120 upper primary school students in Jaipur, divided into an experimental group (7E model) and a control group (traditional method). The results revealed a statistically significant improvement in the academic performance of students taught using the 7E model (mean post-test score = 41.83) compared to the traditional method (mean post-test score =29.57). The t-ratio of 11.47 confirmed that the 7E instructional model led to greater learning gains and conceptual understanding. These findings align with previous research supporting inquiry-based learning as a means to improve student engagement, motivation, and critical thinking. Additionally, technology-enhanced approaches further amplify the benefits of the 7E learning cycle. The study recommends integrating the 7E model into science curricula, emphasizing teacher training programs, digital learning integration, and gender-inclusive strategies to enhance STEM education outcomes. Future research should explore long-term retention effects and technology-driven adaptations of the model.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Extended reality, an umbrella term for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, is increasingly used in health care education as it requires fewer human and logistical resources and offers reduced costs compared with high-fidelity simulations. Nevertheless, the impact of extended reality on education and training in anesthesiology is largely unknown. We aimed to explore the existing extended reality tools and applications in anesthesiology, identify current knowledge gaps, and highlight future research needs in anesthesiology education. Methods We conducted a scoping review of studies published from January 2010 to December 2023 that focused on extended reality training in anesthesiology and included comparative analyses with other methods. We excluded publications investigating topics unrelated to anesthesiology or not involving interaction with extended reality. Results After screening 5,419 studies, we included 62 manuscripts in the final analysis. The definitions and uses of extended reality in anesthesiology education were very heterogeneous. Thirty-seven studies compared extended reality with other forms of training. Neuraxial procedures, peripheral blocks, central venous catheters, and bronchoscopy were primarily investigated. Extended reality improved technical skills, knowledge retention, confidence, and student satisfaction. Six studies reported at least one negative result related to learning, sense of realism, and usefulness. Conclusion The results of this scoping review highlight the increasing interest of extended reality in anesthesiology education. Nevertheless, many studies lack objective outcome measures and relevant comparisons with existing standards. In addition, extended reality needs to be consistently defined in anesthesiology education to derive optimal benefit and impact. Future studies should also focus on defining extended reality's learning objectives and clinical assessments of trainees’ performance, which are commonly missing compared with high-fidelity simulation teaching. Study registration Open Science Framework ( https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/PDT2F ); first submitted 28 June 2023. Alternate abstract: Résumé Objectif La réalité étendue, terme générique désignant réalité virtuelle, augmentée et mixte, est de plus en plus utilisée dans l’enseignement de la santé car elle nécessite moins de ressources humaines et logistiques et réduit les coûts par rapport aux simulations haute fidélité. Néanmoins, l’impact de la réalité étendue sur l’éducation et la formation en anesthésiologie est largement méconnue. Notre objectif était d’explorer les applications et outils existants en réalité étendue en anesthésiologie, d’identifier les lacunes actuelles en matière de connaissances et de mettre en évidence les besoins futurs en matière de recherche dans l’enseignement de l’anesthésiologie. Méthode Nous avons réalisé une étude de portée des études publiées de janvier 2010 à décembre 2023 qui focalisaient sur la formation en réalité étendue en anesthésiologie et incluaient des analyses comparatives avec d’autres méthodes. Nous avons exclu les publications portant sur des sujets sans rapport avec l’anesthésiologie ou n’impliquant pas d’interaction avec la réalité étendue. Résultats Après avoir examiné 5419 études, nous avons inclus 62 manuscrits dans l’analyse finale. Les définitions et les utilisations de la réalité étendue dans l’enseignement de l’anesthésiologie étaient très hétérogènes. Trente-sept études ont comparé la réalité étendue à d’autres types de formation. Les interventions neuraxiales, les blocs périphériques, les cathéters veineux centraux et la bronchoscopie étaient les principaux sujets à l’étude. La réalité étendue a amélioré les compétences techniques, la rétention des connaissances, la confiance et la satisfaction des étudiants et étudiantes. Six études ont rapporté au moins un résultat négatif lié à l’apprentissage, au sens du réalisme et à l’utilité. Conclusion Les résultats de cette étude de portée mettent en évidence l’intérêt croissant pour la réalité étendue dans l’enseignement de l’anesthésiologie. Néanmoins, de nombreuses études manquent de mesures objectives des résultats et de comparaisons pertinentes avec les normes existantes. De plus, la réalité étendue doit être définie de manière cohérente dans l’enseignement de l’anesthésiologie afin d’en tirer des bénéfices et des impacts optimaux. Les études futures devraient également se concentrer sur la définition des objectifs d’apprentissage de la réalité étendue et les évaluations cliniques des performances des étudiantes et étudiants, qui sont souvent absentes par rapport à l’enseignement par simulation haute-fidélité.

    "Abstract": "Problem-based learning (PBL) is an interactive learning model well accepted in undergraduate medical education. Utilization of PBL in most postgraduate continuing medical education (CME) programs has been limited. The traditional didactic lecture (TDL) model alone in CME programs, although much more commonly used, may fail to assess self-efficacy, educational needs, and appropriate use of shared decision-making (SDM). These aspects of practice are essential, and assessment of these skills is necessary to ensure effective change in physician behavior to improve patient outcomes. PBL case discussions during CME breakout groups foster a participant-centered interactive environment that strengthens critical thinking, team collaboration, and clinical reasoning. Through engagement with clinically relevant cases, PBL allows for tailored educational interventions. Integrating or blending PBL with TDL engages the learners in a real-world case discussion first, followed by succinct post-PBL lectures, which are uniquely “in context” to the actual case discussion. The post-PBL lectures are designed to address knowledge gaps that may have been uncovered during the PBL case discussions and reinforce practice guidelines to correct identified misinformation by learners. The PBL approach not only improves knowledge retention but also leads to better adherence to clinical guidelines by producing significant changes in physician behavior, leading to higher-value patient care. Furthermore, PBL promotes effective and appropriate SDM. Still, there are challenges to PBL implementation in postgraduate CME, including logistical constraints and facilitator training requirements. Thus far, integration of PBL is variable across fields of medicine. Further research is needed to optimize PBL application in postgraduate training. This review advocates for a shift from passive learning systems by TDLs alone to interactive educational models, e.g., blended PBL, which synergizes the two adult learning theories.",

    "Abstract": "The \"Fundamentals of Nursing\" course is crucial for equipping novice undergraduate nursing students with essential skills for their professional practice. However, a gap exists between nursing education and clinical readiness-a challenge exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and issues like absenteeism in clinical sessions. The flipped classroom has been proposed as an innovative strategy to bridge this gap, offering students opportunities for self-paced learning before class and enabling more active, hands-on practice during lab sessions. BACKGROUND The \"Fundamentals of Nursing\" course is crucial for equipping novice undergraduate nursing students with essential skills for their professional practice. However, a gap exists between nursing education and clinical readiness-a challenge exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and issues like absenteeism in clinical sessions. The flipped classroom has been proposed as an innovative strategy to bridge this gap, offering students opportunities for self-paced learning before class and enabling more active, hands-on practice during lab sessions.This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the flipped classroom approach on undergraduate nursing students' knowledge retention, skill performance, self-directed learning, collaborative learning, work engagement, learning ability, and satisfaction in a Fundamentals of Nursing clinical course. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the flipped classroom approach on undergraduate nursing students' knowledge retention, skill performance, self-directed learning, collaborative learning, work engagement, learning ability, and satisfaction in a Fundamentals of Nursing clinical course.A non-equivalent quasi-experimental design was used to compare the flipped classroom method against traditional demonstration-based instruction within a clinical skills lab setting. DESIGN A non-equivalent quasi-experimental design was used to compare the flipped classroom method against traditional demonstration-based instruction within a clinical skills lab setting.The study included 100 nursing students enrolled in the \"Fundamentals of Nursing\" theory and lab courses at Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman, during the fall and spring semesters of 2022. PARTICIPANTS The study included 100 nursing students enrolled in the \"Fundamentals of Nursing\" theory and lab courses at Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman, during the fall and spring semesters of 2022.The experimental group engaged with pre-recorded video lectures, infographics, and other educational materials before class, while the control group received conventional demonstration-based instruction. Data were collected through pre-quiz and post-quiz scores, skill evaluation checklists, and surveys assessing various learning outcomes. METHODS The experimental group engaged with pre-recorded video lectures, infographics, and other educational materials before class, while the control group received conventional demonstration-based instruction. Data were collected through pre-quiz and post-quiz scores, skill evaluation checklists, and surveys assessing various learning outcomes.Although students in the flipped classroom group showed significantly higher pre-quiz scores, indicating better initial understanding, there was no significant difference in post-quiz scores, skill evaluation, or other measured learning outcomes compared to the control group. Unexpectedly, the flipped classroom approach had a detrimental effect on self-reported learning ability and satisfaction. Specifically, the mean scores for learning ability were 35.57 (SD = 5.30) in the flipped classroom group versus 37.89 (SD = 5.26) in the control group, with t = 2.186, p = 0.031 (95 % CI 0.21 to 4.42). Satisfaction scores in the flipped classroom were 44.35 (SD = 11.07) compared to 48.43 (SD = 7.53) in the control group, t = 2.119, p = 0.037 (95 % CI 0.26 to 7.91).

While it offers benefits in terms of adaptability to remote scenarios, its impact on self-directed learning and student satisfaction requires careful consideration and further investigation. Future research should explore its application across multiple skills and longer durations to fully ascertain its effectiveness.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to address the challenges faced by the cheese industry, particularly concerning the preservation and transfer of traditional cheesemaking knowledge. It emphasises the need for innovative solutions in sustainably managing knowledge and skills amidst changing demographic and technological landscapes. Design/methodology/approach Our approach consists of developing and implementing a digital tool, the cheese eK-Book, which is designed to capture, structure and disseminate cheesemaking knowledge. This tool is based on a semantic network and is accessible via smartphones and tablets and aims to facilitate continuous learning, knowledge transfer and collaboration across diverse stakeholders in the cheese production sector. Findings The study highlights several critical findings. Traditional cheesemaking knowledge is currently at risk due to a number of factors, including the ageing of skilled workers, a lack of succession planning and pressures from globalisation and industrialisation. The European dairy sector is evolving towards more specialised and automated production, requiring a skilled workforce capable of adapting to these changes. There is a significant gap between traditional cheese makers and research institutions, hindering the adoption of new technologies and best practices. The cheese eK-Book offers a promising solution to these challenges by preserving knowledge, supporting continuous learning and enhancing collaboration between industry stakeholders and educational/research institutions. The tool facilitates access to scientific knowledge, promotes work–life balance by offering a range of flexible learning opportunities and supports tailored training programmes based on individual users’ needs. Originality/value This article contributes original insights by proposing a comprehensive digital solution tailored to the specific, current needs of the cheese industry. By integrating modern technology with traditional knowledge, the cheese eK-Book not only preserves expertise but also fosters innovation and sustainability within the sector. It bridges the gap between practical cheesemaking skills and contemporary scientific understanding, addressing critical challenges such as knowledge retention, succession planning and workforce development in a rapidly evolving industry landscape. The strength of the Cheese eK-Book lies in its capacity to communicate knowledge, traditions and teachings across generations. This transfer of knowledge and skills plays a crucial role in preserving heritage and fostering connections across different generations within a community.",

Nevertheless, the impact of extended reality on education and training in anesthesiology is largely unknown. We aimed to explore the existing extended reality tools and applications in anesthesiology, identify current knowledge gaps, and highlight future research needs in anesthesiology education.We conducted a scoping review of studies published from January 2010 to December 2023 that focused on extended reality training in anesthesiology and included comparative analyses with other methods. We excluded publications investigating topics unrelated to anesthesiology or not involving interaction with extended reality. METHODS We conducted a scoping review of studies published from January 2010 to December 2023 that focused on extended reality training in anesthesiology and included comparative analyses with other methods. We excluded publications investigating topics unrelated to anesthesiology or not involving interaction with extended reality.After screening 5,419 studies, we included 62 manuscripts in the final analysis. The definitions and uses of extended reality in anesthesiology education were very heterogeneous. Thirty-seven studies compared extended reality with other forms of training. Neuraxial procedures, peripheral blocks, central venous catheters, and bronchoscopy were primarily investigated. Extended reality improved technical skills, knowledge retention, confidence, and student satisfaction. Six studies reported at least one negative result related to learning, sense of realism, and usefulness. RESULTS After screening 5,419 studies, we included 62 manuscripts in the final analysis.

    "Abstract": "The modernization of agriculture in Northern countries has led to a loss of crop diversity, as well as a loss of knowledge, know-how and rights of farmers regarding on-farm seed breeding. In France, the Réseau Semences Paysannes (RSP) brings together collectives of actors (farmers, bakers, citizens, gardeners) mobilized in a quest to reclaim these aspects. Within the framework of the decentralized participatory breeding program conducted in collaboration with INRAE, farmers have co-constructed knowledge in terms of dynamic management of heterogeneous wheat populations. Yet, as the RSP network grows, these actors face new types of challenges regarding collective action. To address them, we proposed to consider peasant seeds as « common unknowns » rather than « common goods » and we adapted and applied an innovative design approach drawing upon the KCP (Knowledge-Concept-Proposals) method. This approach consisted in implementing, from 2019 to 2021, five decentralized design workshops with local seed breeding collectives. The replication of design workshops in different contexts provided a framework for interaction among RSP members, allowed the sharing of both scientific and experiential knowledge. Noteworthily, it fostered the generation of many proposals for enhancing collective action, and led to the development of operational proposals with a view to implement them in the future. This methodology-oriented paper mainly describes the decentralized design approach implemented, its outputs and outcomes, as well as its interests and limits in the context of crop diversity management. It also analyses how the workshop outputs enriches previous works in the field; in particular how such a participatory design approach leads to produce original operational solutions to respond to challenges identified in the literature.",

    "Abstract": "The training of nursing professionals has grown increasingly complex due to technological and scientific advancements, demanding higher educational quality and fostering critical thinking. The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has emphasized active teaching/learning methods (ATLMs), which promote critical thinking, decision-making, group work, motivation, and knowledge retention. ATLMs require teachers to adopt a guiding role and adapt their methodologies. While tools like OPPUMAUGR assess ATLM use in education, validated instruments specific to nursing educators remain unavailable, despite studies highlighting ATLMs’ positive impact on nursing students. This study developed and validated the OPPUMA-NV scale for measuring nursing degree lecturers’ perceptions of the use of active teaching/learning methods nursing degree at the University of Granada. The scale, completed by 381 participants (70.6% women, the largest group aged ‘Between 41 and 50 y. o.’), measures six factors: The institution promotes change (14 items), Range of ATLMs (19 items), Traditional methodology (8 items), Student-centred teaching (4 items), Barriers to implementing ATLMs (9 items) and ATLMs implementation facilitators (5 items). It demonstrated high reliability (α=0.859). Descriptive analysis showed that gender (being a man or a woman) had impact on factor 2 ‘Range of ATLMs’. Within professional categories, had impact factors 3 (‘Traditional methodology’) and 5 (‘Barriers to implementing ATLMs’).

    "Abstract": "Problem-based learning (PBL) is an interactive learning model well accepted in undergraduate medical education. Utilization of PBL in most postgraduate continuing medical education (CME) programs has been limited. The traditional didactic lecture (TDL) model alone in CME programs, although much more commonly used, may fail to assess self-efficacy, educational needs, and appropriate use of shared decision-making (SDM). These aspects of practice are essential, and assessment of these skills is necessary to ensure effective change in physician behavior to improve patient outcomes. PBL case discussions during CME breakout groups foster a participant-centered interactive environment that strengthens critical thinking, team collaboration, and clinical reasoning. Through engagement with clinically relevant cases, PBL allows for tailored educational interventions. Integrating or blending PBL with TDL engages the learners in a real-world case discussion first, followed by succinct post-PBL lectures, which are uniquely \"in context\" to the actual case discussion. The post-PBL lectures are designed to address knowledge gaps that may have been uncovered during the PBL case discussions and reinforce practice guidelines to correct identified misinformation by learners. The PBL approach not only improves knowledge retention but also leads to better adherence to clinical guidelines by producing significant changes in physician behavior, leading to higher-value patient care. Furthermore, PBL promotes effective and appropriate SDM. Still, there are challenges to PBL implementation in postgraduate CME, including logistical constraints and facilitator training requirements. Thus far, integration of PBL is variable across fields of medicine. Further research is needed to optimize PBL application in postgraduate training. This review advocates for a shift from passive learning systems by TDLs alone to interactive educational models, e.g., blended PBL, which synergizes the two adult learning theories.Problem-based learning (PBL) is an interactive learning model well accepted in undergraduate medical education.

    "Abstract": "Unlike aboveground utility systems, for which very detailed and accurate information exists, there is generally a dearth of good-quality data about underground utility infrastructures that provide vital services. To identify key strategies to improve the resilience of these underground systems, this paper presents mechanisms for successful engagement and collaboration among stakeholders and shared cross-sector system vulnerability concerns (including data availability) based on the innovative use of focus groups. Outputs from two virtual focus groups were used to obtain information from New York City area utilities and other stakeholders affected by underground infrastructure. There was strong agreement among participants that (1) a trusted agency in New York City government should manage a detailed map of underground infrastructure that would allow stakeholders to securely access appropriate information about underground systems on a need-to-know basis; (2) environmental risk factors, such as infrastructure age and condition, as well as location should be included; and (3) improved mechanisms for collaboration and sharing information are needed, especially during non-emergency situations. Stakeholders also highlighted the need for a regularly updated central database of relevant contacts at key organizations, since institutions often have a high employee turnover rate, which creates knowledge loss. The focus group script developed as part of this research was designed to be transferable to other cities to assess data needs and potential obstacles to stakeholder collaboration in the areas of underground infrastructure mapping and modeling.",

    "Abstract": "Background Didactic Lecture (DL) is a teaching method that has been there for a long time in our educational system, but student involvement is minimal. Problem-based Learning (PBL) differs in that it involves students in the learning process. Various skills are learned, such as self-learning, group discussion, communication skills, teamwork and knowledge retention. Critical thinking, analysis and the ability to solve real problems are some benefits of PBL, which can help medical students understand clinical scenarios and analyse, interpret and come up with possible solutions based on sound knowledge. Thus, there is a need to assess the effectiveness of PBL in recall, interpretation and problem-solving skills as compared to the traditional lecture method, as there are very few Indian studies related to PBL in Indian medical students. Materials and Methods A non-randomised interventional study was carried out in the Department of Pharmacology at East Point Medical College, Bengaluru. Groups A and B, each with 60 medical students, participated in PBL and DL for either of the two competencies (myocardial infarction and iron deficiency anaemia). After the completion of the DL and PBL sessions, 20 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) were given to the students. The effectiveness of the teaching method was determined by comparing the mean scores of MCQs of both groups. Results The group scores were compared using an independent sample t -test and expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The total mean score of PBL for the topic myocardial infarction (11.00 ± 2.64, p value = .001) was statistically significant compared with the total mean score in the DL group (9.38 ± 2.52), and the total mean score of PBL for the topic iron deficiency anaemia (15.28 ± 3.53, p value = .001) was significant compared to the total mean score in the DL group (12.98 ± 3.61), respectively. The mean score for recall and problem-solving for the topic of myocardial infarction was statistically significant in the PBL group compared to the DL group. The mean score for recall, interpretation and problem-solving for the topic of iron deficiency anaemia was statistically significant in the PBL group compared with the DL group. Conclusion PBL showed marked improvement in recall, interpretation and problem-solving abilities compared with DL. So, including PBL as a teaching–learning method can promote active and student-centered learning.",

Article screening was performed independently by 2 reviewers. Studies assessing pharmacy students' knowledge of HIV prophylaxis were included. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Virtual Health Library, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Embase. Article screening was performed independently by 2 reviewers. Studies assessing pharmacy students' knowledge of HIV prophylaxis were included.Eight studies involving 1,797 students, mostly from the U.S., were identified. All had a cross-sectional design, with only one assessing knowledge retention. Six assessment tools focused on PrEP, one on PEP, and one on both. While confidence in PrEP was evident, significant gaps were found in PEP awareness, prophylaxis access, and prescribing guidelines. FINDINGS Eight studies involving 1,797 students, mostly from the U.S., were identified. All had a cross-sectional design, with only one assessing knowledge retention. Six assessment tools focused on PrEP, one on PEP, and one on both. While confidence in PrEP was evident, significant gaps were found in PEP awareness, prophylaxis access, and prescribing guidelines.There is a notable shortage of assessment tools for PEP. Further research is needed to develop validated instruments for measuring knowledge and addressing educational gaps. Longitudinal studies with pre- and post-tests are crucial to evaluate educational interventions and enhance pharmacy students' preparedness for HIV prophylaxis.

    "Abstract": "Immersive learning is predominantly constrained to technology-based interventions but has the potential for more diverse applications. This study reports on an experiment investigating the learning affordances of psychological immersion evoked by narrative absorption. A total of 228 participants were randomly assigned to one of three forms of media, an image, a word list, and a narrative, all of which contained identical items to be memorized for immediate and delayed free recall memory tests. Other variables measured were immersion, extraneous cognitive load, and mental imagery. ANOVA and correlation analyses showed that the narrative media was found to be significantly more immersive and that it evoked mental imagery in individuals at higher levels than both the list and image media. Importantly, there was more decay in memory recall between immediate and delayed tests for those exposed to the list and the image than for those who read the narrative. This implies the utility of immersive narratives for spontaneous mental image generation, which leads to improved knowledge retention. Other implications for immersive learning theory are discussed, and practical solutions for incorporating narrative immersion in learning are also suggested.",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to compare the impact of examination feedback with access to historical examination questions on information retention. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to compare the impact of examination feedback with access to historical examination questions on information retention.First-year student pharmacists completed a baseline knowledge assessment comprising 30 examination questions divided into 3 conditions, with 10 questions each. In the CHEAT condition, students were provided with 10 questions and their correct answers ahead of time. These 10 questions appeared in the baseline assessment. In the FEEDBACK condition, students answered 10 previously unseen questions but received feedback at the end of the baseline assessment, including correct answers and explanations. The CONTROL condition included 10 previously unseen questions, and no information on correctness or feedback was provided. A total of 3 days after the baseline assessment, the students took a surprise retention quiz with 30 similar questions, including all 3 conditions. The primary outcome measure was student performance on a retention quiz.

    "Abstract": "High-stakes multiple-choice question (MCQ) exams in medical education typically focus on assessment of learning at a single point without providing feedback for improvement. Educators can achieve a more balanced approach to MCQ exams by combining efficient assessment of learning with the feedback and improvement opportunities of assessment for learning. PROBLEM High-stakes multiple-choice question (MCQ) exams in medical education typically focus on assessment of learning at a single point without providing feedback for improvement. Educators can achieve a more balanced approach to MCQ exams by combining efficient assessment of learning with the feedback and improvement opportunities of assessment for learning.As part of a curriculum renewal at Baylor College of Medicine's MD program, the Two-Phase Individual Assessment (TPIA) model was launched within a 4-week preclinical Foundations of Medicine course in August 2023. The TPIA model featured weekly assessments, each consisting of 2 MCQ exams given on the same day with a 4-hour study period in between. Exams were paired, consisting of an equal number of items that addressed the same learning objectives. After the initial exam, students received an individualized feedback report indicating correctly and incorrectly answered objectives. Students applied individualized feedback reports to self-identify and remediate deficiencies in preparation for the second-chance exam. Only the highest score counted toward the final grade.

Mean change in performance in week 4 was not significant. Student end-of-course survey responses indicated a strong preference for the TPIA format. Responses highlighted the value of offering individualized feedback, unstructured time to address knowledge gaps, and a corresponding opportunity for improvement.

    "Abstract": "While quantitative measures regarding the progress of students with intellectual developmental disorders are important, it is also desirable to understand teachers’ perspectives on the value of these tools, as they are the ones who will design educational activities using them. This research explores the perspectives of special education teachers on the benefits of using technology for students with moderate intellectual and developmental disabilities. Nineteen special education teachers participated in semi-structured interviews, and a thematic analysis was conducted based on the transcripts. The findings indicate that, according to the teachers, technologies are valuable tools for students with moderate intellectual and developmental disabilities offering numerous advantages beyond traditional teaching methods. They are both motivating and engaging for students, as it makes learning more enjoyable and less stressful, particularly when it comes to handling mistakes. By adapting to students’ abilities and offering immediate feedback, it helps develop key skills such as reading, writing, and planning. The study highlights that, according to teacher technologies are essential tools in special education for students with moderate intellectual and developmental disabilities, offering innovative, engaging, and supportive learning experiences that foster motivation, improve skill development, and enhance knowledge retention while addressing the individual needs of each student.

    "Abstract": "Medical education has undergone a significant reform in response to evolving health care demands, technological advancements, and emerging research in biomedical and education sciences. The teaching methods in anatomy, a core component of medical education, have notably changed, with traditional cadaveric dissection being increasingly replaced by digital and hybrid alternatives. Despite research indicating no significant difference in short-term knowledge retention between students who engaged in cadaveric dissection and those engaging in alternative methods, dissection uniquely fosters professionalism, empathy, and ethical awareness - traits essential for holistic medical education. This review critically examines the dichotomy between traditional and innovative teaching methods in anatomy education, questioning the assumption that traditional methods hinder progress in modern health care. The findings suggest that changes in medical education are primarily influenced by organizational issues, which frequently results in an incomplete implementation of innovative teaching approaches. The inconsistent application of innovative teaching methods makes it difficult to assess their effectiveness and compare them with traditional methods. Reliable data on their long-term impact can only be generated by randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies. In the meantime, we need to ensure that current medical students receive high-quality education by incorporating best practices from diverse teaching methods based on valuable insights from experienced educators and current students' learning preferences.Medical education has undergone a significant reform in response to evolving health care demands, technological advancements, and emerging research in biomedical and education sciences.

    "Abstract": "The flipped classroom (FC) approach has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing the learning process, including within higher education contexts such as medical education. Recently, FC has emerged as potential alternative to traditional teaching models across various disciplines, particularly due to its more engaging nature. However, there is limited data available regarding its impact on student performance, particularly in the context of long-term knowledge retention in pharmacology. In this study, our objective was to assess the short- and long-term impact of FC on student performance in Hungarian pharmacology teaching at medical faculty in Semmelweis University (Budapest, Hungary). BACKGROUND The flipped classroom (FC) approach has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing the learning process, including within higher education contexts such as medical education. Recently, FC has emerged as potential alternative to traditional teaching models across various disciplines, particularly due to its more engaging nature. However, there is limited data available regarding its impact on student performance, particularly in the context of long-term knowledge retention in pharmacology. In this study, our objective was to assess the short- and long-term impact of FC on student performance in Hungarian pharmacology teaching at medical faculty in Semmelweis University (Budapest, Hungary).161 medical students and 10 teachers were involved in this study. We flipped four seminars, then we assessed the academic performance by using multiple choice tests immediately and two weeks after the flipped class. A follow-up assessment was conducted six months after the initial two FC sessions. Our findings indicated that the FC approach enhanced both short- and long-term knowledge retention across most topics. Notably, this long-term improvement was evident even six months after the original seminars on specific subjects. However, despite these topic-specific benefits, the overall performance, including exam grades, did not show significant improvement when compared to the conventional teaching approach. Additionally, we assessed student and teacher perceptions using two questionnaires immediately after practice and at the end of the year. According to the questionnaire responses, students perceived positively the FC approach, emphasizing its interactive and thought-provoking aspects. However, they identified the time-consuming nature of preparation as a significant concern. Teachers also viewed the FC approach favorably, particularly appreciating its interactivity and potential for greater effectiveness. Interestingly, more experienced teachers were less receptive to the FC method, and their perceptions of it were less favorable compared to those of their younger colleagues.

    "Abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global health threat, partly driven by inappropriate antibiotic use. Healthcare students, as future practitioners, must have a good understanding of AMR to contribute to antimicrobial stewardship. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an educational intervention on healthcare students' knowledge of AMR and to assess patterns of antibiotic use prior to the intervention. BACKGROUND Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global health threat, partly driven by inappropriate antibiotic use. Healthcare students, as future practitioners, must have a good understanding of AMR to contribute to antimicrobial stewardship. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an educational intervention on healthcare students' knowledge of AMR and to assess patterns of antibiotic use prior to the intervention.A quasi-experimental pre-and-post study design was conducted with unpaired groups of healthcare students. An educational intervention was carried out comprising of two 20-minute PowerPoint lectures, as well as question and answer sessions focused on understanding the spread, impact, and prevention of AMR. A self-administered questionnaire was given as a pre-test and repeated as a post-test immediately after the training. Students' knowledge of AMR and patterns of antibiotic use was assessed pre-intervention while knowledge of AMR was assessed post-intervention. The knowledge was categorised into domains (Understanding Antibiotic and Antimicrobial Resistance; Spread and Impact of Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance; Prevention of Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance). The total score for each domain of knowledge tested was categorized into good knowledge (≥ 80%) and poor knowledge (< 50%). METHODS A quasi-experimental pre-and-post study design was conducted with unpaired groups of healthcare students. An educational intervention was carried out comprising of two 20-minute PowerPoint lectures, as well as question and answer sessions focused on understanding the spread, impact, and prevention of AMR. A self-administered questionnaire was given as a pre-test and repeated as a post-test immediately after the training. Students' knowledge of AMR and patterns of antibiotic use was assessed pre-intervention while knowledge of AMR was assessed post-intervention.

The total score for each domain of knowledge tested was categorized into good knowledge (≥ 80%) and poor knowledge (< 50%).The number of participants in the pre- and post-intervention were 185 and 157 students with average age of 17.7 years and 17.8 years respectively. Post-intervention, there was a significant increase in students' AMR knowledge, with correct responses regarding spread and impact of AMR increasing from 40.5% pre-intervention to 62.4% post-intervention (p < 0.001; φ (effect size = 0.218). The proportion of students demonstrating good overall knowledge increased from 28.1 to 44.6% (p = 0.001; φ (effect size = 0.171). Misconceptions, such as misunderstanding that antibiotic resistance does not result from the body becoming resistant to antibiotics, persisted but not statistically significant (24.9-17.2%, p = 0.055). Pre-intervention also revealed varied antibiotic use patterns, including the inappropriate use of antibiotics for malaria (51.7%, (n = 76)), and common cold (25.2% (n = 37)). RESULTS The number of participants in the pre- and post-intervention were 185 and 157 students with average age of 17.7 years and 17.8 years respectively.

Incorporating structured AMR content into healthcare curricula could help the students contribute to antimicrobial stewardship. Future research should evaluate knowledge retention and behaviour changes to optimize the long-term impact of AMR education.

    "Abstract": "In an era of rapid scientific advancement, the need for engaging educational tools is critical. DEGRADATOR, a 2D computer game, bridges this gap by immersing players in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a key pathway in cellular protein degradation. Designed for players aged 12 and above, DEGRADATOR introduces the molecular mechanics of targeted protein degradation, including PROTAC drugs. Through 10 levels of gameplay combined with educational quizzes, it represents the first-ever resource of its kind to make this advanced topic accessible and amusing. The game was evaluated by 97 high school students (age 15–19) during biology classes. Over 75% of students completed the game in under 30 min, and 63% rated it highly (4 or 5 out of 5) for its ability to enhance their understanding of protein degradation. In quizzes, 59% scored 10 or more points out of 12 on the final test, indicating substantial knowledge retention. Teachers highlighted the game's potential for deepening students' comprehension and recommended accompanying materials to maximize educational impact. By blending entertainment with education, DEGRADATOR demystifies complex molecular processes, serving as a tool for popularizing science and addressing the potential misconceptions surrounding new therapeutic technologies. Freely available at https://degradator-game.com, DEGRADATOR is complemented by teacher resources and multimedia materials, ensuring broad applicability. This innovative platform not only supports classroom learning but also fosters curiosity and understanding beyond traditional academic settings.",

    "Abstract": "Veterinary anaesthesia requires theoretical knowledge and quick decision-making skills. Traditional education may not adequately prepare students, while simulation-based learning enhances engagement and skill development. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a Twine-based web system in improving experiential learning, engagement, knowledge retention, and decision-making skills in veterinary anaesthesia students. Five interactive clinical cases were developed using Twine, simulating realistic anaesthesia scenarios with decision points and gamified elements, such as scoring systems and resource management. These modules were accessible on various devices via the web. Following a workshop for second- to fourth-year students of the Degree in Veterinary Sciences, an anonymous survey assessed the module's effectiveness. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively, while qualitative feedback was processed through a hybrid AI-human thematic analysis. Out of 849 invited students, 367 responded (42% response rate). Feedback was highly positive; 90.8% found it effective for training, and 97.0% agreed it improved knowledge. User-friendliness was rated as \"easy\" or \"very easy\" by 94.6%. Regarding overall satisfaction, 96.7% of students described the workshop as \"good\" or \"excellent\". Some participants suggested improvements in mobile device compatibility and the need for additional resources to understand the concepts better. Twine's interactive format fosters experiential learning while reducing reliance on live animals, aligning with modern ethical standards. Its accessibility via web and translation-enabled browsers enhances its reach. Future research should examine Twine's impact on clinical skills retention and adaptability in various educational contexts, providing a flexible approach to veterinary anaesthesia education through gamified learning.Veterinary anaesthesia requires theoretical knowledge and quick decision-making skills.

    "Abstract": "Background: Simulation is a crucial component in the training of healthcare professionals, offering a safe environment for practical learning without posing risks to patients. Aim: This study aims to evaluate the effect of simulation with a standardized patient on the acquisition and retention of knowledge, as well as on the self-efficacy of nursing students. Methods: A quasi-experimental study with a pre-test and post-test design was conducted with 120 nursing students, who were randomly assigned to two groups. The experimental group (60) received training through simulation with a standardized patient, supplemented by a lecture-based course. The control group (60) received only the same lecture-based course. A pre-test was conducted to assess students' baseline knowledge and self-efficacy before any intervention. Student performance was then assessed with a post-test immediately after the training to measure knowledge acquisition and self-efficacy and a post-test three months after the intervention to measure long-term knowledge retention. Results: The results showed a statistically significant difference in mean scores between the intervention and control groups in terms of knowledge acquisition (14.92 vs. 13.32; p < 0.001; d = 0.99), self-efficacy (33.02 vs. 31.05; p < 0.001; d = 1.03) and knowledge retention three months after training (12.4 vs. 10.6; p < 0.001; d = 0.94). Conclusions: The results of this study confirmed the effectiveness of simulation in knowledge acquisition and retention, as well as in the self-efficacy of nursing students.

    "Abstract": "Hypertension is a widespread and life-threatening condition affecting one-third of adults globally. In low- and middle-income countries, like Malawi, the burden of hypertension is escalating due to inadequate healthcare resources and lifestyle changes. Family members often become primary caregivers, playing a crucial role in managing hypertension through support and adherence to treatment. This study examined caregivers’ knowledge retention by evaluating their pre- and post-health education knowledge levels. This was a prospective cross-sectional study in Neno, Malawi, a rural setting. 422 caregivers were enrolled from the Integrated Chronic Care Clinic (IC3). A structured questionnaire was used to collect baseline, post-health education, and week six data. Using SPSS V 22.0, comparison of knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) scores, correlation between KAP and between KAP and social demographic characteristics were done using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Pearson correlation, and independent t-test respectively. Among the 422 caregivers who participated in the study, 267 (63.2%) were females and mean age was 44.94 years. The baseline mean knowledge level score was 9.5 (38.0%) and rose to 21.08 (84.3%) p = 0.000 immediate post-health education and a 2.1% decrease 20.54 (82.2%) p<0.001 at week six from the immediate post health education score. Attitude improved from 16.76 (93.1%) at baseline to 17.74 (98.6%) at the six-week mark. Similarly, the mean practice score rose from 25.24 (78.9%) at baseline to 27.42 (85.7%) at week six. There was a positive correlation between KAP while age had a negative correlation with knowledge (r = -0.146; p = 0.003). There was a significant difference between different education levels on knowledge retention p = 0.009. There was a positive and good knowledge retention among caregivers of hypertensive patients after health education at the week six mark. With improved knowledge and the ability to retain it resulting in improved attitude and practices, caregivers are a cornerstone for continued and improved hypertension care for the patients.

    "Abstract": "For rising professionals to meet the needs of contemporary healthcare and biomedical innovation, educators must develop new teaching and learning approaches. Specifically, biomedical innovations are significantly influenced by the FDA’s regulatory framework, requiring professionals to be equipped with regulatory science knowledge, entrepreneurial skills, and interdisciplinary training. However, biomedical education often fails to integrate these skills in an environment that mimics the interdisciplinary setting required for translational science, leaving learners unprepared for unique challenges in practice. This study details an FDA Regulation and Entrepreneurship curriculum at Case Western Reserve University and its affiliated community, leveraging a novel approach for biomedical education. Focused on preparing biomedical professionals to navigate FDA regulatory processes and innovative entrepreneurship endeavors, the curriculum is built upon five core principles: integrating multiple disciplines, ensuring real world applicability, developing a systems thinking approach, incorporating ethical considerations, and fostering a collaborative and experiential learning environment. These principles are supported by a flexible course format, targeted learning objectives, team-based learning sessions, experiential learning opportunities, a diverse participant population, and an interdisciplinary team of faculty and experts. High participant engagement and broad representation across fields over the curriculum’s three-year lifespan to date affirm its relevance and value with participants representing the fields of basic science, medicine, law, business, and engineering. The flexible course format, team-based learning, and experiential learning proved instrumental in enhancing engagement, reinforcing practical learning outcomes, and supporting personalized learning goals. The flexible course format further aligns with professional needs of participants, providing a model for other institutions navigating similar challenges in biomedical education. In conclusion, participant feedback demonstrated the value of the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary training approach in promoting knowledge retention and skill development in complex medical, business management and legal contexts. Moving forward, targeted outreach and flexible engagement options will be necessary to expand the curricular reach and diverse participant population. The success of the curriculum suggests promising implications for similar approaches aimed at empowering biomedical professionals with essential regulatory, entrepreneurial and interdisciplinary competencies, ultimately advancing translational science and improving healthcare outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The utilization of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in healthcare presents an innovative and effective approach for the delivery of emergency medical supplies to rural communities. Providing healthcare students with opportunities to work with UAS prepares them to embrace novel technologies in their future careers. Caring for individuals living in rural communities and those with substance abuse disorders are critical components of current healthcare education. Intervention: This simulation ready-to-use describes an innovative simulation learning exercise (SLE) developed using UAS technologies to address an unexpected opioid overdose in a rural setting. Methods: Students received pre-simulation instruction on the concepts of addiction, emergency management of an opioid overdose, and rural healthcare. Students participated in an unfolding, two-part SLE. Results: The first scenario simulated emergency management of the opioid overdose in which a UAS delivered rescue medications. This was followed by a second scenario simulating continuing care after initial stabilization. Debriefing of the simulation and reflection activities were completed. Discussion: The integration of UAS in healthcare education provides a valuable opportunity for students to increase their knowledge of innovative technologies. The UAS provides educators with a novel resource to expand simulation experiences, increase student engagement, and promote knowledge retention of difficult concepts.

    "Abstract": "Educational animation, recognized for its potential accessibility and engaging qualities, has become increasingly prevalent in classroom instruction. However, not all educational animations exhibit high quality or significantly enhance learning outcomes. This study addresses the need for optimizing educational animation design to enhance student learning outcomes and experiences, employing the construction-integration model. We developed three types of educational animations: subtitled textual cue (STC), keyword textual cue (KTC), and structured textual cue (CTC). Through a quasi-experimental research design, 257 fifth-grade students were assigned to three groups, each exposed to one type of textual cue. The results indicate that CTC leads to superior achievement, knowledge retention, higher self-efficacy, and the lowest cognitive load. In comparison, KTC demonstrates moderate results, while STC yields the poorest outcomes. Furthermore, there is a significant negative correlation between achievement and cognitive load, and a significant positive correlation between achievement and self-efficacy. Additionally, there is a significant positive correlation between the \"faded effect\" of knowledge retention and self-efficacy. These findings highlight the superior learning outcomes and experiences associated with CTC. Based on these findings, recommendations are provided for future educational animation design and instructional practices.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac arrest remains a leading global cause of death. High-quality chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are crucial for patient outcomes. Basic life support (BLS) training must be adequately incorporated into undergraduate training. During the pandemic-regulated restrictions, our institute started the online CPR training course for medical undergraduates so that some training could be imparted to them if they needed to staff the clinical areas. This study compared online with traditional mannequin-based CPR training regarding skill acquisition and knowledge retention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized cross-sectional study involved 108 medical undergraduates divided into two groups to receive online-based training (Group 1) and mannequin-based training (Group 2). Compression depth and rate were objectively measured using an AmbuMan CPR training mannequin. Knowledge assessment was conducted using relevant clinical vignettes, and participant performance was assessed using a skill-based checklist. RESULTS: Both groups had comparable baseline knowledge. Group 2 exhibited significantly higher post intervention knowledge assessment and skill-based checklist scores. Mean compression depth [36.28 (13.84) vs 51.6 (8.7), P < 0.001] and median rate [110 (87.5 to 129.50) vs 123.0 (111.0 to 133.0), P = 0.012] were better in mannequin trained participants. Group 2 participants demonstrated superior skills across all checklist items, with notable differences in pre compression and compression steps. Scene safety checks (62%), compression rate (44%), and compression depth (48%) showed the most significant improvements, whereas steps involving Automated External Defibrillator (AED) usage had minimal enhancements. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study are significant, demonstrating that hands-on mannequin-based training is significantly more effective than online training in teaching BLS skills to novice medical students, particularly in achieving correct chest compression depth and rate. The study’s findings indicate that hands-on training is indispensable for effective skill acquisition despite the widespread adoption of online teaching.",

    "Abstract": "Domain Knowledge Graphs are becoming increasingly significant in a multitude of sectors, as they collate distinctive data from a plethora of disciplines. However, in some domains, generic knowledge representation is limited, resulting in problems like duplication and knowledge loss. To solve the above issues, the study first builds a Knowledge Representation Learning model for training and then constructs a Domain Knowledge Graph inference algorithm based on Knowledge Representation Learning for knowledge inference and quality evaluation. The results indicated that the effectiveness of the knowledge-inference-raised method was the best in datasets of different sizes, with the average accuracy, Hits@1, Hits@3 and Hits@10 of 0.906, 0.914, 0.942 and 0.948, respectively. In the results of the link prediction task, the study method had a poor performance for only one relation, with an average accuracy rate of 0.675. In the application results of knowledge graph quality assessment, the interpretability and data fusion ability of both Domain Knowledge Graphs were strong, with the accuracy indexes exceeding 0.95, and the various indexes of simplicity and completeness exceeding 0.88. The above results indicate that our research method is effective in filling in the missing knowledge through knowledge reasoning and ensures data reliability.",

    "Abstract": "Patient education in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has become increasingly complex with the introduction of new treatments and chemotherapy regimens. Video education presents an opportunity to supplement traditional patient education and address some of the gaps associated with standard methods. This single-center study sought to assess the potential impact of supplemental video education on patients receiving induction chemotherapy for AML. Participants were consented to be randomized to receive their education with or without a supplemental video designed for their treatment regimen. We then provided a survey to each participant to assess knowledge retention, anxiety, and overall satisfaction with their care. Patients that received video education were found to have significantly improved knowledge retention compared to those that did not. There were no differences detected in anxiety or patient satisfaction. Video education appears to be an effective supplemental method for patient education in AML. Limitations include the single-center nature of the study at an urban academic medical center with a relatively well-educated, primarily Caucasian, younger population. Future research is warranted to assess the video in a diverse set of languages and to explore its broader benefits.",

    "Abstract": "With the constant development of technology and the growing interest of students in its application, Extended Reality (XR) expands the opportunities for students from various disciplines to stimulate their creativity and innovation in innovative ways in education. In this sense, the purpose of this research was to analyse the current scientific literature to assess the opportunities offered by XR, which encompasses Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality, in education. The study was developed following the methodology supported by the PRISMA statement, retrieving scientific literature from Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC, PsycINFO, British Education Index and Google Scholar. The analysis of the studies reveals that XR has great potential to enhance teaching and learning in various disciplines. The results indicate that XR can offer immersive and highly interactive learning experiences that can improve understanding of complex concepts and increase knowledge retention. In addition, it has been observed that XR can adapt to different learning styles and provide personalised learning opportunities. However, significant challenges are identified, such as accessibility and costs associated with its implementation in educational settings. Therefore, the need for further research to fully understand the long-term impact of XR on learning and skills development is highlighted.",

    "Abstract": "Background The utilization of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in healthcare presents an innovative and effective approach for the delivery of emergency medical supplies to rural communities. Providing healthcare students with opportunities to work with UAS prepares them to embrace novel technologies in their future careers. Caring for individuals living in rural communities and those with substance abuse disorders are critical components of current healthcare education. Intervention This simulation ready-to-use describes an innovative simulation learning exercise (SLE) developed using UAS technologies to address an unexpected opioid overdose in a rural setting. Methods Students received pre-simulation instruction on the concepts of addiction, emergency management of an opioid overdose , and rural healthcare. Students participated in an unfolding, two-part SLE. Results The first scenario simulated emergency management of the opioid overdose in which a UAS delivered rescue medications. This was followed by a second scenario simulating continuing care after initial stabilization. Debriefing of the simulation and reflection activities were completed. Discussion The integration of UAS in healthcare education provides a valuable opportunity for students to increase their knowledge of innovative technologies. The UAS provides educators with a novel resource to expand simulation experiences, increase student engagement, and promote knowledge retention of difficult concepts.

    "Abstract": "Hypertension is a widespread and life-threatening condition affecting one-third of adults globally. In low- and middle-income countries, like Malawi, the burden of hypertension is escalating due to inadequate healthcare resources and lifestyle changes. Family members often become primary caregivers, playing a crucial role in managing hypertension through support and adherence to treatment. This study examined caregivers’ knowledge retention by evaluating their pre- and post-health education knowledge levels. This was a prospective cross-sectional study in Neno, Malawi, a rural setting. 422 caregivers were enrolled from the Integrated Chronic Care Clinic (IC3). A structured questionnaire was used to collect baseline, post-health education, and week six data. Using SPSS V 22.0, comparison of knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) scores, correlation between KAP and between KAP and social demographic characteristics were done using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Pearson correlation, and independent t-test respectively. Among the 422 caregivers who participated in the study, 267 (63.2%) were females and mean age was 44.94 years. The baseline mean knowledge level score was 9.5 (38.0%) and rose to 21.08 (84.3%) p = 0.000 immediate post-health education and a 2.1% decrease 20.54 (82.2%) p<0.001 at week six from the immediate post health education score. Attitude improved from 16.76 (93.1%) at baseline to 17.74 (98.6%) at the six-week mark. Similarly, the mean practice score rose from 25.24 (78.9%) at baseline to 27.42 (85.7%) at week six. There was a positive correlation between KAP while age had a negative correlation with knowledge (r = -0.146; p = 0.003). There was a significant difference between different education levels on knowledge retention p = 0.009. There was a positive and good knowledge retention among caregivers of hypertensive patients after health education at the week six mark. With improved knowledge and the ability to retain it resulting in improved attitude and practices, caregivers are a cornerstone for continued and improved hypertension care for the patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study aimed to establish the effectiveness of a hypertension knowledge education intervention among Indian adolescents to foster lifestyle changes aimed at preventing hypertension. Methods: The Hypertension Knowledge Test (HKT) was used to assess changes in knowledge using a repeated-measures one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Healthy Lifestyle Practice Scale for Children and Adolescents (HELIPSCA) indexed healthy lifestyle practices, with paired t -tests used to compare pre- and post-intervention scores. A two-way mixed ANOVA examined changes in healthy lifestyle practices among adolescents divided in terms of early and late stage of development. Results: Significant mean differences were observed in overall hypertension knowledge across four domains: general awareness, lifestyle factors, causes and care, and medication management and across time periods. There was a significant improvement in HELIPSCA scores post-intervention, particularly among early adolescents. Conclusion: The hypertension knowledge intervention examined in this study was effective in establishing a cognitive base among school children, with knowledge retention observed for 3 months. Moreover, this knowledge increase was associated with a parallel change in improved healthy lifestyle practices, notably among early adolescents. These findings underscore the importance of providing school-based education programmes early in adolescence to promote awareness of chronic illnesses and encourage healthy lifestyle choices.",

    "Abstract": "Background The evolution of warfare has resulted in a surge of high-energy blast injuries predominantly involving the lower extremities. Once thought to impact only forward-deployed military, such mechanisms of injury are becoming a harsh reality even in civilian territory. Proficiency in surgical techniques for extremity damage control is vital for surgeons, regardless of specialty. To evaluate and train surgical residents and attending surgeons in critical limb-salvage techniques, Theater Hospital Operations Replication (THOR) has been proposed as a high-fidelity training platform to enhance extremity surgery teaching practices and assess proficiency in fasciotomy, vascular shunting, and knee-spanning external fixation in a simulated, resource-limited environment. Questions/purposes Given the importance of proficiency and efficiency in surgeon ability to perform fasciotomies, vascular shunting, and placement of external fixators, in this study, we proposed two research questions: (1) Does repetition-based training within the THOR model improve surgeon knowledge and technical skill? (2) Are there differences in skill outcome when utilizing the THOR model based on surgical specialty (orthopaedic versus general) and/or level in training (attending versus resident)? Methods This was an observational learning outcome study performed in the bioskills lab at a single institution, the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, in which 26 surgeons completed a same-day course consisting of pretraining assessment, cadaver training on three damage-control surgery techniques in a high-fidelity THOR environment, and post-training assessment. The surgeons were either general surgeons or orthopaedic surgeons and consisted of both residents and attending surgeons. Subjects underwent a pretraining knowledge assessment, followed by two rounds of performing simulated surgery. The first round of surgery included guidance and instruction from board-certified orthopaedic surgeons. After a short break for the subjects to review the material, the second round was completed without instruction. To answer our first question of how repetition-based training impacts surgical skill, our metrics included: Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scores (range 1 to 5, scored lowest to highest, where higher scores represent optimal skill performance), procedural accuracy, a 10-question knowledge assessment administered before and after training (scored 0 to 10, where higher scores represent competency of the anatomy and procedure steps), and total procedure time. To address our second question, data on demographic characteristics were collected on all participants, which included surgical specialty, year in training, and gender. Results The general surgery residents’ cohort demonstrated improvement in both mean ± SD OSATS scores (2.4 ± 0.7 before training versus 3.6 ± 0.6 after training, mean difference 1.2 [95% CI 0.4 to 2.0]; p = 0.01) and procedure duration (23 ± 7 minutes before training versus 16 ± 5 minutes after training, mean difference 6 minutes [95% CI 4 to 9]; p = 0.001) for external fixator procedures after THOR. Similar results were seen in fasciotomies after THOR. The orthopaedic surgery residents’ cohort showed similar improvements in reducing procedure duration when performing knee-spanning external fixator surgery, as well as exhibited improvements during vascular shunting procedures in both mean ± SD OSATS scores (previously 3.3 ± 0.9 versus 4.0 ± 0.9, mean difference 0.7 [95% CI 0.2 to 1.2]; p = 0.01) and procedure duration (23 ± 5 minutes versus 14 ± 8 minutes, mean difference 10 minutes [95% CI 4 to 15]; p = 0.003) after THOR. When we compared the cohorts, general surgery attending surgeons demonstrated an improvement in vascular shunting procedure duration after instruction with the THOR model (19 ± 3 minutes versus 12 ± 4 minutes, mean difference 7 minutes [95% CI 1 to 13]; p = 0.03) and in overall knowledge scores (4.3 + 0.5 versus 8.0 ± 1.6, mean difference 3.8 [95% CI 0.5 to 7.0]; p = 0.04). The orthopaedic surgery attending surgeons yielded no improvement for any metric, pretraining and post-training. Using the prescores as a covariate, for almost all metrics analyzed, there were no differences between surgeon groups based on specialty after completing the repeated training. Conclusion Use of the high-fidelity THOR training model improved proficiency in the examined sample of extremity damage-control procedures, thus demonstrating its efficacy in enhancing surgical skills and short-interval knowledge retention while simultaneously highlighting the importance of cadaver simulation training in enhancing surgical preparedness for complex trauma. Clinical Relevance The high-fidelity THOR training model represents a promising modality for preparing surgeons for extremity combat trauma management in resource-limited, high-stress environments. Whether in a wartime environment or in the civilian sector, efficient and skilled intervention are crucial in managing patient morbidity. Differences of a few minutes per procedure can mean all the difference in damage control, especially when compounded in situations where vascular shunting, knee-spanning external fixation, and lower leg four-compartment fasciotomy have to be performed together by both orthopaedic and general surgeons. The observational period in this study spanned 1 day and thus does not provide information on retention of long-term skills or knowledge. A follow-on study can assess how time from initial training to final evaluation impacts overall skill competency and knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "Central venous catheters (CVCs) are used in pediatric patients to deliver IV fluids, blood products, medications, and nutrients. Potential complications include central line infection, which carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality in this population. Pediatric critical care nurses play a crucial role in helping to reduce the risk of infection. BACKGROUND Central venous catheters (CVCs) are used in pediatric patients to deliver IV fluids, blood products, medications, and nutrients. Potential complications include central line infection, which carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality in this population. Pediatric critical care nurses play a crucial role in helping to reduce the risk of infection.The aim of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of a serious, simulated, gaming-based intervention to improve the skills and knowledge of RNs in the early stages of their career regarding central line insertion, care, and infection prevention. PURPOSE The aim of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of a serious, simulated, gaming-based intervention to improve the skills and knowledge of RNs in the early stages of their career regarding central line insertion, care, and infection prevention.A single-arm, pre- and postinterventional pilot study was conducted at the Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health, from July 2021 to July 2022. The study participants were bedside pediatric critical care nurses who were provided with education and skills training regarding CVC placement and maintenance through a so-called serious game-essentially, a video game with a purpose. A simulation session and multiple-choice knowledge test were used to assess skills and knowledge retention both before and after the intervention. METHODS A single-arm, pre- and postinterventional pilot study was conducted at the Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health, from July 2021 to July 2022. The study participants were bedside pediatric critical care nurses who were provided with education and skills training regarding CVC placement and maintenance through a so-called serious game-essentially, a video game with a purpose. A simulation session and multiple-choice knowledge test were used to assess skills and knowledge retention both before and after the intervention.A total of 32 pediatric critical care nurses participated in the study; however, 1 nurse did not complete the follow-up assessment. The study revealed a statistically significant increase in the overall mean (SD) global performance score from 4.06 (2.11) before the intervention to 5.97 (1.80) afterward. Specific areas of performance also showed significant improvement: handwashing prior to the procedure (P = 0.04), covering the procedure site (P = 0.01), cleaning the site properly (P < 0.01), and ensuring central line placement before use (P < 0.01). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the nurses' performance on the multiple-choice knowledge test before and after the intervention.

Our findings indicate that serious gaming is effective in engaging learners and enhancing their skills. More research is needed to evaluate the long-term impact of serious games on learning outcomes and patient care.

    "Abstract": "Background: Central venous catheters (CVCs) are used in pediatric patients to deliver IV fluids, blood products, medications, and nutrients. Potential complications include central line infection, which carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality in this population. Pediatric critical care nurses play a crucial role in helping to reduce the risk of infection. Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of a serious, simulated, gaming-based intervention to improve the skills and knowledge of RNs in the early stages of their career regarding central line insertion, care, and infection prevention. Methods: A single-arm, pre- and postinterventional pilot study was conducted at the Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health, from July 2021 to July 2022. The study participants were bedside pediatric critical care nurses who were provided with education and skills training regarding CVC placement and maintenance through a so-called serious game—essentially, a video game with a purpose. A simulation session and multiple-choice knowledge test were used to assess skills and knowledge retention both before and after the intervention. Results: A total of 32 pediatric critical care nurses participated in the study; however, 1 nurse did not complete the follow-up assessment. The study revealed a statistically significant increase in the overall mean (SD) global performance score from 4.06 (2.11) before the intervention to 5.97 (1.80) afterward. Specific areas of performance also showed significant improvement: handwashing prior to the procedure ( P = 0.04), covering the procedure site ( P = 0.01), cleaning the site properly ( P < 0.01), and ensuring central line placement before use ( P < 0.01). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the nurses' performance on the multiple-choice knowledge test before and after the intervention. Conclusion: This study suggests that serious games have the potential to improve nursing education, particularly in complex procedures like central line insertion and maintenance. Our findings indicate that serious gaming is effective in engaging learners and enhancing their skills. More research is needed to evaluate the long-term impact of serious games on learning outcomes and patient care.",

    "Abstract": "Teaching renal physiology is problematic in many medical schools since conventional passive learning might not be effective. Active learnings including flipped classroom (FC) have been introduced to medical education including renal physiology topic recently, but no study regarding long-term outcomes has been reported. BACKGROUND Teaching renal physiology is problematic in many medical schools since conventional passive learning might not be effective. Active learnings including flipped classroom (FC) have been introduced to medical education including renal physiology topic recently, but no study regarding long-term outcomes has been reported.Two classes of second-year medical students were compared. The former class studied with conventional lecture and the latter class studied with FC. Our FC includes asynchronous instructor-made recorded lectures that students can study according to their pace and available time, followed by synchronous case discussions related to the lecture topic. There were post-test quizzes for all recorded lectures along with the given explanation of the answers after finishing each quiz. Short-term topic understanding and long-term knowledge retention assessed with summative examination and end-of-preclerkship comprehensive examination, respectively, were compared. Attitude towards FC was also assessed. APPROACH Two classes of second-year medical students were compared. The former class studied with conventional lecture and the latter class studied with FC. Our FC includes asynchronous instructor-made recorded lectures that students can study according to their pace and available time, followed by synchronous case discussions related to the lecture topic. There were post-test quizzes for all recorded lectures along with the given explanation of the answers after finishing each quiz. Short-term topic understanding and long-term knowledge retention assessed with summative examination and end-of-preclerkship comprehensive examination, respectively, were compared. Attitude towards FC was also assessed.Students in the FC group performed better in both summative examination (70.1 ± 8.9 vs. 62.8 ± 9.9, p < 0.001, a total score of 90) and comprehensive examination (6.5 ± 2.2 vs. 5.9 ± 1.8, p < 0.001, a total score of 11). Most students agreed that FC should be applied despite the increased stress level and that the post-test quizzes were very helpful. Intriguingly, the multivariate analysis showed that male students performed better than female students for both examinations. EVALUATION Students in the FC group performed better in both summative examination (70.1 ± 8.9 vs. 62.8 ± 9.9, p < 0.001, a total score of 90) and comprehensive examination (6.5 ± 2.2 vs. 5.9 ± 1.8, p < 0.001, a total score of 11). Most students agreed that FC should be applied despite the increased stress level and that the post-test quizzes were very helpful. Intriguingly, the multivariate analysis showed that male students performed better than female students for both examinations.Well-designed FC is a promising and highly effective method in renal physiology teaching. Cautions for the instructor include students' stress and gender differences in academic performance. Well-designed FC is a promising and highly effective method in renal physiology teaching.

    "Abstract": "The evolution of warfare has resulted in a surge of high-energy blast injuries predominantly involving the lower extremities. Once thought to impact only forward-deployed military, such mechanisms of injury are becoming a harsh reality even in civilian territory. Proficiency in surgical techniques for extremity damage control is vital for surgeons, regardless of specialty. To evaluate and train surgical residents and attending surgeons in critical limb-salvage techniques, Theater Hospital Operations Replication (THOR) has been proposed as a high-fidelity training platform to enhance extremity surgery teaching practices and assess proficiency in fasciotomy, vascular shunting, and knee-spanning external fixation in a simulated, resource-limited environment. BACKGROUND The evolution of warfare has resulted in a surge of high-energy blast injuries predominantly involving the lower extremities.

Proficiency in surgical techniques for extremity damage control is vital for surgeons, regardless of specialty.

(2) Are there differences in skill outcome when utilizing the THOR model based on surgical specialty (orthopaedic versus general) and/or level in training (attending versus resident)? QUESTIONS/PURPOSES Given the importance of proficiency and efficiency in surgeon ability to perform fasciotomies, vascular shunting, and placement of external fixators, in this study, we proposed two research questions: (1) Does repetition-based training within the THOR model improve surgeon knowledge and technical skill? (2) Are there differences in skill outcome when utilizing the THOR model based on surgical specialty (orthopaedic versus general) and/or level in training (attending versus resident)?This was an observational learning outcome study performed in the bioskills lab at a single institution, the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, in which 26 surgeons completed a same-day course consisting of pretraining assessment, cadaver training on three damage-control surgery techniques in a high-fidelity THOR environment, and post-training assessment. The surgeons were either general surgeons or orthopaedic surgeons and consisted of both residents and attending surgeons. Subjects underwent a pretraining knowledge assessment, followed by two rounds of performing simulated surgery. The first round of surgery included guidance and instruction from board-certified orthopaedic surgeons. After a short break for the subjects to review the material, the second round was completed without instruction. To answer our first question of how repetition-based training impacts surgical skill, our metrics included: Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scores (range 1 to 5, scored lowest to highest, where higher scores represent optimal skill performance), procedural accuracy, a 10-question knowledge assessment administered before and after training (scored 0 to 10, where higher scores represent competency of the anatomy and procedure steps), and total procedure time. To address our second question, data on demographic characteristics were collected on all participants, which included surgical specialty, year in training, and gender.

To address our second question, data on demographic characteristics were collected on all participants, which included surgical specialty, year in training, and gender.The general surgery residents' cohort demonstrated improvement in both mean ± SD OSATS scores (2.4 ± 0.7 before training versus 3.6 ± 0.6 after training, mean difference 1.2 [95% CI 0.4 to 2.0]; p = 0.01) and procedure duration (23 ± 7 minutes before training versus 16 ± 5 minutes after training, mean difference 6 minutes [95% CI 4 to 9]; p = 0.001) for external fixator procedures after THOR. Similar results were seen in fasciotomies after THOR. The orthopaedic surgery residents' cohort showed similar improvements in reducing procedure duration when performing knee-spanning external fixator surgery, as well as exhibited improvements during vascular shunting procedures in both mean ± SD OSATS scores (previously 3.3 ± 0.9 versus 4.0 ± 0.9, mean difference 0.7 [95% CI 0.2 to 1.2]; p = 0.01) and procedure duration (23 ± 5 minutes versus 14 ± 8 minutes, mean difference 10 minutes [95% CI 4 to 15]; p = 0.003) after THOR. When we compared the cohorts, general surgery attending surgeons demonstrated an improvement in vascular shunting procedure duration after instruction with the THOR model (19 ± 3 minutes versus 12 ± 4 minutes, mean difference 7 minutes [95% CI 1 to 13]; p = 0.03) and in overall knowledge scores (4.3 + 0.5 versus 8.0 ± 1.6, mean difference 3.8 [95% CI 0.5 to 7.0]; p = 0.04). The orthopaedic surgery attending surgeons yielded no improvement for any metric, pretraining and post-training. Using the prescores as a covariate, for almost all metrics analyzed, there were no differences between surgeon groups based on specialty after completing the repeated training.

CONCLUSION Use of the high-fidelity THOR training model improved proficiency in the examined sample of extremity damage-control procedures, thus demonstrating its efficacy in enhancing surgical skills and short-interval knowledge retention while simultaneously highlighting the importance of cadaver simulation training in enhancing surgical preparedness for complex trauma.The high-fidelity THOR training model represents a promising modality for preparing surgeons for extremity combat trauma management in resource-limited, high-stress environments. Whether in a wartime environment or in the civilian sector, efficient and skilled intervention are crucial in managing patient morbidity. Differences of a few minutes per procedure can mean all the difference in damage control, especially when compounded in situations where vascular shunting, knee-spanning external fixation, and lower leg four-compartment fasciotomy have to be performed together by both orthopaedic and general surgeons. The observational period in this study spanned 1 day and thus does not provide information on retention of long-term skills or knowledge. A follow-on study can assess how time from initial training to final evaluation impacts overall skill competency and knowledge.

    "Abstract": "Patient education in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has become increasingly complex with the introduction of new treatments and chemotherapy regimens. Video education presents an opportunity to supplement traditional patient education and address some of the gaps associated with standard methods. This single-center study sought to assess the potential impact of supplemental video education on patients receiving induction chemotherapy for AML. Participants were consented to be randomized to receive their education with or without a supplemental video designed for their treatment regimen. We then provided a survey to each participant to assess knowledge retention, anxiety, and overall satisfaction with their care. Patients that received video education were found to have significantly improved knowledge retention compared to those that did not. There were no differences detected in anxiety or patient satisfaction. Video education appears to be an effective supplemental method for patient education in AML. Limitations include the single-center nature of the study at an urban academic medical center with a relatively well-educated, primarily Caucasian, younger population. Future research is warranted to assess the video in a diverse set of languages and to explore its broader benefits.Patient education in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has become increasingly complex with the introduction of new treatments and chemotherapy regimens.

    "Abstract": "With the constant development of technology and the growing interest of students in its application, Extended Reality (XR) expands the opportunities for students from various disciplines to stimulate their creativity and innovation in innovative ways in education. In this sense, the purpose of this research was to analyse the current scientific literature to assess the opportunities offered by XR, which encompasses Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality, in education. The study was developed following the methodology supported by the PRISMA statement, retrieving scientific literature from Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC, PsycINFO, British Education Index and Google Scholar. The analysis of the studies reveals that XR has great potential to enhance teaching and learning in various disciplines. The results indicate that XR can offer immersive and highly interactive learning experiences that can improve understanding of complex concepts and increase knowledge retention. In addition, it has been observed that XR can adapt to different learning styles and provide personalised learning opportunities. However, significant challenges are identified, such as accessibility and costs associated with its implementation in educational settings. Therefore, the need for further research to fully understand the long-term impact of XR on learning and skills development is highlighted.

The research question in this study was: what features of CBL support active learning?Data was collected using Structured Group Feedback Sessions (SGFS) from 36 students from 12 different countries.

METHODS Data was collected using Structured Group Feedback Sessions (SGFS) from 36 students from 12 different countries. Students were placed in eight Structured Group Feedback sessions, a method that facilitates structured discussions and is effect in curriculum evaluation and feedback. The Experience Based Learning model was used as the conceptual framework to guide the analysis, which was completed using the framework analysis method.Themes were derived from the Experience Based Learning model: affective, pedagogical, and organisational and analysed according to the research question. We found CBL can be used to facilitate active learning with all students at a multicultural medical university. We identified six learning points to highlight features of CBL that support active learning: CBL increased contact with peers and facilitated student bonding; students need to feel psychologically safe to participate; prior learning can enhance confidence to participate; facilitators need to be aware of their role, know about psychological safety, and manage student participation including the dominant voice; some students have a lower tolerance of uncertainty and need additional clarity at the end either via the facilitator or additional notes that provide the key learning points to take away; students became more engaged when a case is aligned to a real patient case giving it authenticity.

    "Abstract": "Student-centered learning and unconventional teaching modalities are gaining popularity in medical education. One notable approach involves engaging students in producing creative projects to complement the learning of preclinical topics. A systematic review was conducted to characterize the impact of creative project-based learning on metacognition and knowledge gains in medical students. STUDY OBJECTIVE Student-centered learning and unconventional teaching modalities are gaining popularity in medical education. One notable approach involves engaging students in producing creative projects to complement the learning of preclinical topics. A systematic review was conducted to characterize the impact of creative project-based learning on metacognition and knowledge gains in medical students.A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE and Embase via Ovid, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Scopus from January 1st, 1995, to July 6th, 2023. Studies using quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods approaches that explored the impact of creative project-based lessons on medical students' educational outcomes were included. Two investigators independently screened the titles and abstracts and extracted data from included articles. A narrative synthesis was conducted to summarize study designs and outcome measures. Content analysis was conducted to generate codes and themes. Study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool in view of the range of study types employed.

Two investigators independently screened the titles and abstracts and extracted data from included articles. A narrative synthesis was conducted to summarize study designs and outcome measures. Content analysis was conducted to generate codes and themes. Study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool in view of the range of study types employed.The review included 17 studies published between 2010 to 2022. These studies implemented various creative project interventions such as handicraft models, drawings, and concept maps covering multiple topics, including anatomy, histopathology, and fundamental sciences. The identified themes of Enhanced Learning, Collaborative Learning, and Deep Learning led to further themes of Student Engagement, Student Disengagement, and Faculty Engagement. Collaborative learning involves students working in teams and benefitting from effective mentorship. Creative projects facilitated deep learning objectives via interdisciplinary learning and promoted new ways of perceiving concepts. Learning was enhanced through increased interactivity, high conceptual fidelity and improved knowledge retention. RESULTS The review included 17 studies published between 2010 to 2022.

Creative projects facilitated deep learning objectives via interdisciplinary learning and promoted new ways of perceiving concepts. Learning was enhanced through increased interactivity, high conceptual fidelity and improved knowledge retention.Creative projects undertaken by medical students exhibit attributes that facilitate the acquisition of collaborative and deep learning objectives through self-directed learning, cognitive load modulation, and metacognitive behaviours. Faculty mentorship and group learning amongst peers facilitate these processes, although challenges such as high task demands, cognitive and emotional intensiveness, and mismatch with students; professional identities remain. Overall, students and faculty received these interventions well, thus, warranting further exploration for uses in medical curricula.

    "Abstract": "Immersive learning is predominantly constrained to technology-based interventions but has the potential for more diverse applications. This study reports on an experiment investigating the learning affordances of psychological immersion evoked by narrative absorption. A total of 228 participants were randomly assigned to one of three forms of media, an image, a word list, and a narrative, all of which contained identical items to be memorized for immediate and delayed free recall memory tests. Other variables measured were immersion, extraneous cognitive load, and mental imagery. ANOVA and correlation analyses showed that the narrative media was found to be significantly more immersive and that it evoked mental imagery in individuals at higher levels than both the list and image media. Importantly, there was more decay in memory recall between immediate and delayed tests for those exposed to the list and the image than for those who read the narrative. This implies the utility of immersive narratives for spontaneous mental image generation, which leads to improved knowledge retention. Other implications for immersive learning theory are discussed, and practical solutions for incorporating narrative immersion in learning are also suggested.

OBJECTIVES The aim of this systematic work is a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (SWOT) analysis to select suitable medicinal plants for cultivation in the region of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.A systematic SWOT analysis, based on expert assesments and literature research, was performed considering factors like market demand, cultivation conditions, and potential economic benefits. METHODS A systematic SWOT analysis, based on expert assesments and literature research, was performed considering factors like market demand, cultivation conditions, and potential economic benefits.Medicinal plants have been essential for producing compounds with significant health benefits. However, unsuitable harvesting practices threaten plant species and traditional communities due to loss of knowledge and culture. In response, sustainable cultivation is gaining attention as alternative to wild collection, ensuring both biodiversity conversation and integrity of medicinal products. Three plants - Arnica montana L. , Hydrastis canadensis L., and Rheum rhaponticum L. - were identified as particularly suitable due to their high demand and feasibility of their cultivation under local conditions. Conversely, six other plants were deemed less viable due to various challenges, including market competition and harvesting difficulties.

BACKGROUND The rapid evolution of healthcare necessitates a new generation of doctors with strong critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability skills. This systematic review explores current longitudinal assessment practices in undergraduate medical education in Saudi Arabia with particular emphasis on progress test and its utility, advantages, and disadvantages.A systematic search was conducted across relevant databases to identify studies that discuss progress test in undergraduate medical education in Saudi Arabia. The studies were analyzed to evaluate their alignment with study objectives and to the demands of a changing healthcare landscape. METHODS A systematic search was conducted across relevant databases to identify studies that discuss progress test in undergraduate medical education in Saudi Arabia. The studies were analyzed to evaluate their alignment with study objectives and to the demands of a changing healthcare landscape.The review highlights the dynamic nature of progress test (PT) as a longitudinal assessment method in undergraduate medical education in Saudi Arabia. The advantages included yearly assessments and holistic feedback to enhance learning techniques and knowledge retention. Moreover, PT serves as both a summative and formative assessment, offering personalized learning experiences tailored to individual needs and pacing. Contrasting traditional assessments, PT promotes deep learning strategies and meaning-oriented approaches, fostering holistic understanding rather than rote memorization. Additionally, PT's continuous nature allows for early identification of knowledge gaps and facilitates ongoing improvement.

    "Abstract": "The insertion of a tracheostomy is an established technique used to wean patients off ventilatory support, manage secretions in complex conditions, and as a potentially life-saving procedure to bypass upper airway obstruction. Life-threatening complications during aftercare are not uncommon and may be influenced by a lack of education of carers or healthcare providers of children and young people living with a tracheostomy. Education programmes designed and supported by the National Tracheostomy Safety Project are effective, but resources are not available to educate the workforce at scale. With the overarching aim of widening access to paediatric tracheostomy skills training, we present the protocol for the development and evaluation of a novel virtual reality (VR) training tool designed to simulate the emergency management of paediatric tracheostomy complications.

With the overarching aim of widening access to paediatric tracheostomy skills training, we present the protocol for the development and evaluation of a novel virtual reality (VR) training tool designed to simulate the emergency management of paediatric tracheostomy complications.A multi-centre, non-inferiority educational interventional study with historical controls will be used to evaluate the novel VR training package. A group of 69 healthcare staff and students will have one week to use the educational intervention as often as necessary to learn paediatric emergency tracheostomy skills. The primary outcome measure is skill performance in simulation in a pre- and post-intervention structure within subjects. Participant performance will also be assessed using non-inferiority metrics against historical traditional educational control data. Secondary outcomes include knowledge gain, knowledge retention, usability, side effects, and participant satisfaction. To minimise the risk of cybersickness, teleportation was the preferred locomotion method for the user navigation within the VR environment.

    "Abstract": "The Basic Emergency Care (BEC) course was created by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM) to train frontline providers in low-resource settings. This study aims to evaluate long-term retention and maintenance of emergency care knowledge and confidence among University of Nairobi School of Medicine graduates after completing the BEC course. BACKGROUND The Basic Emergency Care (BEC) course was created by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM) to train frontline providers in low-resource settings. This study aims to evaluate long-term retention and maintenance of emergency care knowledge and confidence among University of Nairobi School of Medicine graduates after completing the BEC course.This longitudinal, prospective, comparative study was conducted with recent graduates of the University of Nairobi School of Medicine from October 2021 to May 2023. Participants' retention of emergency medicine knowledge was assessed comparing a pre/post course test and a multiple-choice examination 12 to 18 months after completing the BEC course. A survey assessed participants' confidence in managing patients with emergencies 12-18 months after completing the BEC course using a 4-point Likert scale. These results were compared to a control group of recent University of Nairobi School of Medicine graduates who did not take the BEC course. METHODS This longitudinal, prospective, comparative study was conducted with recent graduates of the University of Nairobi School of Medicine from October 2021 to May 2023. Participants' retention of emergency medicine knowledge was assessed comparing a pre/post course test and a multiple-choice examination 12 to 18 months after completing the BEC course. A survey assessed participants' confidence in managing patients with emergencies 12-18 months after completing the BEC course using a 4-point Likert scale. These results were compared to a control group of recent University of Nairobi School of Medicine graduates who did not take the BEC course.The follow-up test scores were lower than the immediate post-course test scores, which suggests some knowledge loss over time. Compared to the control group, the BEC participants had higher test scores during the follow-up period although the difference was not significant. There was no difference between most of the immediate post-course and follow-up survey responses. On follow-up evaluation, BEC participants reported a significant decrease in confidence in understanding emergency drugs and managing an obstructed airway and a patient requiring immobilization. However, compared to the control group, BEC participants had significantly higher self-reported confidence in most areas assessed by the survey.

    "Abstract": "Medical students often struggle to engage with and retain complex pharmacology topics during their preclinical education. Traditional teaching methods can lead to passive learning and poor long-term retention of critical concepts. Background Medical students often struggle to engage with and retain complex pharmacology topics during their preclinical education. Traditional teaching methods can lead to passive learning and poor long-term retention of critical concepts.This study aims to enhance the teaching of clinical pharmacology in medical school by using a multimodal generative artificial intelligence (genAI) approach to create compelling, cinematic clinical narratives (CCNs). Objective This study aims to enhance the teaching of clinical pharmacology in medical school by using a multimodal generative artificial intelligence (genAI) approach to create compelling, cinematic clinical narratives (CCNs).We transformed a standard clinical case into an engaging, interactive multimedia experience called \"Shattered Slippers.\" This CCN used various genAI tools for content creation: GPT-4 for developing the storyline, Leonardo.ai and Stable Diffusion for generating images, Eleven Labs for creating audio narrations, and Suno for composing a theme song. The CCN integrated narrative styles and pop culture references to enhance student engagement. It was applied in teaching first-year medical students about immune system pharmacology. Student responses were assessed through the Situational Interest Survey for Multimedia and examination performance. The target audience comprised first-year medical students (n=40), with 18 responding to the Situational Interest Survey for Multimedia survey (n=18).

Student responses were assessed through the Situational Interest Survey for Multimedia and examination performance. The target audience comprised first-year medical students (n=40), with 18 responding to the Situational Interest Survey for Multimedia survey (n=18).The study revealed a marked preference for the genAI-enhanced CCNs over traditional teaching methods. Key findings include the majority of surveyed students preferring the CCN over traditional clinical cases (14/18), as well as high average scores for triggered situational interest (mean 4.58, SD 0.53), maintained interest (mean 4.40, SD 0.53), maintained-feeling interest (mean 4.38, SD 0.51), and maintained-value interest (mean 4.42, SD 0.54). Students achieved an average score of 88% on examination questions related to the CCN material, indicating successful learning and retention. Qualitative feedback highlighted increased engagement, improved recall, and appreciation for the narrative style and pop culture references.

    "Abstract": "The increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus worldwide necessitates that medical undergraduates acquire a deep understanding of the disease to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective management. Traditional teaching methods, while foundational, often lack the interactive elements that enhance student engagement and knowledge retention. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel educational board game, \"Diabe-teach,\" in enhancing knowledge retention among medical students compared with conventional self-study methods. A randomized controlled design involving 56 preclinical medical students at Dubai Medical College for Girls was used. The participants were randomly assigned to either the game-based learning group or the control group, with both groups receiving identical instructional materials on diabetes. Knowledge retention was assessed via pre- and post-test scores, whereas student engagement and perceptions were measured via a feedback survey. The results indicated that while both groups showed significant improvement in post-test scores (p < .001), the game-based group demonstrated a notably greater frequency of correct responses and a greater tendency to recognize knowledge gaps, as evidenced by the increased \"I do not know\" responses compared with incorrect guesses in the control group. Feedback from the game-based learning group highlighted enhanced confidence, improved communication skills, and a preference for the gamified approach over traditional methods. The findings suggest that the \"Diabe-teach\" board game is an effective tool for teaching complex medical concepts, fostering both knowledge retention and critical self-assessment among students. These results contribute to the growing body of literature on game-based learning, supporting its potential as a valuable adjunct to traditional medical education methods. Further research could explore the application of this approach across other medical disciplines.The increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus worldwide necessitates that medical undergraduates acquire a deep understanding of the disease to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective management.

    "Abstract": "Background: Unhoused and vulnerable women face substantial barriers to comprehensive sexual health education, contributing to unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and poor reproductive outcomes. Unstable housing, limited access to care, stigma, and trauma exacerbate these disparities and underscore the need for targeted, evidence-based interventions. Purpose: This quality improvement project evaluated the effectiveness of a single, structured reproductive health education workshop in improving knowledge and confidence/self-efficacy among unhoused and vulnerable women residing at Phoenix Rescue Mission. Methods: Outcomes were assessed using the Reproductive Knowledge & Confidence Survey (RKCS), created for this project by combining items from the Reproductive Health Knowledge Index (RHKI) and the Sexual Communication Self-Efficacy Scale (SCSES). The RKCS included 8 multiple-choice knowledge items (score range 0–8) and 5 Likert confidence items (score range 5–25). Paired-samples t-tests (non-parametric equivalents as needed) compared pre- and post- workshop scores. Results: Across three workshops (N = 29), knowledge increased modestly but did not reach statistical significance. Confidence/self-efficacy improved consistently, with significant gains in Workshop 1 (p = .04) and Workshop 3 (p = .02) and a strong positive trend in Workshop 2 (p = .066). Qualitative feedback was strongly favorable; participants valued clear reproductive health information, condom demonstrations, and a supportive, stigma-free environment, while suggesting more interactive activities and refreshments. Conclusions: This brief, nurse-led, community-based educational intervention meaningfully improved participants’ confidence/self-efficacy and modestly increased knowledge. Confidence gains are clinically significant given their association with protective behaviors (e.g., condom use, timely care-seeking). Findings support the feasibility of low-cost, replicable, nurse-delivered workshops in shelter settings and suggest potential added benefit from multi-session or reinforced formats to strengthen knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objectives The aim of this systematic work is a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (SWOT) analysis to select suitable medicinal plants for cultivation in the region of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany. Methods A systematic SWOT analysis, based on expert assesments and literature research, was performed considering factors like market demand, cultivation conditions, and potential economic benefits. Results Medicinal plants have been essential for producing compounds with significant health benefits. However, unsuitable harvesting practices threaten plant species and traditional communities due to loss of knowledge and culture. In response, sustainable cultivation is gaining attention as alternative to wild collection, ensuring both biodiversity conversation and integrity of medicinal products. Three plants – Arnica montana L., Hydrastis canadensis L., and Rheum rhaponticum L. – were identified as particularly suitable due to their high demand and feasibility of their cultivation under local conditions. Conversely, six other plants were deemed less viable due to various challenges, including market competition and harvesting difficulties. Conclusions This publication emphasizes the importance of comprehensive planning and analysis in transitioning from wild collection to sustainable cultivation of medicinal plants, highlighting the potential benefits for regional agriculture, conservation efforts, and the pharmaceutical industry. BIOPRO Baden-Württemberg GmbH promotes this approach by fostering a bioeconomy centred on cultivating high-value medicinal plants in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional herbal medicine remains a vital component of healthcare across Africa, deeply rooted in indigenous cultural beliefs and practices. This systematic review employs the PRISMA framework to analyse regulatory frameworks, cultural significance, and practical challenges related to herbal medicine use in multiple African countries. Findings reveal that nations such as Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda have made notable progress in establishing regulatory agencies and legislative oversight, while others, including Ethiopia, exhibit weaker governance structures. The study highlights the critical role of cultural embeddedness, with traditional medicine addressing holistic health dimensions often absent in biomedical approaches. Despite the accessibility and affordability of herbal remedies, concerns about dosage inconsistencies, contamination, and lack of standardisation persist. Furthermore, uneven institutionalisation and generational knowledge loss threaten sustainability. The review underscores the need for harmonised regulatory standards, preservation of indigenous knowledge, increased research investment, and strengthened collaboration between traditional healers and biomedical practitioners. These measures are essential to safely integrate traditional medicine into formal healthcare systems and support universal health coverage across Africa.",

    "Abstract": "The inspection of power transmission lines using unmanned aerial vehicles primarily relies on object detection. However, the continuous emergence of new obstacle types necessitates frequent updates to detection models, leading to substantial retraining costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named IViT, which integrates incremental learning with a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture for improved identification. We combined knowledge distillation with the elastic response selection distillation strategy to enhance detection performance for old classes and strengthen knowledge retention through star convolutional residual blocks constructed via element-wise multiplication. We designed a separable convolution aggregation block that integrates PConv with an attention mechanism, effectively merging global and local information to improve detection accuracy. Finally, we unified the two modules into a hybrid block. In the static detection task, IViT achieves a mAP of 55.3%, a mAP 50 of 83.6%, and a mAP 75 of 61.0%. For the incremental detection task, it attains a mAP of 57.8%, a mAP 50 of 79.7%, and a mAP 75 of 62.3%. Extensive experiments on the transmission line corridor external damage dataset and the INSPLAD dataset demonstrate that IViT exhibits outstanding detection performance compared to mainstream static object detection models and incremental object detection models.",

    "Abstract": "During gestation, pregnant ewes are often managed extensively on rangeland that is not sufficient to meet the nutritional needs of the dam and the fetus, causing nutrient restriction. The performance of these offspring in the pre-weaning period has been well studied; however, there is a lack of studies investigating the effects of maternal nutrient restriction on feedlot and carcass performance of wether lambs after weaning. Thus, the objective of the first study was to investigate the post-weaning performance of lambs from ewes restricted from 110 days of gestation (dGA) to parturition at 65% of NRC requirements. Lambs from restricted dams did not differ in bodyweight or growth rate at any point from lambs born from fully nourished dams. Likewise, lambs from restricted dams did not show evidence of altered nutrient utilization during the balance trial, nor did they have any carcass differences from their control counterparts at harvest. This data demonstrates that nutrient restriction at a moderate level when following full nourishment through early and mid-gestation can be overcome without deficit when also born into a nutrient rich environment. While formative assessment is acknowledged as a meaningful teaching strategy to improve student learning and experience, there is a lack of evidence and implementation of it in undergraduate education. Thus, the objective of the second study was to evaluate student information retention coming from a prerequisite course divergent in assessment strategy and/or environment. The prerequisite course, ANEQ 328: Foundations of Animal Genetics, was delivered in person or online and implemented either exam or quiz-based assessments. At the end of each semester, all students received the same post-test. Furthermore, in the quiz-based courses, students were surveyed at the end of the semester to gather perceptions of learning. In the subsequent course, ANEQ 330: Principles of Animal Breeding, the same post-test from ANEQ 328 was given as a pre-test. Student final grade was greater (P < 0.05) in the quiz-based classroom and in the online classroom. Students in the exam-based classroom performed better (P < 0.05) on the post-test in the prerequisite course. There were no differences in pre-test score or retention across the courses. Student perceptions indicated a preference for formative assessment over summative assessment, yet regardless of classroom type, students felt they could keep up with the material and were well prepared for the subsequent course. These data indicate that both assessment strategies are effective when considering impacts on long-term retention; however, survey data showed that formative assessments are better received than summative assessments, as they help to ease testing anxiety, better pace student learning, and provide consistent feedback.

This work addresses this challenge by suggesting an AI-powered Smart Curriculum Mapping system based on integrating AR/VR immersive learning environments with state-of-the-art student behavior analytics. The system collects multimodal information such as gaze movements, gesture, interaction measures, and performance records and utilizes Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) to extract latent cognitive and engagement features from it. These eventually feed into a Deep Q-Network (DQN) based reinforcement learning engine to dynamically optimize learning paths through selection of content modules, interaction modes, and difficulty levels in real time. Adaptive high-fidelity AR/VR interfaces are engineered to change experiential scenarios adaptively to improve engagement and comprehension. Teachers leverage an AI-powered dashboard to observe predictive engagement, cognitive overload, and knowledge retention. The novelty lies in interconnecting DBN-based feature modeling and DQN-based adaptive policy learning with immersive AR/VR technology to achieve highly personalized data-driven education with optimized academic performance and metacognitive development.",

While these chatbots offer accessibility and scalability, many still lack the capacity to personalize interactions based on the learner’s evolving cognitive and emotional state. Current systems often rely on static profiles or shallow adaptation mechanisms that fail to account for real-time fluctuations in confidence, engagement, and comprehension. This paper presents PersonaGPT, a novel personalization engine for educational chatbots that constructs and continuously updates dynamic learner personas using behavioral signals, linguistic cues, and meta-dialogue patterns. The system integrates these personas into a reflexive dialogue engine, enabling the chatbot to adapt its tone, explanation depth, and instructional strategy in real time. PersonaGPT was implemented as a modular, web-based tutoring system using GPT-4, a Flask backend, and React.js interface, designed to teach SQL programming. In a controlled experiment with 81 university students, PersonaGPT significantly outperformed static and non-personalized chatbots in task completion, knowledge retention, and learner engagement. The study demonstrates that real-time persona modeling and reflexive dialogue enhance both the effectiveness and user experience of AI-powered education.",

Traditional teaching methods, relying on textbooks and instructor-led lectures, often lack interactivity and adaptability, limiting engagement and comprehension in complex subjects such as hydrogen production, storage, and fuel cell technologies. The problem lies in the absence of intelligent educational tools capable of delivering personalized, digital learning experiences that address diverse learner needs while ensuring conceptual clarity. To address this gap, the paper propose the AI-Enabled Virtual Assistant for Digital Hydrogen Energy Systems Education (AIVA-BHESE) framework, which integrates natural language processing, machine translation, and adaptive dialogue management to provide interactive guidance, realtime feedback, and digital explanations in English and a target second language. AIVA-BHESE supports contextualized learning, answers domain-specific queries, and adapts its instructional approach based on learner responses. Experimental evaluation conducted with hydrogen energy educational modules demonstrated that AIVABHESE improved learner engagement by 32 %, enhanced knowledge retention by 27 %, and reduced misunderstanding rates in digital content by 24 %, compared to conventional instruction. These results suggest that AI-enabled virtual assistants can significantly augment hydrogen energy education by providing adaptive, interactive, and digital support. In conclusion, the AIVA-BHESE framework offers a scalable, intelligent solution for enhancing accessibility, comprehension, and engagement in digital hydrogen energy systems education, bridging the gap between advanced energy technologies and diverse learner populations.",

However, the rapid growth of PLC-based instructional materials often varies widely in style, complexity, and pedagogy, creating inconsistencies that hinder student engagement, knowledge retention, and adaptability across diverse learning environments. Traditional curriculum designs rarely account for stylistic alignment between instructional text and learner needs, limiting the effectiveness of teaching PLC logic and programming structures. To address this problem, the paper propose an AI-Driven Stylistic Profiling and Adaptation Model (AISPAM), which combines natural language processing (NLP), transformer-based text representation, and unsupervised clustering to analyze and adapt PLC programming content according to stylistic markers such as technical density, instructional clarity, cognitive load, and domain-specific readability. AISPAM classifies content into pedagogical clusters, aligning instructional material style with targeted learner categories ranging from novice technicians to advanced engineering students. Experimental validation on a curated dataset of PLC programming manuals, learning modules, and industrial training documents demonstrated that AISPAM achieved over 87 % accuracy in stylistic clustering, while adaptive transformation improved student comprehension scores by 22 % in test scenarios. These findings confirm that AI-based stylistic analysis can effectively bridge the gap between technical rigor and adaptive pedagogy, providing a robust framework for developing dynamic, learner-centered curricula in automation education. The work highlights future potential for integrating stylistic adaptability into smart industrial training platforms and intelligent tutoring systems for lifelong learning.",

These issues become especially severe when vehicles possess varying sensing capabilities, computational resources, and domain expertise, leading to fragmented learning and unstable knowledge retention over time. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-level game-theoretic approach. We first formulate a new metric, Utility-of-Information (UoI), to characterize the features of knowledge learning, retention, and consolidation. Based on this metric, we design a game-theoretic dual-level approach, which comprises a lower-level coalition formation game where vehicles self-organize into “teacher-student” coalitions based on their UoI profiles, and an upper-level UAV resource allocation game where vehicle coalitions compete for limited communication resources. To optimize both levels of the game, we design a unified reinforcement learning-based framework that enables adaptive searching for optimization under dynamic network conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses knowledge diversity and significantly mitigates the effects of knowledge forgetting in UAV-assisted heterogeneous vehicle networks.",

A gamified examination platform was developed to improve engagement and personalize ITIL learning for working professionals. Thirty participants aged 20–60, representing diverse IT roles, took part in the pilot. The system applied adaptive, data-driven feedback to simulate machine learning–based personalization, increasing motivation and knowledge retention. Results demonstrate that combining gamification with adaptive instructional design forms an effective hybrid model for heterogeneous learners. The paper further examines how emerging telecommunication technologies (5G, edge computing, and satellite networks) enable scalable, low-latency deployment of gamified learning platforms. These technologies allow continuous, mobile, and high-quality learning experiences across distributed professional environments. The findings highlight the convergence of educational innovation and telecom infrastructure as a pathway to scalable, data-driven, and lifelong learning in IT service delivery.",

Traditional history education in Japan has focused heavily on memorizing dates and events, failing to adequately engage students' interest and curiosity. To address this issue, we aim to create more effective historical learning experiences by combining VR's immersive capabilities with the storytelling techniques of visual novels. Specifically, we developed VRVN content about the Second Choshu expedition using Unity with C# and implemented it on the Meta Quest 3 platform. We conducted evaluation experiments with 13 university students, assessing historical knowledge retention through pre- and post-tests and verifying system effectiveness through subjective evaluations. The experimental results confirmed significant effects on historical knowledge retention, particularly in understanding complex historical contexts. Additionally, the immersive VR experience promoted understanding of historical events with a real sense of presence. Furthermore, the system was effective in improving learning motivation, with many participants responding that they “wanted to learn more in detail,” successfully inspiring continued learning interest.",

    "Abstract": "This postgraduate thesis focuses on the design and development of a digital board game titled Masters of Printing, intended to support the teaching of the subject “Printing Technology” taught in Vocational High Schools (EPAL) in Greece, specifically within the Graphic Arts specialization. The course covers the main printing methods and is considered particularly demanding due to its technical content and extensive curriculum. The game was conceived as an innovative educational tool, incorporating augmented reality (AR) and other digital technologies, aiming to enhance student engagement, understanding, and knowledge retention. The thesis presents a detailed account of the game development process, based on the GGJ Next methodology, including well-defined educational objectives, narrative structure, rules, visual design, and the creation of digital educational content organized by topic. Special emphasis was placed on aligning the game with the official curriculum, the approved textbook, and the questions from the National Question Bank, ensuring its pedagogical coherence. The effectiveness of the game was evaluated through prototyping, playtesting, rubrics, and feedback collected from both teachers and students. The findings highlighted the game’s high educational value, its positive reception by students, and its potential to enrich the teaching and learning experience. The thesis concludes with suggestions for future improvements and emphasizes the importance of integrating game-based and augmented reality technologies into educational practice, particularly in technical and vocational subjects.",

    "Abstract": "This dissertation investigates the role of Wikipedia’s infobox in supporting user comprehension and satisfaction during health information seeking. While infoboxes are widely used across Wikipedia to provide summaries of key article content, research on their actual effectiveness remains limited. The main objectives of this study were to analyze whether the presence of an infobox influences navigation time in goal oriented searching, knowledge acquisition, perceived article usefulness, and task satisfaction, and whether specific structural elements of the infobox impact these outcomes. To address these objectives, an eye-tracking study was conducted with 24 participants tasked with navigating four distinct health-related Wikipedia articles, presented either with or without an infobox, in order to determine the concrete effects if its presence. Participants completed knowledge assessment questionnaires before and after each task, and provided ratings of article helpfulness and task satisfaction. Statistical analysis revealed that in cases where the infobox was present, task completion time was significantly reduced and both user satisfaction and article helpfulness ratings were consistently higher. However, no significant impact was observed in knowledge retention, suggesting that infoboxes support quick reference rather than deep learning. Regarding the impact of the level of attention in trials with an infobox, no statistically significant patterns were identified. Additional correlation analysis within the infobox condition showed no consistent relationship between engagement with individual infobox components and performance or satisfaction metrics, except for a negative correlation between fixations on the infobox image and article helpfulness ratings. These findings contribute to the understanding of information structure in web-based environments and highlight the importance of infoboxes in enhancing user experience, while also identifying limitations in their impact on learning outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Tacit knowledge retention practice is vital to organizational success globally, regionally and locally. It enhances institutional memory, improves problem solving, initiates innovation, collaboration leading to teamwork, and long-term adaptability. Since tacit knowledge is shared through mentorship, observation, storytelling, socialization and forums, then it should be strategically captured before employees exit with their expertise. Against this background, the study on knowledge management practices’ influences on tacit knowledge retention in the Department of Immigration and Citizen Services, Nairobi City County was done. The study focused on knowledge capture and incentives and reward structures. It was anchored on the SECI model and employed a mixed-method approach using an explanatory research design. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from a target population of 504 staff across Human Resource, Library and Registry sections. Stratified, simple random, and purposive sampling techniques were applied, with a 30% sample yielding 152 respondents and six interviewees. Data collection tools included questionnaires and face-to-face interviews. The findings revealed that tacit knowledge capture (72.7%) and incentive and reward use (73%) were main activities practiced to retain tacit knowledge in the department of Immigration. The study concluded that strong knowledge capture systems, effective HR strategies, and well-designed incentive structures significantly promote tacit knowledge retention, though weaknesses in knowledge-sharing mechanisms remain. It recommended strengthening capture methods, adopting robust incentive programs and fostering a strong knowledge-sharing culture to improve tacit knowledge retention within the department of Immigration and Citizen Services Nairobi City County.",

This paper presents ‘Stinger’, a 3D asymmetric multiplayer serious game to address dengue awareness gaps in rural Bangladesh through culturally relevant gameplay. The game has interactive mechanics that simulate real-world dengue transmission dynamics, teach players to identify and eliminate mosquito breeding sites and adopt preventive behaviors. Setting in a rural Bangladeshi environment, the game has multiplayer functionality to model community-level disease spread and collective prevention strategies. Early results show significant knowledge retention and behavior adoption among players, so game-based learning works for public health education. The game provides a framework for developing culturally adapted serious games to bridge the gap between awareness and action in disease prevention.",

    "Abstract": "The yellow-legged hornet ( Vespa velutina ) is an invasive predator that poses a significant threat to native biodiversity and apiculture in Europe. Early detection and rapid response are crucial to prevent its establishment and further spread. In this study, we tested the potential of using elementary school pupils as active contributors to V. velutina surveillance through a targeted educational program. A total of 358 pupils (aged 10–11 years) participated in a program that included information on V. velutina biology, its ecological and economic impacts, and key identification features, supported by practical demonstrations using real specimens. Knowledge of fundamentals of V. velutina biology and identification skills were assessed using pre-tests, post-tests one week after the program, and follow-up tests after 2–3 months. The results showed a significant improvement in both knowledge scores and identification accuracy, with knowledge retention confirmed several months later. In a practical verification experiment six months after the program, dead V. velutina individuals were placed in classrooms on the windowsill; and their presence was successfully reported in 64.3% of the cases. Control of the verification experiment, by placing dead V. crabro individuals into the classrooms, resulted in no false reports of invasive species. These findings demonstrate that educational programs can be a simple, cost-effective tool for increasing public engagement in invasive species monitoring, significantly improving early detection capacity. Implementing such programs, particularly in regions at risk of invasion, could greatly enhance management strategies and reduce socio-economic and ecological impacts.",

    "Abstract": "In the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose major challenges due to their stealthy and adaptive behavior. Traditional detection methods based on signatures or heuristics are limited in identifying novel and evolving attacks, while static deep learning models suffer from concept drift and catastrophic forgetting, leading to degraded performance over time. This paper proposes an adaptive APT detection framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with rehearsal-based continual learning using telemetry data from Wazuh, an open-source Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platform. Endpoint telemetry is represented as graphs where nodes denote system components and edges describe behavioral interactions among them. Experimental evaluations on real-world Wazuh telemetry augmented with sandbox-executed APT scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently achieves F1-scores above 0.98, outperforming static and fine-tuned baselines in both adaptability and knowledge retention. These results confirm that combining graph-based representations with continual learning offers a scalable, interpretable, and resilient solution for modern SOC and EDR environments facing advanced and evolving cyber threats.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 27th International Conference on Business Informatics (CBI) Conference Start Date: 2025 Sept. 9 Conference End Date: 2025 Sept. 12 Conference Location: Lisbon, Portugal The continuous evolution of information technologies has long driven business transformation, a trend reinforced by the paradigm shift introduced by cloud computing. In particular, the ability to combine services from multiple cloud providers offers organizations unprecedented scalability, flexibility, and resilience, becoming a catalyst for innovation. However, despite these advantages, organizations face significant challenges in designing cloud architectures that align with multicloud strategies, often resulting in vendor lock-in. In response, we propose a provider-agnostic, function-based solution to model cloud architectures within Enterprise Architecture using the ArchiMate language. Emphasizing modularity and neutrality, the solution abstracts 148 core functionalities from five leading public cloud providers, grouped into three fundamental IT domains: Networking, Compute, and Data. The applicability of the solution was demonstrated through five distinct scenarios, with qualitative and quantitative evaluations conducted on them. The results indicate that this solution effectively reduces vendor lock-in by supporting cross-provider compatibility. It also enhances architectural clarity, simplifies management, and fosters knowledge retention through reusable components, strengthening an organization's ability to manage multicloud and hybrid environments more efficiently.",

    "Abstract": "This paper aims to investigate whether embedding mathematical problems in cultural tours around cities can effectively increase student engagement, enhance knowledge retention, and promote inclusivity among students with varying abilities. First, we present the content development process and then the evaluation process with the participation of 78 high school students and six teachers. Quantitative data were collected through pre- and post-tour questionnaires, while qualitative data were gathered through teacher interviews to evaluate engagement, knowledge acquisition, and inclusivity. The results indicate that the pedagogical tours significantly enhance student engagement and foster collaboration among students of different abilities. This study contributes to the development of innovative pedagogical approaches by integrating storytelling, gamification elements, and real-world contexts to make mathematics learning more engaging.",

    "Abstract": "Higher education institutions face a risk of knowledge loss when they fail to implement strategies for transferring knowledge from experienced to less experienced employees. Canadian higher education managers are particularly concerned about the adverse impact of losing explicit and valuable tacit knowledge. Grounded in the socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization model, this qualitative pragmatic inquiry study identified and explored successful strategies employed by eight Canadian higher education managers to capture and transfer knowledge from experienced employees, thereby sustaining performance. Data were collected through semistructured interviews and a review of public documents, including strategic plans, annual reports, and accountability statements. Through thematic analysis, three themes were identified that could assist higher education institutions with knowledge transfer, including implementation of (a) a knowledge-sharing culture, (b) mentoring and coaching, and (c) technology adoption. A key recommendation is for higher education managers to integrate formal, structured knowledge management processes with people-centric social learning methods, such as mentorship, to effectively capture explicit and tacit knowledge. The implication for positive social change may include the professional development of individuals and the reduction of knowledge gaps while ensuring business continuity within the community.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose – The primary purpose of this study is to explore and critically evaluate existing research on the application of gamification in employee training and development. By synthesising current empirical and theoretical evidence, the review seeks to understand how gamification influences learner motivation, engagement, knowledge retention and overall organisational performance. Design/methodology/approach – A systematic methodological review was conducted, drawing on 49 empirical studies published between 2014 and 2024, supplemented by 19 foundational works for theoretical grounding. Searches were carried out in Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar using structured keywords. Inclusion criteria required a workplace focus, empirical methodology and relevance to employee training or development. This study contributes original value to the growing body of literature on gamification by offering a comprehensive synthesis of current research on its application within employee training and development. While gamification has been widely examined in educational and consumer contexts, its integration into corporate learning and human resource development remains comparatively underexplored and fragmented.

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 3rd International Conference on Cyber Resilience (ICCR) Conference Start Date: 2025 July 3 Conference End Date: 2025 July 4 Conference Location: Dubai, United Arab Emirates The United Kingdom (UK) faces a significant cybersecurity skills shortage, with approximately 44% of businesses experiencing basic cybersecurity skills gaps, and incident management skills gaps increasing from 27% in 2020 to 48% in 2024. Traditional cybersecurity training methods often fail to engage learners effectively or provide adequate assessment of knowledge retention. This paper presents a novel framework combining gamified cybersecurity training with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven learning analytics specifically designed for UK Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programs.This approach utilizes behavioural science principles together with machine learning algorithms and incorporates real-time performance tracking, predictive modelling, and automated content adaptation based on individual learning patterns to create personalized, adaptive learning experiences. This optimizes both engagement and improves cybersecurity competencies. The effectiveness of this approach is highlighted through case studies of UK-based implementations, including the Cyber Explorers program and Gamified Intelligent Cyber Behaviour Assessment and Skills Training (GICAST) initiative. These case studies demonstrate significant improvements in learner engagement and knowledge retention as well as skills application, through data such as 60% boost in learner engagement by gamified training and 77% improvement in concept understanding from GICAST. Moving beyond conventional compliance-based training to establish interactive, data-driven experiences, the proposed framework addresses the key challenges in cybersecurity education and fosters long-term behavioural change. Results of AI-enhanced gamification show its ability to effectively bridge the cybersecurity skills gap while providing data-driven insights to educators for continuous program improvement.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 11th International Conference on Education and Technology (ICET) Conference Start Date: 2025 Sept. 9 Conference End Date: 2025 Sept. 9 Conference Location: Malang, Indonesia Fire emergencies pose a significant threat to public safety, potentially resulting in severe injuries, fatalities, and property damage. While fire evacuation training is crucial, traditional methods such as instructional videos and static drills frequently lack the immersive experience needed to effectively prepare individuals for a real-world emergency. This research explores the development of a game-based fire evacuation training simulation using desktop platforms—aiming to enhance both knowledge retention and user engagement. The simulation replicates the layout of BINUS Kemanggisan’s Anggrek Campus and integrates interactive features such as alarm systems, fire extinguishers, and scenario-based challenges to provide a hands-on learning environment. The training emphasizes realism and accessibility, using Blender for asset creation and Unity for game development. A user study involving 30 university students was conducted using pre-test and post-test questionnaires to evaluate the training’s effectiveness. The results were analyzed with the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, revealing a statistically significant improvement in post-test scores (z = 4.378, p < .001, r = 0.62). The findings indicate that serious games can effectively bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical emergency response, offering a viable alternative to conventional fire evacuation training methods",

    "Abstract": "Background: Medical education continues to favor didactic lectures as the predominant method of instruction. However, in recent years, there has been a shift toward active learning methodologies such as gamification. Objective: This study aimed to describe the implementation of 3 open-access, web-based pharmacology games tailored for medical students: Cross DRUGs , Find the DRUG , and DRUGs Escape Room . The study also evaluated the impact of gamification on knowledge retention, student engagement, and learning experience in pharmacology education. Methods: We used a quasi-experimental design to examine the effects of gamification on knowledge retention by comparing pretest and posttest scores between the gamer and control groups. Each week, students self-selected into either the gamer group or the control group based on personal preference. All students were provided with online access to the same lecture slides. Students in the control group completed both the pretest and posttest but did not play any of the games. A survey was administered to assess students’ perceptions of gamification as a learning tool. Results: Of the 72 students enrolled in the course, 49 (68%) agreed to participate, with 40 (56%) students completing both the pretest and posttest and being included in our analysis. As participation could vary weekly, an individual student might have appeared in both groups across different weeks, resulting in 59 gamer sessions and 20 control sessions. The mean pretest scores were 6.05 (SD 2.31) for the control group and 6.20 (SD 2.13) for the gamer group. The mean posttest scores were 6.90 (SD 2.02) for the control group and 8.47 (SD 1.30) for the gamer group. The gamer group exhibited significantly improved posttest scores ( P =.006), while the control group did not ( P =.21). Most respondents (25/30, 83%) found the games enjoyable and agreed that the games effectively helped them understand pharmacological concepts (24/30, 80%). Additionally, 70% (21/30) of students believed they learned better from the gaming format than from didactic lectures. Most favored a blended approach that combines lectures with games or case studies. Conclusions: Gamification can serve as an effective complementary teaching tool for helping medical students learn pharmacological concepts.",

Introduction Game-based learning in medical education has emerged as a preferred format for learning complicated topics. At our institution, infectious diseases has been found to be a challenging topic for learners, making it important to find an engaging method to teach this topic. We designed a gamified approach to teach infectious disease management and antimicrobial stewardship for internal medicine resident education.In our gamified learning session, participants played a 60-120-minute game with the goal of treating various pathogens. Participants earned Antimicrobial cards, representing common antimicrobial treatments, by correctly answering challenging infectious disease questions, and then matched the Antimicrobial cards to Pathogen cards, to select appropriate treatments for each infectious disease pathogen or organism while also learning about antimicrobial stewardship. Participants completed a postgame assessment using a Likert scale to gauge satisfaction. Knowledge retention was assessed by a pre- and postgame five-question test.

    "Abstract": "The American church’s identity — and the identity of the one whose lordship it proclaims — has been thoroughly “mispoliticized” over the course of history. This has resulted in an ethically-contrarian ecclesial mutation with no defensible grounding in the biblical witness. As such, the key question this research seeks to answer is a functional one: How do we reestablish the church’s authentic theo-ethical vocation? I contend below that a tripartite method of homiletical, pedagogical, and locational engagement with histories of oppression serves as an effective method of restoring this sense of moral vocation in the Christian life. Following chapters on history (ch. 1), theology (ch. 2), and praxis (ch. 3), I present a case study of the above-mentioned three-part method carried out at The Well United Methodist Church in St. Charles, MO (ch. 4). I took a group of sixteen volunteer research participants through a series of sermons, small group discussions, and on-site immersions based on events of racial oppression in the greater St. Louis area. Quantitative data was collected according to two pre- and post-research surveys: one of my own design gauging knowledge retention and theological formation, and the other being an adaptation of Oskari Lahtinen’s “Critical Social Justice Attitudes Scale” assessment. Qualitative data was collected via field observation and participant interviews. This project concludes (ch. 5) with recommendations for further utilization and replication of this ecclesial method in other broader contexts.",

Among them, Virtual Reality (VR) - based learning systems have been one of the most interactive and attractive learning methodologies for students. Yet, most had the limitation of trying to cater for individual learners profiles but struggling to some degree to do that. In here, the authors propose a new framework by fusing Big Data Analytics and VRLS, thus allowing for the dynamical adaption of the course material following the real-time assessment of the student progress and behavior. Our proposed framework integrates these captured data as well as real-time data obtained from student interactions in the VR environment such as duration, errors, eye gaze, body posture and frequency of interaction. This data is analyzed using sophisticated analytics pipelines such as predictive modelling, clustering and deep learning-based behavior interpretation to form individual learner profiles. These profiles drive adaptive delivery of the course content, so that each student gets a customized learning experience that gets updated as they make progress and master skills. The system also incorporates a feedback-based reinforcement module to take into account recalibration of difficulty levels, learning tempos and types of resources (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) according to cognitive load and the participant engagement. Experimental testing on a pilot pool of secondary science students showed increased knowledge retention (24% increase), and satisfaction of learning (31% better) and decreased time completion (18%) when compared to non-adaptive VR platforms. This study shows that big data analysis can be merged into immersive learning to come up with an intelligent student-center teaching framework. The proposed system satisfies not only the drawbacks of one-size-fits-all teaching models, but it also offers insights for teachers/institutions with the help of rich analytic dashboards. Finally, this work is one step towards the advancement of the next generation educational technologies that are based on personalization, adaptability and learnability that can be measured.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 IEEE Digital Education and MOOCS Conference (DEMOcon) Conference Start Date: 2025 Oct. 5 Conference End Date: 2025 Oct. 7 Conference Location: Boca Raton, FL, USA Integrating AI-enabled avatars within Virtual Reality (VR) environments offers new possibilities for enhancing learning experiences across disciplines. This paper presents two case studies at a business-focused university that evaluate the potential of this technology to transform traditional pedagogical approaches.The first case study examines the use of VR in a Cyber Psychology course. Students participate in role-play scenarios involving real-world scenarios to improve their communication skills. Students were engaging in a debate with an AI-enabled avatar in a safe, controlled VR environment. At the end of their interaction, they receive feedback from the AI that analyzed their debating skills, such as including the avatar’s arguments and expanding their own arguments with examples. This case demonstrates how AI has the potential to offer unique immersive learning environments for developing students’ debating skills.The second case study focuses on the proposed strategy of a redesigned Italian course for business students, where VR technology is used to develop professional manners and workplace etiquette. Students engage in AI-enabled conversational simulations to practice interview skills, to enhance formal language use, and cultural awareness. Integrating AI prompts and evaluation criteria ensures a structured and immersive learning experience. This case illustrates the potential of AI to personalize language learning and provide authentic practice.Both case studies demonstrate the potential of engaging withAI-enabled avatars in VR to create immersive, interactive, and personalized learning experiences. While this paper focuses on the design of these virtual environments, future studies will examine how this technology can improve engagement, enhance knowledge retention, and provide unique opportunities for skills development for learners.",

    "Abstract": "High staff turnover presents a persistent challenge in the software development industry, often resulting in low productivity, loss of knowledge, and disruption of workflows. This issue becomes even more critical in settings with professional training programs for students. This paper proposes a structured self-mentoring model to mitigate the negative effects of high turnover, wherein experienced interns guide new interns, ensuring knowledge transfer and workflow stability. The approach was implemented over five internship cycles, combining the ISO/IEC 29110 standard with agile methods to support continuous development, maintain project continuity, and foster growth in both technical and soft skills. The results of project data analysis across cycles indicate improvements in productivity, quality, and participation, accompanied by a significant reduction in rework during peak performance cycles. This model demonstrates that even in high-turnover environments, structured practices can sustain quality software development while enriching students' learning experiences.

Problema que se agrava aún más en entornos con programas de formación profesional para estudiantes. Este documento propone un modelo estructurado de auto tutoría para mitigar los efectos negativos de la alta rotación, en el que los pasantes con experiencia guían a los nuevos pasantes, garantizando la transferencia de conocimientos y la estabilidad del flujo de trabajo. El enfoque se implementó a lo largo de cinco ciclos de prácticas, combinando la norma ISO/IEC 29110 con métodos ágiles para apoyar el desarrollo continuo, mantener la continuidad del proyecto y fomentar el desarrollo de habilidades técnicas y personales. Los resultados del análisis de datos del proyecto a lo largo de los ciclos indican mejoras en la productividad, calidad y participación, acompañados de una reducción significativa de la repetición del trabajo durante los ciclos de máximo rendimiento. Este modelo demuestra que, incluso en entornos de alta rotación, las prácticas estructuradas pueden sustentar un desarrollo de software de calidad, a la vez que enriquecen las experiencias de aprendizaje de los estudiantes.

    "Abstract": "Formal postgraduate clinical pharmacy education is relatively common but underexplored in the literature, particularly in clinical decision-making and learning from errors – a source of anxiety and stress for pharmacists. Research shows interactive fiction (IF) has been beneficial to help undergraduate pharmacy students learn from their errors and gain confidence in their decisionmaking whilst developing their clinical knowledge. Its use at the postgraduate level however remains unexplored. This study explores how postgraduate distance-learning (DL) pharmacy students engage with IF as a pedagogical tool to learn from failure within their academic studies, as well as on the impact on their usual professional practice. Using Green and Jenkins' (2014) conceptual model of interactivity effects in interactive fiction, this research investigates how students' dual identities as learners and professionals shape their interactions with IF for their own academic and professional development. Anonymous online questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used to gather quantitative and qualitative data in this mixed methods study. Participants were required to play through an IF story simulating a clinical scenario, making both sound and unsound choices in multiple playthroughs to explore the impact of error and failure. Findings suggest IF may be an enjoyable way to enhance clinical decision-making, knowledge retention, learning engagement, and confidence. Unlike undergraduate studies on IF, participants were able to draw on real world experiences and connections to practice which appears to have increased learning impact. Participants found the IF valuable overall, and noted that it encouraged reflection and changes in processes for some participants. Emotional responses to poor decisions did not reduce engagement but appeared to facilitate deeper reflection. This may have implications for long-term knowledge retention and enhanced decision-making. Whilst some found the IF timeconsuming, all participants stated they would welcome more IF within their course, particularly in complex case discussions, ethical decision-making, and for experiencing other clinical specialties and pharmacy sectors. This research highlights IF’s potential use as an educational tool for PG pharmacists, particularly in learning from failure, the development of clinical decision-making skills and simply as a tool to foster engagement. It also contributes to the literature on interactive fiction, postgraduate pharmacy education and on the use of Green and Jenkins' conceptual framework within formal educational contexts. Limitations include a low response rate and a resultant small participant pool, all from one academic institution. Areas for future research include further applications in other healthcare professions, inter- and multi-disciplinary use, in longitudinal knowledge retention, and the use of IF in other subjects within the same context. Furthermore, comparisons of UG and PG engagement may reveal further insights into pharmacy education at both levels.",

    "Abstract": "Vision-based grasping detection is extensively utilized in the field of production and manufacturing, leveraging multisource visual data to generate feature maps and achieve robust autonomous grasps. However, significant challenges remain in effectively integrating multisource visual inputs and overcoming catastrophic forgetting in scenarios that vary with time. To address these issues, this article proposes: 1) a three-branch RGB-D fusion module for cross-modal feature synthesis, integrated into the GR-ConvNet framework to optimize antipodal grasping detection; 2) a composite distillation strategy combining perceptual loss with smooth L1 loss to stabilize knowledge retention across sequential tasks; and 3) a robotic grasping detection system driven by RGB-D sensor integration to facilitate autonomous grasping of objects with diverse shapes. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our methods: 98.9% grasping detection accuracy on the Cornell dataset, 89.12% mean grasp accuracy on the final continual learning task, and 82% grasp success rate in real-world robotic trials. Moreover, ablation experiments conducted on our proposed model and the corresponding continual learning approach demonstrate the effectiveness of the three-branch deep fusion (3-BDF) module and the combined distillation loss. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a perceptual loss approach in RGB-D sensor-driven grasping detection tasks designed for continuously changing scenarios.

While law enforcement continues to intensify efforts against cybercrime, relying solely on punitive measures is insufficient. Enhancing public awareness and promoting preventive education are essential complements. This study introduces a gamified educational game designed to improve users' ability to recognize and respond to online scams. A practical cybersecurity training model using gamification to support scam prevention has been proposed.

    "Abstract": "Introduction: this study examined how information-support resources impact cultural heritage revitalization through traditional sports in physical education, highlighting their cultural value and educational potential when combined with innovative teaching strategies.. Objective: the objective was to evaluate whether the integration of digital learning tools into traditional sports education enhances students’ cultural knowledge, attitudes toward cultural preservation, motivation, engagement, and knowledge retention.. Methodology: A quasi-experimental design was conducted with 60 university students assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received instruction with multimedia, interactive modules, infographics, and virtual content, while the control group followed traditional methods. Data were analyzed using appropriate quantitative and qualitative techniques.. Results: the results indicated significant improvements in the experimental group’s attitudes toward cultural preservation, motivation, engagement, and long-term knowledge retention. however, no significant differences were observed in physical skill acquisition or immediate knowledge gain.. Discussion: The findings support prior research on the effectiveness of multimedia and culturally responsive tools in enhancing learning, while also indicating that physical skills need consistent practice beyond digital support.. Conclusions: it is concluded that information-support resources effectively enrich cultural learning in physical education and should be integrated strategically to complement traditional instructional methods. Alternate abstract: Introdução: o presente estúdio investigou o impacto dos recursos de apoio informativo na revitalização do património cultural através da educação desportiva tradicional em ambientes de educação física. Os desportos tradicionais, um menu marginalizado nos planos do estúdio moderno, representam um valor cultural significativo e um potencial pedagógico relevante quando se apoiam em estratégias de ensino inovador.. Objectivo: o objectivo foi avaliar se a integração de ferramentas digitais de aprendizagem no ensino do desporto tradicional melhorou o conhecimento cultural dos alunos, as suas atitudes para a preservação do património, a motivação, o compromisso e a retenção do conhecimento.. Metodologia: Foi realizado um projeto quase experimental com 60 estudantes universitários atribuídos aos grupos experimentais e de controlo. O grupo experimental recebeu instruções com conteúdos multimédia, módulos interativos, infografias e experiências virtuais, enquanto o grupo de controlo seguiu os métodos tradicionais. Os dados foram analisados ​​utilizando técnicas quantitativas e qualitativas adequadas.. Resultados: os resultados indicam melhores resultados nas atitudes do grupo experimental para a preservação cultural, assim como para a motivação, o compromisso e a retenção do conhecimento a longo prazo. No entanto, não se devem observar diferenças significativas na aquisição de competências físicas ou no conhecimento imediato. Discussão: os hallazgos coincidem com estudos anteriores que suportam a utilização de ferramentas digitais multimédia para melhorar a aprendizagem afetiva e cognitiva. No entanto, também refletimos sobre investigações que sinalizam que as capacidades físicas necessitam de prática constante, mas dependem apenas do apoio tecnológico na aprendizagem. Conclusões: conclui-se que os recursos de apoio informativo enriquecem eficazmente a aprendizagem cultural na educação física e devem ser integrados estrategicamente para complementar os métodos de ensino tradicionais.

    "Abstract": "The growing impacts of climate change on water resources demand innovative monitoring and management strategies. This paper presents SW3T-IoT, an innovative water monitoring system leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to enhance water resource management under dynamic conditions. The system adopts a three-tier architecture—edge, fog, and cloud—integrating a custom-designed LoRa-WDS node optimized for low power consumption and long-term autonomous operation. These nodes collect real-time data on water level, flow, pressure, temperature, and quality from distribution networks and reservoirs. Data are locally processed at the edge, then transferred to the cloud for advanced analysis and visualization. A Geographic Information System (GIS) enhances spatial awareness and decision-making. To ensure adaptability, SW3T-IoT integrates a continual learning (CL) framework for Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) forecasting. The CL mechanism allows models to incrementally update with new environmental data without catastrophic forgetting, maintaining accuracy and robustness as water quality dynamics evolve. A hybrid CNN–BiLSTM–Attention model, reinforced with PER, AER, LwF, and EWC strategies, supports adaptive prediction and knowledge retention. The system delivers intuitive dashboards for engineers and water managers, providing a holistic, scalable, and intelligent solution for sustainable water resource management.",

However, deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when incrementally learning under dynamic industrial conditions, such as varying bearing positions and sensor locations. To address this challenge in domain-incremental learning scenarios, this paper proposes a novel continual learning framework inspired by DER++. The framework integrates a hierarchical 1D-CNN signal processing backbone with a Reservoir Knowledge Base that employs reservoir sampling to maintain a fixed-size, probabilistically representative memory buffer of historical knowledge triplets. A multi-objective loss function is introduced to balance current diagnostic accuracy against historical knowledge retention. Rigorously validated on the CWRU bearing dataset under realistic domain shifts, the method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting, achieving substantially higher accuracy on historical domains (reducing forgetting by 90.96% compared to fine-tuning) while maintaining high performance on new domains.",

    "Abstract": "The study explored how federal employees perceive strategic talent management and succession planning practices during workforce restructuring mandated by executive orders. Guided by Human Capital Theory, the Resource-Based View, and Knowledge Management Theory, the research examined how leadership continuity and institutional knowledge are sustained amid downsizing, along with three sub-questions: succession planning experiences, the influence of leadership development programs, and knowledge retention. Ten mid-level and senior managers from a U.S. federal agency, with tenures ranging from seven to 38 years, who had completed internal or external leadership development programs, participated in semi-structured interviews. A qualitative phenomenological design with thematic analysis was used to interpret their experiences. Convergence emerged around themes of inadequate succession planning, reliance on acting appointments, barriers to knowledge transfer, and heightened employee uncertainty. Divergence centered on perceptions of leadership chaos, transparency, and informal selection processes. While leadership development programs enhanced individual preparedness, organizational constraints, such as hiring freezes and limited mobility, muted the broader impact. Strategic talent management practices were perceived as insufficient for preserving institutional knowledge or ensuring leadership continuity. The study concludes that without integrated succession planning, leadership development, and knowledge management, agencies risk losing knowledge and experiencing diminished mission capability. Implications include the need for formal succession programs, aligning development with advancement pathways, and implementing systematic knowledge transfer strategies to mitigate risks during restructuring.",

Introduction Although cost awareness and advocacy for quality care are core GME competencies, high-value care (HVC) curricula remain limited. Growing evidence shows families increasingly want cost conversations with providers, yet many providers feel ill-equipped. We developed a curriculum to increase pediatric residents' understanding of cost determination and confidence discussing resources with families.Using Kern's six-step approach, we created a two-session curriculum. Session 1 explores how health care charges translate to patient financial responsibility. Session 2 is a simulation in which participants make decisions from the caregiver perspective while incurring costs under randomly assigned insurance plans. Participants completed a postsession survey (session 1) and pre- and postsession evaluations (session 2). We used Wilcoxon signed-rank and chi-square tests to determine significant differences ( p < .05). Methods Using Kern's six-step approach, we created a two-session curriculum. Session 1 explores how health care charges translate to patient financial responsibility. Session 2 is a simulation in which participants make decisions from the caregiver perspective while incurring costs under randomly assigned insurance plans. Participants completed a postsession survey (session 1) and pre- and postsession evaluations (session 2). We used Wilcoxon signed-rank and chi-square tests to determine significant differences (p < .05).Seventy-four residents participated between 2022 and 2024. Most respondents rated each session as useful (≥98%). All reported improved understanding of cost determination after the first session. Simulation participation bolstered confidence in supporting families experiencing financial strain (increasing from 5% to 83%; p < .01). Ninety-six percent found the simulation format enhanced learning, and 87% planned to more frequently discuss costs with patients. Results Seventy-four residents participated between 2022 and 2024. Most respondents rated each session as useful (≥98%). All reported improved understanding of cost determination after the first session. Simulation participation bolstered confidence in supporting families experiencing financial strain (increasing from 5% to 83%; p < .01). Ninety-six percent found the simulation format enhanced learning, and 87% planned to more frequently discuss costs with patients.This curriculum addresses a critical gap in HVC and health systems education by centering the patient's financial experience. The two-session format of a transparent explanation of costs, paired with a simulation experience, improved participants' knowledge, self-efficacy in advocacy, and intent to practice cost-conscious care. Next steps include measuring knowledge retention, and having residents review actual bills issued for their own patients.

Traditional Security Education, Training, and Awareness (SETA) programs often struggle to engage users and drive lasting behavioral change. Gamification-applying game design elements such as incentives, challenges, narratives, and interactivity in non-game contexts-offers a promising alternative. By enhancing cybersecurity learning, gamification can enhance knowledge retention, motivation, and proactive security behaviors. This paper examines cybersecurity awareness and training advancements over the past five years, highlighting effective frameworks, tools, and sector-specific applications. It also identifies critical gaps, such as limited personalization, fragmented evaluation metrics, and inadequate integration with emerging technologies. In conclusion, the study outlines future strategies, such as leveraging artificial intelligence, blockchain, and adaptive feedback mechanisms to advance gamified cybersecurity training and foster stronger human defenses within modern cybersecurity systems.",

    "Abstract": "The Do-Live-Well (DLW) framework was developed by occupational therapists (OTs) to demonstrate how engaging in various activities can impact health and well-being of people. The DLW team has provided education for OTs across the world, and there has been a need for online learning with synchronous features. This study aimed to examine the impact of blended online DLW workshops that combined asynchronous and synchronous educational formats for OTs. We evaluated changes in participants' knowledge of the DLW framework, factors influencing framework adoption in practice, satisfaction with the workshop, and actual use of the framework. Descriptive statistics were used for the continuous variables, and frequencies were used for discrete variables. We then applied one-way repeated ANOVA to examine the changes in knowledge over time. Participants' knowledge levels increased immediately after the workshop (p < 0.001) but decreased after three months (p = 0.003). Their perceived ability to apply the DLW framework in practice increased after the workshop (pre-test, mean = 32.32/60, SD = 6.25; post-test, mean = 44.11/60, SD = 4.76; follow-up, mean = 39/54, SD = 6.97). Participants reported a high level of satisfaction with the workshop (mean = 107/112, SD = 6.24). Blended online workshops can be as effective as asynchronous online and in-person workshops, evidenced by increased knowledge, improved perceived ability to apply the framework in practice, and high scores for participants' satisfaction with the workshops. In future workshops, it will be important to consider how to facilitate knowledge retention and framework application in clinical practice.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid development of Generative Artificial Intelligence in education presents new opportunities but also raises concerns about inequality and the integrity of academic practices. This study explores its impact, trends, and risks in education through an extensive review of existing academic literature. The methodology includes a systematic review conducted via the Scopus platform, incorporating documentary analysis with descriptive statistics, systematic content analysis, and bibliometric analysis of citations, co-citations, and co-words in scientific research on the topic. Network maps were created using VOSviewer, and graphs were produced with Microsoft Excel. Moreover, qualitative content analysis was further deepened using ATLAS.ti, .24. The major findings indicate that generative artificial intelligence, as a set of information-processing tools, has significantly advanced over the past century, especially notable for its ability to process information quickly and adapt to human objectives. Its rapid adaptation is transforming education, particularly by enhancing personalization, improving knowledge retention, and supporting interactive learning environments. However, the use of GenAI also raises ethical and equity concerns, including risks to academic integrity, data privacy, and potential algorithmic bias, alongside challenges in ensuring equitable access and adequate teacher training. The main focus of current applications lies in commercial, collaborative, and natural language strategies, which surpass other uses such as images and videos. GenAI aligns with pedagogical theories that promote student autonomy, active learning, and collaboration, if implemented with clear educational intent. However, since machines lack human social perception, it is necessary to reflect critically on the ethical boundaries and appropriate use of AI in the linguistic and educational domains. Gen AI offers transformative potential for education by enabling personalized and efficient learning; however, addressing associated risks, ethical challenges, and issues of equity is essential to ensure its benefits are realized without compromising academic integrity or exacerbating inequalities.",

    "Abstract": "Although learning approaches are designed to enhance individuals' ability to store and retrieve information, not all of them are considered effective. The goal of the present study was to experimentally compare the test performance as well as the accuracy of metacognitive judgements of a multiple text reading group, rereading group, and single reading group in a one-day vs. one-week delayed test (3 x 2 between subject design). A total of 186 psychology students (M[subscript age] = 20.76) participated in the experiment focused on reading comprehension, accuracy of metacognitive judgments and knowledge retention. Results of the knowledge test indicate that in the one-day delayed test, multiple text reading and rereading yield similar results: both deliver slightly better results than single reading. In the one-week delayed test, though, multiple text reading yields better results than rereading, and both these reading approaches outperform single reading. Moreover, multiple text reading results in fairly robust knowledge retention with only a slight decrease in scores between the one-day delayed and one-week delayed test. Regarding metacognitive monitoring, judgements of learning in the multiple text reading group remained relatively stable after each reading and participants were underconfident about their knowledge. In the rereading group, judgements of learning increased after each reading and participants were overconfident about their knowledge, especially on the one-day delayed test. These findings have implications for educational practices aimed at enhancing learning outcomes and promoting effective learning.",

    "Abstract": "This study explored the experiences of novice counselors from online clinical mental health counseling programs when applying social justice concepts with clients. The rationale of this generic qualitative study was to gain insight into novice counselors’ social justice experiences. Additionally, it aimed to understand whether they are socially justice-oriented in counseling and advocating for marginalized and oppressed groups facing societal challenges. The theoretical framework used for this study was Albert Bandura’s social learning theory to understand individuals’ perceptions of how they observe and imitate novice others’ behavior when applying social justice in a clinical setting. The sample consisted of 8 counselors who graduated within the past 5 years from an online Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP)-accredited clinical mental health counseling program and hold a provisional license to practice in their state of residence. Thematic analysis with constant comparison was utilized to analyze the data collected from each participant during the semi-structured interview process. Six main themes emerged from the data regarding novice counselors’ experiences when applying social justice concepts. The six themes included: (a) many clinicians lack knowledge; (b) support from supervisors and other clinicians is essential; (c) post-graduate learning is necessary; (d) hands-on experience increases knowledge, retention, and competency; (e) counselors as advocates; and (f) awareness of privilege, bias, and power disparities. This study effectively answered the research question: “What are the experiences of novice counselors from online clinical mental health counseling programs when applying social justice concepts with clients?” The findings of the study indicate that novice counselors often feel unprepared to implement social justice concepts and require additional training and supervision.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this quality improvement (QI) Doctorate of Nursing (DNP) project was to create and evaluate the impact of high-fidelity simulation-based training (SBT) on graduate nursing students’ knowledge and confidence in diagnosing and treating septic shock. Outcomes were measured with pre- and post-simulation tests featuring competency questions and Likert-scale confidence ratings. Accordingly, the two research questions guiding this project were: (1) How effective is high-fidelity simulation training in improving students’ knowledge and competence in managing septic shock? (2) How effective is high-fidelity simulation training in enhancing students’ confidence when caring for patients with septic shock? Septic shock was selected as the project focus following a needs assessment by the QI manager. Acute care nursing faculty, who also practice as Advanced Practice Nurses (APN), unanimously reported that graduate students and new APNs often struggle to recognize and manage shock. Further review identified septic shock as a leading cause of death; approximately 1.7 million U.S. adults develop sepsis each year, with at least 350,000 dying in the hospital or being discharged to hospice (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2025). Given its high mortality and relevance across all acute care settings, septic shock was chosen as the primary focus. Simulation-based training (SBT) continues to be a focus of nursing education. The landmark 2014 National Simulation Study by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) found that high-quality simulation training can substitute up to 50% of traditional clinical hours in nursing curricula (Alexander et al., 2015, p. 39). Similarly, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) advocated for competency-based education (CBE) in its 2021 and 2024 white papers, emphasizing the role of evolving learning technologies and approaches (American Association of Colleges of Nursing [AACN], 2021, p. 4). These innovative approaches in education may reduce costs, reduce dependance on clinical sites and faculty, and improve educational outcomes, patient care, and student confidence. SBT has also been shown to improve teamwork, enhance communication skills, and foster better clinical decision making (Elendu et al., 2024). Thus, this QI pilot project aimed to create and implement high-fidelity SBT for acute care graduate nursing students to enhance their knowledge, competency, and confidence in diagnosing and managing patients in septic shock. Twenty-three acute care graduate nursing students participated in the created SBT. They were divided into six groups, each consisting of three to four students. All participants took part in the pre-briefing and debriefing sessions and completed both pre- and post-simulation tests which measured knowledge gain and confidence levels. Results revealed that the largest improvements post-simulation occurred in self-reported confidence levels in managing patients with sepsis and septic shock. These results were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) and showed a medium effect size (Cohen’s d ≥ 0.5). Hence, there was a moderate, meaningful improvement in confidence levels post-simulation. In regard to knowledge gain, there were no statistically significant differences seen between the pre and post test scores (p-values > 0.05). All Cohen’s d values were small (≤0.3) hence suggesting minimal changes in knowledge post-simulation. Although the simulation did not result in a measurable improvement in knowledge, it may have helped participants to retain or reinforce their previously acquired knowledge, or at the very least, apply it more effectively in a critical situation. This project did not test for knowledge retention or reinforcement. However, during the debrief, participants mentioned the “realistic, continuous, real-time” complexity of the simulation and “challenges in putting all the clinical pieces together so quickly” which they verbalized would make them “better providers” in the long run.",

This framework accurately depicts learners' knowledge status and responds in real-time through multi-modal fusion evaluation and reinforcement learning-based dynamic decision-making. Controlled experiments involving vocational college students show that the complete personalized system achieves better knowledge retention, slower forgetting, enhanced path sensitivity through a closed-loop mechanism, and higher efficiency in mastering cross-domain skills. Each component of the multi-objective reward function performs optimally under appropriate weight configurations. The research demonstrates that the framework effectively supports sustainable knowledge growth, ensures decision adaptability, and provides a new solution for optimizing personalized learning paths.",

    "Abstract": "While game-based learning is a growing field, city games remain an underresearched area. This study examined a custom-designed city game and the learning outcomes, motivation, and engagement of 49 visiting American university students in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. The game's design was grounded in game-based learning, self-determination theory, and situated cognition, featuring four puzzles designed to activate specific learning mechanisms: a logic puzzle (deductive reasoning), a wordplay puzzle (associative learning), a task-based puzzle (scaffolding), and a rebus puzzle (insight learning). Participants completed a post-survey assessing knowledge retention, motivation, and engagement. Results revealed a positive relationship between motivation and learning outcomes, while the measurement of engagement did not show any relationship with learning. These findings suggest that while city games show potential as educational tools, their effectiveness hinges on designs that successfully foster motivation, as mere engagement with the game environment is not sufficient to ensure learning.",

    "Abstract": "This paper investigates the influence of power dynamics on knowledge-hiding (KH) behaviors in Chinese enterprises. Data were collected through questionnaires from 342 respondents. Structural equational modeling was performed to analyze the relationships among the perceived value of knowledge (PVK), loss of knowledge power (LOKP), and KH. The findings indicate that PVK is positively related to LOKP, and LOKP mediates the relationship between PVK and KH. However, several hypothesized relationships were not supported, highlighting the complexity of the mechanism underlying KH. The findings suggest that while power dynamics influence KH behaviors, their effects may vary across different contexts and conditions. This study enhances the current understanding of knowledge hiding by contextualizing power dynamics in the Chinese context. It offers a nuanced understanding of when and how knowledge power affects employees' willingness to share or withhold knowledge.This paper investigates the influence of power dynamics on knowledge-hiding (KH) behaviors in Chinese enterprises.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of XR technologies on student performance in engineering labs, focusing on skill acquisition, knowledge retention, problem-solving abilities, and engagement levels. Integrating different methods, an experimental study was conducted across multiple engineering disciplines, where students participated in XR-enhanced lab sessions and traditional lab exercises. Data were collected through performance assessments, pre- and post-lab evaluations, and student feedback to evaluate the effectiveness of XR labs. The results were compared with those of traditional methods. XR labs significantly enhanced students' conceptual understanding and practical skills, particularly in areas where physical lab access was limited or complex equipment handling was required. XR labs increased student motivation and reduced performance anxiety by allowing them to practice in a controlled, risk-free environment. However, challenges such as the learning curve associated with XR interfaces and the need for technical support were identified. The results of this study provide basic data to optimize XR implementation in engineering labs and offer recommendations for educators, curriculum designers, and policymakers to maximize the benefits of XR technologies in fostering a dynamic and inclusive engineering education experience.",

Introduction Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly applied in medical education to enhance learning and patient care. Teaching birth mechanics poses particular challenges, as students must understand complex, dynamic, and rotating intrauterine processes that traditional models cannot adequately represent. VR offers immersive, interactive visualization and has shown promise in other fields, but its role in obstetrics remains underexplored. This study evaluated a novel VR module (Virtual Training for Obstetric Birth Simulation, V.T.O.B.S.) for undergraduate obstetrics education.In this single-center study, 46 medical students used V.T.O.B.S. during their obstetrical block internship and were compared with 120 students without VR exposure (non-equivalent intervention group design). The module consisted of a single, self-directed session. Knowledge retention was assessed 11-17 weeks later in a theoretical Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) station consisting mainly of image-based questions on birth mechanics. Secondary outcomes included acceptance, motion sickness, and free-text feedback. Methods In this single-center study, 46 medical students used V.T.O.B.S. during their obstetrical block internship and were compared with 120 students without VR exposure (non-equivalent intervention group design). The module consisted of a single, self-directed session. Knowledge retention was assessed 11-17 weeks later in a theoretical Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) station consisting mainly of image-based questions on birth mechanics. Secondary outcomes included acceptance, motion sickness, and free-text feedback.No significant differences were found in long-term scores of the OSCE study station between VR and control groups. Subgroup analyses showed no consistent effects, except that visual impairment was associated with significantly lower performance (median 13 [IQR 11-15] vs. 14.5 [12-16], p = 0.003). Acceptance of VR was very high (median = 5 [IQR 4-5]), and motion sickness was rare and mild (median = 2 [1-3]). Free-text responses emphasized the innovative nature of the module, immersive 3D visualization, and the value of VR exposure in a university setting. Observed between-group effects were small and below the detectable threshold, suggesting that minor advantages may have remained uncaptured. Results No significant differences were found in long-term scores of the OSCE study station between VR and control groups. Subgroup analyses showed no consistent effects, except that visual impairment was associated with significantly lower performance (median 13 [IQR 11-15] vs. 14.5 [12-16], p = 0.003). Acceptance of VR was very high (median = 5 [IQR 4-5]), and motion sickness was rare and mild (median = 2 [1-3]). Free-text responses emphasized the innovative nature of the module, immersive 3D visualization, and the value of VR exposure in a university setting. Observed between-group effects were small and below the detectable threshold, suggesting that minor advantages may have remained uncaptured.Although no significant knowledge gain was demonstrated, the strong acceptance and usability support the feasibility of VR in undergraduate obstetrics curricula. The absence of measurable effects may relate to the broad learning objective, brief OSCE assessment, single self-directed exposure, and heterogeneous timing between intervention and assessment. V.T.O.B.S. nonetheless represents an innovative educational tool addressing curricular gaps in visualizing dynamic birth mechanics. Future research should explore repeated exposures, assessment formats that directly capture spatial-conceptual understanding, and integration into interprofessional formats for medical and midwifery students as well as postgraduate training. Discussion Although no significant knowledge gain was demonstrated, the strong acceptance and usability support the feasibility of VR in undergraduate obstetrics curricula. The absence of measurable effects may relate to the broad learning objective, brief OSCE assessment, single self-directed exposure, and heterogeneous timing between intervention and assessment. V.T.O.B.S. nonetheless represents an innovative educational tool addressing curricular gaps in visualizing dynamic birth mechanics. Future research should explore repeated exposures, assessment formats that directly capture spatial-conceptual understanding, and integration into interprofessional formats for medical and midwifery students as well as postgraduate training.",

    "Abstract": "XYZ Sdn Bhd, a telecommunications subcontractor in Malaysia, faces challenges such as limited technical expertise and resource constraints in transitioning from 4G to 5G technology. While this shift presents opportunities for innovation, it is hindered by insufficient 5G skills and organizational readiness. Addressing these gaps is essential to enhance technical competencies and sustain competitiveness in a rapidly evolving sector. Despite the critical importance of the 5G transition in Malaysia, limited research focuses on subcontractor firms and their specific skill enhancement strategies. This study aims to identify the organization’s learning needs, enhance employee competencies in 5G technology, and cultivate a culture of continuous learning and knowledge sharing. It differentiates the theoretical roles of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Learning Organization (LO) Theory, and Action Research (AR). TAM explains how employees perceive and adopt 5G tools; LO fosters organizational mechanisms for continuous learning and knowledge retention; and AR provides a structured, iterative framework to diagnose, implement, and evaluate training interventions before and after implementation.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge retention is important for non-governmental organizations due to several factors that contribute to their effectiveness, sustainability, and mission fulfillment. However, non-governmental organizations have been experiencing a challenge in their knowledge retention. This study therefore sought to examine the effect of employee reward systems on knowledge retention within NGOs operating in Nairobi, Kenya. The specific objectives of the study were to establish the effect of monetary rewards, employee development, recognition, and Skill-based reward on knowledge retention among non-governmental organizations in Kenya. The study was anchored on Vroom's expectancy theory, human capital theory, and social exchange theory. The study adopted a descriptive research design. The target population of the study was 636 heads of finance, fundraising and communications, human resource, and programs departments in the 159 NGOs based in Nairobi County. The study used Slovin's Formula in the determination of the sample size. Stratified random sampling was used in the selection of the sample size. The study used primary data, which was collected by use of semi-structured questionnaires. Both quantitative and qualitative data were generated by the questionnaires. The study concluded that Monetary rewards are vital and significantly contribute to increased knowledge retention in NGOs in Nairobi County Kenya. If employees receive monetary rewards in the form of bonuses, compensation for overtime, and competitive salary, then knowledge retention will be maintained.",

    "Abstract": "Continuous assessments encourage sustained learning that contributes to deeper knowledge retention and academic success. Investigating continuous assessments, such as quizzes and tests, is important in predicting final scores because they provide a reliable measure of students’ learning progress across the semester. The present study examined the extent to which quiz scores, and test scores were able to predict final scores in a grammar course using multiple linear regression analysis. Data were collected from 223 first-semester students enrolled in the course. Preliminary analyses confirmed that the assumptions of multiple linear regression were met by looking at linearity, normality, reliability of measurement and homoscedasticity. The results revealed that quiz scores and test scores were positively associated with final scores, indicating that students who performed well in formative and summative assessments were more likely to achieve higher final scores. The results also showed that both quiz scores and test scores significantly predicted final scores with a substantial proportion of variance in students’ final achievement. A regression model was developed using the SPSS software and the formulated model provides useful insights for educators in identifying early indicators of students’ final performance and in designing instructional strategies that support academic achievement, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of instruction.",

    "Abstract": "This study examined the relationships between Guided Discovery Method (GDM) components and knowledge retention among Electrical Installation students in Benue State. The research objectives were to explore the associations between teacher guidance and scaffolding, problem-solving activities, and collaborative learning with students’ knowledge retention. A correlational survey design was employed with 323 valid responses from Electrical Installation students across technical schools in Makurdi Metropolis. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire adapted from validated scales, with Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranging from 0.91 to 0.94, indicating high internal consistency. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression analyses. The results revealed significant positive correlations between all three GDM components and knowledge retention: teacher guidance and scaffolding (r = .691, p < .01), problem-solving activities (r = .688, p < .01), and collaborative learning (r = .678, p < .01). Multiple regression analysis produced an R value of 0.701 and an adjusted R² of 0.485, indicating that these variables jointly accounted for 48.5% of the variance in students' knowledge retention scores. However, the high inter-correlations among predictors (e.g., r = .989 between teacher guidance and problem-solving) indicate multicollinearity, suggesting that the GDM components likely measure closely related aspects of the same instructional construct. Therefore, the results should be interpreted as the combined influence of GDM rather than distinct effects of each component. The study concludes that GDM components show strong positive relationships with knowledge retention measures. It recommends that technical education teachers adopt GDM as an integrated pedagogical approach. Future research should employ longitudinal or experimental designs with pre-tests and delayed post-tests to establish causation and measure actual long-term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "The ProBIZ e-learning courseware was designed to transform the learning experience of SPM students in Business Studies by addressing common challenges such as lack of focus, difficulty in understanding business functions, and poor retention of past lessons. This project identifies the requirements for multimedia applications in the Business Organization subject (Chapter 4), develops an interactive courseware tailored to these needs, and evaluates its usability. Guided by the ADDIE instructional design model and Gagne’s Nine Events theory, the courseware integrates text, images, videos, animations, and interactive activities to enhance engagement and knowledge retention. Gagne’s instructional events such as gaining attention, informing learners of objectives, stimulating recall, presenting content, providing guidance, eliciting performance, giving feedback, assessing performance, and enhancing retention and transfer are embedded within the courseware to ensure a structured and effective learning experience. The development process included planning, requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, and documentation. Usability was assessed by three experts in multimedia and e-learning development, focusing on functionality, content accuracy, and design quality. Findings confirmed that the courseware aligned with Gagne’s framework, though refinements were suggested to improve feedback for students. Overall, ProBIZ demonstrates the potential of multimedia-based e-learning to support active learning and improve comprehension of business functions.

    "Abstract": "The present study explores the pedagogical contribution of Business Model Board Games to entrepreneurship education as an experiential tool. The BMBGs immerse learners in a safe, simulated decision-making environment to practice recognising opportunities, allocating resources, and planning strategically across various domains. Specifically, the study seeks to 1. Map the intellectual and thematic structure of academic research on BMBG from 1991 to 2024 and 2. Synthesise empirical insights on their utility for promoting cognitive, behavioural, and attitudinal learning outcomes. The bibliometric analysis employed the academic search hub AnswerThis.io, which provides indexed content from academic databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, SpringerLink, and Emerald Insight. A total of 246 publications were processed through VOSviewer and Biblioshiny to ascertain publication trends, citation dynamics, and keyword clusters. The descriptive and thematic indicators, including the total publications, citation frequency, h-index, and keyword co-occurrence, mapped the field’s intellectual structure. The findings indicate a near-explosive rise in publication outputs from 2015 to 2018, with two major citation peaks in 2007 and 2017 corresponding to two seminal works on experiential learning and serious game design. The thematic mapping advised a structural faculty consisting of four overlapping clusters: 1. Experiential learning and simulation design, 2. Motivation and flow engagement, 3. Community-based and collaborative learning, and 4. Digital inclusion and hybrid learning. These publication trends signify a paradigm shift from conventional, lecture-style education to technology-infused, interactive learning environments. The empirical synthesis argues that BMBG consistently favors cognitive development, behavioral aids, and attitudinal results, notwithstanding the gender-sensitive outlook, responsive design, and longitudinal studies to confirm the knowledge retention capacity. Finally, this study contributes to the adventitious literature on experiential entrepreneurship education by setting BMBGs as a cost-effective, context-driven competence-promotion tool for reflective play and social learning, fostering the learning-application chasm for entrepreneurial competency.",

    "Abstract": "This study adopted a comparative experimental design to investigate the effects of collaborative generative learning (CGL) in an AI-enabled immersive virtual environment (AI-IVE) on learners with different motivation levels. Learners with high motivation levels (HML) showed strong interest in both the AI-IVE and the subject content, whereas learners with low motivation levels (LML) lacked interest in one or both aspects. A total of 67 ninth-grade students from two intact classes participated in the study. The classes were randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. In the experimental group, students engaged collaboratively in generative learning activities using a structured CGL strategy with clearly defined roles, while in the control group, students completed the same activities individually using an individual generative learning (IGL) strategy. The results indicated that the CGL strategy enhanced both human-computer and learner-learner interactions, leading to improved learning outcomes in the AI-IVE. These effects were particularly evident in three aspects: (1) improved academic performance, knowledge retention, and transfer among LML learners; (2) increased situational interest, engagement, and self-efficacy; and (3) reduced cognitive load. These findings provide meaningful insights for the design and implementation of generative learning in AI-IVEs.",

    "Abstract": "Power-FULL Biofilms is a 5-week, hands-on outreach workshop designed to introduce KS2 students (ages 7+) to microbiology, electricity, and renewable energy. Students build their own microbial fuel cells (MFCs) using inexpensive plastic components and then inoculate these with mud from their school playground. The MFCs are fed with a simple food source and monitored as an electroactive biofilm develops; they produce electrical current. In the final session, the MFCs are connected together to power a small electronic device, proving we can get power from the playground. This activity builds on previous outreach initiatives like Powerful Soil and Blast a Biofilm , adapting complex microbiological ideas into a fun, age-appropriate format. Sessions combine structured instruction with storytelling, vocabulary development, and hands-on experimentation. Conducting the workshop at a UK primary school showed high levels of engagement and knowledge retention. Teachers praised the balance between challenge and support, and students responded enthusiastically to using real scientific equipment and terms, a way to introduce foundational science, technology, engineering, and mathematics concepts through real-world experimentation.",

    "Abstract": "O storytelling é uma abordagem de ensino que utiliza narrativas cativantes para estimular o interesse e empenho dos alunos, tendo-se revelado eficaz na promoção de uma aprendizagem significativa. Contar histórias ajuda a contextualizar conceitos complexos de forma apelativa, captando a atenção dos alunos e facilitando a retenção do conhecimento. Este trabalho teve como objetivo implementar e avaliar uma estratégia de ensino inovadora baseada no storytelling para abordar os conteúdos do sistema respiratório. Esta abordagem procurou não só promover a compreensão dos conceitos científicos, mas também desenvolver competências como criatividade, comunicação, colaboração e pensamento crítico. Pretendeu-se, ainda, avaliar se a estratégia contribuía para o aumento do interesse e envolvimento dos alunos nas aulas. A investigação foi desenvolvida com uma turma de 20 alunos do 9.º ano de escolaridade, numa escola secundária do Norte de Portugal Continental. Os alunos, com idades entre os 14 e os 16 anos, eram maioritariamente portugueses, incluindo três estrangeiros e um com necessidades educativas especiais. Adotou-se uma metodologia qualitativa e interventiva, baseada na investigação-ação (IA), com recolha de dados através da observação participante do professor investigador (PI) e da análise dos recursos pedagógicos e produtos dos alunos. Os resultados revelaram um aumento na motivação e envolvimento dos alunos, bem como uma melhoria na sua capacidade de compreender e aplicar conceitos científicos sobre o sistema respiratório. Conclui-se que o uso do storytelling pode ser uma estratégia eficaz no ensino das ciências, com impacto positivo nas aprendizagens e na participação dos alunos. Contudo, destaca-se como limitações o facto de ter sido aplicada a uma única turma, o que impede a generalização dos resultados, e o tempo limitado para a implementação da sequência didática, que condicionou o aprofundamento de algumas atividades. Para investigações futuras, sugere-se o alargamento da abordagem a diferentes contextos e níveis de ensino, bem como o aumento progressivo da autonomia dos alunos na criação das suas próprias narrativas. Alternate abstract: Storytelling is a teaching approach that uses engaging narratives to stimulate students’ interest and commitment, proving to be effective in promoting meaningful learning. Telling stories helps to contextualize complex concepts in an appealing way, capturing students’ attention and facilitating knowledge retention. This study aimed to implement and evaluate an innovative teaching strategy based on storytelling to address content related to the respiratory system. This approach sought not only to promote the understanding of scientific concepts, but also to develop skills such as creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking. It also aimed to assess whether the strategy increased students’ interest and engagement in the classroom. The research was conducted with a class of 20 ninth-grade students in a secondary school in Northern Portugal. The students, aged between 14 and 16, were mostly Portuguese, including three foreign students and one with special educational needs. A qualitative and interventionist methodology was adopted, based on action research (AR), with data collected through participant observation by the teacher-researcher and analysis of pedagogical resources and student work. The results showed an increase in student motivation and engagement, as well as an improvement in their ability to understand and apply scientific concepts related to the respiratory system. It is concluded that the use of storytelling can be an effective strategy in science education, with a positive impact on learning and student participation. However, limitations include its application to only one class, which prevents generalization of the results, and the limited time for implementing the didactic sequence, which restricted the depth of some activities. Future research should explore the application of this approach in different contexts and educational levels, as well as progressively increasing students’ autonomy in creating their own narratives.",

    "Abstract": "At the core of every design decision in software architecture is a question, yet they are often overlooked, undocumented, and lost over time. Natural questions are essential to shaping key architectural decisions and preserving architectural knowledge. They arise organically from the architect’s experience and the unique characteristics of the system under design. However, natural questions are often mismanaged or ignored, leading to architectural drift, knowledge loss, inefficient resource use, or poor understandability of the system’s architecture. This thesis explores how explicitly capturing, classifying, and managing architectural questions can support more structured and collaborative software design. We aim to understand and outline the lifecycle of natural questions, the roles involved, their key requirements, challenges and then envision a specialised tool to support them appropriately. Based on existing literature, an exploratory case study, a requirements workshop with expert software architects, and following a Design Science Research methodology, we proposed a lifecycle for natural questions. We elicited essential functional and non-functional requirements to develop and prototype a dedicated tool to capture, manage and preserve natural questions. This dissertation presents a prototype tool that assists each role in tracking the lifecycle of natural questions, leveraging generative AI capabilities to provide automated classification of questions, similarity detection and AI-assisted discussion to support collaborative decision-making and architectural reasoning. The tool organises questions in a backlog, preserving rationale, fostering traceability and enabling easy access to architectural decisions throughout the lifecycle. Evaluating the tool’s usability and perceived value is paramount. To do so, a controlled user study was conducted involving university students and experienced software professionals. Participants reported that the tool was intuitive and appreciated the features available, believing that the AI support helped structure reasoning and explore outcomes. However, its influence on decisionmaking varied depending on user roles. Ultimately, the results suggested that explicitly managing these natural questions can enhance architectural thinking, foster collaboration and preserve critical design knowledge, laying the foundation for more thoughtful and sustainable software design practices.",

    "Abstract": "O presente relatório descreve e analisa uma investigação desenvolvida no âmbito da Prática de Ensino Supervisionada (PES), centrada na aplicação da metodologia de Ensino Orientado para a Aprendizagem Baseada em Modelos (EOABM). O estudo foi realizado com uma amostra de 18 alunos do 7.º ano de escolaridade numa escola secundária do Porto no ensino das Ciências Naturais, com especial foco na compreensão do processo da formação de caldeiras vulcânicas. O ensino das Ciências Naturais no 3.º Ciclo, nomeadamente no domínio da geologia, é frequentemente marcado por abordagens transmissivas, o que dificulta aprendizagens significativas e o desenvolvimento do pensamento científico. Apesar da valorização crescente das metodologias ativas nos documentos curriculares, ainda se verifica uma lacuna na aplicação sistemática de estratégias baseadas na modelação, sobretudo em temas complexos como o vulcanismo. Neste contexto, o presente estudo tem como propósito investigar de que forma a utilização da metodologia EOABM, aliada a estratégias como questionamento, o trabalho colaborativo e a modelação experimental, pode favorecer a construção de mapas mentais e promover competências investigativas. A investigação adota uma abordagem metodológica sustentada na Investigação-Ação (I-A), de natureza qualitativa com componentes quantitativas, visando não só transformar a prática letiva, mas também produzir conhecimento sobre ela. A aplicação da Sequência Didática (SD) foi acompanhada por instrumentos de recolha de dados como os Vês de Gowin, os mapas de conceitos e o inquérito tipo Snapshpot . Os resultados revelaram progressos na formulação de hipóteses, organização conceptual e compreensão dos processos vulcânicos. Verificou-se evolução nos mapas de conceito e nos Vês de Gowin, ainda que a qualidade tenha diminuído com a redução do apoio docente. Conclui-se que o EOABM, quando integrada em práticas pedagógicas mediadas e reflexivas, potencia aprendizagens significativas e duradouras. Segure-se, como perspetiva futura, a extensão desta abordagem a outros métodos curriculares e a realização de estudos longitudinais que analisem a sua eficácia na retenção e transferência do conhecimento. Alternate abstract: This report describes and analyses a research project carried out within the framework of a Supervised Teaching Practice, focusing on the implementation of the Model-Based Teaching (MBT) methodology. The study was conducted with a sample of eighteen Year 7 students from a secondary school in Porto, within the scope of Natural Sciences education, with a particular emphasis on understanding the formation of volcanic calderas. At the lower secondary level, the teaching of Natural Sciences, particularly geology, is often characterised by transmissive approaches, which hinder meaningful learning and the development of scientific reasoning. Despite the growing emphasis on active methodologies in official curricular documents, there remains a gap in the consistent application of model-based strategies, especially in complex topics such as volcanism. In this context, the present study aims to explore how the use of MBT, combined with strategies such as questioning, collaborative learning, and experimental modelling, can foster the construction of mental models and the development of investigative competences. The research adopts an Action Research (AR) methodological approach, predominantly qualitative with quantitative components, aiming not only to transform teaching practice but also to generate pedagogical knowledge. The implementation of the Didactic Sequence (DS) was supported by data collection instruments, including Gowin’s Vee diagrams, concept maps, and a Snapshot-type questionnaire. The results showed progress in hypothesis formulation, conceptual organisation, and understanding of volcanic processes. Improvements were observed in both concept maps and Gowin’s Vees, although a slight decline in quality was noted as teacher support was reduced. It is concluded that MBT, when integrated into reflective and well-mediated pedagogical practices, enhances meaningful and lasting learning. As a future perspective, it is suggested that this approach be extended to other curricular topics and that longitudinal studies be carried out to assess its effectiveness in knowledge retention and transfer.",

    "Abstract": "Num contexto educativo e numa sociedade em constante transformação, a adaptação das metodologias pedagógicas é crucial para alinhar os processos de ensino com as características dos alunos. Assim, torna-se imperativo utilizar estratégias inovadoras, como a gamificação, para cativar a atenção, motivação e empenho dos estudantes, promovendo desta forma o sucesso no ensino-aprendizagem. Esta dissertação explora a integração de técnicas de gamificação no ensino-aprendizagem da contabilidade, incorporando elementos de jogos para potencializar o desenvolvimento dos processos de ensino-aprendizagem. O presente estudo tem como objetivo estudar o contributo da gamificação no ensino-aprendizagem da contabilidade através das perceções dos alunos que jogam um jogo de tabuleiro adaptado ao ensino-aprendizagem da contabilidade ( Trivial Pursuit Accounting ). O jogo proposto, Trivial Accounting Pursuit, é semelhante ao Trivial Pursuit, apenas se alteraram todas categorias e questões que passaram a estar relacionadas com as diferentes áreas da contabilidade, criando, desta forma, uma proposta educacional envolvente e inovadora. Assim sendo, proporciona um ambiente prático para a aplicação de conhecimentos contabilísticos. Os resultados demonstraram que o jogo foi percebido pelos participantes como uma experiência positiva e eficaz para a aprendizagem da contabilidade. Houve uma elevada satisfação com a estrutura do jogo, a clareza das questões e a sua capacidade de promover aprendizagem ativa, interação entre colegas, motivação e consolidação de conhecimentos. Os dados recolhidos indicam também que o jogo contribuiu para uma maior confiança dos alunos na aplicação prática dos conceitos e para uma mudança positiva na perceção sobre a disciplina de contabilidade. A perceção dos alunos em relação ao jogo confirma que o mesmo pode enriquecer significativamente o cenário educacional em contabilidade, proporcionando uma experiência de ensino-aprendizagem inovadora e motivadora para os estudantes. O principal contributo desta investigação é mais uma evidência de que a gamificação, através de uma estratégia pedagógica baseada em jogos, pode não só aumentar o envolvimento e interesse dos alunos, como também melhorar a retenção de conhecimentos, promover competências sociais e transformar a perceção de uma disciplina tradicionalmente considerada complexa ou monótona. O estudo evidencia que, com ajustes contínuos, o Trivial Accounting Pursuit tem potencial para se tornar uma referência inovadora no ensino da contabilidade e para ser adaptado a outras áreas de formação académica e profissional. Alternate abstract: In an educational context and in a society that is constantly changing, adapting teaching methodologies is crucial in order to align teaching processes with student characteristics. It is therefore imperative to use innovative strategies, such as gamification, to captivate students' attention, motivation and commitment, thus promoting learning success. This dissertation explores the integration of gamification techniques in accounting education, incorporating elements of games to enhance the development of learning processes. The present study aims to study the contribution of gamification in the teaching-learning of accounting through the perceptions of students who play a board game adapted to the teaching-learning of accounting (Trivial Accounting Pursuit). The proposed game, Trivial Accounting Pursuit, is similar to Trivial Pursuit, except that all the categories and questions have changed and are now related to the different areas of accounting, thus creating an engaging and innovative educational proposal. Therefore, it provides a practical environment for the application of accounting knowledge. The results demonstrated that the game was perceived by participants as a positive and effective experience for accounting learning. There was high satisfaction with the structure of the game, the clarity of the questions and its ability to promote active learning, interaction between colleagues, motivation and consolidation of knowledge. The data collected also indicate that the game contributed to students' greater confidence in the practical application of concepts and to a positive change in their perception of the accounting discipline. Students' perception of the game confirms that it can significantly enrich the educational landscape in accounting, providing an innovative and motivating teaching-learning experience for students. The main contribution of this research is further evidence that gamification, through a game-based pedagogical strategy, can not only increase student engagement and interest, but also improve knowledge retention, promote social skills and transform the perception of a subject traditionally considered complex or monotonous. The study shows that, with continuous adjustments, Trivial Accounting Pursuit has the potential to become an innovative reference in accounting education and to be adapted to other areas of academic and professional training.",

    "Abstract": "Mentorship plays a critical role in fostering knowledge transfer, particularly in high-stakes healthcare environments such as intensive care units (ICUs). This qualitative study explores the influence of mentoring relationships with the implementation of the SECI (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization) knowledge-sharing practices among ICU nurses. The research seeks to understand how mentorship programs facilitate knowledge transfer, the perceived benefits of such programs, and how the SECI model can be effectively implemented within mentoring relationships. Using a qualitative methodology, this study gathers insights from ICU nurses through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, capturing their experiences with mentorship and its impact on knowledge exchange. The findings reveal that mentorship enhances professional development, fosters collaboration, and supports both tacit and explicit knowledge transfer within healthcare settings. Additionally, the study identifies key factors that contribute to successful implementation of the SECI model in mentoring programs, including institutional support, structured mentorship frameworks, and the role of trust and communication in knowledge-sharing processes. The study contributes to the growing body of research on healthcare mentorship by offering practical recommendations for integrating SECI-based knowledge-sharing strategies into nursing mentorship programs. By enhancing the effectiveness of mentorship in ICUs, this research aims to improve knowledge retention, professional growth, and overall patient care outcomes. Furthermore, the findings underscore the need for healthcare institutions to invest in sustainable mentorship initiatives that promote continuous learning and knowledge dissemination. By bridging the gap between SECI Model in Healthcare 6 theoretical models and real-world application, this study provides a framework for optimizing knowledge-sharing practices within critical care settings. The integration of structured mentorship programs rooted in the SECI model has the potential to strengthen clinical decision-making, enhance teamwork, and improve the overall quality of patient care in intensive care environments.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Dental students’ competencies are shaped by their training, yet traditional methods with mannequins often lack the depth necessary for comprehensive understanding, potentially impacting clinical proficiency. Immersive reality (IR) innovatively offers interactive and scenario-based environments that may enhance skill acquisition. Objective: This study evaluates the effectiveness of IR-based training implementation in comparison with conventional training methods for dental extractions. Methods: A prospective multicenter randomized clinical trial was conducted. Students were randomized to either IR-based training on open and closed extractions or conventional hands-on tutorials by oral surgeons. Post training, participants’ satisfaction and understanding were assessed and analyzed. Results: As of September 2025, 60 students from Hasanuddin University, Makassar, and Padjajaran University, Bandung, have been enrolled, and study enrollment will be expanded to Universitas Sumatera Utara, Medan. Data collection is ongoing and will conclude in November 2025, with expected dissemination in early 2026. Conclusions: IR-based training offers a novel approach that may boost motivation, knowledge retention, and skill transfer in dental education. This pilot protocol explores IR’s feasibility and potential to advance dental students’ competencies.

    "Abstract": "Background: Large language models such as ChatGPT offer significant opportunities for medical education. However, empirical data on actual usage patterns, perceived benefits, and limitations among medical students remain limited. Objective: This study aimed to assess how medical students in Germany use ChatGPT, their perceptions of its educational value, and the challenges and concerns associated with its use. Methods: A cross-sectional 17-item online survey was conducted between May and August 2024 among medical students from Philipps University Marburg, Germany. A mixed methods approach was applied, combining descriptive and inferential statistical analysis with qualitative content analysis of open-ended responses. Results: A total of 84 fully completed surveys were included in the analysis (response rate: 26.7%; 315 surveys started). Overall, 76.2% (64/84) of the participants reported having used ChatGPT for medical education, with significantly higher usage during exam periods ( P =.003). Preclinical students reported higher overall usage than clinical students ( P =.02). ChatGPT was primarily used for summarizing information by 60.7% (51/84) of students, for literature research by 57.7% (49/84), and for clarifying concepts by 47.1% (40/84). A total of 70.2% (59/84) felt that it helped them save time, and 51.2% (43/84) reported an improved understanding of content. In contrast, only 31% (26/84) saw benefits for applying knowledge and 15.5% (13/84) for long-term knowledge retention. Qualitative responses highlighted clear benefits such as time savings and support in exam preparation, while also pointing to potential applications in clinical documentation and expressing concerns about misinformation and source transparency. However, 73.3% (55/75) expressed concerns about misinformation, and 72.6% (61/84) reported lacking confidence in their artificial intelligence (AI)–related skills. Only 41.7% (35/84) stated that they trust ChatGPT’s outputs. Students who used the tool more frequently also reported higher levels of trust in ChatGPT’s outputs ( r =0.374, P< .001). Over 70% of respondents indicated a strong desire for increased integration of AI-related education and practical applications within the medical curriculum. Conclusions: ChatGPT was already widely used among medical students, especially in exam preparation and the early stages of training. Students valued its efficiency and support for understanding complex material, but its long-term influence on learning is limited. Concerns about reliability, source transparency, and data privacy remain, and AI skills played a key role in shaping usage. These findings underscore the need to integrate structured, practice-oriented AI education into medical training to support critical, informed, and ethical use of large language models.",

    "Abstract": "This Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) project focused on a staff education initiative aimed at reducing hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) in healthcare settings. HAIs contribute to patient morbidity, extended hospital stays, and increased healthcare costs. Despite established infection control policies, inconsistencies in adherence had highlighted the need for targeted education. The central practice question guiding this project, conducted in a hospital setting, was, “How did implementing a comprehensive infection prevention education program for healthcare staff influence their knowledge?” The primary goal was to educate staff with the skills needed to minimize infection risks and enhance patient outcomes through effective prevention techniques. The initiative followed the ADDIE instructional design model. Pre- and post-assessments measured participants’ knowledge changes, while formative and summative evaluations assessed the program’s overall effectiveness. Interactive learning methods, including case studies, demonstrations, and quizzes promoted engagement and knowledge retention. The results showed an improvement in staff understanding infection control protocols. Mean pretest scores averaged 2.1 out of 5, while posttest scores averaged 4.8 out of 5, reflecting a notable increase in knowledge retention. Confidence levels shifted with improvement. Before training, only 20% of staff reported feeling highly confident in their ability to prevent HAIs. After training, 85% reported high confidence. The implications for nursing practice include improved adherence to infection prevention guidelines, enhanced patient safety, and the potential for a reduction in HAIs.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) Conference Start Date: 2025 June 30 Conference End Date: 2025 July 5 Conference Location: Rome, Italy Conventional neural networks including Transformers encounter the catastrophic forgetting problem during sequential task learning, where learning new tasks interferes with previously learned knowledge. Existing memory replay and regularization methods cannot effectively eliminate interference among different tasks. Soft parameter sharing methods usually necessitate a large amount of additional parameters for learning each task, and task identity information is essential for leveraging task-specific parameters. To this end, we propose Remembering Transformer leveraging an adapter mixtures architecture enhanced by a generative routing mechanism for efficient task retention. In generative routing, input samples are allocated to the most relevant expert adapters based on a reconstruction loss. Moreover, unlike existing studies on soft parameter sharing that do not consider model capacity limitations, we investigate a challenging setting where the number of task-specific parameters is constrained. In particular, we devise an adapter fusion strategy to aggregate resembling experts based on similarity matching and knowledge distillation. Extensive empirical results measured by task accuracy, forgetting rate, and memory footprint, demonstrate that Remembering Transformer significantly enhances knowledge retention without task identity information. The proposed method surpasses various conventional methods with enhanced parameter efficiency in a broad range of incremental learning tasks.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) Conference Start Date: 2025 June 30 Conference End Date: 2025 July 5 Conference Location: Rome, Italy We propose SPARC, a lightweight continual learning framework for large language models (LLMs) that enables efficient task adaptation through prompt tuning in a lower-dimensional space. By leveraging principal component analysis (PCA), we identify a compact subspace of the training data. Optimizing prompts in this lower-dimensional space enhances training efficiency, as it focuses updates on the most relevant features while reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, since the model’s internal structure remains unaltered, the extensive knowledge gained from pretraining is fully preserved, ensuring that previously learned information is not compromised during adaptation. Our method achieves high knowledge retention in both task-incremental and domain-incremental continual learning setups while fine-tuning only 0.04% of the model’s parameters. Additionally, by integrating LoRA, we enhance adaptability to computational constraints, allowing for a tradeoff between accuracy and training cost. Experiments on the SuperGLUE benchmark demonstrate that our PCA-based prompt tuning combined with LoRA maintains full knowledge retention while improving accuracy, utilizing only 1% of the model’s parameters. These results establish our approach as a scalable and resource-efficient solution for continual learning in LLMs.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) Conference Start Date: 2025 June 30 Conference End Date: 2025 July 5 Conference Location: Rome, Italy Knowledge probing plays a crucial role in evaluating the factual knowledge retention and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in high-risk biomedical applications. However, existing biomedical probing benchmarks often fail to capture the complexity of real-world medical reasoning. In this study, we introduce MedLAMA2, an advanced biomedical knowledge probing benchmark built upon MedLAMA, incorporating multi-token entities and two-hop reasoning queries. All vocabularies are sourced from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus**, ensuring domain-specific accuracy.To systematically evaluate LLMs without fine-tuning, we design a structured probing pipeline using Top-k Metric and Token-level Metric as evaluation parameters. We assess the performance of encoder-only and decoder-only models across different parameter scales, ranging from 6B to 72B. Our experiments demonstrate that decoder-only models outperform encoder-only models, particularly in complex multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, even the best-performing models, such as Llama3-70B-Instruct and Qwen-1.5-72B-Chat, achieve acc@10 scores below 40%, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in structured biomedical knowledge retrieval. Additionally, our results show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting does not significantly improve the accuracy of biomedical knowledge probing tasks and may even degrade performance in multi-hop settings. This suggests that CoT may not be well-suited for structured medical knowledge retrieval.This study highlights the challenges of biomedical knowledge probing and aims to construct a new benchmark and evaluation process to provide more effective methods for assessing LLM performance in real-world medical environments, ultimately promoting the application of LLMs in the biomedical domain.",

Furthermore, existing single-domain unlearning methods fail to address multi-domain scenarios, where knowledge is interwoven across domains such as privacy and copyright, creating overlapping representations that lead to excessive knowledge removal or degraded performance. To tackle these issues, we propose GRAIL (GRadient-based AdaptIve unLearning), a novel multi-domain unlearning framework. GRAIL leverages gradient information from multiple domains to precisely distinguish the unlearning scope from the retention scope, and applies an adaptive parameter-wise localization strategy to selectively remove targeted knowledge while preserving critical parameters for each domain. Experimental results on unlearning benchmarks show that GRAIL achieves unlearning success on par with the existing approaches, while also demonstrating up to 17% stronger knowledge retention success compared to the previous state-of-art method. Our findings establish a new paradigm for effectively managing and regulating sensitive information in large-scale pretrained language models.",

The fundamental challenge is to effectively exploit the consensus and complementary information across the different views. However, most multi-view learning approaches remain challenged in knowledge preservation in absence of annotating data. To handle these problems, this work shows an effective strategy to learn and preserve view-specific knowledge for multi-view learning methods, leveraging both labeled and streamlined unlabeled data to address catastrophic forgetting in multiple views. Specifically, we propose a View-Specific Knowledge Retention (VSKR) module to continuously sustain and absorb new knowledge. The VSKR secures a compact repository of labeled data within a view-specific, adaptable learning dictionary. Serving as a memory bank, the dictionary can be tuned by observing the correlations within an expansive pool of unlabeled data, inferred via label propagation, circumventing the need for costly annotations. Given the intrinsic limitation of the VSKR module in ensuring cross-view knowledge consistency, we use the contrastive learning strategy to facilitate stronger consistency and robustness of knowledge retention by both a Cross-View Distribution Consistency (CVDC) loss and a CAnonical COntrastive (CACO) loss. This regulation is crucial for preserving harmonized knowledge retention within the typical multi-view continual learning setup. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of the Multi-View Knowledge Retention (MVKR) approach for multi-view continual learning.",

The observer and critic MNN weight updates are derived using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the MNN activation gradients, measured outputs, and Bellman errors, respectively. The optimal control input is computed based on the critic network weights and the observer-estimated system dynamics. To enable multitask learning and knowledge retention, an online continual learning mechanism is incorporated by introducing a penalty function into the critic MNN updates, relying solely on estimated states in the output feedback setting.

INTRODUCTION Forensic clinical medicine examines injuries in living individuals and plays a critical role in criminal violence cases, trauma compensation, and judicial rulings. In China, this field contributes substantially to upholding social justice. Current educational approaches struggle to bridge the gap between theory and practice, largely due to privacy constraints during forensic examinations, leaving students ill-prepared to assess real cases and identify key evaluation criteria. Scenario-based simulation training presents a promising alternative to conventional case-based teaching.We compared the efficacy of traditional case-based teaching with scenario-based simulation in a forensic clinical medicine course. Two cohorts of undergraduate forensic science students from consecutive academic years underwent each teaching method. Post-course assessments included theoretical examinations and practical evaluations as quantitative measures of knowledge acquisition. Professional instructors graded students' performance, while self-evaluation surveys captured learning experiences. METHODS We compared the efficacy of traditional case-based teaching with scenario-based simulation in a forensic clinical medicine course. Two cohorts of undergraduate forensic science students from consecutive academic years underwent each teaching method. Post-course assessments included theoretical examinations and practical evaluations as quantitative measures of knowledge acquisition. Professional instructors graded students' performance, while self-evaluation surveys captured learning experiences.Scenario-based simulation teaching yielded superior learning outcomes. The simulation group (2020 cohort) achieved higher scores than the traditional group (2019 cohort) in both theoretical (*p < 0.05) and practical assessments, with notably better knowledge retention (subjective questions: **p < 0.01; objective questions: *p < 0.05). The simulation group also demonstrated stronger theory-practice integration (r = 0.9622 vs. 0.9115). Instructor evaluations (n = 11) demonstrated that scenario-based simulation teaching improved students' learning motivation (81.8%), theoretical application (72.7%), communication skills (81.8%), analytical abilities (63.6%), and teamwork competencies (54.5%). All instructors reported enhanced professional image, with 90.9% noting increased teaching motivation. Student self-assessments reinforced these results: over 80% of the simulation group reported gains in theoretical learning effectiveness, analytical/operational capabilities, and professional self-assurance, versus ≤31.9% in the traditional group. Classroom metrics favored the simulation group (self-study interest: 65% vs. 45.5%; engagement: 90% vs. 45.5%; collaboration: 80% vs. 36.4%), though 10% cited challenges with preparatory workload.

    "Abstract": "Knowledge loss (KL), the disappearance of critical knowledge once a project ends, remains a persistent threat to the sustainability of organizational performance and competitiveness despite ongoing efforts to implement knowledge retention (KR) methods in construction organizations. This study presents a new research model to examine why KL occurs and how valuable project knowledge can be effectively retained. From the conservation of resources (COR) perspective, we aim to investigate how project urgency and temporariness, referred to as project features (PFs), influence knowledge loss through members’ knowledge withholding (KW) behavior, how this association is affected by their psychological emotions (fears), and the contingent role relational resources, namely project team interaction (PTI), plays in this association. Data were collected from a sample of 469 construction experts with extensive experience in international engineering projects undertaken by Chinese international companies. Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) analysis using SmartPLS 4 was employed to empirically test the proposed theoretical model. The results show that KW behavior is a critical driver of KL and serves as a mediator of the impact of PFs on KL. PFs were found to be positively associated with members’ KW behavior. This linkage was partially mediated by fear of failure (FF), while fear of losing uniqueness (FLU) showed no significant mediating effect. PTI played a moderating role in the relationship between KW and KL. Based on these findings, minimizing KL requires management to focus on reducing FF by fostering a climate of mistake tolerance, and subsequently strengthening PTI to promote effective knowledge exchange. The results of this study offer new theoretical and practical insights into KL risk management within construction organizations.",

Digital natives expect interactive learning experiences integrating with their technology-rich environments. Game-based learning (GBL) combines entertainment with educational objectives, demonstrating potential for improving learner motivation and knowledge retention in second language acquisition. This study evaluates the effectiveness and user experience of a proprietary gamified mobile application for English language learning, focusing on practical skill development and cross-cultural applicability. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted using a 38question, 5-point Likert-scale questionnaire administered to 516 participants aged 14-25 from Türkiye, Hungary, and Germany following two months of application usage. The questionnaire encompassed five dimensions: User Experience and Interface, Content Quality and Effectiveness, Motivation and Tracking Mechanisms, Interaction and Personalization, and Overall Satisfaction. Data analysis employed descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and thematic evaluation. The application achieved consistently high satisfaction scores across all dimensions, with mean values ranging from 3.79 to 4.18. The highest-rated aspect was overall effectiveness as a language learning tool $(\\bar{x}=4.18, \\sigma=0.94)$ , while practical language skill applicability received strong endorsement ( $\\bar{x}=4.14, \\sigma=1.00$ ). Correlation analysis revealed strong positive relationships between user experience factors, particularly between User Experience and Interface and Content Quality and Effectiveness ( $r=0.839$ ). The study demonstrates successful integration of gamification and mobile learning technologies for language education, with users perceiving significant educational value and practical applicability across different cultural contexts.",

While effective, traditional training methods face challenges such as logistical constraints and limited accessibility. This study investigates the potential of virtual reality (VR) as an alternative approach to enhance avalanche rescue training. We conducted a comparative analysis between traditional ( $\\mathrm{N}=21$ ) and VR ( $\\mathrm{N}=22$ ) training methods, focusing on participants' knowledge retention, procedural adherence, and confidence in handling real-life scenarios and equipment. Our findings indicate that VR training offers comparable learning outcomes to traditional methods, with the added benefits of increased engagement and accessibility. However, challenges in handling equipment suggest that VR should complement, rather than replace, hands-on training. This research contributes valuable insights into integrating immersive technologies in safety education and the potential for VR to improve training effectiveness in highrisk environments.",

The simulation highlights everyday mistakes to raise awareness of risky behaviors in public settings. We developed and evaluated an immersive debriefing system that enables participants to review their performance and re-engage with the scenario through a redo phase. This redo was implemented in two formats: a full scenario redo (F-REDO) and a segmented redo targeting specific moments (S-REDO). We found that both redo formats were equally effective in learning outcomes and user satisfaction, using a mixed-methods approach combining standardized questionnaires (motivation, cognitive load, usability, knowledge retention) and qualitative trainer feedback. However, S-REDO demonstrated greater time efficiency without increasing cognitive load and was perceived by the trainer as more engaging and pedagogically relevant.

    "Abstract": "In today’s crisis-affected world, soft skills like empathy are increasingly important for effective leadership. While prior research shows that empathy can be trained, existing publications are focused mostly on healthcare settings. This quasi-experimental study examines whether empathy training can enhance emotional intelligence (EI) and crisis leadership abilities among business school students through a 90-minute face-to-face training. Although no significant impact on the respective constructs was found, participants demonstrated strong knowledge retention and high satisfaction with the intervention. This work thus provides a practical, replicable toolkit for integrating empathy training into business education and serves as a basis for future research.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge in organizations continues to be lost during attrition (Cox & Overbay, 2023). The Baby Boomers are retiring (Cox & Overbay, 2023), younger generations move (Brown, 2023), and self-interested employees hide knowledge (Ahmad & Karim, 2019; Anand et al., 2022) Collaborative learning teams (CLTs) increase knowledge transfer, which retains organizational knowledge (Ahmad & Karim, 2019). This mixed methods research was undertaken to investigate what contributors made a group in an organization into a CLT. Autonomy, competence development, group relatedness, psychological safety, shared goals and objectives, and leadership collaboration encouragement were explored for their relationships with being a CLT. Experiences were also researched that occurred in positively performing CLTs. The Theory of Planned Behavior was used as a theoretical lens for the research to help understand the behavior of collaborative team knowledge sharing. Behavior can be predicted by attitudes, social influences, and perceived behavior control towards the behavior (Ajzen, 1991). The approach was utilized to understand what the primary contributors are for a group of employees to become a CLT and to understand what experiences occur in positively performing CLTs. For the correlational study, 167 participants were surveyed, and eight of those participants were interviewed in a phenomenological study. The responses were grouped and placed into themes. The survey was used to correlate conditions of the contributors in the participants’ teams in relation to their level of being an effective CLT. The interview was used for further learning of the survey results. The contributors, autonomy, competence development, relatedness, psychological safety, shared goals and objectives, and leadership collaboration encouragement were all found as significant when correlated to the level of being a CLT and were supported by the phenomenological research. In positively performing CLTs, collaboration can be lessened and use of the phenomenological research provided learning. Improving behavioral, normative, and control beliefs towards each contributor can motivate employees to be part of CLTs but leaders must continuously motivate towards the contributors and not take positive performance for granted. Leaders can use this research to create CLTs in their organizations, lessen organizational knowledge loss, and gain a competitive advantage over other organizations.",

    "Abstract": "Promoting public health is challenging owing to its abstract nature, and individuals may be apprehensive about confronting it. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using the metaverse and gamification as novel educational techniques to improve learning experiences related to the immune system. Thus, we present MetaRoundWorm, an immersive virtual reality (VR) escape room game designed to enhance the understanding of parasitic infections and host immune responses through interactive, gamified learning. The application simulates the lifecycle of Ascaris lumbricoides and corresponding immunological mechanisms across anatomically accurate environments within the human body. Integrating serious game mechanics with embodied learning principles, MetaRoundWorm offers players a task-driven experience combining exploration, puzzle-solving, and immune system simulation. To evaluate the educational efficacy and user engagement, we conducted a controlled study comparing MetaRoundWorm against a traditional approach, i.e., interactive slides. Results indicate that MetaRoundWorm significantly improves immediate learning outcomes, cognitive engagement, and emotional experience, while maintaining knowledge retention over time. Our findings suggest that immersive VR gamification holds promise as an effective pedagogical tool for communicating complex biomedical concepts and advancing digital health education.",

    "Abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool for science education, offering interactive environments to explore intangible concepts. Traditional teaching methods often struggle to convey abstract concepts in science, where many phenomena are not directly observable. VR can address this issue by modeling and visualizing complex and unobservable entities and processes, allowing learners to dynamically interact with what would otherwise not be directly perceptible. However, relatively few controlled studies have compared immersive VR learning with equivalent hands-on laboratory learning in physics education, particularly for more abstract topics. In this work, we designed a VR-based physics lab that is capable of visualizing electrons and electromagnetic fields to teach fundamental concepts of electronics and magnetism, closely replicating a traditional electronics learning kit used as a baseline for comparison. We evaluated the impact of the two conditions (VR versus traditional) on students' learning outcomes, motivation, engagement, and cognitive load. Our results show significantly higher knowledge retention in the VR group compared to the traditional group. Also, while there were no significant differences in immediate comprehension between the two groups, participants in the VR group spent substantially more time engaged with the learning content. These findings highlight the potential of visually enriched virtual environments to enhance the learning experience and improve knowledge retention of intangible scientific concepts.",

Traditional Cybersecurity Awareness Training (CSAT) programs often rely on static content, lack of personalization, and struggle remain in the face of evolving threats. This study presents an AI driven CSAT framework that integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), Online Machine Learning, and adaptive data processing to deliver personalized, scalable, and real-time training contents. The proposed model utilizes GAI to dynamically generate interactive training contents tailored to individual user profiles based on job roles, behavioural risk indicators, impact assessment scores, and the pre-assessment outcomes. An online Naïve Bayes algorithm enables continuous risk profiling and content adaptation according to user performance, while windowing technique and integrated search engine ensure up-to-date and contextually relevant training materials. The proposed system aligns with Bloom’s Taxonomy and MITRE ATT&CK framework to ensure cognitive depth and real-world attack vector relevance. The research demonstrates that the integration of GAI with adaptive learning technologies significantly improves knowledge retention, enhance user engagement, and delivers cost-effective training solution. Further this study highlights the potential of GAI in revolutionizing cybersecurity training, ensuring resilience against evolving cyber-threats.",

    "Abstract": "Conventional imitation learning (IL) struggles with scalability and catastrophic forgetting in sequential task learning, prompting the need for Lifelong Imitation Learning (LIL) to enable sustainable knowledge accumulation. However, existing LIL approaches, which largely depend on replaying demonstration data or generating visual pseudo-samples, suffer from high storage demands and low sample fidelity. To address these issues, we propose Feature-Action Generative Replay (FAGR), a novel LIL framework for robotic manipulation. FAGR begins by performing multimodal feature extraction and feature-action joint clustering for each task to retain cluster statistics, thereby dramatically reducing storage requirements by replacing raw demonstration data with compact cluster statistics. Subsequently, FAGR generates pseudo-feature samples from these statistics and infers corresponding actions via previously learned policy network, thereby obtaining feature-action pairs for past tasks. To enhance the reliability of these samples, FAGR incorporates a filtering mechanism based on action distribution confidence, which selectively retains the high-fidelity generative samples. These curated samples are then integrated with current-task data for joint optimization, enabling effective robust knowledge retention and transfer. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore generative replay in the feature-action space for LIL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAGR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in mitigating forgetting while maintaining high task success rates, thus achieving better stability-plasticity balance.",

    "Abstract": "Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) suffers from the catastrophic forgetting problem when learning from non-stationary data streams. Existing exemplar-based and knowledge distillation-based LReID methods encounter data privacy and limited acquisition capacity, respectively. In this paper, we introduce the prototype, which is under-investigated in LReID, to better balance knowledge retention and acquisition. Previous prototype-based works primarily focused on the classification task, where prototypes were modeled as discrete points or statistical distributions. However, they either discarded the distribution information or omitted instance-level diversity, which are crucial fine-grained clues for LReID. Furthermore, the domain shifts between data sources result in a feature gap between the new and old data, which restricts the utilization of the fine-grained information in prototypes. To address these challenges, we propose Distribution-aware Knowledge Aligning and Prototyping (DKP++), a novel framework for modeling and leveraging prototypes in LReID. First, an Instance-level Distribution Modeling network is introduced to capture the local diversity of each instance. Next, a Distribution-oriented Prototype Generation algorithm transforms the instance-level diversity into identity-level distributions which are stored as prototypes. Then, a Prototype-based Knowledge Transfer module distills the knowledge within the prototypes to the new model. To mitigate the impact of domain shifts during knowledge transfer, we introduce a privacy-friendly Distribution Aligning module that transforms new input data to fit the historical distribution, which is incorporated with feature-level alignment constraints to enhance the coherence between new and old knowledge, effectively improving historical prototype utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a superior balance between plasticity and stability, outperforming state-of-the-art LReID methods by a large margin.",

For example, in domestic environments, robots can proactively help users by fetching needed objects based on learned routines, which they infer by observing how objects move over time. However, data from these interactions are inherently non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.), e.g., a robot assisting multiple users may encounter varying data distributions as individuals follow distinct habits. This creates a challenge: integrating new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose STREAK (Spatio Temporal RElocation with Adaptive Knowledge retention), a continual learning framework for real-world robotic learning. It leverages a streaming graph neural network with regularization and rehearsal techniques to mitigate context drifts while retaining past knowledge. Our method is time- and memory-efficient, enabling long-term learning without retraining on all past data, which becomes infeasible as data grows in real-world interactions. We evaluate STREAK on the task of incrementally predicting human routines over 50+ days across different households. Results show that it effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting while maintaining generalization, making it a scalable solution for long-term human-robot interactions.",

VR enables interactive and virtual learning environments, whereas AI delivers adaptive and intelligent learning assistance. Yet, current learning systems typically suffer from low interactivity, non-personalization, and poor adaptability to the needs of individual learners. Most traditional systems, such as web-based learning platforms and multimedia instructional materials, simply provide static materials that are unable to dynamically adapt to the pace or learning style of learners and thereby achieve less engagement and retention. While prior methods tried to augment user experience with gamification or basic adaptive techniques, they remain to lack full real-time personalization. To address these issues, this paper suggests a VR-AI Adaptive Learning System (VRAILS) that combines interactive VR simulations and adaptive AI-powered algorithms. The system uses reinforcement learning and predictive modeling to tailor learning routes, offer instant feedback, and adapt difficulty levels based on learner performance. Experimental testing and comparative evaluation with conventional systems prove that VRAILS generates considerable improvements in learner interaction, knowledge retention, and satisfaction. The findings validate the potential of pairing VR and AI to create a solid framework for future intelligent education systems.",

Common approaches to this challenge involve incorporating diverse data into the training process or fine-tuning models on unseen datasets. However, these solutions can be computationally demanding and may lead to the loss of knowledge acquired from previously learned data. Continual learning techniques offer a potential solution to this problem, allowing the models to learn from unseen data without losing what they have already learned. Still, the optimal way to apply these algorithms for speech deepfake detection remains unclear, and we do not know which is the best way to apply these algorithms to the developed models. In this paper we address this aspect and investigate whether, when retraining a speech deepfake detector, it is more effective to apply continual learning across the entire model or to update only some of its layers while freezing others. Our findings, validated across multiple models, indicate that the most effective approach among the analyzed ones is to update only the weights of the initial layers, which are responsible for processing the input features of the detector.",

However, existing methods tend to focus on data fusion, overlooking the importance of self-transformations. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive data augmentation strategy that combines self-transformations with cross-sample fusion: Symmetry and Fusion Data Augmentation (SF-DA), implemented within the Mean Teacher framework. Our method has two branches: Self-Symmetric Flipping (SSF), enhancing the model’s feature understanding, and cross-sample stitching (CSS), promoting common semantic learning between labeled and unlabeled data. Together, they promote more comprehensive knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on ACDC and PROMISE12 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of SF-DA. Across different labeled data scenarios, SF-DA consistently outperforms the second-best method in all evaluation metrics. Code is available at https://github.com/ZYS-four/SF-DA.git.",

These challenges frequently result in sub-optimal decision-making and catastrophic forgetting during task transitions. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a framework that leverages large language models for strategic guidance, optimizing decision-making and action selection. The framework integrates a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network to ensure interpretability via symbolic regression, enabling effective strategy transfer across diverse environments. Adaptive Elastic Weight Consolidation is employed to prevent catastrophic forgetting, preserving task-specific knowledge across training. A caching mechanism reduces computational overhead linked to large language model queries, enhancing overall efficiency. Experimental evaluations indicate competitive performance, robust interpretability, and effective strategy transfer.",

We present DREAM-CL, a novel CL method for ECG arrhythmia detection that introduces dynamic prototype rehearsal memory. DREAM-CL selects representative prototypes by clustering data based on learning behavior during each training session. Within each cluster, we apply a smooth sorting operation that ranks samples by training difficulty, compressing extreme values and removing outliers. The more challenging samples are then chosen as prototypes for the rehearsal memory, ensuring effective knowledge retention across sessions. We evaluate our method on time-incremental, class-incremental, and lead-incremental scenarios using two widely used ECG arrhythmia datasets, Chapman and PTB-XL. The results demonstrate that DREAM-CL outperforms the state-of-the-art in CL for ECG arrhythmia detection. Detailed ablation and sensitivity studies are performed to validate the different design choices of our method.",

    "Abstract": "Background/purpose: Higher education necessitates learner autonomy and active participation for deep engagement in learning. However, significant challenges limited classroom involvement and low student learning autonomy. Infrequent peer discussion further hinders knowledge retention and conceptual mastery. Many lecturers dominate learning in class; these issues constrain independent learning and participation in learning development. This study, therefore, investigates peer lesson strategies to enhance student learning independence and activity. Materials/methods: The study used Classroom Action Research (CAR), involving 67 active students, and comprised two cycles. Each cycle followed the four standard CAR stages: planning, implementation, observation, and reflection. The initial cycle employed a traditional lecture-based teaching approach, while the second cycle implemented the peer lesson strategy. Results: In Cycle I, lecture-based instruction, achievement remained below the benchmark, with independent learning indicators 26.87%- 41.79% (explorative and creative, responsibility in learning, trying new things, focus on learning material) and active learning 34.33%-41.79% (visual engagement, verbal participation, active listening, note-taking and summarizing). With Cycle II, all indicators increased significantly due to the Peer Lesson Strategy, with independent learning 80.6%-86.57% and active learning 80.6%--88.06%, thus confirming the PLS effectiveness in promoting autonomy and active participation. Conclusion: The Peer Lesson Strategy (PLS) contributes to independent learning by enhancing creativity, responsibility, initiative, and focus, while fostering learning through participation, attentive listening, note-taking, and summarizing. In this context, PLS applies an educational practice that is centered on the learner's autonomy and participation in the learning process during the lesson.",

Introduction Traditional narrative lectures in medical education often result in cognitive overload and disengagement. Flipped classrooms offer a feasible alternative by promoting active learning and preparation. We integrated flipped classroom strategies with gamification to enhance learning in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) education.Fifth-year medical students enrolled in the Preoperative to Postoperative Care V course, comprising 112 hours of clinical training and 24 lectures, participated in this educational session. Students received preclass materials and completed presession tests and psychometric assessments. During the 90-minute LUTS session, interactive Kahoot! quizzes were administered in three segments, covering classification, differential diagnosis, and treatment of LUTS, followed by a postsession test and summative assessment. Data were analyzed using nonparametric and Spearman's rank correlation tests.

Data were analyzed using nonparametric and Spearman's rank correlation tests.Of 162 students completing the presession test, 115 completed the postsession test and psychometric evaluation. Significant improvements were observed across all objective domains. The mean confidence level (on a 5-point Likert scale) increased from 2.78 to 4.26 ( p < .001), and satisfaction improved from 4.62 to 4.81 ( p = .005). High presession test scores (above mode of eight cutoff) were associated with higher pass rates on the final multiple-choice exam ( p = .04), and a weak yet significant correlation was found between postsession test scores and OSCE performance ( r = 0.20, p = .03).

    "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the demand for effective asynchronous educational videos, prompting renewed attention to how emotional tone influences learning outcomes. Beyond sustaining attention and motivation, the affective cues conveyed by educators directly shape students’ emotional responses and engagement. This study investigates how educators’ sentiment and emotional cues, extracted from video subtitles, correlate with students’ emotional responses and engagement metrics in asynchronous learning environments. Educator affect was inferred from subtitle analysis, while student reactions were characterized through comments, likes, and viewing patterns. Sentiment assessments using VADER and RoBERTa revealed moderately strong and consistent correlations: subtitles with negative sentiment were frequently associated with anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and disapproval in student comments, whereas positive emotional cues aligned with more favorable and constructive responses. These results highlight the significant role of emotional dynamics in asynchronous learning and suggest that strategic modulation of affective expression in educational content could optimize student engagement and knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 25th International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability, and Security Companion (QRS-C) Conference Start Date: 2025 July 16 Conference End Date: 2025 July 20 Conference Location: Hangzhou, China With the widespread application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of operations and maintenance, AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) has become a key technology for improving operational efficiency and automated decision-making. However, traditional machine learning models often struggle to maintain stable performance when dealing with concept drift and catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, this paper proposes the LILT model (LoRA-based Incremental Learning Transformer), which implements incremental learning in the Transformer neural network through LoRA fine-tuning technology. Additionally, the model incorporates regularization methods to constrain the model parameters, effectively addressing concept drift and knowledge retention issues in hard disk failure prediction. The LoRA adapter facilitates incremental learning by fine-tuning the feedforward layer parameters, improving the model’s adaptability when new tasks arise. Meanwhile, freezing the parameters of the self-attention layer ensures the stability of the task and promotes the accumulation of knowledge over long-term learning. Regularization techniques add constraints to control model parameter changes, ensuring stability between tasks and supporting long-term knowledge retention. Moreover, the integrated gradient (IG) method is employed to analyze the feature importance of the model, specifically demonstrating the contribution of each input feature to the model’s predictions by outputting the tensor of feature contributions. Experimental results show that LILT, when applied to hard disk failure prediction tasks with concept drift, demonstrates stronger task adaptability and stability compared to traditional Transformer models. Furthermore, LILT has a lower forgetting rate compared to the LoRA-based incremental learning method. The model has made significant progress in retaining the memory of old tasks, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. At the same time, the integrated gradient method enhances the interpretability of LILT. This study provides a novel solution for the fault prediction domain, demonstrating strong stability and interpretability in a drift-driven streaming data environment.",

A major factor contributing to this issue is background shift, where background categories in sequential tasks may overlap with either previously learned or future unseen classes. To address this, we propose a novel method called Class-Agnostic Shared Attribute Base (CASA) that encourages the model to learn category-agnostic attributes shared across incremental classes. Our approach leverages an LLM to generate candidate textual attributes, selects the most relevant ones based on the current training data, and records their importance in an assignment matrix. For subsequent tasks, the retained attributes are frozen, and new attributes are selected from the remaining candidates, ensuring both knowledge retention and adaptability. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.",

    "Abstract": "Mi motivación surge de mi propia experiencia con el estrés académico durante mi formación en medicina. Esta vivencia me llevó a explorar métodos de aprendizaje más eficaces, apoyándome en el uso de tecnologías. En un contexto donde los currículos médicos en Colombia son fragmentados y poco alineados con las necesidades reales del sistema de salud, decidí que mi tesis debía desafiar el modelo tradicional de enseñanza y fomentar un aprendizaje más individualizado y menos estresante. Me enfoqué en las tecnologías inmersivas como la Realidad Virtual (RV), la Realidad Aumentada (RA), la Realidad Mixta (RM) y la Realidad Extendida (RE), ya que permiten crear experiencias digitales realistas que estimulan los sentidos y generan una sensación de presencia. Estas herramientas ofrecen beneficios como el aprendizaje experiencial, una mayor retención de conocimientos y la posibilidad de practicar en entornos seguros. Sin embargo, también enfrentan desafíos como los altos costos, efectos secundarios como el mareo cibernético, el efecto novedad, y preocupaciones éticas relacionadas con la privacidad, el acceso equitativo y la despersonalización de la medicina. Para abordar estos temas, adopté un enfoque cualitativo basado en revisión de literatura, observación y entrevistas semiestructuradas a cinco estudiantes y egresados de medicina de la Universidad El Bosque. Utilicé análisis temático y visualización de redes mediante un código en R para mapear las interacciones entre los estudiantes y las herramientas tecnológicas. Los resultados mostraron que estudiantes como Paula y Andrea actúan como nodos centrales en la red de interacción, conectadas con múltiples herramientas como Complete Anatomy, Anatomage, Cardionics, Anatomy TV e iHuman. Esto sugiere que son mediadoras clave en la configuración del aprendizaje colectivo. Las experiencias estudiantiles revelan que, aunque las tecnologías transforman el acceso a la información y el desarrollo de habilidades, persiste una fuerte preferencia por el contacto físico y los modelos reales. La facilidad de uso de las plataformas, así como los fallos técnicos, influyen significativamente en la experiencia de aprendizaje. Desde una perspectiva de salud pública, utilicé la Teoría del Actor-Red (TAR) para comprender cómo actores humanos y no humanos configuran el sistema educativo y, por extensión, el sistema de salud. Critico que la reforma de salud en Colombia no contemple la inclusión de tecnologías inmersivas en los programas de pregrado, lo que representa una omisión importante. También abordo implicaciones éticas como la equidad en el acceso, la privacidad de los datos, el sesgo algorítmico y la formación ética de los futuros profesionales. En conclusión, sostengo que las tecnologías inmersivas tienen un potencial transformador en la educación médica, pero deben complementar, no reemplazar, los métodos tradicionales. Recomiendo diseñar interfaces accesibles, integrar estratégicamente estas tecnologías en el currículo, ofrecer soporte técnico y capacitación docente, investigar la interacción humano-tecnología (especialmente con IA), y abordar las implicaciones éticas y de salud mental. Mi objetivo final es contribuir a la formación de médicos más competentes y empáticos, capaces de enfrentar los desafíos de la atención médica moderna mediante un equilibrio entre tecnología y humanismo.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Infection prevention and control (IPC) competencies are essential to safe patient care across practice settings. This cross-sectional survey study aimed to describe the ability of an escape room to reinforce IPC concepts and knowledge retention rates for third-year student pharmacists. Methods: An IPC-themed escape room using a mixture of online and physical puzzles was incorporated into a third-year student pharmacist course. Students in the course took knowledge assessment and perception surveys before the escape room (T1), after the escape room (T2), and for retention at the end of the semester (T3). Results: Statistically significant ( p < 0.05) increases in knowledge occurred on four out of five of the knowledge assessment questions between the pre- and post-assessments (T1, T2) as well as between the pre- and retention assessments (T1, T3). Student confidence in their ability to provide patient care compliant with IPC practices also demonstrated statistically significant improvement between pre, post, and retention assessments (T1, T2, T3). Conclusions: An IPC escape room is an effective tool to reinforce IPC concepts and increases student pharmacist knowledge and confidence in patient safety practices. Future study iterations should evaluate the role of an IPC IPE event for utility across multiple health professions curricula.",

    "Abstract": "This paper explores the integration of computing and multimodal technologies into personal reading practices to enhance student engagement and knowledge assimilation in higher education. In response to a documented decline in voluntary academic reading, we investigated how technology-enhanced reading environments can re-engage students through interactive and personalized experiences. Central to this research is SmartRead, a proposed multimodal eReading platform that incorporates gamification, adaptive content delivery, and real-time feedback mechanisms. Drawing on empirical data collected from students at a higher education institution, we examined how features such as progress tracking, motivational rewards, and interactive comprehension aids influence reading behavior, engagement levels, and information retention. Results indicate that such multimodal interventions can significantly improve learner outcomes and user satisfaction. This paper contributes actionable insights into the design of innovative, accessible, and pedagogically sound digital reading tools and proposes a framework for future eReading technologies that align with multimodal interaction principles.",

Introduction Immunology is challenging for medical students due to its complexity and dense content. Traditional learning methods, like lectures and textbooks, form the foundation of medical education but may not always sustain student engagement. Gamification, which incorporates game design elements into educational contexts, has shown promise as a supplemental tool to increase motivation and comprehension. This activity uses a proof-of-concept board game, The Immunology Game, to evaluate whether it could support and enhance students' understanding and enjoyment of immunology alongside traditional educational methods.Participants were 41 first- and second-year medical students from Noorda College of Osteopathic Medicine, divided into two cohorts based on their lack of prior exposure to immunology courses (cohort 1; n = 24) or current enrollment in immunology coursework (cohort 2; n = 17). Students were then invited to play the game. Pre- and postgame quizzes measured knowledge improvement, while Likert-scale surveys (5-point ratings; 1 = strongly disagree , 5 = strongly agree ) captured students' perceptions of enjoyment, usability, and learning, as well as feedback.

This study explores how combining large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs (KGs) within IMLS can create adaptive, customized learning experiences. Leveraging the sophisticated natural language understanding and generation capabilities of LLMs, the system enables dynamic interactions between learners and educational content, offering real-time feedback and personalized guidance. At the same time, knowledge graphs provide a well-organized framework for structuring educational materials, detailing the relationships among concepts, skills, and learner profiles. By integrating these technologies, the system can intelligently assess individual learner needs, predict learning trajectories, and tailor instructional strategies accordingly. Empirical evaluations across various educational settings have shown significant enhancements in learner engagement, knowledge retention, and overall academic performance. This research highlights the promising potential of merging advanced language models with semantic knowledge representations to develop scalable and effective personalized education solutions that cater to the unique needs of every learner. This study addresses the existing gap in combining large language models and knowledge graphs for personalized education by proposing a novel integrated framework. Our empirical results demonstrate significant improvements in learner engagement and knowledge retention, highlighting the robustness and scalability of the approach.",

    "Abstract": "Effective succession planning is critical for leadership continuity and operational stability in U.S. federal agencies, yet challenges such as leadership turnover, knowledge loss, and strategic disruptions persist. This qualitative exploratory case study examined senior leaders’ perceptions of current succession planning methodologies, their effectiveness, and the barriers associated with implementation. Data were collected through 57 semi-structured interviews and 15 focus group sessions, with 10 interviews and 10 focus groups analyzed due to data saturation. Thematic analysis revealed key challenges, including mentorship gaps, resource constraints, and private-sector competition. While some agencies reported structured leadership development efforts, findings indicated inconsistencies in implementation and persistent bureaucratic barriers. The study concluded that federal agencies must institutionalize mentorship, strengthen leadership pipelines, and address systemic obstacles to improve succession outcomes.

    "Abstract": "Numerous studies have documented Indonesia's food and medicinal plant knowledge. Although ethnobotanical practices in Indonesia have been extensively studied, research on the traditional knowledge preserved by the Indonesian diaspora remains scarce. Therefore, this study sets out to understand how these practices are retained or transformed among Indonesians who been dispersed from their home, in particular those who have migrated to the United States. Semi-structured interviews with 66 key informants and a survey of 124 respondents were conducted. The results were analyzed using the relative frequency of citation (RFC) index, Shannon diversity index (H’), and principal com analysis (PCA) to understand how social and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, length of residence, and participant’s age at arrival in the host country influence traditional knowledge, cultivation practices, and plant use. According to responses from the interviewees, a total of 131 plant species representing 98 genera and 57 families have been cultivated by the member of the Indonesian diaspora in the United States. Our study also identified five plant species with the highest level of utilization, including Citrus hystrix DC, Syzygium polyanthum (Wight) Walp, Curcuma longa L), Ocimum basilicum L., and Manihot esculenta Crantz. In addition, our analysis revealed the importance of age at migration as a key factor in knowledge retention while long-term residence may challenge the continuity of traditional ethnobotanical practices among Indonesian migrants. We also recorded the cultivation management practices employed by informants in the United States, which include container cultivation, intercropping systems, and organic farming. Overall, our study provides insights into how traditional plant knowledge is preserved by Indonesian diaspora in the new environment. It also reveals challenges faced by Indonesian diaspora in sourcing food and medicinal plants, and ways they adapt with local substitutes. These ethnobotanical insights can play a role in formulating conservation strategies and stimulate demand for Indonesian food and medicinal plants.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Children with Down syndrome (DS) often experience cognitive and adaptive challenges that affect their ability to acquire and retain critical life skills, including those needed for effective response during emergencies. Traditional training methods used to prepare children for crises are frequently static, noninteractive, and insufficiently tailored to the unique learning profiles of children with DS. These limitations contribute to reduced engagement, poor knowledge retention, and inadequate real-world preparedness. Recent advancements in game-based learning, particularly serious games, have demonstrated potential for enhancing education and skill development among individuals with cognitive impairments. Objective: This study aimed to design, implement, and evaluate Risk Resist, an adaptive serious game developed to improve emergency preparedness in children with DS. The game incorporates a dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm that personalizes the learning experience by dynamically modifying game difficulty based on real-time behavioral performance metrics. The study also assessed whether this adaptive game-based learning approach leads to superior learning gains and engagement compared to conventional teacher-led training. Methods: A quasi-experimental, between-group design was used with 18 children diagnosed with DS, aged 8 to 12 years. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n=9), which played Risk Resist, or a control group (n=9), which received traditional instruction on emergency scenarios. Learning outcomes were assessed using pre- and postintervention knowledge tests composed of 5 emergency-related questions. Engagement levels were measured through a structured 5-point Likert scale questionnaire completed by observing teachers. The game used a machine learning–driven dynamic difficulty adjustment model, specifically a Random Forest Regressor, which adjusted difficulty in response to individual performance indicators such as success rate, response time, and behavioral patterns during gameplay. Results: The experimental group achieved significantly higher learning gains (mean 3.6, SD 0.5) than the control group (mean 2.0, SD 0.5; P <.001). Engagement levels were also significantly greater in the game-based group (mean 4.54, SD 0.4) compared to the control group (mean 4.01, SD 0.32; P =.002). A strong positive correlation was identified between engagement and learning gain ( r =0.85; P <.001), indicating that higher engagement contributed directly to improved knowledge acquisition. Conclusions: The results support the effectiveness of Risk Resist in enhancing both engagement and learning outcomes for children with DS. The integration of adaptive difficulty algorithms provides a personalized, responsive learning experience, positioning serious games as a viable and impactful tool for emergency preparedness training in special education settings.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Virtual & Augmented Reality Simulations (ICVARS) Conference Start Date: 2025 July 25 Conference End Date: 2025 July 27 Conference Location: Birmingham, United Kingdom Disaster preparedness training is essential for enhancing the effectiveness and resilience of first responders. Conventional tabletop exercises (TTX) have been widely used for disaster training due to their structured yet low-risk nature. However, limitations such as a lack of realism and engagement necessitate innovative approaches. This study explores the integration of augmented reality (AR) technology into TTX to enhance training effectiveness. This study utilises an exploratory sequential mixed-methods research design in three phases. Phase 1 involved collecting qualitative data through document analysis, in-depth interviews, and non-participatory observations to develop a realistic disaster scenario. Phase 2 transforms the identified disaster scenario into an AR-based TTX application using the Rapid Application Development (RAD) model. Phase 3 assesses the validity and usability of the AR-based TTX through a pilot study involving twenty undergraduate final-year nursing students who had undertaken an elective course (NURD 4412: Elective Disaster Nursing), evaluated using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results demonstrate that the developed AR application provided an immersive and interactive training experience, fostering better engagement and realism than conventional TTX methods. The pilot study yields a SUS score of 58.4, classifying the application as “Not acceptable” in terms of usability, which indicates that it faces significant usability issues when used in a tabletop exercise as an approach to sustainable disaster preparedness training. Key advantages included improved knowledge retention, real-time interaction, and enhanced decision-making skills among participants. However, limitations such as device compatibility issues and the need for technical support were identified, suggesting areas for future improvements. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of AR-based TTX as an innovative and sustainable approach to disaster preparedness training. The findings underscore the need for further enhancements to optimise user experience and broaden accessibility, ultimately strengthening the capacity of emergency responders to manage disaster scenarios effectively.",

However, traditional VR learning that incorporates haptic feedback usually has a limited body coverage, and there is a weak alignment between the haptic feedback and the educational content. To address the above-mentioned issues, this study established an environment that combines VR with dynamic somatosensory feedback. Through the simulation of the human blood circulation, it explored the impacts of VR and somatosensory feedback on learning effects. Sixty participants were randomly divided into three groups: the computer-based group, the VR-only group, and the VR with somatosensory feedback group. Self-efficacy, perceived enjoyment, and knowledge retention were evaluated through targeted questionnaires. The results showed that VR with somatosensory feedback significantly outperformed the computer-based and VR-only learning modes. This study provides new insights and practical support for the effective integration of VR and somatosensory feedback technology in educational environments.",

As technological advances continue to shape many aspects of life, incorporating gamification into prenatal education has emerged as an innovative approach. Therefore, the present study aimed to review the use of educational interventions based on gamification in prenatal care. In the present study, studies indexed in PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases were searched for until March 2023. The main keywords and synonyms of gamification and pregnancy were used to search for studies. The inclusion criteria were English language studies with a gamification intervention and RCT. Abstracts of studies or conferences, book chapters, review articles, and non-randomized studies were excluded from the study. The Jadad scale was used to assess the quality of the studies. Five clinical trials were reviewed. The effects of gamification-based education were divided into four categories: effectiveness of gamification in acquiring knowledge, effectiveness of gamification in increasing prenatal healthcare, emotional and psychological benefits, and compliance with prenatal healthcare advice. Gamification can positively affect pregnancy outcomes through increasing knowledge retention, improving attitudes, promoting healthy behaviors, and reducing stress and anxiety.Gamification takes advantage of game designs to add dynamicity to educational environments and develop students' sociocognitive skills.

Young children will benefit from this game. Given the rising obesity rates in Malaysia and the growing prevalence of diverse fusion cuisines, it is imperative to address unhealthy eating habits among young children, a pivotal age group for shaping long-term nutritional behaviors. This study explores the usability and effectiveness of the All You Can Eat (AYCE) game as an educational tool for promoting healthy eating habits among young children. The game employs interactive, gamified learning to engage users in making informed nutritional choices. Participants were assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS) to quantitatively measure the game's usability, including perceived ease of use, efficiency, and satisfaction. Additional measures evaluated cognitive load and comprehension of healthy eating concepts. Results indicated that the A Y CE game successfully engaged users while effectively conveying key nutritional concepts. The game was well-received, with participants reporting high levels of usability and satisfaction. These findings suggest that gamified educational tools like A YCE can be valuable in promoting healthy eating habits among young adults. Further research will explore the long-term impact of such tools on behaviour change and nutritional knowledge retention.",

This study presents the Dynamic Integration and Optimization of NetCyber Activities (DIONA) system which is an AI-enhanced educational tool developed from the NetFusion Learning Academy (NLA) to tackle ongoing issues in conventional cybersecurity education, including restricted adaptability, absence of real-time feedback, and inadequate practical skill application. The study employs a systematic methodology based on four distinct objectives: (1) to assess the efficacy of NLA in improving student learning across five critical domains— knowledge retention, practical skills, engagement, conceptual understanding, and problem-solving; (2) to examine student and faculty perceptions of its educational value; (3) to develop the ACTIVE AI Framework for AI-driven pedagogy; and (4) to create and validate DIONA as an AI/ML-based experiential learning platform. Statistical and thematic analyses indicated that although NLA effectively enhances knowledge and engagement, deficiencies persist in practical skills and problem-solving, necessitating the incorporation of AI-powered tools. The ACTIVE AI Framework and DIONA system offer customized learning trajectories, AI-generated feedback, and immersive simulations that correspond with authentic cybersecurity challenges. Results endorse the significance of intelligent learning analytics and specialized AI systems in transforming technical education and equipping students for changing digital environments.",

This innovative system combines image-to-3D generation, large language models, and text-to-image models to create progressive clues within a virtual campus. Learners engage in thematic zones, interact with AI-powered non-playable characters, and manipulate artifact items—creating, fusing, or exchanging them—to steer their own discovery process.At the heart of MetaClues is the goal of uncovering or recreating a secret artifact, a multidisciplinary item rich with educational significance. Learners follow progressive clues tied to a relevance score for each item they possess. This scoring system evaluates an item’s connection to the secret artifact across multiple dimensions, offering insights into its value. To unlock additional clues, learners must create, fuse, or exchange items, refining their understanding of the artifact based on these scores. This adaptive approach strikes a balance between structured, domain-specific learning and open-ended creativity, fostering active engagement.A pilot study with 19 participants showed notable improvements in participation, knowledge retention, and motivation to explore further. Impressively, 84% of novice learners gained a substantive understanding of multidisciplinary concepts. Evaluations using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) confirmed high usability and educational impact.Using generative AI as a collaborative tool, MetaClues aims to transform learners from passive recipients into creative problem solvers. Our research demonstrated how constructivist principles can be blended with generative AI and immersive technology to enrich multidisciplinary education.",

However, they still face challenges in handling knowledge-intensive tasks within the power domain, including insufficient factual accuracy, difficulties in knowledge updating, and a scarcity of high-quality domain-specific datasets. In order to address these challenges, this paper aims to design specifically a system for knowledge-intensive question answering tasks in the electric power domain. The proposed system incorporates an enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy that integrates a hybrid retrieval strategy and a finetuned model to provide more efficient knowledge acquisition and updating capabilities. Additionally, the system incorporates LLMbased prompt engineering techniques to enhance the coherence of responses to questions. Experimental results show that the question answering system effectively improves the accuracy of retrieving and answering power-related knowledge and reduces hallucinations. Furthermore, ablation experiments indicate that RAG module has the greatest impact on system performance, with the overall accuracy decreasing by 18.6 % without this component.",

    "Abstract": "The adoption of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and other Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) introduces benefits and challenges for drivers. Drivers who use those driving technologies should develop accurate mental models, appropriately calibrate trust, and effectively apply automation in real-world scenarios. This dissertation examines how different text-based training influence drivers’ learning, engagement, and training transfer when using ACC, with a focus on both younger and older adults. A series of driving simulator studies compared several training conditions with or without different types of driving roles and responsibilities information. The study assessed how these training methods impact drivers’ comprehension, trust, and performance in edge-case driving scenarios. Results suggest that training presentation and structure significantly influences learning and transfer outcomes. Older participants, in particular, exhibited increased attention to system limitations, and scaffolding training content improved knowledge retention and application. These findings highlight the importance of structuring driver education programs to support better mental model development and trust calibration, ultimately enhancing the safe and effective use of ACC.",

    "Abstract": "Personalized federated learning (PFL) allows clients to collaboratively train their personalized models to handle situations where data from different clients are not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). Previous PFL research implicitly assumes that clients benefit most from those with similar data distributions. Correspondingly, methods such as personalized weight aggregation assign higher weights to similar clients during aggregation. We pose a question: can a client benefit from other clients with dissimilar data distributions, and if so, how? This question is particularly relevant in scenarios with a high degree of non-IID, where clients have widely different distributions, and learning from only similar clients will result in a loss of knowledge from many other clients. We note that when dealing with clients with similar distributions, current methods tend to enforce their models to be close in the parameter space. It is reasonable to conjecture that a client can benefit from dissimilar clients if we allow their models to depart from each other. Based on this idea, we propose DiversiFed, which allows each client to learn from clients with diversified distribution. DiversiFed pushes personalized models of clients with dissimilar distributions apart in the parameter space while pulling together those with similar distributions. In addition, to achieve the above effect without using prior knowledge of distribution, we design a loss function that leverages model similarity to determine the degree of attraction and repulsion between any two models. Experiments on benchmark and medical datasets show that DiversiFed can outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by up to 3.19%.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this systematic review is to explore the role of Virtual Reality (VR) toward academic mentorship and career decision-making. This review synthesized 25 experimental and qualitative studies on the subject of VR simulations engaging in informed academic specialization choices, published between 2013 and 2023. A structured analysis of studies is done on IEEE Explorer, PubMed, and Google Scholar using pre-defined criteria for the methodology. One of the major downsides of traditional mentorship systems is that they face resource shortage that prevents them from offering personal guidance. VR provides this through immersive, real-world simulations that students experience with a possible career path. For example, VR-based simulations in the workplace allow for exploration of different professional environments and increase the level of confidence in making decisions. The study discovers that VR-based mentoring is almost 45% better for engagement, 30% better for decision confidence and 50% better for knowledge retention than traditional methods. However, high implementation costs and challenges of accessibility are still the main barriers for the wide spread adoption. Future research on low priced, available VR solutions and how VR should be used in tone with existent frameworks for education. These findings provide an opportunity to use VR in transforming academic mentorship, to enable an interactive, data driven, and more global approach to career exploration for students.",

    "Abstract": "Head and neck anatomy is a complex topic for students to learn and educators to teach. The current, most common pedagogical approach is student-conducted dissection.

The current, most common pedagogical approach is student-conducted dissection. However, dissection of this region can be difficult, may be stressful, and might not optimally impart the foundational knowledge necessary to understand clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we developed an instructor-guided, situated learning workshop using prosections of the infratemporal fossa and retromandibular region. This workshop aimed to reduce learner stress and improve their knowledge of these anatomic areas.Twenty-four first-year medical students, who were enrolled in a dissection-based anatomy course, participated in the 40-minute, instructor-facilitated workshop. Students completed a survey and a pre/postworkshop test to gauge perceived stress levels and knowledge retention. Mean values of the pre/postworshop tests were compared using a paired two-sample t test. Methods Twenty-four first-year medical students, who were enrolled in a dissection-based anatomy course, participated in the 40-minute, instructor-facilitated workshop. Students completed a survey and a pre/postworkshop test to gauge perceived stress levels and knowledge retention. Mean values of the pre/postworshop tests were compared using a paired two-sample t test.Workshop participation significantly improved student learning of head and neck anatomic subregions. Postworkshop knowledge scores were significantly higher than preworkshop scores (mean of 8.75 [95% CI, 8.12-9.38] vs. 4.79 [95% CI, 3.68-5.90]; p < .001). Additionally, in 75% of the survey answers, the learners reported mild or no stress during the workshop (36 of 48 total replies). Results Workshop participation significantly improved student learning of head and neck anatomic subregions. Postworkshop knowledge scores were significantly higher than preworkshop scores (mean of 8.75 [95% CI, 8.12-9.38] vs. 4.79 [95% CI, 3.68-5.90]; p < .001). Additionally, in 75% of the survey answers, the learners reported mild or no stress during the workshop (36 of 48 total replies).Our findings suggest that a prosection-centered, instructor-guided workshop is an effective and low-stress approach for teaching students complex head and neck anatomy. This workshop can serve as an alternative to, or enhancement of, student-conducted dissection of the area. Although originally designed for medical students, the approach may also benefit learners in other health professions.

    "Abstract": "Adolescents may not necessarily have a specific mental health challenge to seek information on mental health. They may be genuinely curious on how to better understand these issues, especially when mental health is being discussed in school, among peers and with parents. The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency and factors associated with online information seeking about mental health among adolescents. A total of 702 high school students from Belgrade, Serbia, participated in the study and filled in an anonymous questionnaire about sociodemographics, digital behaviors and the Electronic Health Literacy Scale (eHEALS). The prevalence of seeking information about mental health in our study sample was 23.5% (165/702). The multivariate model showed that having a lower school performance, lower eHEALS score and browsing health blogs, social media and websites run by physicians and health institutions were independently associated with online information seeking about mental health. Additionally, searching for online information about psychoactive substances, bullying and medications was independently associated with online information seeking about mental health among adolescents. Adolescents are familiar with a variety of sources of online health information, but choose specific online platforms to read about mental health. These platforms could be utilized to promote mental well-being in high schools. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract) Impact statement In efforts made by the government and institutions to raise awareness and enhance mental health literacy, adolescents might be interested in expanding their understanding of mental health by using the Internet, regardless of whether or not they encounter mental health challenges. The present study found that one in four high school students seeks online information about mental health. These adolescents were more likely to be females, have lower school performance and have lower e-health literacy levels. They are more likely to use health blogs, social media and websites run by physicians and health institutions, as well as seek information about psychoactive substances, bullying and medications. Websites and Internet platforms can use these study findings to adjust and adapt information delivery regarding mental health to optimize comprehension and knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center is an academic medical institution with an 80-year history of innovation in cancer care, research, and prevention. Located in the largest medical center in the world, the Texas Medical Center, in Houston, Texas, MD Anderson is a specialized organization of over 25,000 employees entrusted to care for and treat some of the most difficult cancer diagnoses. This chapter examines a case study from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, where concerns arose that 40% of the workforce in one division would be eligible for retirement within the next five years. Recognizing the risk this posed to institutional knowledge and innovation, a project was undertaken to assess the fragility of the division's knowledge-sharing network. The analysis focused on identifying how information flowed within and across departments and pinpointing individuals who held essential knowledge that would be difficult to replace if lost. By mapping these networks and highlighting key knowledge holders, the project informed targeted interventions to strengthen knowledge transfer and retention. The case underscores the importance of addressing knowledge continuity in organizations that rely heavily on relationships to drive creativity and innovation.

    "Abstract": "This research explains Sustainable Development (SD) and explores the significance of sustainability education in the 21st century. The research points out the potential of gamification as a tool to enhance sustainable education. By integrating game elements into learning experiences, gamification can increase student engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention. The research goes deep into the benefits of gamification in promoting sustainable behaviours, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and collaboration. However, it also acknowledges the challenges associated with implementing gamification, such as technical infrastructure, pedagogical alignment, and the complexity of sustainability issues and suggests some simple feasible remedial measures that can be implemented. By addressing these challenges and utilizing the opportunities offered by gamification, educators can create innovative and effective learning experiences that foster a sustainable future.",

    "Abstract": "Research reports that interesting but irrelevant information, seductive details, in teaching material can impede learning. In science education, the inclusion of historical narratives in lessons to promote interest has been recommended but may hinder learning. This study examines the impact of seductive details on UK high school students' knowledge retention from video explanations. The research adopted a mixed methods approach. In the first study, an online survey (N = 101) randomized participants to watch video explanations of two physics topics (dark matter and tracers), with seductive details or without, and compared pre-, post-, and delayed knowledge test scores. Six participants were interviewed. In the second study, nine participants took part in a think-aloud protocol while watching videos to examine perceptions of the videos. In the first study, the seductive details in one topic (dark matter) harmed learning (p > 0.01, [chi-squared] = 0.114), but not in the second (tracer, p = 0.166). Data from the think-aloud task indicate an explanation for the mixed effect. Seductive details may both impede learning but also promote attention to core content, chunk material, and provide structure into which new content can be anchored when prior knowledge is low. Seductive details should be used with caution. They have the potential to impede learning, but, in some contexts, their negative impact on learning may be limited. Their effects depend on the context. The inclusion of seductive details in video explanations should not be ruled out, and we present guidance for reducing the impediment that interesting but inessential details can cause.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional teaching methods in Aircraft Maintenance Technology (AMT) often struggle to maintain student engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention. While gamification has been recognised as a potential solution, its application in AMT education remains underexplored, particularly in bridging theoretical knowledge with practical skill acquisition. This study investigates the effectiveness of Kahoot-based gamification in enhancing student engagement, motivation, knowledge retention, and practical skills development. A mixed-methods approach was employed, integrating quantitative surveys, pre- and post-assessments, and qualitative interviews with students and instructors. The study assessed 120 participants, revealing statistically significant improvements: engagement increased by 43.8%, motivation by 55.2%, knowledge retention by 41.2%, and practical skills by 51.6%. Qualitative findings supported these results, with students reporting higher participation, improved concept recall, and greater enthusiasm. Instructors observed enhanced confidence in applying theoretical knowledge. Despite these benefits, challenges such as internet connectivity issues, time constraints, and question format limitations were identified. The study recommends a blended learning approach integrating gamification with hands-on training, scenario-based exercises, and emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Beyond AMT, these findings highlight gamification's potential in technical and vocational education, emphasising the need for future research on adaptive gamification models and AI-driven learning platforms.",

    "Abstract": "The Instrumental Analytical Chemistry course, taught in the fifth semester across several programs at the Faculty of Exact Sciences of the National University of La Plata, places a significant emphasis on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This versatile analytical technique is essential for the separation, identification, and quantification of compounds in various matrices with widespread applications spanning analytical chemistry, biochemistry, pharmaceuticals, forensics, environmental science, and the food industry. Despite its importance, practical HPLC training faces challenges related to the expense of instrumentation and consumables, the significant time investment required for experiments, and the technical expertise needed for operation. To address these limitations, simulation software offers an effective approach to teaching the fundamental concepts of HPLC and demonstrating the influence of different variables on chromatographic separations. This study explores the use of the freely available Practical HPLC simulator v1.0 as a supplementary tool for hands-on HPLC activities in the regular curriculum. The pedagogical framework for the designed activities is Kolb's experiential learning theory, which guides a sequence involving an introductory session on the simulator's features and capabilities, followed by teacher-led group simulations and an evaluation of learning through individual and group problem-solving tasks. Initial findings from the implementation of the HPLC simulator indicate a notable enhancement in students' comprehension of the foundational principles of the technique. Furthermore, the simulator enriches practical HPLC exercises by providing clearer explanations, improving knowledge retention via practical engagement and increasing student motivation and interest, thereby fostering greater participation. In conclusion, this innovation offers a valuable and flexible tool for the comprehensive training of students by integrating theoretical knowledge, practical application, and problem-solving skills. Consequently, this initiative presents a significant opportunity to optimize student education in liquid chromatography, more effectively equipping students for future academic and professional endeavors.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The demand for effective disaster preparedness training in hospitals is steadily increasing, as healthcare staff need to handle emergencies efficiently while providing patient care. However, conventional training methods like live drills and tabletop exercises can require significant resources, limit participation, and disrupt hospital operations. In light of these challenges, Virtual Reality (VR) training has emerged as a modern solution, offering an innovative way to improve training efficiency without interfering with routine hospital activities. This study, therefore, examines how VR training compares to traditional methods in preparing hospital personnel for disasters, focusing specifically on effectiveness and cost. Methods: We reviewed studies concerning the effectiveness and economic assessments of VR compared to traditional methods. To answer the research questions, we followed the Canada Drug Agency's guides on conducting a health technology assessment. Articles were identified from both peer-reviewed and gray literature. Results: The review highlights eight pertinent studies demonstrating VR's advantages, including boosting knowledge retention, performance, and overall confidence among healthcare professionals in disaster preparedness. Furthermore, the economic analysis indicates that although the initial costs of VR synchronous training may be higher, the long-term savings from reduced ongoing training and maintenance can lead to greater cost efficiency. In addition, while VR training presents safety benefits, challenges such as cybersickness and accessibility concerns have also been observed. Conclusion: VR training offers considerable advantages over traditional disaster preparedness methods and significantly improves healthcare workers' confidence and skills. Despite the high upfront costs, the potential long-term financial benefits appear promising. To maximize results, funding for VR initiatives must emphasize demonstrated effectiveness alongside ongoing research to explore broader applications and address the challenges posed by these emerging technologies.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigated teachers' perceptions on the impact of gamification on student engagement and learning outcomes in Nigerian primary schools, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional teaching methods and contemporary learner needs. A mixed-methods approach was utilised, involving quantitative and qualitative data collection through an online survey distributed to 82 primary school teachers. The results revealed that most of the respondents incorporated gamification techniques weekly, with badges and points being the most frequently used elements. Gamification was most commonly applied in Maths, followed by English, Science and other subjects. Teachers perceived significant positive impacts on academic achievement, student participation and knowledge retention, though challenges such as lack of technological resources, curriculum alignment, scepticism from stakeholders, and insufficient teacher training were highlighted. Thematic analysis of qualitative data identified themes related to enhancing problem-solving abilities, catering to diverse learning styles and fostering healthy competition. Despite challenges, the study found unanimous support for gamification, with teachers willing to undergo further professional development. The findings suggest that gamification holds promise for transforming educational environments in Nigerian primary schools by promoting active engagement, motivation, and improved academic performance, although addressing technological and training barriers remains crucial.",

    "Abstract": "In the postgraduate fire safety engineering programme, students come from diverse educational backgrounds, leading to varying levels of familiarity with the fundamental principles essential for understanding fire engineering concepts. As a result, a significant amount of new knowledge must be delivered, which often increases the cognitive load on students. To address this, instructional design should focus on minimising unnecessary cognitive load on students' working memory. This paper applies specific methodologies derived from Cognitive Load Theory to reduce cognitive load in an intensive teaching mode implemented across two fire safety engineering courses. To enhance student learning, constructivist principles were also applied by reinforcing student involvement during lectures through active learning strategies. The learning performance of forty students was assessed through pre- and post-lecture tests, including multiple-choice and discussion-type questions, and the results were compared to evaluate their retention of key concepts taught in class. The findings show that nearly all students demonstrated improvement in the post-lecture tests, retaining new knowledge in both their short-term and long-term memory. The performance of different student groups--categorised by enrolment status, work experience, and academic background--was also analysed and compared. The findings indicated that students with professional experience in the fire industry performed slightly better than those without such experience. Student scores increased significantly, with notable improvements in both multiple-choice and discussion-type questions. In interviews, students highlighted that techniques used during lectures, such as interactive breaks and rehearsal sessions after each segment, were instrumental in helping them absorb content and enhance long-term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Background The Kazakh people of Altay, Xinjiang, possess rich traditional knowledge associated with medicinal food plants (MFPs), shaped by their nomadic pastoralist heritage and the unique mountain-grassland ecosystems of the region. However, this biocultural heritage remains insufficiently documented and is increasingly threatened by human’s economic activities, rapid globalization, climate change, and generational knowledge loss. This study aimed to record MFPs, evaluate their cultural and ecological relevance, and assess their conservation challenges. Methods Ethnobotanical fieldwork was conducted in 2012 and 2017 across Altay Prefecture. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews with 100 key informants, including traditional healers, herders, and merchants, complemented by focal group discussions, field observations, and voucher specimen collection. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Herbarium of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ethnomedicine (XJNM). Use-value (UV) index was calculated to assess the relative importance of each species. Traditional knowledge, edible applications, and sustainability concerns were systematically documented. Results A total of 118 MFP species were identified, belonging to 37 families and 85 genera. Rosaceae (12.7%), Asteraceae (7.6%), Polygonaceae (7.6%) and Fabaceae (7.6%) were the most represented families. Herbaceous plants dominated (69.5%), with fruits (33.9%) and roots (20.3%) being the primary edible parts. Species with the highest medicinal UV included Glycyrrhiza uralensis (UV = 0.56), Taraxacum officinale (UV = 0.41), and Codonopsis pilosula (UV = 0.34). MFPs were primarily used to treat digestive (26.1%) and respiratory (17.7%) ailments, reflecting the health challenges associated with a nomadic lifestyle. These plants are also deeply embedded in cultural practices, including seasonal dietary customs (e.g., sea buckthorn jam), spiritual rituals, and ecological taboos such as phenology-based harvest timing. Key threats to MFPs sustainability include overharvesting (30.5% of species are now cultivated to mitigate pressure), climate change impacts on alpine habitats, and the erosion of traditional knowledge, as only 9% of informants with rich knowledge of MFPs were under the age of 30. Conclusions Kazakh MFPs represent a culturally integrated “medicine-food continuum” intricately adapted to local ecological conditions. Sustainable utilization requires the incorporation of traditional knowledge—such as phenology-informed harvesting practices—into conservation strategies, the promotion of community-led cultivation of vulnerable species, and the documentation of associated cultural practices. Given accelerating environmental and sociocultural shifts, urgent efforts are needed to preserve this fragile biocultural heritage.",

    "Abstract": "Background In Oral Pathology, traditional slide-based teaching methods often focus on passive observation which may not completely ignite the pathology resident’s critical thinking and diagnostic capabilities. Hence we designed and evaluated a modified teaching method which was integrating Problem-Based Learning (PBL) with Six Thinking Hats (STH) methodology in enhancing diagnostic skills in the assessment of diagnostically challenging cases. Methods A cohort of n  = 15 Oral Pathology residents were included for the study. Their diagnostic accuracy, critical thinking, and knowledge retention were assessed through traditional slide-based teaching and a PBL integrated with STH approach. The PBL-STH framework engaged residents in a multi-perspective analysis of clinical data, histopathological features, and immunohistochemical markers (e.g., CD20, CD138), using structured group discussions based on the six thinking hats to foster collaborative decision-making. Results Diagnostic accuracy significantly improved with the PBL-STH method, with 86.6% of residents accurately diagnosing DLBCL compared to 40% in traditional teaching. Critical thinking and risk analysis were markedly higher with PBL-STH (93.3% vs. 30%), and peer collaboration was observed in all PBL-STH sessions. Additionally, knowledge retention after two weeks was better among residents trained with the PBL-STH approach (90% vs. 55%), and overall satisfaction was significantly higher (93% vs. 50%). Conclusion The PBL integrated with STH approach offers substantial benefits over traditional teaching methods, improving diagnostic accuracy, critical thinking, engagement, and knowledge retention in Oral Pathology. This innovative methodology encourages deeper analysis and collaboration, proving to be a highly effective educational tool for complex diagnostic cases especially in oral pathology which is the backbone for treatment, follow up, prognosis and quality of life of patients Also, implementation of PBL-STH in medical and dental curricula could enhance clinical reasoning and diagnostic skills across specialties.",

    "Abstract": "This study presents a novel approach for transferring expert tacit knowledge to construction students through a cross-modal deep learning supported mixed reality training system. Traditional construction training faces challenges in effectively capturing and transmitting the implicit expertise of experienced practitioners. We developed a framework that integrates multimodal data collection from construction experts with cross-modal deep learning algorithms to identify critical knowledge patterns and represent them in an immersive mixed reality environment. Experimental validation with 80 participants demonstrated that students trained using this system achieved 32.4% faster skill acquisition, 22.4% higher accuracy in construction tasks, and significantly better knowledge retention compared to traditional methods. The system particularly excelled in transferring situational awareness and adaptive problem-solving capabilities. Results indicate that cross-modal deep learning approaches can successfully formalize expert tacit knowledge into learnable representations, providing a scalable solution for construction education that addresses industry challenges of workforce development and knowledge preservation. Despite these promising results, the study acknowledges limitations including computational latency challenges during complex interactions and hardware ergonomic constraints during extended training sessions.",

The proposed FL-RSD framework enhances model generalization, mitigates overfitting to non-IID data, and improves adaptability to new malware variants. The RSD process iteratively transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a lightweight student model, reducing model complexity and communication overhead while preserving detection accuracy. Experimental results have confirmed that FL-RSD achieves significant performance improvements over baseline models in terms of malware detection accuracy and adversarial robustness. FL-RSD attains a malware detection accuracy and an average adversarial robustness scores over 92%, outperforming Federated Proximal, FedNova, and Hierarchical FL. The improvements range from 3% to 48% for detection accuracy, and 6% to 81% for the adversarial robustness score. Additionally, FL-RSD demonstrates a minimal memory footprint with a final global model size of 373.17 KB and maintains knowledge retention with an Average Catastrophic Forgetting Score of 93.66%. These results confirm that FL-RSD offers a lightweight, efficient, and scalable solution for malware detection in IoV.",

Introduction Cancer remains a leading global health issue and has been the leading cause of death in Taiwan for over four decades. In recent years, ethnomedicines have gained growing attention as complementary therapies in cancer treatment. However, systematic investigations linking traditional medicinal practices with cancer remain limited. This study aims to explore the types, preparation methods, and parts used of anticancer ethnomedicines and cancer types across different regions in Taiwan through ethnobotanical surveys, and to preserve and transmit traditional knowledge.Data were collected through questionnaire-based interviews with 210 participants, sampled proportionally by region, age, gender, and education based on national demographics. Methods Data were collected through questionnaire-based interviews with 210 participants, sampled proportionally by region, age, gender, and education based on national demographics.Chi-squared tests showed that only education level significantly influenced the number of anticancer ethnomedicines mentioned ( p < 0.001), suggesting that Taiwan's policies promoting traditional medicine education may enhance knowledge retention. A total of 159 ethnomedicines were mentioned, with 146 plant species classified into 66 families, predominantly Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, and Fabaceae. The most commonly used plant parts were whole herba for herbaceous species, herba and radix for lianas, and leaves for trees and shrubs. Water decoction was the most frequently reported preparation method. The top ten mentioned ethnomedicines were traditionally used for a broader range of cancers than reported in the PubMed literature, especially for breast, lung, liver, and colorectal cancers, showing high consistency between traditional usage and modern scientific findings. Consensus factor analysis revealed high agreement among respondents regarding remedies for the ten most common cancers in Taiwan, except for prostate and oral cancers, possibly due to clinical treatment limitations or low questionnaire response rate. Taiwan's cultural diversity, linguistic unity, and unique geographical environment facilitate the accurate and comprehensive collection of ethnomedicinal data, leading to more valuable research outcomes.

    "Abstract": "The problem addressed in this study was many learners do not retain the knowledge or apply the skills they have learned after attending mandatory training. The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to explore the state agency learners' experiences regarding their knowledge retention and application of skills after attending mandatory training. Participants included nine agency employees (learners) from diverse divisions who had attended at least two trainings and had a minimum of six months’ tenure. Data collection involved qualitative methods, grounded in Malcolm Knowles' Adult Learning Theory. Additionally, participants emphasized that training must be directly relevant to their job and supported by supervisors to be effective. Recommendations include adopting a blended, multimodal training approach, providing take-away resources and reinforcement opportunities, and equipping supervisors with tools to reinforce learning. Malcolm Knowles’ theory of andragogy emphasizes that adult learners differ from children. Adults see themselves as self-directed and want greater autonomy in their learning. They bring prior experiences that shape and enrich the learning process. Readiness to learn is tied to real-life roles and responsibilities, making adults more motivated when content is immediately relevant. Their orientation to learning is problem-centered rather than content-centered, with a preference for practical application over abstract theory. Motivation tends to come more from internal drivers, such as personal growth, job satisfaction, or improved self-confidence, than from external pressures. Finally, adults need to understand the purpose and value of what they are learning before fully engaging.

Traditionally, cybersecurity training participants have shown low concentration levels and poor retention of the material presented. Gamification methods represent a new and potentially practical approach to dealing with these combined challenges by introducing game-like elements into education. This paper provides a gamified adaptive architecture that modifies the training content based on user performance and learning behaviour. The system designed will merge machine learning algorithms with gamification mechanics that are individualised to engage users optimally and facilitate knowledge acquisition. A six-month experimental study with 240 participants in three different organisational settings confirmed the efficacy of the system. Results indicate significant improvements in user engagement metrics, thereby increasing completion rates by 73% compared to traditional approaches to training. Knowledge retention tests indicated sustained improvement after three months post-training, at 68%. Security awareness behaviours showed measurable improvement: incident reporting increased by 45%, and policy compliance increased by 52%. While meeting individual cognitive preferences and organisational security needs was a personalised learning experience, one had an adaptive framework, and engagement metrics were kept high.",

Our work pushes beyond this speculation through a study that attempts to clarify the mechanism that drives the efficacy of a patient-centric narrative serious game named Strong Together. Through a randomized experiment across four groups, corresponding with four distinct versions of the game with individual gameplay features modified, we evaluate the impact of three common gameplay features present in Strong Together: “soft” fail states, implicit audio-visual feedback, and a third-person narrative perspective. Based on pre and posttest questionnaires and gameplay analytics captured for 190 participants, we found in the case of Strong Together that feedback mechanisms, failure conditions, and player perspectives significantly influenced player engagement, decision-making times, and self-advocacy knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: In recent years, the use of gamification has been growing in health education. In undergraduate nursing programs, it aims to enhance motivation, engagement, knowledge retention, and professional competencies. However, the evidence often combining nursing students with other disciplines or focusing on specific tools rather than the broader concept. This systematic review will synthesize the impact of gamification strategies on educational outcomes in undergraduate nursing education. Methods: This protocol was written according to PRISMA-P guidelines and is registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251117719). Eligible studies will include randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, and observational designs involving undergraduate nursing students exposed to gamification interventions in classroom, online, or clinical training settings. Comparators may include traditional lecture-based instruction or other non-gamified methods. We will search the PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, covering January 2010 to July 2025, without language restrictions. Two reviewers will independently screen studies, extract data, and assess risk of bias using Cochrane RoB-2, ROBINS-I, and JBI Critical Appraisal Tools. Where possible, a meta-analysis will be conducted; otherwise, findings will be synthesized narratively. Results: Not applicable; this is a protocol. Findings will be synthesized as specified in the Methods. Conclusions: This review will provide a comprehensive synthesis of gamification’s effectiveness in undergraduate nursing education, identifying the most effective strategies and the contexts in which they perform best.",

    "Abstract": "Educational games often fail to effectively merge game mechanics with educational goals, lacking adaptive feedback and real-time performance monitoring. This study explores how Human–Computer Interaction principles and adaptive feedback can enhance educational game design to improve learning outcomes and user experience. Four educational games were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach and evaluated through established frameworks, such as the Serious Educational Games Evaluation Framework, the Assessment of Learning and Motivation Software, the Learning Object Evaluation Scale for Students, and Universal Design for Learning guidelines. In addition, a novel Human–Machine Pair Inspection protocol was employed to gather real-time data on adaptive feedback, cognitive load, and interactive behavior. Findings suggest that Human–Machine Pair Inspection-based adaptive mechanisms significantly boost personalized learning, knowledge retention, and student motivation by better aligning games with learning objectives. Although the sample size is small, this research provides practical insights for educators and designers, highlighting the effectiveness of adaptive Game-Based Learning. The study proposes the Human–Machine Pair Inspection methodology as a valuable tool for creating educational games that successfully balance user experience with learning goals, warranting further empirical validation with larger groups.",

    "Abstract": "Continual Learning (CL), the ability of a model to learn new tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a critical challenge in artificial intelligence. This is particularly true for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that utilize Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for global representation learning. Catastrophic forgetting, where new information overwrites prior knowledge, is especially problematic in these models. This research proposes the replacement of MLPs in ViTs with Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) to address this issue. KANs leverage local plasticity through spline-based activations, ensuring that only a subset of parameters is updated per sample, thereby preserving previously learned knowledge. This study investigates the efficacy of KAN-based ViTs in CL scenarios across various benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet-200), focusing on this approach’s ability to retain accuracy on earlier tasks while adapting to new ones. Our experimental results demonstrate that KAN-based ViTs significantly mitigate catastrophic forgetting, outperforming traditional MLP-based ViTs in both knowledge retention and task adaptation. This novel integration of KANs into ViTs represents a promising step toward more robust and adaptable models for dynamic environments.",

    "Abstract": "Accurate recognition of power grid operation behaviors is crucial for ensuring both safety and operational efficiency in smart grid systems. However, this task presents significant challenges due to dynamic environmental variations, limited labeled training data availability, and the necessity for continuous model adaptation. To overcome these limitations, we propose an Incremental Spatio-temporal Augmented Sampling (ISAS) method for power grid operation behavior recognition. Specifically, we design a spatio-temporal Feature-Enhancement Fusion Module (FEFM) which employs multi-scale spatio-temporal augmented fusion combined with a cross-scale aggregation mechanism, enabling robust feature learning that is resilient to environmental interference. Furthermore, we introduce a Selective Replay Mechanism (SRM) that implements a dual-criteria sample selection strategy based on error variability and feature-space divergence metrics, ensuring optimal memory bank updates that simultaneously maximize information gain while minimizing feature redundancy. Experimental results on the power grid behavior dataset demonstrate significant advantages of the proposed method in recognition robustness and knowledge retention compared to other methods. For example, it achieves an accuracy of 89.80% on sunny days and maintains exceptional continual learning stability with merely 2.74% forgetting rate on three meteorological scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "Retention of foundational knowledge is critical in dental education, yet the implications of Ebbinghaus forgetting curve are often overlooked. This study examined how well dental students retained core periodontal concepts and how confident in their knowledge evolved over the dental school years. A standardized 20-question multiple-choice exam was administered to 120 students at six points: before and after each of three progressive periodontal courses. Students also rated their confidence for each answer. Data from 113 students were analyzed. During the first-year course, mean scores increased significantly from 42–46% to 76–81%. After a four-month gap, second-year pre-course scores dropped to 66–70% and then rebounded to 84–89% post-course. In the third year, despite a nine-month gap, pre-course scores remained relatively high (78–81%) and rose slightly to 80–83% post-instruction. Performance and confidence improved significantly over time ( p < 0.001), and a strong positive correlation was observed between them (r = 0.87, p < 0.001). These findings support the value of repeated reinforcement in promoting long-term knowledge retention and increasing student confidence.",

    "Abstract": "This Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) project aimed to enhance medication safety by implementing a structured staff education initiative focused on standardized handoff communication using a medication reconciliation tool kit. Medication errors during transitions of care contribute to adverse drug events and patient harm. A lack of consistency in handoff processes was identified as a critical gap in practice. The practice-focused question guiding this project was: In an inpatient hospital setting, how does implementation of a standardized handoff tool kit affect nursing staff knowledge and communication practices related to medication reconciliation? The purpose was to educate nurses on utilizing a structured tool kit, such as SBAR (i.e., situation, background, assessment, recommendation), to promote accurate and effective communication during handoffs. The educational intervention followed the ADDIE model, incorporating analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation stages. Pre- and post-intervention tests were used to evaluate changes in staff knowledge. Interactive education, including handouts and simulation-based learning, supported knowledge retention. Post-implementation results demonstrated improved knowledge scores and increased compliance with the structured handoff protocol. The findings support the integration of the tool kit into routine nursing workflow to improve patient safety and care coordination .",

    "Abstract": "We examined whether practice testing enhances learning from persuasive texts and influences attitude change. In two online experiments, participants read texts on biodiversity loss (Study 1, n  = 454) or wolf recolonization (Study 2, n  = 400) and were assigned to one of three conditions: pretesting (guessing before reading), posttesting (retrieving after reading), or no-testing. Both testing conditions improved knowledge retention compared to no-testing, with no consistent differences between pre- and posttesting. Across all conditions, attitudes shifted in the expected direction—biodiversity loss was perceived as more severe, and wolf recolonization more positively after reading. However, neither testing condition led to greater attitude change than no-testing. A systematic association between final knowledge and attitude emerged only in the pretesting group, suggesting that generating responses before learning may have promoted attitude change in some individuals. These findings demonstrate that practice testing enhances knowledge acquisition from persuasive texts but does not reliably amplify attitude change. This suggests that while retrieval-based learning strengthens memory for persuasive content, additional factors may be required to translate knowledge gains into belief revision. Our results highlight the complex relationship between knowledge and attitudes and contribute to understanding the role of test-enhanced learning in persuasion.",

    "Abstract": "Lung diseases are prevalent in today’s world, exhibiting a wide range of disease variations that requires early diagnosis for preventing disease evolvement, diminishing long-term complications, and limiting the fatality rate. Conventional feature extraction methods such as scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and classification models like convolutional neural network (CNN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), graph neural network (GNN), are associated with high computational complexity, redundancy in feature structure, and restricted adaptability due to rigid designs. Moreover, it demonstrates limitations in scalability, generalization over limited datasets, susceptible to noise or illumination and lack of optimized feature sets leading to weak predictive performance. In order to overcome that, a novel framework that enhances lung disease prediction using Grey wolf optimization (GWO) based optimized multi-feature extraction with cumulative, recursive learning and a gated multi-layer perceptron (GMLP) for robust classification. This approach provides robustness to noise or illumination i.e. invariant feature extraction, efficient dimensionality and complexity of the extracted features, captures multi-scale spatial-textural patterns through global and local feature fusion and it provides high scalability and generalization capability while maintaining computational efficiency. Also, the optimization approach leads to progressive feature enhancement, knowledge retention, adaptability and redundancy elimination for the extracted features which are further processed by a classifier that selectively integrates full and regional patterns to sharpen feature distinctiveness and improve classification performance. The results obtained from the proposed framework tested on benchmark datasets were encouraging, showcasing notable performance with 98% accuracy outperforming the evaluated baseline methods.",

Small Language Models (SLMs) like Gemma, Phi, and LLaMA offer a cost-effective alternative, enabling efficient fine-tuning on proprietary datasets. However, continued pretraining introduces catastrophic forgetting (CF), where models lose prior knowledge while acquiring new information, posing a significant challenge for enterprise applications.This study examines the impact of continued pretraining on knowledge retention, output consistency, and model reliability. Our findings reveal that CF leads to substantial knowledge degradation and unintended repetition, limiting model adaptability. Despite ongoing research since McCloskey and Cohen’s 1989 study, CF remains a fundamental constraint in deep learning. This work highlights the need for effective mitigation strategies to preserve prior knowledge while ensuring seamless adaptation, contributing to more resilient and dependable language models.",

Deep learning has shown promising results in dermatological image analysis, yet its effectiveness is often hindered by overfitting due to limited and imbalanced datasets. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a potential solution, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large, complex teacher model to a smaller, more efficient student model. However, the impact of using domain-specific datasets for distillation remains underexplored in medical imaging.In this study, we investigate the role of dataset specificity in knowledge distillation for melanoma depth classification. We compare two KD approaches: one using a general-purpose dataset (ImageNet) and another using a dermatology-specific dataset. Performance is evaluated through classification metrics, feature visualization techniques (UMAP and t-SNE), Grad-CAM interpretability maps, and robustness tests under image perturbations. Our findings reveal that while ImageNet-distilled models achieve slightly better classification performance, the dermatology-specific distillation provides more structured feature representations, suggesting improved task-specific knowledge retention. Additionally, models trained with domain-specific KD demonstrate enhanced resilience to real-world variations, such as image noise and brightness changes.These results highlight the potential of tailored knowledge distillation strategies in medical imaging, suggesting that leveraging domain-specific datasets can improve model interpretability and robustness while mitigating overfitting. Future work will explore hybrid distillation techniques and domain adaptation strategies to further enhance deep learning applications in dermatological oncology.",

This innovative approach enhances understanding of accounting concepts and improves knowledge retention. However, the adoption of Virtual Reality in accounting education presents new challenges. Most existing Learning Management Systems are designed for traditional online training and lack the functionality to host Virtual Reality content effectively. This research study explores instructional design strategies to address these challenges. Specifically, it focuses on: 1.Proposing different learning activities and performance tasks supported by the learning management systems and the virtual reality immersive learning platform. 2.Developing an approach that integrates synchronous, asynchronous, and in-classroom activities into a cohesive and effective virtual reality-based experiential learning process. 3.Evaluating the feasibility of generating data flows and interfacing between different systems to enable interactive feedback along the learning process. The research study is conducted by developing, testing and refining a prototype of the learning experience through multiple peer reviews by experts, educational technologists and end-users. The learning prototype is supported by a technological infrastructure combining an open-source Learning Management System, a Virtual Reality immersive platform, and Artificial Intelligence-driven tools. Virtual reality contents are created from 360° captures or images generated by Artificial Intelligence without requiring coding. The research aims to propose methodology guidelines to design and implement successful experiential learning experiences that embed virtual reality in management accounting.",

The current educational methods are plagued by several drawbacks such as inflexible content delivery, absence of real-time interaction, limited remote access, and insufficient testing of practical decision-making abilities. The conventional systems tend to be static and do not involve learners in interactive, real-time rescue contexts. In order to tackle these challenges, this work suggests a Web-Enabled BERT-based Teaching Assistance System specifically designed for the \"Basic Disaster Rescue Medicine\" course. The system architecture consists of modular content delivery with web technologies, simulation-based interactive case practice, real-time skill testing, and an intelligent feedback loop that adjusts learning materials according to user performance. The major innovations encompass dynamic rendering of learning material, asynchronous support for remote learners, and inbuilt behaviour tracking to monitor performance and decision validity. Experimental evaluation of the platform included comparative testing against standard learning environments. Experimental findings establish a significant improvement in learner interest, knowledge retention, and emergency response preparedness.

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Knowledge Extraction (ICICKE) Conference Start Date: 2025 June 6 Conference End Date: 2025 June 7 Conference Location: Bengaluru, India Modern language education requires flexible, intelligent platforms that can adapt to diverse learning needs while maintaining accessibility. Web-based smart teaching systems present an ideal solution, offering device-independent access and centralized management of educational resources. However, current implementations often face limitations in personalization accuracy, real-time interaction quality, and adaptive content delivery, resulting in suboptimal learning experiences. To overcome these challenges, this study develops an intelligent system combining knowledge graph-enhanced recommendation Transformer-Based Adaptive Learning Model (TALM), algorithms with real-time performance analytics. The solution employs a hybrid approach integrating collaborative filtering (98.2% accuracy) and deep neural networks (97.6% prediction precision) to deliver personalized learning paths. System evaluation demonstrates outstanding metrics: content recommendation relevance (96.9%), response latency (98.4% requests processed <0.3s), knowledge retention improvement (95.8%), and user engagement rates (97.1%). The system successfully merges web technology's accessibility with advanced AI-driven personalization, creating a robust framework for English language education. Its consistently high-performance metrics confirm effectiveness in addressing critical gaps in digital language learning while maintaining the flexibility required for varied educational contexts. This approach establishes a new standard for intelligent, web-based teaching systems that dynamically respond to learner needs.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This quality improvement project implemented a computer-based learning (CBL) module to educate perioperative providers on the administration of sugammadex and its ability to reduce the effectiveness of hormonal-based contraceptives in women of childbearing age. Methodology: An online learning module was developed and disseminated via a CBL system already used by the regional medical center of interest. Participants were automatically assigned the CBL based on job class and department. After completing the learning module, a knowledge-based questionnaire and a teaching evaluation survey were presented to participants to evaluate knowledge retention and overall teaching method effectiveness. Results: The computer-based learning module was automatically assigned to 134 perioperative providers across multiple hospital campuses and units. One hundred six providers completed the CBL during the 45-day implementation period, marking a 79% completion percentage. Only 11 providers (10.4%) scored 100% on the first attempt. Seven providers (6.6%) required a third attempt to achieve 100% accuracy on the post-test. A nine-question evaluation survey was presented to the participants before the post-test, using the Likert Scale and one free-text question to assess whether objectives and goals were met through the online CBL module. For all objectives, no respondent disagreed or strongly disagreed with any statement. Ninety-eight participants (92.45%) strongly agreed or agreed that the CBL was presented logically and concisely to improve clinical knowledge and practice. Implications for Practice and Research: Continuing education is essential for all healthcare providers, particularly those responsible for educating patients pre- and postoperatively. The project focused on how adults learn and continue their medical education, emphasizing the impact of thorough patient education on a patient’s postoperative period. By utilizing an online CBL platform, like those already in use at most facilities, continuing education can be concise, informative, cost-effective, and most importantly, utilized to improve patient outcomes and education.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the role of flow in game‐based learning and compares the effects of continuous flow states with those produced by structured cognitive interruptions. The research combines a bibliometric analysis of 2,466 peer‐reviewed articles (2004–2024) with a manual review of 106 studies using a custom Flow‐Impact Analysis Framework (FIAF). This framework was developed specifically for the review and may assist future investigations into flow in game‐based learning. FIAF categorizes studies based on how they define flow, the instruments used for its measurement, and the links between flow and cognitive, affective, and behavioral learning outcomes. Findings show that most research builds on Csikszentmihalyi’s flow theory (1990), with common dimensions including challenge–skill balance, concentration, and enjoyment. Although continuous-flow states are associated with high engagement, studies incorporating structured cognitive interruptions—such as scaffolding and reflection prompts—report better knowledge retention and increased reflective behavior (Hamari et al., 2016; Lin & Hou, 2024b). Variations in measurement methods across studies point to a need for standardized approaches in future work.  Findings offer guidance for educators and instructional designers in creating game‐based learning environments that balance immersive engagement with opportunities for critical reflection.",

    "Abstract": "Puzzle-solving has been recognized as an effective game-based educational strategy for active learning and can be used to learn complex topics such as psychiatric disorders. This research was designed to investigate the benefits of this technique on the learning, memorization, and satisfaction of general medical students in the clinical rotation of the psychiatry department and the role of related demographic factors. BACKGROUND Puzzle-solving has been recognized as an effective game-based educational strategy for active learning and can be used to learn complex topics such as psychiatric disorders. This research was designed to investigate the benefits of this technique on the learning, memorization, and satisfaction of general medical students in the clinical rotation of the psychiatry department and the role of related demographic factors.Sixty-three medical students participated in this quasi-experimental study from January 2022 to February 2023. After completing a pre-test, the students engaged in three puzzle sets related to panic attacks, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety disorders based on the DSM-5 criteria. Following the completion of the puzzles, the students took a post-test and filled out a satisfaction questionnaire. Twenty days later, a follow-up test was conducted to assess knowledge retention. The data were then analyzed using SPSS-19 at a significance level of 0.05. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-three medical students participated in this quasi-experimental study from January 2022 to February 2023. After completing a pre-test, the students engaged in three puzzle sets related to panic attacks, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety disorders based on the DSM-5 criteria. Following the completion of the puzzles, the students took a post-test and filled out a satisfaction questionnaire. Twenty days later, a follow-up test was conducted to assess knowledge retention. The data were then analyzed using SPSS-19 at a significance level of 0.05.The post-test and follow-up test average scores were significantly higher than the pre-test ( P < 0.05), with a non-significant decrease in the follow-up ( P = 0.13). Additionally, the participants reported a high level of satisfaction. RESULTS The post-test and follow-up test average scores were significantly higher than the pre-test (P < 0.05), with a non-significant decrease in the follow-up (P = 0.13). Additionally, the participants reported a high level of satisfaction.The puzzle-solving technique as an active strategy can have a very important role in the efficacy of the teaching-learning process, especially in complex subjects like psychiatry. The present study provides evidence that puzzle-solving training significantly improves the learning and memorization of psychiatric DSM criteria in medical students. The results of this study can be used to design a more active learning environment to improve learning outcomes in medical education. CONCLUSIONS The puzzle-solving technique as an active strategy can have a very important role in the efficacy of the teaching-learning process, especially in complex subjects like psychiatry.

This study applies game theory to model strategic interactions among senior leaders, successors, and administrators during leadership transitions. Using payoff matrices and Nash Equilibrium, it identifies stable strategies where no party benefits from unilateral deviation. Findings highlight that cooperative approaches—such as mentorship and skill development—ensure smooth transitions and knowledge retention, while non-cooperative strategies like external hiring increase costs and disruptions. Game theory offers a structured method to align incentives, anticipate conflicts, and design resilient succession plans. Key recommendations include balancing internal promotions with external recruitment, fostering mentorship programs, and leveraging Nash Equilibrium to enhance organizational stability. This approach equips HR professionals with strategic tools for effective staff transitions.",

Utilizing PRISMA guidelines, the study initially identified 647 articles, of which 186 were included after systematic screening and quality assessment. From these, 24 studies were selected for in-depth analysis based on methodological rigor and relevance. The review highlights reported improvements in adaptive learning systems, predictive analytics, and intelligent tutoring, enhancing student engagement and success. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in digital infrastructure, data privacy, and algorithm bias. Overcoming these barriers can make higher education more inclusive and efficient. For instance, some of the analyzed studies highlight performance improvements of up to 20% with adaptive systems, and predictive models reaching up to 93% accuracy in identifying at-risk students. A key insight regarding intelligent tutoring systems is their potential to enhance knowledge retention and provide real-time feedback to support student progress.",

This study presents the adoption and outcomes of an authentic assessment approach replacing the traditional final examination used in a core mathematics course of an undergraduate engineering curriculum. The research aimed to (1) explore the impact of the assessment approach in promoting students’ higher-order thinking skills, and (2) identify learning gains reported by students that demonstrate deep and meaningful learning in the core math course for engineers. A mixed-method approach was used, involving 74 second and third-year engineering students enrolled in the Differential Equations course during the 3 rd semester of the 2023/2024 academic year at Ashesi University. Data collected included post-course surveys, reflections, audio recordings of the final oral assessment pitches, and student performance scores. The results showed that, on average, students showcased growth in understanding and competency of transferring knowledge beyond application word problems to solving real-life problems through the authentic assessment approach. Students also noted that the assessment approach greatly impacted their learning experience, including their motivation to take a deep approach to learning, confidence, sense of relevance, usefulness, and connection of concepts to real-life, personal interests, and future careers. In general, the study indicates that the assessment approach can help students move beyond focusing on grades and passing examinations and instead prepare them to become deep and meaningful thinkers who can confidently approach real-life workplace tasks.",

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA show promise in mitigating catastrophic forgetting, existing methods either indiscriminately accumulate modules or fail to maintain knowledge consistency. We propose Dynamic Routing and Distillation-Aware Fusion for LoRA-based Continual Learning (DRDF-LoRA), a novel framework that introduces a dynamic LoRA selection mechanism to reuse historical knowledge modules in a task-boundary-free manner, and performs elastic LoRA fusion guided by behavioral distillation from earlier stages. We conduct experiments on challenging continual visual question answering (VQA-CL) benchmarks.

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 5th International Conference on Computer Science and Blockchain (CCSB) Conference Start Date: 2025 Aug. 1 Conference End Date: 2025 Aug. 3 Conference Location: Shenzhen, China We propose the Meta-Learning Curriculum Agent (MLCA), a hierarchical framework designed to address the challenge of cross-environment adaptation in reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional transfer learning methods often rely on static pre-training or manually designed curricula, which struggle to generalize across diverse and dynamic environments. The MLCA merges meta-learning with curriculum learning via a three-part structure: a Meta-Learner that deduces task relevance from environmental features, alongside a dynamically adjusting Curriculum Generator for task difficulty, and a Policy Adaptation Module supporting swift fine-tuning. The Meta-Learner employs a Transformer-based encoder to capture temporal and taskspecific patterns, while the Curriculum Generator optimizes task selection by balancing performance improvement and knowledge retention. Additionally, the Policy Adaptation Module employs gradient-based meta-learning to adjust policies effectively with limited retraining. The framework functions by means of asynchronous data pipelines and establishes a closed-loop system in which curriculum modifications are directed by real-time agent performance. MLCA differs from prior methods by employing a dual-loop optimization that simultaneously refines task ordering and policy adjustment, avoiding dependence on predetermined schedules. Initial experiments on algorithmically constructed benchmarks show better generalization than traditional approaches. The MLCA's ability to autonomously generate adaptive curricula makes it particularly suitable for applications requiring robust RL agents in non-stationary environments, such as robotics and autonomous systems.",

    "Abstract": "In the evolving landscape of digital cultural heritage, the integration of advanced computational models into immersive virtual environments has become essential for enriching user engagement and fostering more meaningful interpretative experiences. As digital heritage platforms increasingly adopt interactive technologies, there is a growing need to move beyond static presentations and introduce intelligent, responsive systems that adapt to individual users’ interests and behaviors. Traditional virtual museum systems often suffer from rigid content structures, limited adaptability, and a lack of personalized storytelling, all of which constrain user immersion and diminish the potential for impactful learning experiences. To overcome these challenges, our approach integrates semantic-topological modeling with adaptive interaction mechanisms, forming a dynamic and personalized digital museum experience. The proposed framework features a hybrid computational architecture that unites symbolic knowledge representations with algorithmic spatial layout generation. This integration enables the creation of flexible narrative trajectories that are contextually relevant and customized according to each user’s cognitive and behavioral profile. Furthermore, the system incorporates reinforcement-driven semantic planning to interpret and respond to user interactions in real time, ensuring a continuously evolving and coherent interpretative journey. Experimental results reveal substantial improvements in user satisfaction, engagement levels, and knowledge retention when compared to traditional virtual museum platforms. These outcomes highlight the scalability and transformative potential of the model, reinforcing its capacity to enhance accessibility, personalization, and educational value across diverse digital heritage applications.",

    "Abstract": "Humans have the ability to incrementally learn, accumulate, update, and apply knowledge from dynamic environments. This capability, known as continual learning or lifelong learning, is also a long-term goal in the development of artificial intelligence. However, neural network-based continual learning suffers from catastrophic forgetting: the acquisition of new knowledge typically disrupts previously learned knowledge, leading to partial forgetting and a decline in the model’s overall performance. Most current continual learning methods can only mitigate catastrophic forgetting and fail to incrementally improve the overall performance. In this work, we aim to incrementally improve performance within sample incremental context by utilizing inter-stage edges as a pathway for explicit knowledge transfer in continual graph learning. Building on this pathway, we propose a knowledge-augmented replay method by leveraging evolving subgraphs of important nodes. This method enhances the distinction between patterns associated with different node classes and consolidates previously learned knowledge. Experiments on phishing detection in Ethereum transaction networks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating effective knowledge retention and augmentation while overcoming catastrophic forgetting and incrementally improving performance. The results also reveal the relationship between average accuracy and average forgetting. Lastly, we identify the key factor to incremental performance improvement, which lays a foundation for convergence of continual graph learning.",

This approach redefines traditional roles in education, assigning students the responsibility of acting as educators. They develop teaching materials, quizzes, and lessons, leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) as a supportive and interactive tool. The instructor’s role shifts to that of a facilitator, guiding students through a structured, phase-based process and integrating AI tools to enhance the collaborative and engaging learning experience. The primary objective of this methodology is to explore how role reversal and active engagement with AI can support deeper comprehension, improved knowledge retention, and greater awareness of GenAI’s appropriate and responsible use.

    "Abstract": "Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States, disproportionately impacting Black birthing individuals due to systemic racism, healthcare inequities, and insufficient postpartum education. Despite clinical guidelines, HDP warning signs often go unrecognized, delaying timely intervention. This quality improvement project primarily aimed to evaluate the impact of evidence-based education on HDP symptom recognition and the time to seek care. Secondary aims were to (1) assess the effect of racially congruent video education on patient satisfaction and (2) evaluate the impact of video-based education on HDP knowledge retention. Conducted at a Gulf Coast perinatal clinic serving a predominantly non-Hispanic Black population, the intervention included a culturally representative flyer and a racially congruent educational video, both introduced at the initial postpartum visit. Eligible participants were postpartum individuals up to six weeks, English-speaking, aged 18 or older, and with access to a mobile device. The project used pre- and post-design, comparing data collected three months before and three months after the practice change. HDP knowledge was assessed using a multiple-choice survey; satisfaction was measured using a Likert-scale tool. Unexpected permanent clinic closure one week after project launch significantly disrupted data collection. Three pre-intervention knowledge surveys and two satisfaction surveys were completed. Knowledge scores averaged 86.7% (range: 66–100%), showing varied baseline awareness. Satisfaction data showed a positive shift in patient trust and engagement. Lessons learned included the need for early, hands-on training with clinic staff and the primary stakeholder on digital tools, clearer communication throughout the team, and secure infrastructure to support implementation. Additionally, future projects should obtain funding to support higher-quality educational video production. Establishing strong stakeholder engagement and identifying on-site practice champions are critical to maintaining fidelity, troubleshooting barriers, and supporting sustainability. Most critically, addressing racial disparities in maternal health requires embedding equity from the outset; through community co-design, systemic alignment, and long-term commitment to culturally responsive care. With adequate resources and collaborative leadership, racially congruent education can be fully integrated into postpartum workflows to improve patient trust, health literacy, and timely care-seeking, ultimately advancing equity in perinatal outcomes.",

Organizations may develop immersive and captivating learning environments that encourage active creativity and knowledge retention by including game features like challenges, rewards, competition, points, levels, and leaderboards in training programs. Given the increasing gap in shop floor employees' skill sets about cutting-edge technology and the wide range of the workforce, to fulfill shifting production demands and satisfy people's need for success and motivation at work, a cognitive system that fills in these technical gaps is necessary. The present research investigates a two-level collaboration filtering strategy that optimizes the dispersion of statistics provided by an employee to complete a manufacturing task while taking into account the staff's remarks. An examination of an employee's work cycle in a retail area with several desks and activities analyses an interim implementation. Gamification takes on additional dimensions when paired with artificial intelligence. Organizations can create gamified experiences that are incredibly engaging, flexible, and impactful because to AI's strengths in data processing, customization, and predictive analytics.",

This systematic literature review, conducted using the PRISMA framework, examines the implementation, effectiveness, and challenges of VR in farming education. The analysis reveals that VR technology significantly enhances student engagement and knowledge retention through immersive simulations, particularly beneficial in agricultural training where hands-on experience is traditionally limited by physical resources. While VR demonstrates considerable potential in democratizing agricultural education by providing urban students access to farming simulations, the study identifies key challenges including technological limitations and high equipment costs. The findings suggest that despite these obstacles, VR's capacity to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application makes it a valuable tool for developing future agricultural expertise. This review highlights VR's role in preparing learners for emerging challenges in food security and modern farming practices, while emphasizing the need for structured educational frameworks to guide its implementation in agricultural curricula.",

The system features a modular, web-based architecture and incorporates gamification elements—such as points, badges, progression levels, and real-time leaderboards—within a responsive interface accessible via desktop and mobile devices. The core objective is to enhance student engagement, monitor academic performance, and reinforce knowledge retention beyond traditional classroom settings. Employing the Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology, the system underwent iterative prototyping and stakeholder-driven refinement. A comprehensive dual-model evaluation was conducted. The ISO/IEC 25010 software quality model assessed functionality, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, reliability, and security, while McCall’s Software Quality Model addressed maintainability, portability, and code-level attributes. Results showed high overall ratings, particularly in usability (M = 4.66), maintainability (4.82), and portability (4.73), affirming both pedagogical and technical efficacy. Although tested in a specific academic context, the architecture and methodology are transferable to broader educational and training environments. This work contributes to the field of intelligent cyber-physical systems by demonstrating how gamified tools can deliver scalable, quality- driven educational solutions.",

This paper proposes a decentralized reward framework integrating verifiable credentials and programmable money to enhance trust, transparency, and automation in organizational incentives. By linking digital credentials to programmable rewards, contributions can be verified, acknowledged, and compensated based on predefined, rule-based criteria. This eliminates the need for centralized oversight, ensuring transparent and tamper-proof reward distribution while reducing administrative overhead. We explore the system’s design, discuss its potential impact on research organizations, and analyze both its benefits and challenges, including usability, adoption barriers, and security considerations. Furthermore, we examine extensions such as group-based credential issuance and decentralized validation to improve fairness and adaptability. This work offers a novel perspective on leveraging decentralized technologies for incentives, setting the stage for further investigation into its practical feasibility and adoption.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning for Communication and Networking (ICMLCN) Conference Start Date: 2025 May 26 Conference End Date: 2025 May 29 Conference Location: Barcelona, Spain The advent of 6G represents a paradigm shift where Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning AI/ML becoming the pulsating heart of network innovation. However, these AI/ML models face a significant challenge known as Model Drift, caused by changes in data distributions and feature relationships over time, leading to degraded performance. While numerous drift adaptation strategies have been explored including model retraining, incremental learning, and ensemble approaches, they often neglect the critical issue of \"Catastrophic Forgetting\" (CF). The latter refers to the phenomenon where neural networks, upon learning new information (post-drift), lose the ability to retain previously learned knowledge (pre-drift). This challenge is particularly pronounced in the time-series forecasting tasks inherent to telecommunications networks, where sequential data dependencies amplify the forgetting issue. To address this limitation, we propose a novel LSTM-EWC model that synergistically combines the time-series processing strengths of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with the CF mitigation capabilities of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC). The proposed framework empowers LSTM models to retain essential pre-drift knowledge, while effectively adapting to post-drift changes, enabling robust and continuous learning in dynamic environments. Experimental evaluations on a real-world telecommunications dataset highlight the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating up to 51% improvement in knowledge retention over state-of-the-art CF baseline methods.",

Filling the gaps in adaptive tutoring systems and considering people's emotional engagement, the framework combines the cognitive load theory, indicators of emotional intelligence, and adaptive learning algorithms to develop an overarching, context-specific instructional landscape. The study makes use of a mixed-methods design, using machine learning driven tutoring interfaces, state of the art learning analytics, and sentiment analysis on a long-term study with 68 engineering students. Incorporating powerful affective computing techniques and intelligent intervention methods, this study presents an encompassing approach that can tune the scaffolding support to learners' abilities and adjust to everchanging competencies of learners while being proactive about detecting the indicators of cognitive overload. The uniqueness aspect of this research lies in its synergistic combination of various data streams (multimodal) - text, visual, and biometric data - combined with dynamic AI-based recommendation model, which maximizes personalized feedback loops. Theoretically, the study expands the insights into how the cognitive load and the emotional dynamics form learning outcomes. Practically, it provides a scalable, flexible approach to the integration of multimodal AI tutors in various educational environments.

Recognizing the pedagogical challenges of teaching complex PV principles and practical operation and maintenance (O&M) skills, the framework leverages interactive, game-based methodologies. The TRANSIT Online Training Platform utilizes scenario-based simulations and multiplayer environments for foundational concepts and PV system design. Complementing this, the PROMISE project incorporates two custom-designed board games to explore O&M complexities: a \"tycoon\"-style game for introductory concepts and a facilitator-guided game for in-depth discussions.

    "Abstract": "An off-campus practical course is one in which students receive practical training in a vocational workplace outside of their educational institution. These courses focus on practical skills rather than academic knowledge and are essential for students to gain real-world experience and develop skills needed in the modern workforce. The research objective is to explore the continuous development of off-campus practical courses using the Outcome-Based Education (OBE) framework. The study used both qualitative and quantitative research methods, with 900 structured questionnaires distributed and 847 valid responses collected from students and teachers. The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS software, and the qualitative data were analyzed using NVivo software. The findings highlight that off-campus practical courses improve students' problem-solving skills, practical application abilities, industry-relevant performance, and engagement compared to traditional classroom-based education. Theoretically, this study contributes to the growing body of research on OBE by demonstrating how off-campus practical courses, when aligned with OBE principles, can better equip students with the skills required by modern industries. The study enriches the OBE framework by providing evidence of how it enhances not only technical knowledge retention but also fosters critical competencies such as problem-solving, industry-specific performance, and engagement. Practically, the study provides insights for educators and industry stakeholders to design off-campus programs that align with both academic and vocational outcomes. The novelty of this study lies in its exploration of how off-campus practical courses can be continuously improved to better prepare students for the challenges of the contemporary workplace.",

    "Abstract": "This study originates from the observation during teaching and student interactions that students in industry-academic cooperative programs have very limited time to dedicate to coursework. The target group for this research consists of third-year students in the Mechanical Engineering industry-academia collaborative training program, and sessions are conducted in the shared computer lab, Room 312. All 40 students were informed of the study details and signed consent forms. This research was initiated based on observations from teaching sessions and internship evaluations, which revealed that these students face challenges such as heavy workloads, condensed class schedules, and limited familiarity with programming. With limited classroom time, designing content that captures students' attention and enhances learning efficiency is a primary objective of this study. This research introduces a topic-based teaching approach, which was pilot-tested in the 2021 academic year and fully implemented in the 2022 academic year. The topic-based approach comprises three stages: topic explanation and programming implementation, problem-based exercises with peer learning, and results presentation with in-depth discussion. After completing each topic, both qualitative and quantitative questionnaires are administered to facilitate rapid instructional feedback, thereby scientifically refining the teaching and learning process. The study findings show high effectiveness in quantitative metrics, with student evaluations consistently above 4 out of 5 and a gradual increase in satisfaction with the teaching team as topic difficulty rose (from 4.48 to 4.70). In qualitative feedback, students expressed strong agreement that the topic-based approach enhanced their understanding of programming applications and techniques, peer interactions deepened knowledge retention, and team presentations fostered greater engagement. Course evaluation scores improved from 4.03 to 4.49, and final grades increased significantly from 70.23 to 87.26 (with a 12.7% improvement in teaching effectiveness and a 24.2% increase in overall semester grades.). These results indicate that, compared to conventional teaching methods, the topic-based approach effectively ignites students' enthusiasm for learning and improves learning outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Education 4.0 represents a visionary approach to the future of education, aiming to enhance teaching and learning through advanced technologies. The aim of this research is to determine student attitudes toward the use of Education 4.0 tools in the 7th-grade Science course Electrical Circuits unit. To achieve this, an attitude test was developed to evaluate the integration of Education 4.0 tools into the Science curriculum, and student attitudes were assessed using this test. A \"quasi-experimental design with pre-test and post-test control group,\" one of the quantitative research methods, was used in the study. The research involved 41 seventh-grade students from one public secondary schools in Turkey, with 21 students in the experimental group and 20 in the control group. The \"Attitude Scale toward the Use of Education 4.0 Tools in Science Teaching,\" developed by the researchers, was used as the data collection instrument. The experimental phase lasted four weeks (16 lesson hours), during which the experimental group engaged in activities involving Education 4.0 tools, while the control group followed the curriculum-prescribed activities. The t-test results of the collected data revealed a statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of the experimental and control groups, with the experimental group showing more favorable outcomes. The research findings reveal that students exhibit a positive attitude toward the use of Education 4.0 tools in science education. These results suggest that the integration of Education 4.0 into science education enhances students' understanding of abstract electrical concepts such as electric current, potential difference, resistance, and Ohm's Law, improves knowledge retention, and transforms the learning process into an interactive and discovery-oriented experience. Furthermore, Education 4.0 tools have contributed to the improvement of learning outcomes by promoting student engagement and make learning processes more efficient by improving students' ability to use technology effectively.",

Traditional teaching methods often fail to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, leaving students unprepared for the evolving demands of the industry. To address these challenges, this research introduced speculative and experiential learning strategies, including science fiction prototyping, movie analysis, flash fiction storytelling, and innovation labs. These activities aimed to enhance engagement, knowledge retention, critical thinking, and collaborative skills by immersing students in creative and hands-on problem-solving scenarios.The findings demonstrate that futuristic thinking methodologies significantly improve students’ understanding of X-Ops concepts, fostering creativity and innovation while promoting collaboration and ethical reasoning. Quantitative data revealed marked improvements in familiarity with X-Ops principles and problem-solving confidence, while qualitative reflections highlighted the value of group-based activities in contextualizing abstract theories. Despite limitations such as sample size and short-term observation, the study underscores the transformative potential of active and future-oriented pedagogies. By bridging the gap between theory and practice, these approaches prepare students to thrive in the dynamic and evolving landscape of modern technological systems.",

Traditional memorization techniques, such as rote learning and mnemonics, often fail to support long-term knowledge retention. This paper introduces AI-driven memory scripts, an innovative approach that structures learning materials using mind mapping, storytelling, humor, music, and visual techniques to enhance recall. Rather than replacing human-led instructional methods, AI acts as a technical communication aid, applying natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to generate personalized, structured memory scripts aligned with individual learning styles. These scripts facilitate adaptive exam preparation and support clearer content delivery, demonstrating potential applications in science, mathematics, and language learning. While this approach remains conceptual, it provides a compelling framework for scalable, learner-centered educational design.",

Objective The diagnosis and treatment of arthropathic orthopaedic conditions are inherently linked to anatomical structures, necessitating strong spatial visualization abilities in students. Providing intuitively accessible methods for students to master specialized knowledge presents a formidable challenge for educators. This study aims to evaluate the pedagogical value of integrating 3D-printed model with mixed reality (MR) technology in clinical orthopaedic surgery education.Thirty-six senior clinical medical undergraduates were randomized into two groups. The experimental group underwent training using the combined 3D- printed model and mixed reality (MR) technology, while the control group received traditional instruction. Learning outcomes were evaluated through standardized Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) assessments and questionnaires. Correlation analysis was conducted between total OSCE scores and questionnaire scores. Methods Thirty-six senior clinical medical undergraduates were randomized into two groups. The experimental group underwent training using the combined 3D- printed model and mixed reality (MR) technology, while the control group received traditional instruction. Learning outcomes were evaluated through standardized Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) assessments and questionnaires. Correlation analysis was conducted between total OSCE scores and questionnaire scores.The experimental group achieved significantly higher OSCE scores compared to the control group ( p    0.8, p    0.8, p < 0.001). The strongest correlation was observed between learning efficiency and OSCE total scores (r = 0.918).Integrating 3D-printed model and MR technology into orthopedic joint surgery clinical teaching significantly boosts student performance, learning efficiency, and overall teaching quality, demonstrating strong potential for wider application.

Extended Reality technologies, including Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, offer promising alternatives for delivering room-of-horrors simulations. By allowing repeated, autonomous, and safe practice, these technologies reduce the need to repurpose real clinical spaces and can provide immersive learning experiences. However, the literature has not yet systematically identified optimal extended reality design for effective autonomous room-of-horrors simulations training.

However, for VLMs, in addition to the loss of knowledge previously learned from downstream tasks, pre-training knowledge is also corrupted during continual fine-tuning. This issue is exacerbated by the unavailability of original pre-training data, leaving VLM’s generalization ability degrading. In this paper, we propose GIFT, a novel continual fine-tuning approach that utilizes synthetic data to overcome catastrophic forgetting in VLMs. Taking advantage of recent advances in text-to-image synthesis, we employ a pre-trained diffusion model to recreate both pre-training and learned downstream task data. In this way, the VLM can revisit previous knowledge through distillation on matching diffusion-generated images and corresponding text prompts. Leveraging the broad distribution and high alignment between synthetic image-text pairs in VLM’s feature space, we propose a contrastive distillation loss along with an image-text alignment constraint. To further combat in-distribution overfitting and enhance distillation performance with limited amount of generated data, we incorporate adaptive weight consolidation, utilizing Fisher information from these synthetic image-text pairs and achieving a better stability-plasticity balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches across various settings.",

Despite several research efforts to address this, they often fail to consider the real-world demand from users for complete knowledge erasure. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that existing methods have a risk of leaking personal knowledge through embedding features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel concept of Knowledge Deletion (KD), an advanced task that considers both concerns, and provides an appropriate metric, named Knowledge Retention score (KR), for assessing knowledge retention in feature space. To achieve this, we propose a novel training-free erasing approach named Erasing Space Concept (ESC), which restricts the important subspace for the forgetting knowledge by eliminating the relevant activations in the feature. In addition, we suggest ESC with Training (ESC-T), which uses a learnable mask to better balance the trade-off between forgetting and preserving knowledge in KD. Our extensive experiments on various datasets and models demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve the fastest and state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our methods are applicable to diverse forgetting scenarios, such as facial domain setting, demonstrating the generalizability of our methods.

    "Abstract": "Background: Infectious diseases disproportionately affect rural and ethnic communities in Colombia, where structural inequalities such as limited access to health care, poor sanitation, and scarce health education worsen their effects. Education is essential for preventing and controlling infectious diseases, fostering awareness of healthy behaviors, and empowering communities with the knowledge and skills to manage their health. Participatory and co-design methods strengthen educational programs by ensuring cultural relevance, enhancing knowledge retention, and promoting sustainable community interventions. Objective: This study aims to describe the co-design process and evaluate the capacity building of an education program for the prevention and control of infectious diseases using participatory audiovisual methods culturally adapted to ethnic communities and rural contexts in Colombia. Methods: A qualitative case study approach was used. 15 community leaders contributed to the program’s design, implementation, and evaluation. Nominal groups and a participatory social diagnosis identified key topics, while theoretical-practical sessions with visual methods guided the cocreation of workshops and audiovisual materials. Evaluation combined qualitative analysis of participants’ perceptions and quantitative assessment of knowledge acquisition. Qualitative data were coded through content analysis, while multiple-choice questionnaires (initial and final) categorized knowledge acquisition into 3 levels (low, medium, and high), with percentage distributions used for comparative analysis. Results: The co-design process resulted in 12 theoretical and practical workshops in infectious diseases and 3 audiovisual products: an animation about malaria, a comic book about cutaneous leishmaniasis, and a puppet show about tuberculosis. The quantitative evaluation applied to the 15 participants revealed substantial improvements, with the proportion that achieved excellent scores in pedagogy increasing from 40% (6/15) to 93% (14/15), in leadership from 13% (2/15) to 27% (4/15). In terms of health knowledge, excellent scores increased from 40% for leishmaniasis, 60% for malaria, and 13% for tuberculosis, reaching 80% for all three diseases. The qualitative evaluation showed positive results in terms of the participants’ perceptions of both the methodology and the co-design process outcomes. Conclusions: The co-design process was driven by 3 key factors: (1) active community participation at every stage; (2) knowledge exchange between multidisciplinary technical expertise and practical local knowledge; and (3) the use of innovative, culturally adapted pedagogical tools tailored to the rural context and population. This co-design process proved to be an effective method for meaningful capacity building among populations experiencing vulnerability in complex settings, and has the potential to contribute significantly to the improvement of infectious disease prevention and control.",

The integration of biometric technologies into educational systems has shown promise in enhancing learning effectiveness and engagement. While short-term studies have demonstrated benefits on immediate academic performance, the long-term impact on student behavior and learning habits remains underexplored. This study investigates the effects of a biometric-based adaptive learning environment over six weeks on students' academic routines, stress management, and knowledge retention. A controlled experiment with 60 undergraduate students divided into three groups—biometric feedback-driven adaptive learning, passive biometric monitoring, and conventional learning—was conducted. Biometric indicators such as heart rate variability, eye-tracking fixation data, and electroencephalogram-derived engagement metrics were continuously monitored. The system adjusted content difficulty and delivery pace based on these indicators. Data on learning behaviors, including time-on-task, late submissions, and participation frequency, were collected, and weekly quizzes assessed knowledge retention. Results revealed that the biometric adaptive group showed significantly higher engagement, reduced stress, improved test performance, a 22% increase in study time, and a 37% decrease in late submissions, indicating a shift toward more self-regulated learning. These findings suggest that prolonged exposure to biometric-adaptive environments can foster sustainable learning habits and long-term academic benefits.",

This study explores the application of biometric technologies in education management systems to enhance adaptive learning and improve student engagement. The research proposes a model that utilizes biometric data, including facial recognition, eye-tracking, and physiological signals (heart rate, EEG), to assess students' cognitive states in real-time. By analyzing these biometric indicators, the system dynamically adjusts learning materials and teaching strategies to match individual learning needs. The proposed model is implemented using artificial intelligence algorithms to process biometric inputs and personalize the learning environment accordingly. A controlled experiment was conducted with university students to evaluate the system's effectiveness. The results indicate that biometric-driven personalized learning improves knowledge retention and student engagement compared to traditional learning approaches. Additionally, the system demonstrates the potential to identify learners' stress levels and attention spans, enabling more effective educational interventions. This study highlights the potential of biometric-based adaptive learning systems in modern education and suggests future directions for integrating biometric technology into large-scale learning platforms. The findings provide valuable insights for researchers and education policymakers aiming to enhance the efficiency of learning management systems through biometric data integration.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents an agent-based simulation model with cognitive elements, developed to explore strategies for managing complex projects under uncertainty. The model was implemented using NetLogo, which provided a matrix-structured environment where agents—identified as assigners and workers—interact based on factors such as expertise level, intensity of collaboration, frequency of task rotation, and workload balance. The system was simulated over 100 time steps, allowing the identification of behavioral patterns related to organizational learning and performance under varied experimental conditions. Methodologically, the model integrates mechanisms for distributing tasks, rules for agent assignment, adjustable collaboration ranges, and decision-making based on utility functions. Cognitive aspects are addressed through decentralized decision processes and adaptive behaviors that evolve during the simulation. A total of eight configurations were analyzed, varying turnover rates, collaboration distances, and the initial competencies of the agents to assess how these variables influence the accumulation of experience and project effectiveness. The results indicate that when agents build up experience over time, project outcomes improve, following a growth curve with diminishing marginal returns. Conversely, high turnover interferes with knowledge retention and weakens learning processes. Additionally, too much collaboration can overwhelm highly connected agents, thereby decreasing the system’s overall efficiency. Statistical validation was carried out through ANOVA and Spearman’s correlation tests, confirming the consistency and relevance of the observed effects. Overall, the study underscores the importance of organizational continuity and the thoughtful design of collaboration parameters to achieve efficient performance in complex project settings. The proposed model serves as a useful framework for examining how task distribution, talent retention, and interaction patterns can be optimized, and it opens the door to future developments involving more advanced cognitive modeling techniques.",

    "Abstract": "Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to learn from streaming data sources step by step, which suffers from the catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, we investigate the exemplar-free LReID setting where no previous exemplar is available during the new step training. Existing exemplar-free LReID methods primarily adopt knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from an old model to a new one without selection, inevitably introducing erroneous and detrimental information that hinders new knowledge learning. Furthermore, not all critical knowledge can be transferred due to the absence of old data, leading to the permanent loss of undistilled knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a novel exemplar-free LReID method named Long Short-Term Knowledge Decomposition and Consolidation (LSTKC++). Specifically, an old knowledge rectification mechanism is developed to rectify the old model predictions based on new data annotations, ensuring correct knowledge transfer. Besides, a long-term knowledge consolidation strategy is designed, which first estimates the degree of old knowledge forgetting by leveraging the output difference between the old and new models. Then, a knowledge-guided parameter fusion strategy is developed to balance new and old knowledge, improving long-term knowledge retention. Upon these designs, considering LReID models tend to be biased on the latest seen domains, the fusion weights generated by this process often lead to sub-optimal knowledge balancing. To settle this, we further propose to decompose a single old model into two parts: a long-term old model containing multi-domain knowledge and a short-term model focusing on the latest short-term old knowledge. Then, the incoming new data are explored as an unbiased reference to adjust the old models’ fusion weight to achieve backward optimization. Furthermore, an extended complementary knowledge rectification mechanism is developed to mine and retain the correct knowledge in the decomposed models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LSTKC++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins.",

Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) excel in organizing structured and textual data but struggle to incorporate multimodal information and implicit relationships, limiting their effectiveness. This paper explores the potential of Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) to address these limitations by integrating text, images, videos, and audio into a unified framework. We investigate how MMKGs enhance knowledge retrieval, comprehension, and interactive learning through advanced techniques, including Natural Language Processing and deep learning. Our findings demonstrate that MMKGs significantly improve knowledge retention and application in specialized fields, offering a foundation for more intuitive and effective domain-specific knowledge ecosystems.",

Within the framework of immersive traffic education, a simulator was developed that recreates realistic traffic scenarios and allows users to interact with traffic signals, pedestrians, and environmental factors while receiving detailed feedback on their actions and compliance with current regulations in Ecuador. The project was developed using tools such as Unity to create the graphics engine, Blender for 3D modelling, and the agile SCRUM methodology for iterative development management. In addition, the design and evaluation of the simulator was based on the Design Science methodology, an approach that integrates three key cycles: Relevance, Rigor, and Design. The simulator was evaluated through tests with students and drivers from the Technical University of Manabí, who interacted with the system in controlled scenarios. The results showed high levels of satisfaction, confidence, and perceived effectiveness, with a significant increase in knowledge retention and road safety awareness among users. This immersive learning model stands out as an innovation in the teaching of traffic rules and enables an effective transition from theory to practice in a safe environment.",

This study examines current KM practices within a sample organization to identify areas for process improvement. By applying the ISO/IEC 12207 standard, two key processes were prioritized for improvement: (c) Sharing knowledge assets throughout the organization and (d) Managing knowledge, skills, and knowledge assets. To enhance KM within Scrum teams, a structured Knowledge Management Process (KMP) guideline has been established, along with a tailored Knowledge Management System (KMS) designed and implemented for improved knowledge storage, retrieval, and sharing. Nevertheless, successfully implementing the process guideline requires the alignment with the organization's policies and operational needs. This research contributes to the advancement of KM in Scrum-based software development by providing a structured approach that improves knowledge retention, process efficiency, and compliance with industry standards.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 Symposium on Maritime Informatics and Robotics (MARIS) Conference Start Date: 2025 June 26 Conference End Date: 2025 June 27 Conference Location: Syros, Greece Aquabots is a development platform for autonomous navigation which was initiated in 2010 by the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences and system integrator Imtech. In 2014, the first student team successfully crossed the river Nieuwe Maas with their Remotely Operated Vessel (Aquabot) EindMaas. By structuring the project as stacked research, where each team builds upon the work of their predecessors, significant time savings and deeper knowledge development have been achieved. This modular concept, starting from 2017, has enabled various, consecutive student teams to develop individual components of the system architecture. This approach ensured continuity, prevented knowledge loss, and allowed teams to focus on advancing the technology rather than redoing previous work. Over the years, as developments have progressed, it has become increasingly difficult to preserve and extend the knowledge base. To combat the major drawback of various consecutive student teams, a community system will be set up, consisting of teachers, company representatives and students who have contributed to the Aquabots project over the years. This will require active and fruitful cooperation and knowledge sharing, not only from the academic side (students plus teachers), but also from the business sector. We believe that the incubation phase of followup multidisciplinary student teams working on the Aquabots project can be shortened significantly. In this way common resources as well as knowledge can accumulate, academic potential can be explored, and the related business sector will have access to building blocks which can be applied to exploit their business potential. This paper documents best practices and challenges of such a modular learning community.",

Introduction Many dental students lack sufficient knowledge to manage dental trauma. Traditional lectures usually involve one-way communication from the instructor to the students. Game-based learning strategies can increase student engagement, offer hands-on experiences, and promote a deeper interest in learning.To compare the knowledge and satisfaction of dental interns participating in game-based learning versus traditional learning method on traumatic dental management at KAUFD. Objective To compare the knowledge and satisfaction of dental interns participating in game-based learning versus traditional learning method on traumatic dental management at KAUFD.An experimental study conducted at the Faculty of Dentistry at King Abdulaziz University involved a sample size of 88 dental interns. The interns were divided into a game-based learning group (game group) and a traditional lecture group (lecture group). The game group participated in a game-based learning session, engaging in an educational game focused on managing permanent teeth trauma. Meanwhile, the lecture group attended a traditional lecture covering the same topic. Both groups took part in pre- and post-quizzes before and after the sessions and completed a satisfaction survey distributed after the sessions. Methods An experimental study conducted at the Faculty of Dentistry at King Abdulaziz University involved a sample size of 88 dental interns. The interns were divided into a game-based learning group (game group) and a traditional lecture group (lecture group). The game group participated in a game-based learning session, engaging in an educational game focused on managing permanent teeth trauma. Meanwhile, the lecture group attended a traditional lecture covering the same topic. Both groups took part in pre- and post-quizzes before and after the sessions and completed a satisfaction survey distributed after the sessions.Both lecture formats significantly enhanced knowledge retention. Post-intervention scores were comparable between the groups (p = 0.393), The mean post-intervention correct score for the lecture group was 12.72 (SD = 1.33; 95% CI: 12.32-13.13), while the mean score for the game group was 12.62 (SD = 1.56; 95% CI: 12.15-13.09). showing no significant difference in score improvements (p = 0.315). The post-intervention satisfaction survey indicated positive responses in both groups, with no significant differences in satisfaction levels. Results Both lecture formats significantly enhanced knowledge retention. Post-intervention scores were comparable between the groups (p = 0.393), The mean post-intervention correct score for the lecture group was 12.72 (SD = 1.33; 95% CI: 12.32-13.13), while the mean score for the game group was 12.62 (SD = 1.56; 95% CI: 12.15-13.09). showing no significant difference in score improvements (p = 0.315). The post-intervention satisfaction survey indicated positive responses in both groups, with no significant differences in satisfaction levels.The findings indicate that both game-based learning and traditional lectures are equally effective in enhancing knowledge and ensuring high satisfaction among dental interns. Given the similar results, it is recommended to incorporate both approaches in educational settings. Future research should investigate the impact of new content and more complex game designs to understand their potential benefits better.

To address this gap, a Digital Role-Playing Game-Based Learning (DRPGBL) intervention, Engineering Ethics Enigma (3E), was developed to align with the Malaysian Matriculation Programme curriculum. However, its instructional usability and relevance, required validation. This study reports the iterative testing of 3E through expert review $(\\mathrm{n}=12)$ and student pilot testing ($\\mathrm{n}=36$). Experts rated content relevance ($M=4.75$) and overall suitability ($M=4.67$) highly, while students echoed these ratings and emphasized learning effectiveness ($M=4.72$). Usability scores improved following targeted refinements. The lowest scores were observed for perceived knowledge retention, highlighting a need for enhanced post-game reinforcement. The results validate 3E as a curriculum-aligned, engaging, and pedagogically sound tool for pre-university ethics education. These findings establish a strong foundation for large-scale quasi-experimental implementation and support the broader integration of DRPGBL in values-driven STEM education.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 10th International STEM Education Conference (iSTEM-Ed) Conference Start Date: 2025 July 30 Conference End Date: 2025 Aug. 1 Conference Location: Pattaya, Thailand Traditional biomechanics education often faces challenges engaging students due to its reliance on theoretical concepts and limited interactive feedback. Mobile technology offers a promising solution by enhancing learning experiences through applications designed for human movement analysis. This study examines the effectiveness of OCHY, BeOneSports, and OnForm in improving learning outcomes, student engagement, and STEM integration in biomechanics education. Using a quasi-experimental repeated-measures design, 50 undergraduate students in a biomechanics course were assessed at four stages: Pre-test (Week 1), Post-test 1 (Week 2), Post-test 2 (Week 4), and Post-test 3 (Week 6, two weeks postintervention). Quantitative assessments, surveys, and interviews measured students’ biomechanical analysis skills. A repeatedmeasures ANOVA revealed significant improvements ($\\mathbf{p}\\lt $ 0.001), with mean scores increasing from $58.4 \\%$ (Pre-test) to $68.2 \\%$ (Post-test 1), 78.9% (Post-test 2), and 80.1% (Post-test 3). Additionally, $92 \\%$ of students reported greater engagement and motivation when using mobile applications compared to traditional methods. Despite these benefits, challenges such as technical constraints, learning curves, and instructor training needs were identified. This study highlights mobile technology’s potential to enhance biomechanics education by integrating STEM principles and promoting active learning. Future research should explore broader student populations, incorporate AR/VR technologies, and examine long-term knowledge retention beyond six weeks to further optimise mobile-based biomechanics education.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 10th International STEM Education Conference (iSTEM-Ed) Conference Start Date: 2025 July 30 Conference End Date: 2025 Aug. 1 Conference Location: Pattaya, Thailand Immunology is a complex subject, and students often find it difficult to grasp key concepts through conventional pedagogical methods. Educational tabletop games offer a promising and interactive alternative; however, evidence of their impact on cognitive learning outcomes and past games in the cooperative genre are limited, with few frameworks available to guide their development. To address this, the POV3D framework (Problem, Objectives, Vision, Design, Debrief, Development) was developed by the researcher and applied in the creation of Virulence, a cooperative board game to teach immunology. To evaluate Virulence’s effectiveness, 30 Year 12 students from an international school in Bangkok participated in small-group sessions. A 36 -item test was completed by participants before and after gameplay, with immunology questions categorized by Bloom’s taxonomy to assess knowledge retention, understanding and application. A separate questionnaire collected participant feedback. Data normality was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk Test, followed by analysis using Paired T-Tests and the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Results showed a statistically significant improvement in short-term knowledge retention and understanding ($\\mathrm{p}\\lt 0.05$), though gains in application were statistically insignificant ($\\mathrm{p} \\boldsymbol{\\gt } {0 . 0 5}$). The questionnaire feedback indicated that participants found Virulence to be useful, motivating and replayable, but also not as technical as lessons. This study’s limitations include the lack of a control, the effect of the participants’ subject history and of the facilitator in the sessions. Even with these limits, Virulence helped students learn immunology, the cooperative genre for board games shows merits, and the POV-3D framework has promising utility for educators, but should be tested further.",

Forrester's original Beer Game and demonstrates how modern technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and concepts of Serious Games (SGs) can elevate traditional learning tools to a new level of effectiveness. We present a VR-based SG version of Forrester's Beer Game to teach about the Bullwhip Effect in supply chain contexts, providing a rich decision context to students. The project integrates role-specific mini-games for each participant in the supply chain: retailer, wholesaler, distributor, and brewery (i.e., manufacturer). A user study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the developed VR SG. The results of the user study support the educational value and technical stability of the system while also identifying clear directions for future development. The findings highlight the importance of balancing game length and challenge level to sustain user engagement over multiple rounds. Developers should aim to optimize mini-game durations and incorporate adaptive difficulty to maintain motivation. Additionally, embedding educational content more intuitively within the gameplay, rather than through passive text, is essential to enhance flow and knowledge retention.",

This is mainly due to the presence of multiple files, functions, classes and various dependencies existing among themselves. This calls for an efficient pipeline to extract additional context for the LLM agent in a RAG system. In this paper, we try to investigate two methodologies for efficiently retrieving relevant information from source code repositories, namely CodeSplitter in LlamaIndex and CodexGraph. CodeSplitter uses AST parsing to form semantically meaningful code chunks that are efficiently and precisely retrieved within structured boundaries, whereas CodexGraph employs static analysis to comprehensively create graph databases encapsulating inter-file and inter-module relationships and perform holistic reasoning. We analyse the performance of both of these pipelines by implementing a RAG system using Large Language Models like GPT-4.0 and LLaMA 3.2 to evaluate their effectiveness in improving code analysis, retrieval, and project knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "The research investigates gamification methods as it applies to the emerging interdisciplinary domain that brings together cybersecurity with neuroscience and psychology. Neurocybersecurity implements neural concepts to protect digital systems from security threats while targeting the human vulnerabilities that present as the strongest points of attack. Several researchers have examined gamification techniques which incorporate game design elements to enhance cybersecurity training outcomes by improving user participation and knowledge retention and user conduct compliance. The research incorporates Self-Determination Theory along with Cognitive Load Theory to explain the design principles for efficient gamified interventions. The implementation of both cognitive performance improvement and neuroplasticity enhancement along with decision capability retainment under high-pressure circumstances results from real-time feedback and simulation-based training methods. The implementation of gamification presents continued obstacles including data privacy ethics problems and cognitive overload together with declining participant motivation during extended periods of use. Research curated in this article brings together scholarly works spanning 2020 to 2024 while presenting theoretical frameworks alongside an evaluation of adaptive gamification's scope regarding different population groups. The author recommends future cybersecurity research must integrate AI personalization techniques with virtual reality and augmented reality technologies to maximize neurocybersecurity training results. Gamification shows promise for addressing human-related security weaknesses based on this analysis which provides guidance for integrated research development in the future.",

    "Abstract": "The demand for effective disaster preparedness training in hospitals is steadily increasing, as healthcare staff need to handle emergencies efficiently while providing patient care. However, conventional training methods like live drills and tabletop exercises can require significant resources, limit participation, and disrupt hospital operations. In light of these challenges, Virtual Reality (VR) training has emerged as a modern solution, offering an innovative way to improve training efficiency without interfering with routine hospital activities. This study, therefore, examines how VR training compares to traditional methods in preparing hospital personnel for disasters, focusing specifically on effectiveness and cost. We reviewed studies concerning the effectiveness and economic assessments of VR compared to traditional methods. To answer the research questions, we followed the Canada Drug Agency's guides on conducting a health technology assessment. Articles were identified from both peer-reviewed and gray literature. The review highlights eight pertinent studies demonstrating VR's advantages, including boosting knowledge retention, performance, and overall confidence among healthcare professionals in disaster preparedness. Furthermore, the economic analysis indicates that although the initial costs of VR synchronous training may be higher, the long-term savings from reduced ongoing training and maintenance can lead to greater cost efficiency. In addition, while VR training presents safety benefits, challenges such as cybersickness and accessibility concerns have also been observed. VR training offers considerable advantages over traditional disaster preparedness methods and significantly improves healthcare workers' confidence and skills. Despite the high upfront costs, the potential long-term financial benefits appear promising. To maximize results, funding for VR initiatives must emphasize demonstrated effectiveness alongside ongoing research to explore broader applications and address the challenges posed by these emerging technologies.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to evaluate early childhood nutrition knowledge and practices in Gicumbi District, Rwanda, and assess the potential of parents’ evening forums as platforms for community-based nutrition education. Design: This study employed a mixed-methods design incorporating structured questionnaires (quantitative) and focus group discussions and interviews (qualitative). Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Spearman’s rank correlation to explore associations among participation, knowledge application and access barriers. Thematic analysis was applied to qualitative data to capture contextual insights and educational preferences. Setting: The study was conducted in Gicumbi District, a rural region in northern Rwanda, characterised by high malnutrition rates. Participants: 523 participants: 471 household heads completed questionnaires; 52 took part in focus group discussions and interviews. Results: The study revealed substantial knowledge gaps, with only 46 % of participants aware of the symptoms of malnutrition and just 32 % identifying nutrient-rich complementary foods. Despite 68 % of participants reporting social connection as a key motivator for joining parents’ evening forums, logistical challenges such as time and travel barriers were cited by 41 % as constraints. Lectures were the most preferred teaching method (78 %), followed by cooking demonstrations (56 %). Qualitative findings emphasised the importance of local relevance, peer support and interactive learning for fostering participation and knowledge retention. Conclusions: Parents’ evening forums represent a viable and contextually appropriate platform for delivering early childhood nutrition education. Their expansion, alongside the integration of digital tools and tailored, experiential teaching approaches, could strengthen community engagement and address persistent malnutrition challenges in Rwanda and comparable settings.",

    "Abstract": "This project evaluated whether implementing an evidence-based educational intervention enhanced nurses’ knowledge of dietary considerations essential to managing heart failure. Heart failure is a chronic condition requiring comprehensive care, with diet playing an important role in promoting heart health and preventing complications. Nurses are key educators in guiding patients on fluid intake and sodium restrictions, which are essential components of effective heart failure management. This intervention aimed to improve nurses’ knowledge and confidence in delivering dietary counseling through a targeted training session. Licensed registered nurses currently working with heart failure patients were invited to participate if they were over 18, proficient in English, and had computer access. Pre- and post-intervention surveys using the Nurses Knowledge of Heart Failure Education Principles Survey (NKHFEPS) measured changes in knowledge. Data were analyzed using a paired t-test with a significance level set at p < 0.05. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess normality, and descriptive statistics were used to examine demographic variables such as age, education, and years of experience. Results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in post-test scores (t = -2.77, p = 0.014), indicating increased knowledge following the intervention. Findings suggested positive trends in nurse knowledge and comfort with dietary education. Limitations included a small sample size. The project emphasized the need for ongoing, targeted education to enhance nurse-led dietary interventions in heart failure care. Future research should include larger, more diverse samples and explore long-term effects on knowledge retention, clinical outcomes, and self-efficacy. This work supports the integration of structured education into professional development for improved patient outcomes and nursing practice.",

    "Abstract": "Promoting domestic fire safety is crucial for preventing and effectively managing risky situations. This study evaluated the effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) in fire drills to improve citizens’ knowledge and safe behavior in domestic settings. Conducted at the Citizen School for Risk Prevention (CSRP) in Zaragoza (Spain), the experiment involved 20 participants facing a simulated kitchen fire using a combination of physical and virtual extinguishing equipment. A theoretical session accompanied the drills to reinforce learning. Participants were divided into two groups: one completed the drill before and after the theoretical session, while the other completed it only afterward. Performance was assessed based on the ability to extinguish, control, or lose control of the fire. Surveys administered before, immediately after, and three months after training measured knowledge retention and behavioral changes. The results indicate a significant improvement in fire safety awareness and lasting adoption of safe practices. Participants also emerged as safety advocates. This study highlights the potential of combining theoretical instruction with immersive practical training and identifies strategies for replicating this approach in other prevention schools.",

    "Abstract": "The application of extended reality (XR) in design education has grown substantially; however, empirical evidence on its educational benefits remains limited. This two-year study examines the impact of incorporating a virtual reality (VR) learning module into undergraduate landscape architecture (LA) construction courses, focusing on brick masonry instruction. A conventional learning sequence—lecture, sketching, CAD, and 3D modeling—was supplemented with an immersive VR experience developed using Unreal Engine 5 and deployed on Meta Quest devices. In Year 1, we piloted a preliminary version of the module with landscape architecture students ( n = 15), and data on implementation feasibility and student perception were collected. In Year 2, we refined the learning module and implemented it with a new cohort ( n = 16) using standardized VR evaluation metrics, knowledge retention tests, and self-efficacy surveys. The findings suggest that when sequenced after a theoretical introduction, VR serves as a pedagogical bridge between abstract construction principles and physical implementation. Moreover, the VR module enhanced student engagement and self-efficacy by offering experiential learning with immediate feedback. The findings highlight the need for intentional design, institutional support, and the continued development of tactile, collaborative simulations.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The education process for newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) patients and their families, primarily led by diabetes specialist nurses, is essential for gaining knowledge about the disease and its management. However, few assessment tools have been employed to evaluate long-term knowledge retention among T1D patients years after diagnosis. Methods: We developed a 20-question test to assess the knowledge of patients and their families at the conclusion of the initial education process and again 6–12 months later. Demographic and clinical data were also collected. Statistical analyses included comparisons between the first and second test results, as well as evaluation of potential contributing factors. The internal consistency and construct validity of the questionnaire were evaluated. Results: Forty-four patients completed both assessments, with a median interval of 11.5 months between them. The average score on the first test was 88.6, which declined to 82.7 on the second assessment ( p < 0.001). In univariate analysis, factors positively associated with higher scores included Jewish ethnicity, lower HbA1c levels, and shorter hospitalization duration. Multivariate analysis revealed that parents had lower odds of experiencing a significant score decline compared to patients. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.69, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) identified eight components accounting for 67.1% of the total variance. Conclusions: Healthcare providers should consider offering re-education to patients and their families approximately one year after diagnosis, with particular attention to high-risk populations during the initial education phase. Further studies are needed to examine this tool’s performance in larger cohorts.",

The integration of immersive tools such as virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) into AEC curricula has shown enormous potential in enhancing learning outcomes. Despite the increasing popularity of these tools, their adoption for sustainable construction materials and systems such as mass timber building remains underexplored, especially for teaching and facilitating their curricula delivery. This study adopted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines and a scientometric analysis across key AEC journals. The study synthesizes findings from 69 peer-reviewed articles across three databases. While the findings suggest that VR/AR significantly enhances learning outcomes, key gaps such as lack of standardized evaluation metrics, inadequate faculty training, and a lack of a robust integration framework persist, especially for mass timber and overall sustainability education. This study proposed a foundational framework for VR/AR integration in AEC curricula for mass timbers education and highlighted some pedagogical strategies for bridging the identified gaps. The insights establish the basis for future research that will develop and evaluate a VR-based instructional tool to teach mass timber and sustainable construction education.",

    "Abstract": "Immersive technologies like extended Reality (XR) are becoming more mature and prevalent, presenting significant opportunities to enhance learners' motivation, engagement, comprehension, and long-term knowledge retention. This incentivizes higher education institutions (HEIs) to adopt XR. However, HEIs are bureaucratic organizations that are notoriously difficult to change, with a large number of decision-makers distributed across various levels of the organizational hierarchy. Thus, understanding stakeholder roles and needs is essential for successful XR integration. This study presents findings from a case study on XR implementation processes at Virginia Tech (VT), approaching the challenge as a systems engineering (SE) problem. A stakeholder identification exercise - a key step in problem formulation - documents the stakeholders involved, their roles, nuanced needs, and how these factors influence XR implementation and long-term sustainment. Findings indicate that even a relatively simple project requires the involvement of many stakeholders, leading to unpredictable latencies between stakeholder actions to overcome barriers. Furthermore, high costs associated with hardware, software, infrastructure, and content development, along with faculty skepticism and institutional resistance to change, further hinder adoption. Effective integration requires a pedagogically driven approach, prioritizing clear learning objectives over technological novelty. Although this case study focuses on VT's socio-technical system, its findings contribute to a broader understanding of the complexities associated with XR integration in HEIs. The insights guide stakeholders in navigating similar challenges. Future research should continue exploring XR's effectiveness across diverse educational contexts and refine user experiences for broader adoption.",

    "Abstract": "This dissertation explores a structured educational intervention aimed at enhancing confidence and knowledge retention among phase II cardiac rehabilitation patients through the “teach back” method. Drawing from a semi-structured interview with a former patient, fishbone diagram and empathy interview, insights regarding the need for structured education in cardiac rehabilitation and the missed opportunity for improved patient engagement were gained. This study proposed a 12-session individualized education program designed to equip phase II cardiac rehabilitation patients with the knowledge, skills and confidence to excel in their cardiac health maintenance in phase III cardiac rehabilitation. The program aims to foster a more holistic care approach, improving patient outcomes and reducing clinician burnout. The proposed changes were assessed through 3 key inquiry questions: 1. Are phase II cardiac rehabilitation patients comfortable with the teach back method and the structure of education? 2. To what extent did the intervention impact the phase II cardiac rehabilitation patients knowledge of their individual cardiac health and confidence in themselves to maintain their improved cardiac health into phase III? 3. How did this intervention impact my co-workers time management with their responsibilities? This study’s methods, results, implications and conclusions are expected to inform best practices in phase II cardiac rehabilitation and contribute to the development of more comprehensive, supportive care models that integrate physical, mental, and social health.",

    "Abstract": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition impacting approximately 4.6 million children, with high rates of uncontrolled cases in Missouri. This quality improvement project aimed to explore the use of a digital media system to provide asthma education to children and families receiving care in a rural pediatric pulmonology clinic aged 6 months- 21 years of age; and to assess preferred media format, priority topics, and knowledge gained from exposure to digital educational materials. Utilizing a prospective cohort design, families completed a pre-survey to identify educational preferences and tailored digital asthma education through the use of Patient Education Genius (PEG). A post-survey measured knowledge retention and satisfaction. Over the 20-week period, 37 families expressed interest in digital asthma education, 13 completed the pre-survey, and one completed the post-survey. Although statistical analysis was not feasible due to insufficient data, initial data showed strong interest in digital education. Families prioritized areas of learning such as emergency care, trigger identification, and medication administration. Non-cartoon and cartoon media were rated as equally beneficial for learning purposes. Multiple limitations were observed over the course of this quality improvement study. However, this project indicates digital tools may enhance asthma education. Future research is encouraged with utilization of a large sample size and robust study design to combat observed limitations and evaluate digital media’s true impact on asthma education and disease management within the pediatric population.",

    "Abstract": "It is not known how surgical nurses describe the influence of self-guided digital learning (SDLM) on their self-efficacy and performance expectations. This gap affects how nurses perceive and utilize digital learning platforms to enhance their skills. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore how surgical nurses in Ohio describe the impact of SDLMs on self-efficacy and performance expectations. The study involved 16 surgical nurses, supplemented by two focus groups of six participants each. Data were collected through demographic questionnaires, interviews, and focus group discussions and analyzed using Braun and Clarke’s six-phase reflective thematic analysis with MAXQDA 2022 for data management. Grounded in self-efficacy theory, findings revealed that SDLMs positively influenced nurses’ learning strategies, innovation, and ability to work under pressure, fostering self-efficacy. Barriers to self-efficacy emerged, yet SDLMs were associated with improved quality of service, deeper field understanding, and better teamwork. Notably, new nurses displayed enhanced knowledge retention and confidence, while seasoned nurses showed signs of complacency. These results highlight the need to balance repetitive learning without alienating experienced staff. Positive social implications include fostering teamwork and continuous professional development among surgical nurses. Future research should focus on strategies to incorporate repetitive module use effectively for all experience levels.",

    "Abstract": "This study explored virtual reality (VR) technology to enhance cultural learning in heritage tourism, aligning with a focus on learning systems. Traditional models lack interactivity, but VR digitizes artifacts and historical scenarios. Through surveys (1,200 participants) and data analysis, VR improved student knowledge retention by 45% (F=8.3, p&1t;0.01) and increased visits by 42–75%. While boosting stay time (39%) and consumption (41%), challenges include content stagnation (23% revisit decline) and hardware discomfort (55% dissatisfaction). Proposed solutions are ergonomic headsets (33–50% weight reduction), dynamic content updates, and in-scene augmented-reality commerce (27% online revenue growth in pilots). These innovations position VR as a non-formal learning tool for heritage preservation and digital education. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "Tyrimo problema. Šiandien vis dažniau kalbant lytiškumo temomis, svarstant apie poreikį ir būtinybę šviesti mokinius, diskutuojant kaip tai turėtų vykti, vis daugiau paauglių atvirai kelia klausimus apie savo lytinę tapatybę. Ieškant lytinio tapatumo paauglys gali išgyventi vidinius konfliktus, sulaukti kitų žmonių nemalonių reakcijų, susidurti su nerimu, depresijos simptomais, savęs žalojimu ar savižudybės rizika (Dora ir kt., 2021). Lytinio tapatumo paieškos ir juos lydintys sunkumai paliečia ne tik pačius paauglius, bet ir jų šeimos narius, o ypač tėvus, kurie dažnai turi prisiimti atsakomybę už savo vaiką bei priimti svarbus sprendimus, įtakojančius jo ateitį (Caldarera ir kt., 2021). Šiais laikais tėvai, susidūrę su sudėtingomis situacijomis, linkę dažniau ieškoti psichologinės, socialinės pagalbos bei palaikymo. Nepaisant to, kad tokios paslaugos yra siūlomos, Lietuvoje vis dar trūksta atviro kalbėjimo apie tėvų patirtis šioje srityje ir atrodo, kad su lytiškumu susijusios temos vis dar išlieka tabu. Tuo pačiu ir ši jautri visuomenės grupė vis dar lieka nuošalyje – ir pačių tėvų pasirinkimu, ir tyrimų kontekste. Lietuvoje lytinio tapatumo ieškančių ir jų šeimos narių patirtys kol kas nėra plačiai analizuojamos, nepavyko rasti ir mokslinių darbų apie tėvų patirtis, o užsienio literatūroje lytiškumo temos paauglystėje dažniau tyrinėjamos klinikiniu pagrindu. Tėvų vaidmuo tokioje situacijoje yra labai reikšmingas, nes nuo jų reakcijos, supratimo ir palaikymo priklauso paauglio psichologinė gerovė, pasitikėjimas savimi, savivertė. Tyrimo tikslas – atskleisti mamų patyrimus, auginant paauglį, ieškantį lytinio tapatumo. Tyrimo dalyviai. Mamos, auginančios paauglį (12-17 metų amžiaus), kuris turi lytinio tapatumo sunkumų (lyties pajautimas nesutampa su biologine lytimi) ir susiduria su šiais sunkumais ne trumpiau nei 6 mėnesius (n=7). Tyrimo metodai. Tyrimui atlikti pasirinktas kokybinis metodas. Duomenys buvo renkami naudojant pusiau struktūruotą interviu. Tyrimas atliktas 2024 birželio – rugpjūčio mėnesiais didžiuosiuose Lietuvos miestuose. Duomenys analizuoti pasitelkus aprašomąją fenomenologinę duomenų analizę pagal P. Colaizzi. Tyrimo atlikimui leidimą davė Lietuvos sveikatos mokslų universiteto Bioetikos centras. Išvados. 1) Mamos, auginančios lytinio tapatumo ieškančius paauglius, patyrė netekties jausmą, kaltę, nerimą, baimę, nežinomybę, liūdesį. Mamų išgyvenimai susiję su žinių stoka, lūkesčių ir vilčių praradimu, suvokimu apie tarsi pasikeitusią paauglio lytį. Mamoms susitaikius ir priėmus esamą situaciją, emociniai išgyvenimai tapo lengviau pakeliami, o dėmesys – labiau sutelktas į pagalbą vaikui bei šeimos poreikius. 2) Mamų pagalba ir palaikymas paaugliams, sudėtingame jų gyvenimo etape, sąlygojo artimesnį mamų ir vaikų tarpusavio ryšį. 3) Mamos išsakė patyrusios sunkumus rasti kvalifikuotų specialistų, kurie galėtų atsakyti į visus rūpimus klausimus bei profesionaliai konsultuotų paauglį lytiškumo klausimais. 4) Mamos išsakė emocinės pagalbos poreikį, bet nurodė susidūrusios su problema rasti psichologą, kuris konsultuotų lytinio tapatumo klausimais. Tėvų paramos grupė, susidūrus su paauglio lytinio tapatumo paieškų sunkumais, tapo pagrindiniu paramos šaltiniu. 5) Kaip svarbiausius lūkesčius visuomenei mamos išsakė priėmimą ir toleranciją jų vaikams, pokyčius švietimo sistemoje lytiškumo ugdymo klausimais. Alternate abstract: Research problem. Today, as we increasingly talk about sexuality, consider the need and necessity to educate students, and discuss how this should happen, more and more adolescents openly raise questions about their sexual identity. In search of sexual identity, an adolescent may experience internal conflicts, receive unpleasant reactions from others, face anxiety, symptoms of depression, self-harm, or the risk of suicide (Dora et al., 2021). The search for sexual identity and the difficulties that arise affect not only adolescents themselves, but also their family members, especially parents, who often must take responsibility for their child and make important decisions that affect his or her future. Therefore, not only adolescents face difficult experiences, but parents also often experience various unpleasant feelings (Caldarera et al., 2021). Nowadays, parents, faced with difficult situations, tend to seek psychological, social help and support more often. Even though such services are offered, in Lithuania there is still a lack of open discussion about parents' experiences in this area and it seems that topics related to sexuality remain taboo. At the same time, this sensitive group of society is still left aside - both by the parents' own choice and in the context of research. In Lithuania, this topic has not yet been widely analyzed, it was not possible to find scientific works on parents' experiences, and in foreign literature, topics of sexuality in adolescence are more often studied on a clinical basis. The role of parents in such a situation is very significant, because the psychological well-being, self-confidence, and self-esteem of the teenager depend on their reaction, understanding and support. The aim – to reveal mothers' experiences raising a teenager who is searching for gender identity. Participants: Mothers raising an adolescent (aged 12-17) who has gender identity difficulties (a sense of gender does not match their biological sex) and has been experiencing these difficulties for at least 6 months (n=7). Research methods. A qualitative method was chosen for the study. Data were collected using a semistructured interview. The study was conducted from June to August 2024 in major Lithuanian cities. The data were analyzed using descriptive phenomenological data analysis according to P. Colaizzi. Permission to conduct the study was granted by the Bioethics Center of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences. Research results. After analyzing the data, 5 main themes emerged: 1. Psychological experiences of mothers in the search for their child's gender identity; 2. The path to a closer relationship with a teenager; 3. Wandering in information labyrinths; 4. Need and search for emotional support; 5. Mothers' expectations of society. Conclusions. 1) Mothers raising adolescents seeking gender identity experienced a sense of loss, guilt, anxiety, fear, uncertainty, and sadness. Mothers' experiences were related to a lack of knowledge, loss of expectations and hopes, and perception of the adolescent's seemingly changed gender. As mothers reconciled and accepted the current situation, emotional experiences became easier to bear, and attention was more focused on helping the child and the needs of the family. 2) Mothers' help and support for adolescents during a difficult stage of their lives led to a closer relationship between mothers and children. 3) Mothers expressed that they experienced difficulties in finding qualified specialists who could answer all their questions and professionally advise the adolescent on issues of sexuality. 4) Mothers expressed a need for emotional help but indicated that they would find a psychologist to advise on gender identity issues if they encountered a problem. The parent support group, faced with the difficulties of adolescents' search for gender identity, became the main source of support. 5) As the most important expectations from society, mothers expressed acceptance and tolerance for their children, and changes in the education system regarding issues of sexuality education.",

    "Abstract": "Effective Knowledge Transfer (KT) is widely recognized as a cornerstone of success in Enterprise System Projects (ESPs). However, despite its critical role, many ESPs continue to suffer from poor KT practices, resulting in delays, cost overruns, and suboptimal system adoption. This study aims to develop a qualitative constructivist framework for assessing knowledge transfer in ESPs to advance the ESPs' success. This study introduces the Transfer Success Self-Assessment Framework (KTSSAF), a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework designed to systematically evaluate KT effectiveness across ESP phases. Drawing upon the Information Systems (IS) Success Theory, the KTSSAF is built around the Project Management Process Groups (PMPG), enabling organizations to assess KT at granular levels within the pre-, during-, and post-implementation stages of ESPs. The development of KTSSAF was guided by a qualitative constructivist methodology, combining insights from semi-structured interviews with domain experts and a comprehensive literature review, an assessment kit, and a scoring mechanism tailored to enterprise-specific knowledge clusters and project phases. The framework supports ESP stakeholders in identifying KT gaps, forecasting KT success, and implementing targeted improvements. Empirical validation through expert reviews and pilot studies demonstrates the framework's practical utility and theoretical contributions. KTSSAF empowers organizations to make informed decisions regarding knowledge management strategies, facilitating improved knowledge retention, enhanced system use, and increased stakeholder engagement. By addressing longstanding gaps in KT evaluation within ESPs, this study contributes a structured, repeatable approach for practitioners and researchers to enhance KT outcomes and overall ESP success.",

    "Abstract": "This thesis details the creation of a novel Digital Energy Assessment (DEA) tool aimed at addressing the gap between theoretical instruction and practical experience in energy management and auditing education. Recognizing that traditional lecture-based instructional methods frequently lack opportunities for experiential learning, this study proposes a comprehensive training approach utilizing cutting-edge digital technologies. Central to this training strategy is a meticulously developed 3D-scanned virtual model of a real-world educational building, offering learners a safe, controlled environment to practice the identification of energy-saving opportunities and execute data-collection procedures. Integrated into this digital framework is the Building Energy Efficiency Profiler (BEEP), a user-friendly graphical interface linked with EnergyPlus simulation software, enabling interactive analysis of how various building parameters and climate conditions influence energy usage. Furthermore, structured laboratory instructions were crafted to methodically lead learners through the virtual environment, supporting hands-on practice in detecting energy inefficiencies, interpreting collected data, and performing economic evaluations, such as payback period estimations for proposed energy conservation measures. Thus, the DEA tool provides learners with a realistic, immersive, and reproducible training context, effectively enhancing learner confidence, knowledge retention, and workforce readiness.",

    "Abstract": "Background: As of 2021, there were 47 million immigrants in the United States. Immigrant populations are uninsured at higher rates than US citizens, leading many to rely on emergency departments (ED) for their healthcare needs. However, emergency physicians (EP) often lack training on the unique challenges faced by this population, necessitating educational interventions. Methods: We implemented educational interventions for an urban emergency medicine residency program using Kern’s six-step approach for curriculum development to inform EPs of existing immigration-specific patient resources; teach social-medical-legal best practices with regard to asking, documenting, and sharing immigration-specific health information; and increase awareness of ED-relevant local policies. We developed three educational interventions.in collaboration with legal organizations, and community experts. To evaluate the success of these interventions we administered a pre- and post-survey to 64 EPs (36% of 178 targeted learners) Results: We found a significant increase in confidence and knowledge, with an average 5-point Likert scale score improvement of 1.47 (P < .001) in all responses and 1.40 (P < .001) in paired responses, and an improvement in test scores on the three knowledge-based questions of 30.66% (P < .001) in all responses and 33% (P = .02) in paired responses. Conclusion: This study highlights a model for interprofessional collaboration in curriculum development and the importance of a multipronged educational approach to improve the care of immigrants in the ED. The curriculum offers a framework for other EDs aiming to address healthcare inequities for this population. Future research can explore long-term knowledge retention, detailed educational tool utilization, and the impact on patients.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge retention is crucial in medical education, yet traditional study methods often fail to ensure long-term recall. Spaced repetition, a cognitive learning strategy that reinforces information at increasing intervals, has shown promise in enhancing retention and engagement. While widely used in self-directed learning, its role in structured medical education remains underexplored. This study evaluates the effectiveness of spaced repetition in improving knowledge retention and student engagement in undergraduate paediatric education, offering insights into its potential for enhancing learning outcomes. Background Knowledge retention is crucial in medical education, yet traditional study methods often fail to ensure long-term recall. Spaced repetition, a cognitive learning strategy that reinforces information at increasing intervals, has shown promise in enhancing retention and engagement. While widely used in self-directed learning, its role in structured medical education remains underexplored. This study evaluates the effectiveness of spaced repetition in improving knowledge retention and student engagement in undergraduate paediatric education, offering insights into its potential for enhancing learning outcomes.This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of spaced-repetition in improving knowledge retention and student engagement in undergraduate paediatric education. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of spaced-repetition in improving knowledge retention and student engagement in undergraduate paediatric education.A quasi-experimental study was conducted over 6 months at the Department of Paediatrics, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi (Meghe). Ninety final-year medical students were divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention group used digital flashcards following spaced-repetition intervals of 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days. The control group followed traditional study methods. Knowledge retention was assessed using pre-tests and post-tests, each containing 20 multiple-choice questions. Data were analysed using paired and independent t -tests. Qualitative feedback from the intervention group was thematically analysed to assess engagement and motivation.

    "Abstract": "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), launched by the United Nations in 2015, outline 17 interconnected objectives designed to promote human well-being and sustainable development worldwide. Education is recognized by the United Nations as a key factor in promoting sustainable development. To cultivate students with both global perspectives and local engagement, it is essential to integrate sustainability education into elementary curricula. Accordingly, this study aimed to enhance elementary school students’ understanding of the SDGs by designing a structured instructional activity and developing a hybrid digital-physical board game. The game was implemented as a supplementary review tool to traditional classroom teaching, leveraging the motivational and knowledge-retention benefits of physical board games while incorporating digital features to support learning process monitoring. To address the limitations of conventional review approaches—such as reduced student engagement and increased cognitive load—the instructional model incorporated the board game during review sessions following formal instruction. This was intended to maintain student attention and reduce unnecessary cognitive effort, thereby supporting learning in sustainability-related content. A quasi-experimental design was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the instructional intervention and the board game system, focusing on three outcome variables: learning motivation, cognitive load, and learning achievement. The results indicated that students in the game-based Sustainable Development Goals group achieved significantly higher delayed posttest scores (M = 72.91, SD = 15.17) than the traditional review group (M = 61.30, SD = 22.82; p < 0.05). In addition, they reported significantly higher learning motivation (M = 4.40, SD = 0.64) compared to the traditional group (M = 3.99, SD = 0.69; p < 0.05) and lower cognitive load (M = 1.84, SD = 1.39) compared to the traditional group (M = 2.66, SD = 1.30; p < 0.05), suggesting that the proposed approach effectively supported student learning in sustainability education at the elementary level.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Health education plays a vital role in training health professionals and caregivers, supporting both prevention and the promotion of self-care. In this context, technology serves as a valuable ally by enabling continuous and flexible learning. Among the various domains of health education, nutrition stands out as a key element in the management of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), helping to prevent malnutrition and enhance patient well-being. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching and learning processes within a learning pathway focused on food and nutrition in the context of ALS. Methods: This study adopted a longitudinal, quantitative design. The learning pathway, titled “Food and Nutrition in ALS,” consisted of four self-paced and self-instructional Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), offered through the Virtual Learning Environment of the Brazilian Health System (AVASUS). Participants included health professionals, caregivers, and patients from all five regions of Brazil. Participants had the autonomy to complete the courses in any order, with no prerequisites for enrollment. Results: Out of 14,263 participants enrolled nationwide, 182 were included in this study after signing the Informed Consent Form. Of these, 142 (78%) completed at least one course and participated in the educational intervention. A significant increase in knowledge was observed, with mean pre-test scores rising from 7.3 (SD = 1.8) to 9.6 (SD = 0.9) on the post-test across all courses ( p < 0.001). Conclusions: The self-instructional, technology-mediated continuing education model proved effective in improving participants’ knowledge about nutrition in ALS. Future studies should explore knowledge retention, behavior change, and the impact of such interventions on clinical outcomes, especially in multidisciplinary care settings.",

    "Abstract": "Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and chronic hypertension, are among the leading causes of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality globally, affecting approximately 10% of pregnancies. Despite established clinical guidelines, a significant gap remains in provider knowledge and the consistent application of evidence-based practices, particularly during the postpartum period and among marginalized populations. This Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) project addressed this gap by implementing a staff education program using the evidence-based California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC, 2021) toolkit. The intervention consisted of a pretest to assess baseline knowledge, an interactive PowerPoint presentation based on the CMQCC toolkit, and a posttest to measure knowledge retention. Results showed an increase in average test scores from 77.5% to 91.7%, representing a 14.2 score improvement. Findings suggest the intervention was effective in enhancing clinical understanding and management of HDP among participating providers. The project could support earlier clinical interventions, more accurate diagnoses, and greater consistency in care. HDP remains a leading cause of preventable maternal mortality worldwide, particularly in low-resource settings and among women of color, who continue to face systemic disparities in diagnosis and treatment (Chambers et al., 2022; World Health Organization, 2024). This educational model is scalable and adaptable, providing a practical framework for enhancing provider preparedness and promoting equitable, evidence-based maternal care across diverse health care settings.",

Introduction The inclusion of active learning in veterinary medical education has received significant focus in recent years. Game-based learning is an unconventional form of active learning and its use in education within the health sciences has been investigated.This study evaluated the use of a card game to teach antimicrobial use in dogs and cats with bacterial diseases as a supplement to traditional methods of teaching. Methods This study evaluated the use of a card game to teach antimicrobial use in dogs and cats with bacterial diseases as a supplement to traditional methods of teaching.This study found that third- and fourth-year veterinary students' comfort in antimicrobial decision-making increased for four infectious diseases following the inclusion of a card game during rounds. No similar improvement was noted for a disease that was not included in the card game. Students perceived that the game improved their understanding of antimicrobials in dogs and cats and students universally enjoyed playing the game. Results This study found that third- and fourth-year veterinary students' comfort in antimicrobial decision-making increased for four infectious diseases following the inclusion of a card game during rounds. No similar improvement was noted for a disease that was not included in the card game.

    "Abstract": "This study explored virtual reality (VR) technology to enhance cultural learning in heritage tourism, aligning with a focus on learning systems. Traditional models lack interactivity, but VR digitizes artifacts and historical scenarios. Through surveys (1,200 participants) and data analysis, VR improved student knowledge retention by 45% (F=8.3, p<0.01) and increased visits by 42–75%. While boosting stay time (39%) and consumption (41%), challenges include content stagnation (23% revisit decline) and hardware discomfort (55% dissatisfaction). Proposed solutions are ergonomic headsets (33–50% weight reduction), dynamic content updates, and in-scene augmented-reality commerce (27% online revenue growth in pilots). These innovations position VR as a non-formal learning tool for heritage preservation and digital education.",

    "Abstract": "Public sector organizations face increasing cybersecurity risks due to the growing complexity of digital infrastructure, expanding attack surfaces, and evolving threat landscapes. Despite the increasing risk, many Information Technology (IT) leaders continue to struggle with implementing comprehensive and sustainable strategies to protect information systems. Grounded in Ajzen’s theory of planned behavior, the purpose of qualitative pragmatic inquiry was to explore effective cybersecurity strategies IT leaders in the public sector use to protect organizations from cyberattacks, maintain public trust, and prevent financial losses. The project examined how attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence leaders’ cybersecurity practices. Data were collected from six IT leaders in the public sector, who successfully implemented effective cybersecurity strategies, utilizing a combination of semi-structured interviews and document reviews. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data, revealing three themes: prioritizing cybersecurity awareness and training, promoting stakeholder collaboration and audits, and embedding adaptive governance and culture. A key recommendation is the implementation of role-based cybersecurity training, tailored to employee responsibilities, to enhance engagement and knowledge retention. The implications for positive social change include improved protection of public digital infrastructure, enhanced public trust in government services, and the promotion of ethical leadership practices in cybersecurity management by IT leaders in public sector organizations.",

    "Abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a transformative technology in education, enabling immersive simulations that foster student engagement and improve knowledge retention. This study presents a bibliometric analysis of global trends, research patterns, and challenges related to the integration of VR in educational contexts. Data were collected from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), and Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) within the Web of Science Core Collection, including only articles also indexed in Scopus to ensure high-quality and comprehensive coverage. Of the 1220 articles published between 2010 and 2024, 97 met the inclusion criteria based on relevance, accessibility, and methodological rigor. We performed keyword analysis, citation analysis, and thematic mapping using RStudio and the Bibliometrix package. The findings indicate that the United States, China, and the United Kingdom are the most active contributors to VR research in education. VR has been applied across diverse learning modalities, enriching both formal and informal educational environments. However, its widespread adoption faces several barriers, including high implementation costs, health and safety concerns, limited curricular integration, and insufficient educator training. Proposed solutions include strategic partnerships with technology providers and the use of cloud-based infrastructures to reduce costs and complexity. This study offers actionable insights for educators, policymakers, and developers, providing a robust, data-driven foundation for the effective and equitable integration of VR in education.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this research is to investigate how AI-improved dynamic physical education materials impact middle school education in physical settings. Utilizing a randomized controlled crossover approach, a 16-week study involved 120 students aged 12 to 18 to evaluate the impact of AI-enhanced physical education courses against traditional instructional techniques. Findings indicated a notable improvement in the AI group compared to traditional instruction in terms of physical fitness (23% enhancement), motor skill proficiency (31% improvement), and knowledge retention (27% enhancement) (p < 0.01). Evaluations of system usability reveal that users have an excellent experience (SUS score 84.3), with a 4.7/5 satisfaction score. Qualitative feedback underscores the importance of personalized coaching and real-time feedback. Notably, the AI system shows exceptional effectiveness for students with lower initial levels of physical fitness. An analysis after three months revealed a 19% success in comprehensive performance metrics (p < 0.01). This evidence points to the AI-aided physical education resources improving learning and user satisfaction, and opens new pathways for physical education innovation. Further investigation into long-term effects and widespread application across various educational contexts is needed.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Assess the impact of a novel Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) training for Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (EFAST) presented to US Ski and Snowboard (USSS) physicians at the Medical Emergencies in Skiing and Snowboarding (MESS) course in January 2024 in Park City, Utah. Methods: Prospective cohort analysis of an EFAST training including a one-hour didactic session, 30-min hands-on scanning session, 30-min competition-style group and individual assessment. Pre- and post-training testing was administered to evaluate procedure proficiency and knowledge retention. Hands-on skills training utilized volunteer standardized patients with a variety of portable POCUS instruments. The effectiveness of the EFAST training modality was evaluated based upon pre- to post-training test scores. Results: The cohort consisted of 62 physicians representing various specialties with a 65%, n = 40, response rate. Post-test scores showed a significant increase of 54% (p < 0.001). Self-rated 'Novices' in ultrasound experience had the greatest score increase (0.50 ± 0.31; p < 0.01), while self-rated 'Experts' had the smallest score increase (0.10 ± 0.14; p < 0.01). The majority (95%) of respondents reported that POCUS would be \"Moderately to Very Beneficial\" for emergency management of athletes in remote settings with prolonged transport times, and 80% either \"Somewhat Agreed\" or \"Strongly Agreed\" that POCUS would be a beneficial tool in the care of USSS athletes following the training. Conclusion: These results suggest our novel training was effective at teaching physicians basic ultrasound utilization, the EFAST procedure, normal and pathologic ultrasound anatomy, and proper clinical decision-making based on findings. Participants believe POCUS would be a valuable tool for use in the emergency care and management of USSS athletes.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores the impact of secondary traumatic stress (STS) on first-year teachers (FYTs) and the potential of trauma-informed practices (TIP) as a mitigating strategy. STS, which results from exposure to students' trauma, is a significant but underexplored issue in education. By examining the first year of teaching, this mixed-methods study investigates whether TIP reduces STS symptoms and improves knowledge retention in FYTs. Quantitative findings suggest that TIP can enhance TIP content knowledge and confidence and reduce STS, offering valuable insights for teacher well-being and retention, particularly in high-needs schools. This study contributes to the emerging literature on STS in education and highlights the importance of targeted support for first-year teachers.",

    "Abstract": "The development of information and communication technologies has created limitless prospects for using augmented reality (AR) in various fields. Unfortunately, the multitasking nature of AR systems prevents learners from successfully reflecting and retaining knowledge. This study developed and designed a learning analytics dashboard (LAD) with three components: personal learning data, social comparison, and visualization of the learning process, to promote knowledge acquisition and metacognitive awareness among AR learners. A total of 31 intermediate-level Japanese learners participated in an experiment involving pre-tests, post-tests, and a delayed test to assess the LAD. Learners engaged with the AR learning system for Japanese compound verb learning and utilized the LAD to monitor and reflect on their AR learning activities. Behavioral data were analyzed using Lag Sequential Analysis (LSA), while learning performance was evaluated through one-way repeated-measures ANOVA tests. The findings indicate that the use of the LAD significantly improves learning outcomes and metacognitive processes, such as knowledge of cognition and regulation of cognition. Additionally, there were different usage patterns of the dashboard among learners, which corresponded to significant differences in their learning outcomes and changes in metacognitive awareness. Learners who primarily focused on the learning process and social comparison components of the dashboard demonstrated improved knowledge retention. Conversely, those who mainly concentrated on personal learning data experienced the most significant gains in metacognitive awareness. This study also provides crucial design insights on the integration of dashboard components with cognitive efforts to maximize learning outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Many national medical governing bodies encourage physicians to engage in continuing professional development (CPD) activities to cultivate their knowledge and skills to ensure their clinical practice reflects the current standards and evidence base. However, physicians often encounter various barriers that hinder their participation in CPD programs, such as time constraints, a lack of centralized coordination, and limited opportunities for self-assessment. The literature has highlighted the strength of using question-based learning interventions to augment physician learning and further enable change in practice. CPD By the Minute (CPD-Min) is a smartphone-enabled web-based app that was developed to address self-assessment gaps and barriers to engagement in CPD activities. Objective: This study aimed to assess the app using four objectives: (1) engagement and use of the app throughout the study, (2) effectiveness of this tool as a CPD activity, (3) relevance of the disseminated information to physicians’ practice, and (4) acceptability to physicians of this novel tool as an educational initiative. Methods: The CPD-Min app disseminated 2 multiple-choice questions (1-min each) each week with feedback and references. Participants included licensed staff physicians, fellows, and residents across Canada. A concurrent multimethods study was conducted, consisting of preintervention and postintervention surveys, semistructured interviews, and app analytics. Guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework, the qualitative data were analyzed deductively and inductively. Results: Of the 105 Canadian anesthesiologists participating in the study, 89 (84.8%) were staff physicians, 12 (11.4%) were fellows, and 4 (3.8%) were residents. Participants completed 110 questions each over the course of 52 weeks, with an average completion rate of 75% (SD 33%). In total, 40.9% (43/105) of participants answered >90% of the questions, including 15.2% (16/105) who completed all questions. Moreover, 69% (52/75) of participants reported the app to be an effective and valuable resource for their practice and to enhance continuous learning. Most participants (63/75, 84%) who completed the postsurveys reported that they would likely continue using the app as a CPD tool. These findings were further supported by the interview data. Three key themes were identified: the practical design of the novel educational app facilitates its adoption by clinicians, the app was perceived as a useful knowledge tool for continuous learning, and the app’s low-stakes testing environment cultivated independent learning attitudes. Conclusions: The findings suggest the potential of the app to improve longitudinal assessments that promote lifelong learning among clinicians. The positive feedback and increased acceptance of the app supports it as an innovative tool for knowledge retention and CPD.

    "Abstract": "This study explores the impact of digital tools on fraction comprehension among 6th-grade students with learning difficulties in mathematics. The research evaluates the effectiveness of educational software, video tutorials, and their combination, using a pre-, post-, and follow-up test experimental design. Conducted with 258 6 th grade students from 10 public elementary schools located in central and northern Greece, the study divided participants into three groups: one using interactive educational software, one using teacher-created video tutorials, and one combining both tools in an integrated learning program. The intervention lasted six weeks, with three sessions per week, and included a follow-up assessment three months after the program to examine knowledge retention. In addition to overall performance, the study also examined gender differences in learning outcomes and attitudes toward mathematics. The results show that, while all groups benefited from the integration of digital tools, female students demonstrated slightly higher gains in both fraction comprehension and self-efficacy compared to male students. These findings highlight not only the effectiveness of blended digital interventions for students with learning difficulties but also the importance of considering gender-related factors in educational research and classroom practice.",

    "Abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a transformative technology in education, enabling immersive simulations that foster student engagement and improve knowledge retention. This study presents a bibliometric analysis of global trends, research patterns, and challenges related to the integration of VR in educational contexts. Data were collected from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), and Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) within the Web of Science Core Collection, including only articles also indexed in Scopus to ensure high-quality and comprehensive coverage. Of the 1220 articles published between 2010 and 2024, 97 met the inclusion criteria based on relevance, accessibility, and methodological rigor. We performed keyword analysis, citation analysis, and thematic mapping using RStudio and the Bibliometrix package. The findings indicate that the United States, China, and the United Kingdom are the most active contributors to VR research in education. VR has been applied across diverse learning modalities, enriching both formal and informal educational environments. However, its widespread adoption faces several barriers, including high implementation costs, health and safety concerns, limited curricular integration, and insufficient educator training. Proposed solutions include strategic partnerships with technology providers and the use of cloud-based infrastructures to reduce costs and complexity. This study offers actionable insights for educators, policymakers, and developers, providing a robust, data-driven foundation for the effective and equitable integration of VR in education.",

    "Abstract": "To improve the effectiveness of English-Chinese bilingual learning, this study introduces an optimization model that combines semantic analysis with neural machine translation (NMT). A series of comprehensive experiments were conducted to evaluate its performance. The results demonstrated that the proposed model outperformed existing approaches across multiple key metrics, including reading comprehension, translation accuracy, and learning efficiency. Specifically, the optimized model achieved a reading comprehension score of 85.0, a grammar accuracy rate of 82.5%, and a vocabulary score of 80.1. For translation performance, it attained a sentence-level accuracy of 84.3%, paragraph coherence of 81.5%, and a cultural understanding score of 78.9. In terms of learning efficiency, the model reduced average learning time to 45.3 min, reached a knowledge retention rate of 80.2%, and improved autonomous learning ability to 78.5%. Learner satisfaction also improved, with an interest level score of 4.3, a teaching method satisfaction score of 4.0, and an overall satisfaction score of 4.2 (on a 5-point scale). Compared with rule-based translation systems and models using word embeddings or basic neural networks, the proposed model demonstrated clear advantages in all areas of evaluation. Overall, this study offers a valuable contribution to the advancement of computer-assisted language learning technologies.",

    "Abstract": "This paper aims to explore the challenges of maintaining and modernizing legacy systems, particularly COBOL-based platforms, the backbone of many financial and administrative systems. By exploring the DOGE team’s initiative to modernize government IT systems on a relevant case study, the author analyzes the pros and cons of AI and Agile methodologies in addressing the limitations of static and highly resilient legacy architectures. A systematic literature review was conducted to assess the state of the art about legacy system modernization, AI integration, and Agile methodologies. Then, the gray literature was analyzed to provide practical insights into how government agencies can modernize their IT infrastructures while addressing the growing shortage of COBOL experts. Findings suggest that AI may support interoperability, automation, and knowledge abstraction, but also introduce new risks related to cybersecurity, workforce disruption, and knowledge retention. Furthermore, the transition from Waterfall to Agile approaches poses significant epistemological and operational challenges. The results highlight the importance of adopting a hybrid human–AI model and structured governance strategies to ensure sustainable and secure system evolution. This study offers valuable insights for organizations that are facing the challenge of balancing the desire for modernization with the need to ensure their systems remain functional and manage tacit knowledge transfer.",

    "Abstract": "The rise of virtual learning has been significant in recent years, with the percentage of degree programs offered exclusively online increasing from 15.4% in 2019 to 60% in 2022. While online courses provide flexibility and convenience, concerns have emerged regarding student engagement, learning outcomes, and satisfaction. Due to limited interactions with peers and instructors, virtual students often struggle with motivation and experience higher levels of anxiety, stress, and isolation compared to their in-person counterparts. A key factor influencing student success in online courses is social presence, defined as the extent to which learners feel connected and engaged with their instructor and classmates. Research indicates higher levels of social presence contribute to increased student satisfaction, improved knowledge retention, and stronger sense of community. Conversely, a lack of social presence can lead to disengagement, dissatisfaction, and higher dropout rates. Non-traditional graduate students, defined as students pursuing advanced degrees while balancing work and family responsibilities, represent a significant portion of online learners. They choose virtual education for its flexibility, yet often struggle with engagement and social connection. These challenges can negatively impact their learning experiences, program completion rates, and overall success. Professional degree programs, designed to prepare individuals for industry-specific careers, further complicate this dynamic. Unlike academic degrees focused on research, professional degree programs require high levels of engagement and application-based learning, making social presence particularly important. Despite the growing number of non-traditional students in online professional degree programs, research on their specific social and emotional needs remains limited. This Dissertation in Practice will explore how this demographic perceives and experiences social presence in online professional degree programs through semi-structured interviews designed to capture their subjective experiences and interactions within virtual learning environments. Ultimately, this study aims to provide deeper insight into non-traditional graduate student perceptions of social presence—including potential barriers—to help foster more transformative, equitable, and inclusive online learning experiences.",

    "Abstract": "The problem addressed in the study was that many organizations struggled with workforce generational differences as four generations coexisted in the labor force and Baby Boomers were leaving the workforce at an estimated four million a year leaving an ill-prepared workforce to handle the loss of institutional knowledge thus necessitating the need for multigenerational workforce management strategies. As a result, managers, supervisors, and organizations face challenges in continuing business as usual and merging diverse generational perspectives. The purpose of this qualitative single case study was to examine workforce generational differences, challenges posed by Baby Boomers leaving the workforce, and effective multigenerational workforce management strategies to address institutional knowledge loss. The study followed the Generational Cohort Theory, which helped explain how generational experiences play a role in shaping what happens in the workplace. This qualitative single-case study employed semi-structured interviews and demographic questionnaires with 20 participants aged 18 to 69 years from a traffic management company in northeast Oklahoma. Participants represented Baby Boomers, Generation X, Generation Y, and Generation Z cohorts. The analysis of data followed thematic coding guided by NVivo and Braun and Clarke’s step-by-step approach. Trustworthiness was established through triangulation, member checking, peer debriefing, and reflexive journaling. The results indicated that individuals from different generations communicated differently, used technology differently, and had differing work values and learning approaches. Baby Boomers preferred face-to-face communication, whereas digital communication was preferred by the younger generations. Key challenges included knowledge transfer barriers, differences in communication, and motivational factors. Successful management practices involved open communication structures, strength-based management approaches, mixed-generation teams, adaptive training methods, and formal mentoring programs. The study concludes that organizations must develop comprehensive, intentional management approaches, viewing generational diversity as a strategic advantage rather than a challenge. Among the recommendations included setting up knowledge-sharing programs, nurturing intelligence across ages among top managers, and encouraging environments that allow different age groups to contribute their ideas, leading to improved performance and creativity in organizations.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To assess the impact of a course incorporating role-playing on undergraduate dental students' satisfaction, knowledge, and attitudes toward tobacco cessation counseling. Methods: A pilot study was conducted at a French dental school between September 2022 and March 2023. Overall, 28 fourth- and fifth-year dental students participated in a three-step course on tobacco cessation counseling which included a theoretical component and role-playing sessions. Kirkpatrick’s four-level model was used to assess educational outcomes immediately after the theoretical course (levels 1 and 2) and 6 months later (levels 3 and 4). Results: The level 1 evaluation showed that most students were satisfied with the course (mean score: 4.7/5) and would use their knowledge in their future practice. For level 2, knowledge was significantly increased (+ 36.7%) following the course and was maintained at 6 months ( p =0.015). Levels 3 and 4 assessed clinical behaviour and practice regarding tobacco cessation counselling and showed a significant increase in counseling (+28.7%) and in the prescription of tobacco substitutes (+ 48.6%) at 6 months ( p =0.042 and 0.041, respectively). Conclusions: The study demonstrated the effectiveness of a role-playing-based course in terms of satisfaction, knowledge, and clinical behavior toward tobacco cessation counselling with sustained knowledge retention over time.",

This study applies the Precede-Proceed Model of Learning framework to examine how predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing educational strategies support sustained knowledge retention among healthcare professionals. The analysis focused on three accredited continuing professional development (CPD) programs conducted between 2022 and 2024. Participants engaged in educational activities that included baseline pre-test and post-activity post-test assessments, with exposure categorized based on prior interaction with related content. Learners were stratified into groups by timing and frequency of exposure to the material. The primary outcome measured was improvement in test performance across sequential learning engagements. Results indicated that learners who accessed educational content prior to the activity demonstrated a significantly higher mean pre-test score of 31% ( n = 443) compared to 27% ( n = 1,416) among those who viewed it afterward ( p = 0.041). Furthermore, repeat learners, regardless of content timing, achieved greater knowledge gains, improving by 34% ( p < 0.001), in contrast to a 26% improvement among first-time learners ( p < 0.001). These findings highlight the additive value of progressive and repeated exposure in CPD programs. By analysing longitudinal engagement patterns, this study reinforces the importance of strategically structured educational design to foster enduring clinical competence.Cognitive research consistently demonstrates that spaced repetition enhances memory consolidation and retrieval by reinforcing learned material over time.

Mobile learning (m-learning) offers a flexible and accessible alternative for continuing professional education, overcoming barriers such as time constraints and financial burden. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of m-learning in nurses’ knowledge retention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease self-management, using a Massive Open Online Course with integrated virtual clinical simulation. Methods: A quasi-experimental pre- and posttest study was conducted, with no control group, among 168 nurses from a Portuguese hospital. The intervention included an asynchronous online course with 13 modules. Knowledge retention was assessed by comparing the mean scores before and after the course. Results: The results indicated a significant increase in knowledge retention. The participants’ average score increased from 59.97% in the initial assessment to 84.05% in the final assessment ( P <.001). Nurses with a master’s degree exhibited a higher level of basic knowledge than those with a bachelor’s degree. The course completion rate was 93.45%, reflecting significant engagement attributed to gamification and clinically relevant content. Conclusions: This study confirms the effectiveness of m-learning in improving knowledge retention in nursing. This strategy is a valuable approach to lifelong learning, promoting quality and safety in delivering health care. m-learning is useful in nurses’ lifelong learning, offering flexibility and more effective support for clinical practice. Integrating virtual simulation and gamification boosted motivation and reduced drop-out rates, highlighting the potential of m-learning in lifelong learning in health care.",

    "Abstract": "The Flipped Classroom (FC) approach is increasingly recognized for enhancing student engagement and knowledge retention. This study evaluates its impact on undergraduate nursing students at the Higher Institute of Nursing Professions and Health Techniques in Fez, Morocco. A quasi-experimental design was used, comparing two groups: one following the FC model and the other a traditional lecture-based approach. A total of 120 students were randomly assigned to either the FC ( n =60) or the Traditional Classroom (TC) ( n =60) group. Knowledge retention was assessed through module. The FC group demonstrated significantly higher academic performance, with a mean score of 17.39 ± 1.11 compared to 14.11 ± 3.03 in the TC group ( U = 3098.0, p < 0.0001). Moreover, all FC students validated the module, compared to 90% in the TC group ( χ2 = 4.39, p = 0.036). These findings suggest that the FC model fosters deeper engagement and better knowledge retention, making it a promising pedagogical alternative, particularly in nursing education where critical thinking is essential. However, further research is needed to assess its long-term effects across diverse educational settings.",

    "Abstract": "Enterprise System Projects (ESPs) are fundamental enablers of digital transformation across organizations, yet they consistently suffer from high failure rates, often attributed to ineffective Knowledge Transfer (KT) practices. Despite the critical role of KT in ensuring project sustainability and long-term organizational learning, limited scholarly attention has been given to identifying and systematically categorizing the success factors that influence KT outcomes in ESPs. The aim of this study is to investigate and conceptualize the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) that influence effective knowledge transfer in ESPs. To address this research gap, a mixed-methods approach is used, combining a literature review with empirical insights from semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners involved in large-scale ESP implementations. The analysis reveals a set of interrelated CSFs that significantly impact KT effectiveness. Some of the key points highlighted are the shared knowledge between cultures, the high expertise of consultants based on technicality and social skills, and the solid and visible management support. These points are integrated into a conceptual framework that enhances conceptual understanding while offering practitioners practical guidance. The study contributes by bridging the gap between the KT concept and ESP implementation, which are connected to the academic discourse, proposing a comprehensive model for successful knowledge transfer during the deployment of ESP. From a practical standpoint, the findings offer organizations a strategic lens to design and implement KT mechanisms that enhance project outcomes and ensure long-term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "In educational settings, the role of neuroplasticity in shaping cognitive development has gained increasing attention.

Introduction In educational settings, the role of neuroplasticity in shaping cognitive development has gained increasing attention. Traditional pedagogical models often fail to capture the dynamic neural adaptations that underlie effective learning. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates neuroplastic principles into action recognition for educational applications. Existing models primarily rely on behavioral metrics, neglecting the underlying neural mechanisms that drive skill acquisition.Our method introduces a Neuroplastic Learning Dynamics Model (NLDM), a computational framework designed to simulate the synaptic modifications, cortical reorganization, and learning-induced connectivity changes that occur during educational engagement. By leveraging a mathematical formulation of neuroplastic adaptation, NLDM enables a dynamic representation of cognitive transformation. Furthermore, we introduce Neuroplasticity-Driven Learning Optimization (NDLO), a strategic framework that adapts pedagogical interventions based on real-time neural responses. NDLO integrates multimodal data sources, including neurophysiological signals and behavioral feedback, to refine personalized learning pathways. By dynamically adjusting educational interventions, our framework fosters deeper engagement, accelerates skill acquisition, and enhances cognitive flexibility.

Introduction Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals face significant health disparities, often due to healthcare providers' (HCPs) insufficient training and awareness. Comprehensive educational interventions are essential to improve both cultural competence and medical knowledge. While previous evaluations of training programs have shown short-term benefits, evidence on long-term outcomes remains scarce. This study extends the findings of an earlier evaluation of a distance learning course on TGD healthcare, exploring the sustainability of its effects over time.To assess changes in self-reported attitudes, skills, practices, and knowledge retention 6 months after course completion. Objectives To assess changes in self-reported attitudes, skills, practices, and knowledge retention 6 months after course completion.A longitudinal design was used with assessments at baseline (T0), post-course (T1), and six-month follow-up (T2). Participants completed the Attitudes, Skills, and Practices Questionnaire (ASPQ) and a 10-item knowledge test at all time points. Paired t -tests were used to compare mean scores for attitudes and skills. Knowledge retention was analyzed with McNemar tests. Changes in practice items were evaluated using Cochran's Q and Friedman tests for paired categorical data. Methods A longitudinal design was used with assessments at baseline (T0), post-course (T1), and six-month follow-up (T2). Participants completed the Attitudes, Skills, and Practices Questionnaire (ASPQ) and a 10-item knowledge test at all time points. Paired t-tests were used to compare mean scores for attitudes and skills. Knowledge retention was analyzed with McNemar tests. Changes in practice items were evaluated using Cochran's Q and Friedman tests for paired categorical data.A total of 3,102 participants (17% of the original cohort) completed the follow-up. All self-reported skills and most attitudes improved significantly from baseline to follow-up ( p  < 0.001 for skills; p  ≤ 0.02 for attitudes), with modest declines from T1. Practice items showed significant variation over time (Cochran's Q and Friedman tests, p  < 0.001), though without a consistent increase in engagement. Knowledge improved in 8 of 10 items from baseline to follow-up (McNemar, p  < 0.001), particularly in sexual identity, hormone therapy, and legal rights, despite partial declines from post-course levels. Results A total of 3,102 participants (17% of the original cohort) completed the follow-up. All self-reported skills and most attitudes improved significantly from baseline to follow-up (p < 0.001 for skills; p ≤ 0.02 for attitudes), with modest declines from T1.

This study addresses these challenges by leveraging deep learning and knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML) approaches. Initially, ResNet architectures were employed as baseline models for nematode classification, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 81 %, with a maximum balanced accuracy of 85%. To overcome the limitations of baseline models in fine-grained classification tasks, a novel KGML framework was developed, integrating domain-specific knowledge through Grad-CAM-based attention mechanisms. This framework ensures that the model focuses on biologically significant regions, such as the head and tail of nematodes, using a knowledge loss function. Experimental results demonstrated an average accuracy improvement of 7%, with a maximum balanced accuracy of 94%, in the KGML models, along with enhanced interpretability, as validated through visual analysis of attention maps. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge-guided AI to improve classification tasks in domains with limited datasets, bridging the gap between computational tools and biological research. Future work aims to expand this approach to other species and datasets, advancing biodiversity studies through AI.",

In this study, the author looks at the creation of an adaptive education content delivery framework with the usage of RL. In contrast to the conventional approach of using systems that provide learners with static and structured training courses, the present work adapts a RL, which allows for real time content changes based on learner's progress, choice and performance. The system applies deep reinforcement learning in order to make the interaction process and the learning path interesting and effective for each user. Some of them are ability to use predictive analysis to suggest areas where students need help, built-in feedback system and modularity to combine different forms of educational material. From the experimental outcomes it can be confirmed that the knowledge retention and skill acquisition rates of the proposed system have enhanced manifold than conventional training methods. In addition to that, the authors highlight that the framework is designed for scalability of learning; now, it can be applied to all different types of settings for learning including the formal schooling, workplace learning and training, as well as lifelong learning settings. Thus, being devoted to promote the synthesis of the principles of education with the most advanced AI techniques, this research sets its goal to fill the gap between individual learning and mass learning. Rather, the studies suggest that RL-based personalized learning models may revolutionize learning processes and engage learners and educators.",

In this work, an online update method is proposed, which is based on the existing Retrieval Enhanced Generation (RAG) model with multiple innovation mechanisms. Firstly, the dynamic memory is used to capture the emerging data samples, and then gradually integrate them into the core model through a tunable knowledge distillation strategy. At the same time, hierarchical indexing and multi-layer gating mechanism are introduced into the retrieval module to ensure that the retrieved content is more targeted and accurate. Finally, a multi-stage network structure is established for different types of inputs in the generation stage, and cross-attention matching and screening are carried out on the intermediate representations of each stage to ensure the effective integration and iterative update of new and old knowledge. Experimental results show that the proposed method is better than the existing mainstream comparison models in terms of knowledge retention and inference accuracy.",

    "Abstract": "ECG interpretation is an ordinary skill among RNs. However, the level of ECG interpretation skill frequently falls short of expectations on competency testing. Despite this phenomenon being well documented and multiple educational paradigms being applied; knowledge retention and interpretation skills degrade rapidly following training. A qualitative approach was undertaken to understand better the barriers to ECG knowledge retention among practicing RNs. An anonymous survey was created and distributed to RNs caring for patients in medical-surgical, intensive care, perianesthesia, and emergency departments. A sample size of 30 participants was acquired. All participants stated that their ECG understanding was adequate for their clinical environment. Despite stating that their ECG knowledge was adequate, 22 participants stated that there were rhythms that were challenging for them. The most identified barrier to ECG knowledge retention was a lack of exposure to specific ECG rhythms. Participants identified multiple training modalities to improve ECG knowledge retention, but the most common recommendation was to increase the frequency of training and testing to prevent degradation. This research identifies a disconnect between perceived ECG knowledge needs among practicing RNs and expected ECG knowledge commonly seen on competency testing. Less widely seen rhythms were identified as problematic among most participants. Further exploration of the necessary ECG knowledge and required training frequency is needed.",

    "Abstract": "Tacit knowledge loss poses a significant challenge in the South African explosives manufacturing sector, where specialized expertise is critical for operational efficiency and safety. This study examines the role of Knowledge Management (KM) practices in mitigating tacit knowledge loss, employing a quantitative cross-sectional design with data from 350 respondents. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess the reliability and validity of critical success factors (CSFs) and KM enablers. Findings indicate that human-oriented factors—such as leadership, organizational culture, and mentoring—are essential for effective knowledge transfer, while technology-driven solutions, such as documentation and databases, support knowledge retention. This research provides empirical insights into KM strategies tailored for high-risk industries, contributing to both theory and practice. The study highlights the need for integrated KM approaches to sustain competitive advantage and proposes recommendations for future research on longitudinal KM effectiveness.",

    "Abstract": "The oil and gas industry relies on knowledge management (KM) and asset integrity strategies to ensure safety, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance. However, traditional KM systems face challenges such as fragmented data, workforce turnover, and inconsistent maintenance practices, leading to increased operational risks. Digital twins-real-time virtual replicas of physical assets-offer a transformative approach by integrating sensor data, artificial intelligence (AI), and predictive analytics to enhance real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and risk-based inspections. This paper examined the role of digital twins in improving knowledge retention, decision-making, and asset lifecycle management in oil and gas operations. Despite their potential, adoption barriers include data integration issues, cybersecurity risks, and a lack of standardization. Future opportunities lie in AI-driven automation for self-monitoring systems, blockchain-secured knowledge sharing, and extended reality (XR)-based workforce training simulations. By leveraging emerging technologies and digital transformation, oil and gas companies can enhance asset integrity, reduce downtime, and improve long-term sustainability. Future research should focus on developing scalable digital twin frameworks, refining AI-driven risk assessment models, and ensuring regulatory compliance to fully harness their potential.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 IST-Africa Conference (IST-Africa) Conference Start Date: 2025 May 28 Conference End Date: 2025 May 30 Conference Location: Nairobi, Kenya This research aims to alleviate the constraints of limited resources and traditional pharmaceutical training techniques by creating DigiDoseAR, an Augmented Reality (AR) mobile application for learning the tablet production process. The pharmaceutical profession, specifically the solid dosage form production, requires strict adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), quality management system, and continuous on-the-job training to ensure quality finished products. The competence in the tablet product process is acquired by students during practical classes in pharmaceutics. Challenges regarding limited practical class hours and infrastructure or equipment for students learning pharmacy in a South African Higher Institution were the initial research motivation for this work. This research highlights advancements in pharmacy education, including AR and the possibility of AI-driven personalized learning. The DigiDoseAR application focuses on the wet granulation method of tableting, which is a vital procedure in the pharmaceutical tablet manufacturing process. Using Unity, 3Ds Max, and Visual Studio software, DigiDoseAR offers a simulated environment in which students can practice the procedure in wet granulation, improving knowledge retention and skill development. The project was developed using the agile scrum and participatory design approach and included 3D models, animation, and interactive elements to create a realistic learning experience. The application was created to be user-friendly and accessible across multiple devices. Future research is needed to assess the efficacy of the application in increasing student learning outcomes when compared to traditional techniques. Overall, based on various system-level testing conducted and feedback from an expert instructor from the Pharmacy domain, DigiDoseAR has the potential to transform pharmacy education by providing a more engaging and participatory method of learning complex pharmaceutical processes and promoting experiential learning.",

    "Abstract": "Non-conformities—deviations from established standards or procedures—can significantly impact product quality and process performance. Although various tools and methodologies exist, current research lacks an integrated, deferred, and corrective approach to non-conformance management that bridges day-to-day operations with systematic quality control. The proposed tool aims to address this gap by providing a practical framework that combines batch data processing using the “Daily Challenge” tool with structured problem solving and corrective strategies. It serves as a comprehensive decision-making tool for systematically managing deviations. The methodology begins with identifying non-conformities through data collection and direct observation, followed by focused reporting and active discussion during departmental meetings. Issues are then categorized based on their frequency, operational impact, and resource requirements to determine the appropriate resolution path—whether through immediate correction or detailed analysis using structured tools such as the “Daily Challenge” sheet. It integrates well-established methodologies such as 5M and PDCA into a structured, daily workflow for resolving non-conformities. Implemented solutions are evaluated for effectiveness with ongoing monitoring to ensure continuous improvement. A key feature of this system is the use of the “Daily Challenge” form, which facilitates documentation, accountability, and knowledge retention—helping to reduce the recurrence of similar situations. The case studies illustrate the methodology through two examples: a labeling issue involving the omission of quantity information on product labels due to operator oversight and the management of production downtime caused by equipment and sensor failures. Although a standard existed, the errors revealed the need for reinforced procedures. Corrective actions included revising procedures, retraining personnel, repairing and recalibrating equipment, enhancing maintenance protocols, and using visual documentation to enhance process understanding. The “Daily Challenge” tool provides a replicable framework for managing non-conformities across various industries, aligning operational practices with quality assurance goals. By integrating structured analysis, clear documentation, and corrective strategies, it fosters a culture of continuous improvement and compliance.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for personalized learning path generation by integrating deep knowledge tracing and cognitive load estimation within a unified framework. We propose a dual-stream neural network architecture that simultaneously models students’ knowledge states and cognitive load levels to optimize learning trajectories. The knowledge state tracking module employs a bidirectional Transformer with graph attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between knowledge components, while the cognitive load estimation module utilizes multimodal data analysis to dynamically assess mental effort during learning activities. A dual-objective optimization algorithm balances knowledge acquisition with cognitive load management to generate paths that maintain optimal challenge levels. Experimental evaluations across multiple educational domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy (87.5%), path quality (4.4/5), and learning efficiency (24.6% improvement). The implemented system supports real-time adaptation based on performance and cognitive state, resulting in reduced frustration, higher engagement, and improved knowledge retention. This research contributes to both theoretical understanding of learning processes and practical implementation of next-generation adaptive educational technologies.",

We introduce REMIND, a lightweight, modular framework integrating Short-Term Memory (STM) for session-specific recall and Long-Term Memory (LTM) for persistent knowledge retention. REMIND employs a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines vector search, hierarchical grouping, iterative query refinement, and keyword filtering to enhance recall precision without modifying LLM architectures. To benchmark REMIND, we introduce MemoRA, an open dataset for evaluating dynamic memory retrieval in multi-turn dialogues. Our evaluation combines static metrics with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and GPT-40-mini as a relevance judge, showing that REMIND outperforms MemGPT in recall scenarios. Results indicate that LLaMA3.3:70B demonstrates weaker grouping capabilities, while DeepSeek-V3 is a cost-effective reasoning engine. By open-sourcing the MemorA dataset [1] and REMIND's implementation [2], we provide resources to advance research in memory-augmented dialogue systems, enabling personalized, scalable applications in healthcare, tutoring, and customer support. While current evaluations focus on the MemoRA and DMR datasets, future work will extend assessments to broader benchmarks.",

    "Abstract": "Condensed courses are commonly used across academia as a means for students to catch up or get ahead of their curriculum. Instructors may be hesitant to teach such courses due to concerns about limited knowledge retention and reduced academic rigor. We sought to determine if there are any differences in changes of student attitudes before and after 3.5-week and 7-week condensed flipped Organic Chemistry I courses using the Attitude toward the Subject of Chemistry Inventory Version 2 (ASCIv2). Student performance, as measured by exam and overall course grades, was compared for both course lengths. The results indicate that student attitudes started and remained more negative in a 3.5-week course than the 7-week course, even though exam and course grade averages are not significantly different between the formats. This information can help instill confidence in administrators and faculty of various disciplines that condensed courses do not present major barriers to student's academic success, or require that given courses adjust the amount of content or academic rigor.",

    "Abstract": "The study examines the effectiveness of microlearning in developing the capacity to address climate change and adapt to environmental challenges. Conducted as an online field experiment with 140 participants, the study focused on the impacts of smartphone use as an illustrative learning domain for education in climate change-related areas. Using a pre-post research design and simultaneous equation models, the study found improvements in knowledge retention, with a median increase of 38%. The results indicated that the brief microlearning units also promoted sustainability action competencies, such as confidence in one's influence and willingness to act sustainably. This suggests that higher-order learning processes were also triggered, although to a much lesser extent. Furthermore, learner satisfaction was identified as a mediating variable for these positive outcomes. The study concludes that short bursts of knowledge delivered through microlearning activities can be used alongside traditional training methods to build the critical skills needed for initiatives such as the EU Green Deal.",

    "Abstract": "This article proposes a novel conceptual framework that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) to enhance Open Distance eLearning (ODeL) systems. By bridging the gap between traditional cognitive theories and cutting-edge AI technologies, this framework supports adaptive cognitive load management, AI-mediated schema creation, and human-AI collaborative learning. A refined critique of Twabu's (2023) PhD study, based on conceptual analysis of its theoretical scope and limitations, highlights the absence of AI integration. This article presents a unique contribution by synthesizing established cognitive theories with the dynamic potential of AI, a perspective underrepresented in current literature. Practical examples, policy recommendations, and ethical considerations are consolidated to offer a comprehensive path forward. The study proposes an expanded framework incorporating \"AI-enhanced cognitive load management,\" \"AI-mediated schema creation,\" and \"human-AI collaborative learning.\" The Literature review and theoretical framework emphasises AI's role in simplifying cognitive processes by dynamically adjusting content presentation based on learner needs and performance. This includes AI-mediated adjustments to manage cognitive load and enhance schema development through personalised feedback and tailored content delivery. Such integration promises to create a more effective learning environment by aligning multimedia content with individual learner profiles, thus addressing the challenge of cognitive overload and improving knowledge retention and understanding.",

    "Abstract": "Background Education has continuously evolved to keep pace with advancements in information technology. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an innovative and effective learning approach that enhances student engagement, particularly in developing problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Since its introduction in the early 1980s, VR has gained increasing attention in nursing education due to its potential to improve learning outcomes and skill acquisition. However, there is a need for further research to explore its impact on critical thinking disposition among nursing students. Methods This quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study was conducted with a convenience sample of 190 nursing students from Damietta University’s Faculty of Nursing. Participants were assessed on their critical thinking disposition and VR-related knowledge at three time points: before the intervention, immediately after, and two months post-intervention. Aim: The VR-based educational program aimed to improve students’ critical thinking disposition and assess their knowledge of virtual reality before, during, and after the program. Results A statistically significant improvement in students’ mean scores for critical thinking disposition was observed across all evaluations ( p  < 0.001). The effect size (η² p  ≥ 0.14) indicated a substantial impact, reinforcing the effectiveness of the VR-based educational program in fostering higher-order cognitive skills. Additionally, students demonstrated increased retention of VR-related knowledge when assessed immediately after the program and again after two months. Conclusions This study highlights the transformative potential of VR as an educational tool in nursing. VR-based learning promotes active engagement, knowledge retention, and skill development in a safe and controlled environment. By integrating VR programs into nursing education, institutions can enhance students’ critical thinking, collaboration, and communication skills, ultimately preparing them for real-world clinical practice.

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 IEEE 38th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS) Conference Start Date: 2025 June 18 Conference End Date: 2025 June 20 Conference Location: Madrid, Spain Accessing reliable clinical knowledge quickly is an everyday challenge for clinicians. Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist healthcare professionals by providing this knowledge, but their responses often deviate from expert consensus or are not up to date necessitating reliable validation and possible correction. To address this, we introduce MedBlock-Bot, an interactive Streamlit-based system integrating a blockchain-enabled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for expert-driven assessment and immutable feedback storage within a permissioned consortium network. Unlike traditional feedback mechanisms that may be altered or lost, MedBlock-Bot employs smart contracts to securely store and verify any feedback, ensuring transparency and auditability. We evaluated the system using three opensource LLMs-BioMistral, HippoMistral, and LLaMa 3.1-on clinical guideline interpretation for neonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Human experts assessed model responses based on accuracy and relevance, revealing variations in adherence to the guideline knowledge. Additionally, deploying the blockchain component in a local permissioned environment (Ganache) ensured efficient transaction processing and tamperproof feedback retrieval without gas cost concerns. Our results demonstrate the integration of blockchain for LLM feedback review enhancing trust, accountability, and structured knowledge retention. Clinicians can access past expert assessments for validation, while developers can leverage this feedback for potential model refinement. Taking the long-term impact into account this approach targets towards a reliable and dynamic representation of clinical knowledge and consensus.

    "Abstract": "In this work, a novel approach that combines artificial neural networks (ANNs) and polynomial modeling to efficiently model the behavior of nonlinear RF devices is introduced. Utilizing the strengths of ANNs in knowledge retention and transfer, the proposed approach effectively incorporates new operational states such as different dc biases, frequencies, dies, and devices into existing models. This adaptive capability, in addition to the dynamic sampling techniques that only capture crucial dynamic characteristics across various operational states, significantly enhances the behavioral model’s extrapolation ability across various operational states and decreases the amount of measurement data needed. This approach is verified with a 0.25-[Formula Omitted]m real gallium nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) device measured at different dies, sizes, dc biases, and frequencies. The results show that by utilizing only 30% of the conventional measurement data, the established polynomial equation-based model achieved a normalized mean squared error (NMSE) below −30 dB. The proposed model technique also has the advantage of easily being implemented in computer-aided design (CAD) software and allows for the fast design of RF circuits in industry applications while ensuring high accuracy and adaptability.",

    "Abstract": "This study aims to enhance quality control in the production of varistor discs used in lightning arresters at Hitachi Energy by integrating K-Means clustering, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Digital Twin Models (DTMs). It addresses the challenge of achieving production stability through a systematic, data-driven approach, motivated by the limitations of traditional engineering-based adjustments. K-Means clustering segments production data to identify defect patterns and enable precise parameter adjustments. Knowledge Graphs formalize and standardize tacit engineering knowledge into actionable rules, supporting knowledge retention and transfer. Digital Twin Models simulate the production line for real-time optimization, reducing material waste and accelerating process improvement. Experimental results validate improvements in quality and stability, proposing robust tolerance ranges. This M.Sc thesis contributes to intelligent manufacturing by demonstrating a novel, integrated framework that bridges data analytics, semantic modeling, and dynamic simulation, offering scalable insights and practical solutions for industrial applications.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge management (KM) is essential for organizational success, yet public sector agencies face unique challenges in retaining and transferring institutional knowledge. Unlike the private sector, public organizations struggle with bureaucratic inertia, leadership transitions, and high employee turnover, which disrupt continuity and hinder knowledge retention. This study examines barriers to KM within the New Jersey Department of Education's Office of Special Education (OSE) and evaluates the effectiveness of competency profiles in promoting knowledge-sharing behaviors to preserve institutional knowledge. Using a qualitative research approach, this study collected data through semi-structured interviews with OSE employees at various experience levels. Findings reveal that frequent leadership changes, employee turnover, and limited KM infrastructure create significant obstacles to knowledge retention. Participants identified both structural and cultural barriers, highlighting the need for leadership engagement, formalized knowledge-sharing mechanisms, and integration of KM strategies into hiring, training, and performance evaluations. This study contributes to the understanding of KM in the public sector by exploring strategies that enhance knowledge retention despite workforce transitions. Embedding KM practices into organizational culture through competency profiles and structured policies can mitigate knowledge loss and improve operational continuity. Recommendations include leveraging technology for knowledge transfer, fostering a culture of collaboration, and institutionalizing KM frameworks to ensure long-term sustainability.

    "Abstract": "There is limited evidence regarding the retention of essential basic science knowledge among dental students and professionals. Understanding the anatomy of the skull, osteology, is crucial as it provides the structural framework essential for comprehending head anatomy, where various soft tissue components are organized. This study aims to evaluate and compare the retention of osteological knowledge across different stages of dental education and professional practice. Specific anatomical structures on selected skull bones and the complete cranium, taught at the pre-clinical level and including clinically and radiographically significant landmarks, were marked for assessment. The study evaluated the ability of second year and fifth year undergraduate dental students, as well as postgraduate students at various stages of specialist training in different dental fields, to independently identify these marked anatomical structures. The study demonstrated significantly higher identification accuracy among second year students compared to fifth year and postgraduate students ( p  < 0.05). Second year students achieved over 90% accuracy for individual skull bones, with slightly lower accuracy for the entire cranium (85.9%). Fifth year students showed markedly lower retention, with accuracy below 50%, ranging from 20.8% (cranium) to 48.3% (mandible). Postgraduate students performed similarly to fifth year students, notably with only 11.8% accuracy for the sphenoid bone. Significant differences in accuracy were observed among postgraduate specialties ( p  < 0.05), with oral surgery and oral medicine specialists achieving the highest accuracy (81.2% for the mandible). However, no significant correlation between years of experience and accuracy was observed among the postgraduate groups ( p  = 0.45). Our results indicate that clinically and radiologically relevant anatomical knowledge is better retained over time, while overall osteological knowledge significantly declines. This highlights the need for strategies beyond initial learning to enhance long-term retention. Integrating clinical, radiological, and surface anatomy into continuing dental education could substantially improve knowledge retention. Furthermore, our findings suggest potential benefits from increased vertical integration and encourage broader discussion regarding the traditional separation between pre-clinical and clinical training phases.There is limited evidence regarding the retention of essential basic science knowledge among dental students and professionals.

Postgraduate students performed similarly to fifth year students, notably with only 11.8% accuracy for the sphenoid bone. Significant differences in accuracy were observed among postgraduate specialties (p < 0.05), with oral surgery and oral medicine specialists achieving the highest accuracy (81.2% for the mandible). However, no significant correlation between years of experience and accuracy was observed among the postgraduate groups (p = 0.45). Our results indicate that clinically and radiologically relevant anatomical knowledge is better retained over time, while overall osteological knowledge significantly declines. This highlights the need for strategies beyond initial learning to enhance long-term retention. Integrating clinical, radiological, and surface anatomy into continuing dental education could substantially improve knowledge retention. Furthermore, our findings suggest potential benefits from increased vertical integration and encourage broader discussion regarding the traditional separation between pre-clinical and clinical training phases.",

    "Abstract": "Effective science education relies on innovative and engaging teaching tools that enhance student learning and retention. This need is particularly important in agricultural science outreach, where understanding the role of microbiology in animal health and disease is essential for both livestock producers and the public. However, traditional teaching methods often fail to adequately convey complex concepts in an accessible, applicable, and memorable way. To address this gap, a memory-based card game was developed utilizing game-based learning (GBL) principles to improve comprehension of microbiology's impact on animal health and disease within agricultural systems. This interactive tool balances educational content with gameplay, fostering an engaging learning experience that encourages knowledge retention and real-world application. Through the use of the game, pre- and post-self-assessments indicated learners perceived they were improved in their understanding of microbes in agriculture and noted their greater likelihood to use this information in real-world situations (P < 0.001). By integrating this game into extension and outreach programs, we aim to enhance public understanding of agricultural systems and microbiology's role in animal health, ultimately improving informed decision-making and agricultural literacy. This approach not only advances microbiology education but also exemplifies the pedagogical benefits of incorporating GBL into agricultural science communication.",

    "Abstract": "Novice computer programming students face considerable learning challenges in an introductory programming course leading to disengagement and high dropout rates at universities and institutions of higher education. This action research study sought to investigate these learning challenges and find solutions to better support the students using innovative education technologies. Analysis of Cycle 1 data collected from students, teaching assistants and faculty led to the identification of three themes related to the learning challenges of novice programmers, need for additional support and appropriate instruction design. This provided evidence and reinforced the findings from the extensive literature review done for the study indicating that such challenges led to student anxiety, high levels of stress, and demotivation, resulting in many students dropping out from the programming courses. Action steps were designed, implemented, and evaluated in Cycle 2 to provide support to novice programming students through an online game-based pre-course; delivery of main course content using animations, and visualization tools to explain complex programming concepts; and using the problem-based learning approach (PBL) along with peer support and gamification techniques. Evaluating the results of the action research study included a thorough assessment of all the created resources and their delivery. Student participants and collaborators provided critical feedback that assisted in the evaluation process. The study concluded that the use of these interventions benefited students by building foundational knowledge, improving comprehension of abstract programming concepts, reducing anxiety, enhancing knowledge retention, and engagement in classrooms. Implications for the organization included providing an inclusive learning environment for everyone through accessibility to diverse and multiple learning tools addressing their individual needs and improving learning outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 13th International Conference on Information and Education Technology (ICIET) Conference Start Date: 2025 April 18 Conference End Date: 2025 April 20 Conference Location: Fukuyama, Japan This study evaluates the impact of ChatGPT on student learning and test performance through a structured 18-week experiment conducted in an introductory computer science course at Soochow University. A total of 117 students participated, divided into a control group (59 students, no ChatGPT assistance) and an experimental group (58 students, ChatGPT-assisted testing). The experiment included four exams, a midterm, and a final exam, along with pre- and post-study surveys to assess students' perceptions of ChatGPT. The results indicate a consistent improvement in test scores among students in the experimental group who used ChatGPT for test assistance. Compared to the control group, the average score difference was 19.1 points in the second exam, 26.901 points in the third exam, and 40.389 points in the fourth exam-an overall increase of approximately 47.7 % from the second to the fourth exam. These findings highlight the importance of precise input prompts in generating accurate responses. Additionally, as students became more proficient in using ChatGPT, their trust in the tool also increased, raising concerns about potential overreliance. While ChatGPT-assisted assessments provided short-term performance gains, long-term knowledge retention remained limited. Although the experimental group outperformed the control group in ChatGPT-assisted tests, the final exam results (where neither group had ChatGPT support) showed only a 2.99 % difference. This suggests that students who relied on ChatGPT during their studies struggled to retain concepts when AI assistance was removed. These findings underscore the need for a balanced approach to integrating ChatGPT into education. While ChatGPT has significant potential as an instructional aid, careful implementation is crucial to prevent over-dependence and to foster deeper, independent learning.",

    "Abstract": "The problem with post-merger integrations is the significant loss of corporate knowledge and skill ability because of high turnover rates, impacting the merger's success. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive case study explores organizational behaviors, elements, and process factors in a post-merger solar company, focusing on factors influencing the success of the merger and acquisition process. The following research questions were addressed: what organizational elements and procedures management can employ to mitigate the loss of corporate knowledge and skills in merger and acquisitions (M&A) integrations in the solar industry, and what organizational behaviors management can employ to foster success in M&A integration within the solar industry. The population of supervisors, team leaders, and quality assurance managers comprised the sample size of eight people from a solar company for this case study. The case study used Yin's five-step thematic analysis and the DeDoose program to complete the data analysis of the one-on-one interviews, archived documents, and a focus group session interview to find patterns and provide information about a recently merged solar company. The participants highlighted organizational sustainability, employee loyalty, and knowledge retention in successful mergers which highlighted the use of Organizational Learning Theory, Meaningful Learning Theory, and Learning Curve Theory. Knowledge sharing, employee development, and retention help companies integrate after a merger, according to the descriptive case study. The descriptive case study recommends conducting further research on the impact of training and support on staff integration. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objective: Delirium, a prevalent neurocognitive disorder, frequently affects critically ill patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs), leading to increased mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and higher healthcare costs. This quasi-experimental study assessed the effect of an educational program relating to ICU nurses’ knowledge of delirium in a university hospital in Nablus, Palestinian Authority. Methods: A pre-test–post-test design was employed, utilizing a 25-item questionnaire for 114 ICU nurses. The educational intervention included a presentation on delirium, the distribution of educational materials, and follow-up video sessions. Our study aim was to evaluate nurses’ understanding of ICU delirium and the impact of the educational program on their ability to identify and evaluate the delirium. Results : Pre-intervention assessments indicated limited awareness among nurses regarding delirium diagnosis and management tools, i.e., the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. Post-intervention results showed a significant improvement in knowledge; median scores increased from 6 (range: 3–13) to 15 (range: 12–20) ( p < 0.001). Nurses also reported greater confidence in identifying and managing delirium, and 50% found CAM-ICU easy to use. However, knowledge gaps remained concerning mixed delirium types and modifiable risk factors. Conclusions: Continuous educational programs are essential for ensuring long-term knowledge retention. We recommend integrating routine delirium education with hospital policies and emphasizing the use of delirium assessment tools during each shift. Findings show that targeted education can enhance ICU nurses’ competencies and thereby improve patient outcomes through more effective delirium management.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Bystander first aid in paediatric choking is crucial. It ought to be universally comprehensible and backed up by evidence-based guidelines. However, there still are inconsistencies in guidelines worldwide. The objective of this research was to assess the knowledge of medical students on paediatric choking rescue manoeuvres and their educational backgrounds in order to evaluate the impact of differences in educational curricula. Methods: Medical students from a total of 12 universities across Canada, Libya, and Poland were surveyed online. The questionnaire assessed the respondents’ experience, training, and knowledge in first aid regarding foreign body airway obstruction in infants and children. Results: Out of 324 responses, 290 were evaluated. Although the students studied in only 3 countries, they represented 37 countries of origin. A total of 7 new reference groups were created based on guideline identification. A comparison of 4 clinical scenario questions revealed that certain training providers communicate recommendations more effectively to medical students, as their guidelines seem to have better knowledge retention. Conclusions: There are important differences in medical student knowledge, possibly due to discrepancies in training programs and guidelines. Variability was found in body position, anti-choking suction devices, blind finger sweeps, and medical follow-ups. More research is needed to standardize training and improve worldwide choking management outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Medical students face cognitive overload and disengagement due to the rigorous demands of their education. This study evaluates the impact of Medimon Learning Cards, a mnemonic-based trading card game, on engagement, satisfaction, and knowledge retention among students in a medical immunology course. These cards incorporate visual and linguistic mnemonics, coupled with strategic gameplay, to create an interactive learning experience. This study was conducted on 39 first-year medical students enrolled in an immunology course, divided into experimental Learning Card and control groups. The Learning Card group received the Medimon Learning Cards and participated in a structured play session, while both groups received identical in-class instruction. The results from the Situational Interest Survey for Multimedia revealed high engagement and satisfaction among the Learning Card group, with students expressing enthusiasm for expanding the scope of the cards to other topics. However, no significant differences were observed in knowledge retention or exam performance between the groups. These findings suggest that Medimon Learning Cards can serve as a valuable supplementary tool with which to enhance motivation and interest, though their impact on cognitive outcomes requires further investigation. These findings suggest that incorporating mnemonic-based card games such as Medimon Learning Cards can enhance learner motivation and interest, although their impact on cognitive outcomes warrants further study.",

    "Abstract": "Outdoor experiences significantly enrich intangible cultural heritage tourism, yet limited interaction often restricts deep cultural learning. This research investigates how a mobile application, grounded in experiential learning theory, enhances tourists’ learning about Tang Sancai, a form of Chinese intangible cultural heritage, in the outdoor setting of Sancai Town, Luoyang. Employing a theory learning behavior design scenario framework, the application integrates activity-based exploration, reflective multimedia content, and immersive simulation scenarios to promote active participation, critical reflection, and context-rich outdoor learning experiences. Controlled experiments using pre- and post-tests and questionnaires revealed that participants using the application significantly outperformed those using conventional digital tools in knowledge retention, comprehension, and experiential learning outcomes. Technology acceptance analysis highlighted perceived usefulness as a critical driver of learning success. However, limited effects on behavioral progression suggest that short-term digital interactions may not sustain long-term behavioral change. This research offers a replicable mobile learning framework for outdoor cultural education, extends experiential learning theory to informal tourism contexts, and provides practical insights into using technology to enrich outdoor educational experiences, while supporting heritage preservation.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 International Conference on Frontier Technologies and Solutions (ICFTS) Conference Start Date: 2025 March 27 Conference End Date: 2025 March 28 Conference Location: Chennai, India Growing academic burden and dependence on traditional close book assessments have frequently compromised learning and mental well-being. We can also simply explore machine learning field, in situations with clear set of skills, reading and comprehension, etc., and give individual insights that tell educators what area they need to focus on. And, similarly, how machine learning could generate a tailored learning experience and remove the stress of conventional assessments altogether. This information can be used by adaptive learning systems, so that they can customize educational content for each student based on their individual needs. This is balanced against students being able to ingest information at their most suitable speed and also to focus on areas that they're struggling to master or hone and finesse skills that they already do possess in their toolkit. However, that kind of bespoke support does not focus solely on knowledge retention - it builds confidence that, in turn, will alleviate the anxiety that comes with high -stakes testing. Chat GPT, smart quizzes and ML based platforms, have the most potential that could be used for continuous formative assessment, and can provide real-time feedbacks and track progress overtime. Whereas you were always encouraged to cram knowledge to the best of your ability, which was once a must with close book examination formats, these tools foster active learning. Students will identify where their learning is lacking and be able to correct it over days, weeks and months and in doing so make the entire joy of learning meaningful, child friendly, stress free.” Another great exploding advantage of machine learning in the education sector is predicting academic performance and emotional states. Using techniques such as sentiment analysis or behavioral tracking through learning management systems, educational institutions can identify students who are struggling or demonstrating signs of stress around examinations. This allows you to put in early interventions - for example, a tailored-approach mental health support or workload adaptation - and intervene before stress can domino. Furthermore, ML-driven intelligent tutoring machines can imitate the coaching style of a human by offering personalized hints, explanations, or analysis of study schedules.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Stroke treatment has significantly improved over the last decades, but the complexity of stroke cases requires specialized care through dedicated teams with specific knowledge and training. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), widely used to assess neurological deficits and make treatment decisions, is reliable but requires specific training and certification. The traditional didactic training method, based on a video, may not adequately address certain NIHSS intricacies nor engage health care professionals (HCPs) in continuous learning, leading to suboptimal proficiency. In the context of time-constrained clinical settings, highly interactive e-learning could be a promising alternative for NIHSS knowledge acquisition and retention. Objective: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a highly interactive e-learning module compared with a traditional didactic video in improving NIHSS knowledge among previously trained HCPs. Furthermore, its impact on knowledge retention was also assessed. Methods: A prospective, multicentric, triple-blind, and web-based randomized controlled trial was conducted in 3 Swiss university hospitals, involving HCPs previously trained in NIHSS. Invitations were sent through email, and participants were randomized to either the e-learning or traditional didactic video group through a fully automated process upon self-registration on the website. A 50-question quiz was administered before and after exposure to the training method, and scores were compared to assess knowledge acquisition. The quiz was repeated after 1 month to evaluate retention. Subjective assessments of learning methods that is, user satisfaction, probability of recommendation, perceived difficulty, and perception of duration, were also collected through a Likert-scale questionnaire. A sample size of 72 participants were deemed necessary to have an 80% chance of detecting a difference of 2 points in the postcourse quiz between groups at the 5% significance level. Results: Invitations to participate were sent through email to an estimated 325 HCPs. 174 HCPs enrolled in the study, of which 97 completed the study course. Both learning methods significantly improved NIHSS knowledge, with an improvement of 3.2 (range 2.0-4.3) points in the e-learning group and of 2.1 (1.2-3.1) points in the video group. However, the e-learning group performed better, with higher scores in knowledge acquisition (median score 39.0, IQR 36.0-41.0 vs 37, IQR 34.0-39.0; P =.03) and in knowledge retention (mean score 38.2, 95% CI 36.7-39.7 vs 35.8, 95% CI 34.8-36.8; P =.007). Participants in the e-learning group were more likely to recommend the learning method (77% vs 49%, P =.02), while no significant difference was found for satisfaction ( P =.17), perceived duration ( P =.17), and difficulty ( P =.32). Conclusions: A highly interactive e-learning module was found to be an effective asynchronous method for NIHSS knowledge acquisition and retention in previously NIHSS-trained HCPs, and may now be considered for inclusion in NIHSS training programs for HCPs.

By leveraging AI-powered AR, tourism can offer real-time, context-aware recommendations and interactive digital content, enriching user engagement. Existing tourism methods often suffer from a lack of personalization, static information, and an inability to adapt to individual preferences. Conventional approaches fail to provide real-time, tailored suggestions, leading to generic and less engaging travel experiences. The proposed Smart Tourism using AI with AR (ST- AI-AR) framework combines AI-driven data analytics with AR- based immersive visualization. AI personalizes travel recommendations by analyzing user behavior, preferences, and real-time location data, while AR enhances experiences through interactive digital overlays on real-world environments. This synergy resolves issues of static information and lack of customization in traditional tourism methods. By implementing the ST-AI-AR framework, tourists receive personalized itineraries, cultural insights, and interactive guidance, enriching their exploration with dynamic and adaptive digital content. The system ensures an engaging and informed travel experience. Findings indicate that AI-powered AR significantly improves user engagement, satisfaction, and knowledge retention. The proposed method transforms tourism into a highly adaptive, immersive, and personalized journey, enhancing the overall travel experience.",

Integrating school-based gardening focused on IVFs with a nutrition education program delivered via WhatsApp combines experiential learning with digital tools. Introduction The poor dietary habits and limited nutritional knowledge, particularly regarding indigenous vegetables and fruits (IVFs) among youth in southwest Nigeria, highlight the need for an integrated intervention approach. Integrating school-based gardening focused on IVFs with a nutrition education program delivered via WhatsApp combines experiential learning with digital tools.This is a non-randomized, mixed-methods study involving youths between 15 and 35 years who will participate in gardening activities and/or interactive nutrition education via WhatsApp. Participants will be provided technical support on growing IVFs, while nutrition education messaging via WhatsApp will include texts, images, and videos on nutrition and healthy eating behavior. Data at baseline will be collected on the study's primary outcomes (awareness and interest in IVFs, household food security, nutritional knowledge and practices, fruits and vegetables intake, food safety self-efficacy, dietary diversity, anthropometric, and biomarker indicators). In contrast, data collection during the intervention and at post-intervention will include the study's secondary outcomes (WhatsApp engagement, knowledge retention, and intervention acceptability). Mixed model regression and the Mann-Whitney U Test will be used to analyze the data collected. All analyses will be performed using IBM SPSS (version 23), and the statistical significance will be set at a p -value <0.05.

Mixed model regression and the Mann-Whitney U Test will be used to analyze the data collected. All analyses will be performed using IBM SPSS (version 23), and the statistical significance will be set at a p-value <0.05.The present study will focus on the acceptability and feasibility of gardening and incorporate nutrition education delivered through WhatsApp to address the improvements in food security, dietary diversity, and other nutrition-related outcomes of youth in low-income countries. The expected outcomes include enhanced nutrition knowledge, healthier dietary habits, and greater acceptance of indigenous gardening. The result will support the development of effective, culturally acceptable strategies to promote healthy eating behavior among youths and influence future school-based nutrition programs in similar settings. Discussion The present study will focus on the acceptability and feasibility of gardening and incorporate nutrition education delivered through WhatsApp to address the improvements in food security, dietary diversity, and other nutrition-related outcomes of youth in low-income countries.

    "Abstract": "Dementia is a growing global public health concern, particularly in LMICs like Bangladesh. With population aging, there is an increasing prevalence of dementia; care facilities are limited. This scarcity of services places a significant responsibility on untrained family caregivers, impacting the health of persons with dementia and their caregivers. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving dementia care, especially in resource-constrained settings. Recognizing the urgency, the WHO developed an online self-training manual, iSupport, emphasizing education, skill development, and support for caregivers. This study aims to test feasibility of iSupport i) in improving knowledge about dementia and dementia care among family and formal caregivers, and ii) reducing family caregivers' stress and improving their caregiving skills, mental health, quality of life and relationship with the person with dementia cared for. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of SAJIDA Foundation (2024-005-SFIRB). This non-randomized feasibility study aims to recruit 44 family caregivers and 132 formal caregivers from Dhaka, Bangladesh, using a purposive sampling technique. Participants will be provided access to iSupport for two months. Pre- and post-intervention surveys will be conducted to assess changes in knowledge about dementia care among both family and formal caregivers, as well as changes in psychological well-being among family caregivers. To assess knowledge retention, a follow-up survey will be conducted. Any differences in the outcomes from the pre-intervention period will be tested against the null hypothesis of zero mean difference using a two-sample paired t-test. Additionally, multivariable regression techniques will also be used to control for possible confounders. To understand the facilitators and barriers of implementing iSupport, a qualitative approach will be used to interview 15 family caregivers and conduct four FGDs with formal caregivers. Qualitative data will be analysed using an inductive content analysis approach.Dementia is a growing global public health concern, particularly in LMICs like Bangladesh.

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 8th World Conference on Computing and Communication Technologies (WCCCT) Conference Start Date: 2025 April 11 Conference End Date: 2025 April 13 Conference Location: Shenzhen, China In rapidly changing environments, traditional static deep learning models are unable to adapt to the evolving demands of new tasks. These models lack the adaptability required to address dynamic scenarios. While fine-tuning these models can be a solution to some extent, it frequently leads to a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting, which involves the loss of knowledge acquired from previous tasks. Existing class-incremental learning methods predominantly prioritize the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting, often at the cost of compromising plasticity and adaptability. To address these challenges, we draw inspiration from model merging techniques and propose the Analytic Learning and Model Merging (ALMM) method. ALMM integrates the strengths of model fine-tuning, analytic learning and model merging into a cohesive framework. This approach enables ALMM to achieve a balance between robustness and plasticity in class-incremental learning tasks, while also safeguarding data privacy—a critical consideration in real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that ALMM excels in class-incremental learning scenarios, effectively addressing the dual challenges of catastrophic forgetting and adaptability, and showcasing superior performance in balancing robustness and plasticity.",

    "Abstract": "This article discusses the exercise of power within organisational settings, with emphasis on dysfunctional behaviours associated with the Dark Triad — Machiavellianism, narcissism, and subclinical psychopathy — and on the deliberate retention of knowledge as a strategy of symbolic domination. It is based on the understanding that pursuing power is a legitimate human inclination, but one that, in competitive organisational contexts, can take on manipulative and harmful forms. The study draws on political philosophy and organisational psychology contributions to analyse practices such as the selective favouring of allies, the manipulation of success trajectories, and the restriction of access to knowledge as a means of self-preservation and status maintenance. It also considers the influence of Brazilian cultural elements — marked by centralised leadership styles and low levels of cooperation — which contribute to the reproduction of permissive environments that enable opportunistic profiles to thrive. The study further highlights a gap in the main strands of management theory, which, by prioritising material incentives and formal structures, tend to overlook the effects of symbolic power relations and interpersonal manipulation on organisational performance. It is argued that the absence of precise institutional mechanisms to address such behaviours reflects a lack of theoretical recognition of the problem. The article concludes that understanding knowledge retention as an instrument of domination requires a broader perspective on power dynamics and the incorporation of interdisciplinary approaches that combine ethics, organisational culture, and individual behaviour. Further empirical investigation is recommended, particularly with support from organisational psychology.",

    "Abstract": "The increasing availability of online herbal medicine information has complicated the process for consumers and practitioners to locate pertinent data. Conventional resources such as textbooks and manuscripts are deficient in depth and order, hindering comprehension of herbal remedies and their interconnections. Ontology, as a systematic framework, can assist in resolving this challenge by offering a more lucid articulation of knowledge. Ontologies have demonstrated efficacy in domains such as biology, ecology, and biodiversity research, consolidating and augmenting data descriptions while improving data discovery. This study aims to develop and assess a domain ontology for Malaysian Herbal Medicine utilizing evidence-based data. The research has employed the Haghigi framework, which has three main phases: method of identification, ontology design and implementation, and ontology assessment. The ontology comprises 13 primary classes and properties, addressing competency questions regarding the safety and efficacy of herbal medicines through SPARQL query and prototype evaluations. The ontology provided correct answers to all competency questions through SPARQL query testing and has met the criteria in terms of its accuracy, appropriateness, comprehensiveness, consistency, extensibility, and completeness. The validation and verification results included the positive endorsement and constructive judgment of most of the ontology components. The established ontology may enhance compliance with regulatory standards by providing accurate definitions and classifications of pharmaceutical goods. The ontology may serve as an instructional tool, assisting students and professionals in understanding complex pharmacological concepts within a structured framework and, hence, enhancing learning outcomes and knowledge retention in pharmacology and related fields.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores the implementation of the Three-Minutes-Each-Way technique in university classrooms to enhance student engagement and active participation. Traditional lecture formats, which often emphasize one-way communication from instructor to student, typically lead to passive learning. This approach can limit students' opportunities for interaction, leaving them less engaged and hindered in their comprehension of complex concepts. The Three-Minutes-Each-Way technique introduces a solution by incorporating structured, brief, bidirectional discussions between the lecturer and students, transforming the lecture into a more dynamic and participatory environment. By allocating short, focused time intervals for discussions in which both students and lecturers exchange ideas, this method encourages students to articulate their understanding, ask clarifying questions, and actively engage in meaningful dialogue. The technique allows students to reflect on their thoughts in real-time and provides immediate feedback from the lecturer, making learning more interactive and personalized. These brief discussions are designed to promote active learning while maintaining an effective pace in the lecture. The study examines how the Three-Minutes-Each-Way method impacts various aspects of the learning experience, including student participation, comprehension, and overall lecture effectiveness. Findings indicate that integrating this technique into classroom activities fosters greater student confidence, encourages deeper conceptual understanding, and improves classroom dynamics. Importantly, it provides an inclusive platform for students who may be hesitant to participate in more traditional lecture settings, such as those who struggle with anxiety or feel overshadowed by more vocal peers. The research underscores the importance of incorporating structured interactive techniques in higher education to bridge the gap between passive reception and active learning. By cultivating an environment where students are encouraged to participate actively, the Three-Minutes-Each-Way method helps create a more engaging, effective, and inclusive teaching methodology that enhances both knowledge retention and student satisfaction.",

    "Abstract": "In an era of increasing financial uncertainty and economic volatility, social security programs serve as a fundamental pillar in safeguarding the financial well-being of individuals and families. Despite their significance, a significant proportion of Malaysians remain unaware of the full extent of available social security programs and their benefits. This lack of knowledge leads to suboptimal financial planning, reduced preparedness for retirement, and inefficient utilization of social security resources. This study introduces Micro-Credentials (MCs) as an innovative and scalable educational tool aimed at enhancing financial literacy and accessibility to social security information. The research focuses on Malaysia’s key social security programs, including Government Pension, Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), Social Security Organisation (SOCSO), and Private Retirement Scheme (PRS). By leveraging the MC-based uFuture platform of UiTM (https://ufuture.uitm.edu.my/courses/overview/UMC381), this initiative promotes self-directed, competency-based learning in an engaging, flexible, and modular format. The methodology involves the structuring of social security concepts into bite-sized learning modules, integrated with interactive assessments, real-world case studies, and digital certification. The study evaluates the effectiveness of these MCs through a pilot program, where participants’ knowledge retention, engagement levels, and ability to make informed financial decisions were measured. Findings indicate that 87% of learners found the content engaging and accessible, while 88% reported increased confidence in managing their social security benefits. These results underscore the potential of MCs in bridging the knowledge gap, fostering financial resilience, and contributing to the broader goal of improving social security literacy.

    "Abstract": "The rapid advancement of educational technology has transformed the landscape of higher education, particularly in specialized fields such as actuarial mathematics. This study explores the effectiveness of digital resources, with a focus on the MindAppz eBook, Introduction to Actuarial Mathematics, in enhancing student comprehension, engagement, and learning outcomes. The eBook, which covers fundamental actuarial topics including life annuities, assurances, premium rates, reserves, and the calculation of surrender and paid-up values, integrates theoretical concepts with practical exercises to support learning. Using a mixed-methods approach, this research evaluates the educational impact of the eBook through surveys, student performance analysis, and interviews with actuarial educators. The findings indicate that students using the digital resource exhibit improved comprehension and retention of key actuarial concepts compared to those relying solely on traditional textbooks. Additionally, the interactive and self-paced nature of the eBook contributes to greater engagement, though some students report challenges related to digital fatigue and the lack of physical interaction with instructors. The study underscores the growing significance of e-learning in actuarial education and highlights the need for hybrid learning models that combine digital and traditional resources to optimize student success. The findings provide valuable insights for educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers in integrating digital tools effectively into actuarial science education. Future research should explore the incorporation of AI-driven interactivity and adaptive learning features in digital actuarial resources to further enhance engagement and knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Background Generative AI technologies offer significant opportunities to enhance orthodontic education by improving knowledge retention, clinical decision-making, and skills training. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact of generative AI tools in orthodontic education, focusing on knowledge retention, decision-making, and practical skills. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, ERIC, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore from January 2010 to December 2023. Studies evaluating the integration of generative AI in dental and orthodontic education were included. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, with the GRADE approach used to evaluate evidence quality. Results Generative AI improved knowledge retention and clinical decision-making through adaptive learning pathways and real-time feedback. Barriers included limited faculty training, technical infrastructure deficits, and educator resistance. Conclusions Generative AI holds transformative potential for orthodontic education but requires addressing practical and ethical challenges. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to validate long-term impact and explore integration strategies.",

    "Abstract": "With air travel growing rapidly worldwide, airports are busier than ever, making efficient security screening a top priority. To meet this growing demand, various advanced X-ray baggage scanners have been deployed at airports worldwide. Researchers have proposed multiple automated threat detection systems to enhance security screening efficiency; however, automated baggage threat segmentation remains a complex task, especially in the context of multi-class threat detection across diverse datasets. Traditional deep learning models struggle with differentiating between multiple threat types and suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to new classes. To address these limitations, we propose an incremental learning framework that enables the model to progressively learn new threat categories while retaining previously acquired knowledge. Our approach utilizes SegFormer as the backbone and introduces a custom loss function, combining mutual distillation loss, KL divergence, and cross-entropy loss, to enhance knowledge retention and adaptability. The model is trained sequentially on three publicly available datasets, SIXRAY, GDXRAY, and PIDRAY, enabling it to generalize effectively across diverse baggage imagery. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art incremental learning techniques, achieving superior segmentation accuracy and knowledge retention. Furthermore, Grad-CAM visualizations and t-SNE plots provide interpretability, offering insights into the model’s learning behavior and class separability. The proposed framework establishes a scalable and adaptable solution for real-world security screening applications, enabling efficient threat detection without requiring model retraining from scratch.",

In the pre-test/post-test design study, 34 fifth-grade students engaged in an interaction with an astronomy context-based AR-based learning module on the concepts like the rotation of the Earth, phases of the moon. The MRT was used to measure spatial ability and split the participants into high and low spatial ability groups. The results show that AR enhances the students' knowledge retention by a higher percentage of low spatial ability students 48% as compared to high spatial ability students 27%. First, it should be mentioned that, compared to conventional visualizations, AR provides manipulable 3D models which eliminate certain abstractive thickets of the human brain. This work sheds the light on the ability of AR to facilitate enhanced teaching and learning of science for diversely-abled learners within STEM fields. Subsequently, these studies should look at the durability of learning that is anchored on augmented reality as well as assess its possibilities in other areas of science.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON) Conference Start Date: 2025 April 22 Conference End Date: 2025 April 25 Conference Location: London, United Kingdom Technological advancements enabled new possibilities for interacting within a classroom or, in general, with an audience. Starting with dedicated devices called clickers, the technology leveraged personal general-use devices such as smartphones and tablets. Terminology varies, but this is generally called response technology, response system, or student response system. This research aimed to explore the students' perceptions concerning technology-mediated opentext questions and the various factors that influence students' learning during lectures. This research adopts a case study approach, employing qualitative, in-depth interviews with ten students from a large science and technology university in northern Europe. In this exploratory research, interview sessions were digitally recorded, audios were converted to text through Microsoft Word, and NVivo was used for thematic analysis. The study uncovered student engagement and interactivity, focus and attention, learning and knowledge retention, and challenges as key themes that impact student learning. Findings indicated that students generally had positive experiences with this approach, though they also encountered several challenges. Notable examples from the findings: the technology-mediated questions combined with anonymity allow increased freedom of expression for the students; the modality for collecting responses can feel quite limited, especially when using a smartphone or similar device as input. Some identified themes, e.g., challenges encountered, can be further classified into additional subthemes, e.g., technological, pedagogical, and content-related. Combining open-text questions with other types in the context of a lecture opens opportunities for active participation, formative assessment, reflections, scaffolding discussions, and, in general, higher-level learning activities and processes. Teachers and technologists could consider these findings to optimize the implementation of such tools in classroom settings.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON) Conference Start Date: 2025 April 22 Conference End Date: 2025 April 25 Conference Location: London, United Kingdom Contribution: This study examines the effective-ness of a flipped classroom approach combined with dialogic teaching in STEM education. The primary contribution is the development of a methodology centered on discussions between the professor and students, guided by questions. The entire class is organized around these discussions, rather than merely asking occasional questions during the session. With pre-class reading, students focus class time on in-depth discussions that enhance comprehension and critical thinking, promoting active learning and student participation. Evidence from 163 first-year students highlights both the benefits and challenges of this teaching strategy. Background: Active learning enhances student engagement and academic performance, particularly in STEM fields. Dialogic teaching facilitates meaningful interactions that refine students' understanding, while the flipped classroom shifts content delivery outside of class, requiring students to prepare beforehand. This integration of strategies explores how pre-class preparation and in-class questioning enhance knowledge retention, engagement, and critical thinking. While these approaches are well-established, empirical evidence on their effectiveness in higher education contexts remains limited, highlighting the need for further investigation into their impact on student outcomes. Intended Outcomes: The methodology aims to create a student-centered learning environment where students arrive prepared, allowing class time for discussions driven by open-ended questions. The approach seeks to improve focus, comprehension, and retention while promoting a dynamic and inclusive classroom atmosphere that encourages voluntary participation and reduces anxiety. Application Design: Following the flipped classroom model, students read materials before class, allowing the pro-fessor to engage them with adaptive, open-ended questions. This focus on individual responses promotes deeper understanding and personalized feedback, creating a supportive learning en-vironment. Findings: Feedback indicated high satisfaction with the methodology, particularly in maintaining focus (mean rating of 4.2/5) and enhancing learning effectiveness (4.3/5). However, challenges related to participation (3.6/5) and confidence (3.4/5) were noted. Overall, the methodology was well-received, but further efforts are needed to address these concerns and optimize the learning environment.",

As part of our research agenda, we aim to investigate suitable design strategies for eLearning courses that support distributed practice through intrinsic motivation. Our most recent strategy followed the idea of linking the acquisition of badges gained by completing a set of quizzes with a small extrinsic reward, a small bonus in the exam grade. We built a course with quizzes and timed badges with staged deadlines for the badges to ensure students do the quizzes during the semester and not shortly before the exam. An initial evaluation of this course design yielded encouraging results. The assessment showed that students learned a great deal from the quizzes and were highly motivated by the quizzes and by receiving the badges. Qualitative feedback highlighted increased motivation, increased engagement, and lower levels of perceived stress among students, who attributed these changes to the platform's ability to make learning more enjoyable and less monotonous. This paper argues that the strategic use of gamification in engineering education can significantly support distributed practice by creating an interactive, motivating, and supportive learning environment.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON) Conference Start Date: 2025 April 22 Conference End Date: 2025 April 25 Conference Location: London, United Kingdom Flipped Learning has been widely recognised for its potential to enhance student engagement and academic performance. However, its success depends on students completing asynchronous activities, which can be challenging due to motivational issues. This study investigates the introduction of gamification as a strategy to address this challenge by integrating Kahoot-based competitive quizzes into face-to-face sessions within the flipped learning model. This intervention is aimed at increasing student participation, attendance, online engagement, and overall academic achievement. Building on a similar pilot study conducted at the School of Engineering and Materials Science (SEMS), this research extends the implementation to a transnational educational context at Queen Mary Engineering School (QMES), Xi'an, China [1]. The study examines the impact of gamified flipped learning across diverse cultural groups and seeks to identify best practices for optimising student engagement through active learning strategies. The methodology involved the use of Kahoot! quizzes and interactive challenges aligned with learning outcomes to promote knowledge retention and gather data on student performance and engagement. Learning analytics were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. The results showed an increase in student engagement, higher passing rates, and no failures in the examined module. The latest cohort shows a significant improvement, with a sharp increase in high scores (80+ mark range) and a marked reduction in students scoring below 50 compared to the previous cohort, resulting in a passing rate increase from 87 % to 100 %. The success of this intervention has led to its application in other modules, where similarly positive outcomes are anticipated.",

    "http": "//ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/strengthening-communities-designing-ai-knowledge/docview/3215650074/se-2?accountid=16210",
    "Abstract": "The welfare of vulnerable and marginalized individuals, including those facing poverty, food insecurity, and housing instability, is significantly influenced by their ability to access essential social services. Community social service organizations work tirelessly to meet these needs, yet their effectiveness is shaped not only by available resources but also by how knowledge is managed, shared, and retained across their networks. Unlike corporate environments with structured knowledge management systems, community social service organizations rely heavily on informal processes, including conversations, ad-hoc emails, and staff memory, leading to inefficiencies, knowledge silos, and challenges in maintaining service continuity. To investigate these challenges and explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in supporting knowledge management, this dissertation presents three empirical studies. First, we conducted an ethnographic study with community service workers (CSWs) across two organizations to understand how they manage and transfer knowledge in their daily work. Our findings reveal that CSWs navigate high caseloads, shifting service landscapes, and documentation burdens, often relying on personal networks and tacit knowledge rather than formalized systems. The study also highlights the need for accessible, sustainable knowledge management solutions that fit the informal knowledge-sharing practices of CSWs while enhancing knowledge retention, knowledge transfer, and collaboration. Second, we engaged CSWs in participatory design workshops across four organizations, co-designing AI-driven interventions to support knowledge management and knowledge transfer. Participants recognized the potential of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve information synthesis, reduce administrative overhead, and enhance inter-agency coordination. However, they also voiced concerns about privacy, data bias, and the risk of AI undermining the human-centered values of their work. These discussions informed key design considerations for AI integration, ensuring that automation complements rather than replaces human expertise. Finally, we explored AI-assisted case note management through co-design workshops with caseworkers. The study revealed significant challenges in writing and reading case notes, including uncertainty in documentation and difficulties in retrieving past case information. Caseworkers saw the potential of LLMs to facilitate structured documentation and enhance knowledge transfer, but also raised concerns about automation reducing personalization and the need for privacy safeguards. These insights informed design guidelines for LLM-driven case note management and design considerations to align with social service workflows. This dissertation is grounded in the following thesis statement , which shaped both the empirical investigation of knowledge management in community social services and the broader examination of AI design in resource-limited environments: AI is promising for improving knowledge management in community social services, but its implementation must be approached with care. If designed without consideration of the social, ethical, and practical realities of service work, AI systems risk amplifying biases and disrupting the trust-based relationships that define social services. By centering the voices of community service workers and prioritizing AI as a collaborative tool rather than a substitute for human expertise, we can design technology that strengthens, rather than disrupts, the relational and human-centered nature of social service work.",

It requires the model to answer questions directly in the absence of rich contextual information and external knowledge, thus relying on the model's capacity for knowledge retention. This study proposes a salient mask optimization method based on information extraction to enhance the model's knowledge parameterization capacity in closed-book question answering tasks. Specifically, information extraction technology is first used to extract key entities and triples from text to construct salient region masks sensitive to knowledge, addressing the limitations of traditional masking strategies in professional domain knowledge coverage. Subsequently, in the intermediate pre-training stage, the salient mask is integrated with the self-attention mechanism to enhance the model's ability to learn and retain relevant knowledge. The experiment is conducted on the traditional Chinese medicine literature data from the Tianchi dataset, using T5-small as the baseline model. The experimental results show that, compared with the original model, the proposed method achieves an improvement of 11.03% in the EM score and 6.98% in the F1 score. Ablation experiments further confirm the effectiveness of information extraction in generating salient masks and highlight the role of salient masks in improving the model's knowledge parameterization capacity. This study provides a new technical solution for optimizing masking strategies in knowledge-intensive tasks and offers theoretical support for efficient knowledge compression in language models for vertical domains.",

    "Abstract": "The research investigates the relationship between how teachers teach and how students learn and participate in research course. The research was conducted in a private higher education of Bukidnon during the 2024–2025 first semester involving 105 students as participant of the study. A descriptive-correlational research design such-mean and standard deviations to rate teaching approaches composed of inquiry-based learning, mentoring and coaching, and technology-enhanced learning while measuring student performance through cognitive and behavioral retention levels. Pearson’s R Correlation used to find out the relationship of the study’s variable. The research showed that the three teaching strategies achieved successful implementation at a high level. The students displayed limitations in knowledge retention which indicated their ability to remember information remained unknown six months to a year after instruction. Student behavioral engagement reached very high scores while their cognitive engagement levels were assessed as high. Finally, the research found out that there was no significant connection between teaching styles and student academic performance levels in addition to student participative behaviors and educational achievements.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this research is to investigate how AI-improved dynamic physical education materials impact middle school education in physical settings. Utilizing a randomized controlled crossover approach, a 16-week study involved 120 students aged 12 to 18 to evaluate the impact of AI-enhanced physical education courses against traditional instructional techniques. Findings indicated a notable improvement in the AI group compared to traditional instruction in terms of physical fitness (23% enhancement), motor skill proficiency (31% improvement), and knowledge retention (27% enhancement) ( p < .01). Evaluations of system usability reveal that users have an excellent experience (SUS score 84.3), with a 4.7/5 satisfaction score. Qualitative feedback underscores the importance of personalized coaching and real-time feedback. Notably, the AI system shows exceptional effectiveness for students with lower initial levels of physical fitness. An analysis after three months revealed a 19% success in comprehensive performance metrics ( p < .01). This evidence points to the AI-aided physical education resources improving learning and user satisfaction, and opens new pathways for physical education innovation. Further investigation into long-term effects and widespread application across various educational contexts is needed.",

    "Abstract": "The potential of serious games to improve students' engagement and knowledge retention in design historical education has gained significant attention in recent years. This study proposes a learning strategy integrating AI virtual characters into a role-playing serious game designed to teach design history. Utilizing the Arts and Crafts Movement as the narrative foundation, the game employs AI-driven characters to provide adaptive guidance, interactive storytelling, and personalized feedback. A quasi-experimental design was adopted with two groups of college students (N = 60): an experimental group using the AI-supported game and a control group playing the same game without AI integration. Results show that the inclusion of AI virtual characters significantly enhances students' engagement and knowledge acquisition compared to the traditional game. These findings highlight the potential of AI-powered serious games to transform historical education by fostering active participation and deep learning.

    "Abstract": "To evaluate the effectiveness of the Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) method in enhancing hospital infection training. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of the Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) method in enhancing hospital infection training.A total of 196 infection control staff from clinical departments were selected from a hospital and divided into a control group and an experimental group. The control group received conventional hospital infection control, which training included 10 h of theory lectures and 5 h of practical demonstrations, while the experimental group received three formative assessments using the DOPS method in addition to the conventional training at two-month intervals. The results of the three DOPS assessments in the experimental group were analyzed and compared. The training effectiveness was further evaluated by comparing theory test scores and satisfaction ratings between the two groups. Methods A total of 196 infection control staff from clinical departments were selected from a hospital and divided into a control group and an experimental group. The control group received conventional hospital infection control, which training included 10 h of theory lectures and 5 h of practical demonstrations, while the experimental group received three formative assessments using the DOPS method in addition to the conventional training at two-month intervals. The results of the three DOPS assessments in the experimental group were analyzed and compared. The training effectiveness was further evaluated by comparing theory test scores and satisfaction ratings between the two groups.Among these 196 study subjects, the majority were over 35 years old, female, doctors or nurses, with middle titles, a bachelor's degree, and over 10 years of working seniority. The scores of using protective equipment and the handling of emergencies increased over the three DOPS evaluations (3.93 vs. 3.94 vs. 4.15 and 2.37 vs. 2.53 vs. 2.68, respectively). After adjusting for all covariates, the overall theoretical knowledge score in the experimental group was 7.968 times higher than that of the control group. The number of participants in the experimental group who were satisfied with the training was 86 compared to 71 in the control group for knowledge retention, 82 vs. 62 for clinical application, 83 vs. 67 for knowledge extrapolation, 88 vs. 73 for training methods, and 89 vs. 59 for motivation.

    "Abstract": "The rapid emergence of Industry 4.0 technologies has transformed manufacturing, requiring a workforce skilled in automation, data-driven decision-making, and process optimisation. While traditional education includes structured formats such as lectures and tutorials, it may not always equip graduates with the hands-on expertise demanded by modern industrial challenges. This study presents a Mixed Reality (MR)-based educational framework that promotes interactive experiences to enhance students’ engagement with and understanding of Industry 4.0 concepts, aiming to bridge the skills gap through immersive Virtual Learning Factories (VLFs). The framework was developed using a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative feedback with quantitative benchmarking. A proof-of-concept MR application was developed and tested at the (Anonymised), simulating Industry 4.0 scenarios in an engineering education context to validate the framework. The findings indicate that MR-based learning improved students’ engagement with the academic content, leading to better knowledge retention and deeper conceptual understanding. The students also demonstrated enhanced problem-solving, process optimisation, and adaptability compared to traditional methods. The immersive nature of MR provided an interactive, context-rich environment that fostered active learning. This research highlights MR’s potential as a transformative educational tool, aligning academic training with industry needs. Future research is recommended to evaluate the framework’s scalability and long-term effectiveness.",

    "Abstract": "Background : First aid training in secondary education enhances emergency preparedness and supports public health. Despite its inclusion in many school curricula, there is no consensus on the most effective teaching methodologies. This systematic review aims to compare instructional strategies used in first aid training during Physical Education and evaluate their impact on students’ knowledge, practical skills, and confidence. Methods : A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Six databases (SCOPUS, Web of Science, ERIC, DIALNET, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) were searched up to December 2024. Eligible studies were quasi-experimental or observational, involved students aged 11–18, and focused on first aid instruction within Physical Education. Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. Results : Eleven studies with a total of 3069 students aged 11–18 were included. Active and technology-based methodologies outperformed traditional approaches, improving knowledge acquisition (10.2–30.5%) and practical skill development (18.6–42.3%). Long-term retention ranged from 14.2% to 45.8%, with longer interventions yielding better outcomes. Gamification, simulations, and peer learning improved CPR quality and boosted student confidence. However, most studies assessed only short-term outcomes, limiting conclusions about sustained learning. Conclusions : Active methodologies, particularly gamification, simulation, and cooperative learning, enhance knowledge retention, practical skills, and confidence in providing first aid. Although the results were consistently positive, methodological heterogeneity and limited long-term follow-up reduce their generalizability. Further high-quality, longitudinal research is needed to identify the most effective and sustainable strategies. These findings support integrating first aid training into Physical Education as a public health initiative to strengthen emergency preparedness in schools.",

This investigation examines a RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG) solution for quality reports at Siemens Electronics Works, where engineers currently spend significant time searching through $4,500+$ technical documents, resulting in annual costs of approximately $\\mathrm{C}\\!\\!\\!\\!{\\scriptstyle{{}^=}\\,} 200,000$ . We developed an optimized data preprocessing pipeline for semantic search that combines generalizable components (duplicate removal, HTML cleaning, chunking strategies) with novel domain-specific enhancements. Our key innovation is a systematic approach integrating Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) with attention mask modification (AMM) to identify and downweight tokens that disproportionately influence search results. This method, combined with LLM-based contextual enhancement of domain-specific abbreviations and semantic chunking, achieved a 21.1 % improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to raw data processing, as measured by Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The resulting RAG application operates locally without internet access, ensuring data security while significantly reducing document retrieval time. Our methodology provides a framework for optimizing semantic search in specialized technical domains without requiring extensive model retraining.",

    "Abstract": "Contribution: An innovative approach utilizing interactive software paired with stereoscopic projection hardware is introduced to enhance the teaching and learning of solid-state physics. This method is distinctive for its integration of complex 3-D visualizations directly into classroom instruction, facilitating a deeper understanding of abstract concepts through interactive engagement. Background: This study is motivated by the challenges faced in teaching abstract concepts in a solid-state physics course, such as the energy band theory and Bravais lattices, to undergraduate students. Traditional teaching methods, such as blackboard teaching, or PowerPoint presentations often fail to adequately address these complexities, leading to a significant learning gap. This gap underlines the necessity for innovative educational tools that can bridge theoretical knowledge with practical understanding, applicable globally across educational programs. Intended Outcomes: The primary outcomes targeted by this approach include improved student engagement and learning efficacy, enhanced comprehension and retention of complex physics concepts, and better transfer of theoretical knowledge to practical applications. Application and Evaluation Experiment Design: The teaching tool integrates MATLAB-based interactive software with hardware utilizing the \"Pepper Ghost\" technique for 3-D stereoscopic visualization. This approach aims to foster an interactive and engaging learning environment, allowing complex physics concepts to be visualized intuitively. Assessment of learning effectiveness is carried out through the design of targeted questions, participant recruitment, and statistical analysis of questionnaire responses. Findings: Noticeable improvements in performance on both retention questions and transfer questions are observed, indicating that students exposed to this new teaching approach benefit in knowledge retention and application compared to those who experienced traditional teaching methods. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the integrated teaching tool in enhancing teaching outcomes in physics, suggesting its potential broad applicability in other fields.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of using gamification implemented in immersive virtual reality for the promotion of library services in the university library including knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention and user engagement. In terms of research procedure, we divided the participants into Gamified and Non-Gamified virtual reality groups, and both groups were asked to perform the pretest questionnaire of cognitive assessments. Then, participants were informed to use virtual reality to finish all the levels within one month in the library lab setting of the university. We performed post-tests to evaluate the knowledge acquisition, including a delayed post-test of three months to verify the knowledge retention. We also collected the user data to analyze the participant behavior. Results showed no significant differences among the Gamified and Non-Gamified groups in terms of knowledge acquisition, but showed significant difference in knowledge retention and user engagement. These findings supported the presumption that the gamified virtual reality approach can improve the library user's access and knowledge retention of library services.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study aimed to establish the effectiveness of a hypertension knowledge education intervention among Indian adolescents to foster lifestyle changes aimed at preventing hypertension. Methods: The Hypertension Knowledge Test (HKT) was used to assess changes in knowledge using a repeated-measures one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Healthy Lifestyle Practice Scale for Children and Adolescents (HELIPSCA) indexed healthy lifestyle practices, with paired t-tests used to compare pre- and post-intervention scores. A two-way mixed ANOVA examined changes in healthy lifestyle practices among adolescents divided in terms of early and late stage of development. Results: Significant mean differences were observed in overall hypertension knowledge across four domains: general awareness, lifestyle factors, causes and care, and medication management and across time periods. There was a significant improvement in HELIPSCA scores post-intervention, particularly among early adolescents. Conclusion: The hypertension knowledge intervention examined in this study was effective in establishing a cognitive base among school children, with knowledge retention observed for 3 months. Moreover, this knowledge increase was associated with a parallel change in improved healthy lifestyle practices, notably among early adolescents. These findings underscore the importance of providing school-based education programmes early in adolescence to promote awareness of chronic illnesses and encourage healthy lifestyle choices.",

    "Abstract": "Background/purpose: Collaborative concept maps (CCMs) stand out for their ability to organize knowledge and enhance retention. However, their use in higher education raises questions about their effectiveness. This study aims to evaluate the effect of CCMs on learning of students enrolled in the Master's program in Training and Supervision Professions in Morocco, identify the challenges they faced during the creation of these maps, and propose improvements aimed at optimizing the use of these tools in higher education. Materials/methods: The study involves 60 students divided into two modules, \"Work Psychology\" and \"Andragogy.\" Organized into small groups, the participants designed concept maps throughout the semester, using course materials and recommended scientific articles. Data were collected at the end of the semester through a questionnaire that included Likert-scale items and open-ended questions. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis, respectively. Results: CCMs proved to be effective in fostering creativity, enhancing critical thinking, and improving knowledge retention. However, certain limitations were identified, including cognitive overload related to organizing complex information and interpretive divergences within groups, which slowed down the collaborative process. Additionally, technical and organizational challenges, such as a lack of digital skills and coordination difficulties, were also noted. These limitations occasionally hindered the effectiveness of collaborative dynamics and the achievement of learning objectives. Conclusion: CCMs are an innovative teaching-learning tool that promotes interactivity among learners. By overcoming identified challenges and implementing recommended strategies, these maps effectively achieve a variety of educational objectives.",

    "Abstract": "In ancient poetry courses, students are expected to learn literary skills and the ability for interpreting ancient poems, from which they can gain insight into the historical context and appreciate the beauty of the poems. However, due to the gaps between ancient and modern living contexts, students often encounter difficulties in comprehending ancient texts. Scholars have suggested that visualizing learning scenarios could enhance learners' comprehension and knowledge retention, implying that engaging students in learning by illustrating the context of ancient poems could encourage them to explore the contexts in that historical background and comprehend the contents. Therefore, a generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) drawing mode is proposed in the present study. In this learning mode, students describe the characters, events, and scenes in the poems in words, and GenAI creates visual representations to immerse students in the contexts of the ancient poems. An experiment was conducted with two classes of students from a high school. One class was the experimental group consisting of 31 students, who used GenAI drawing mode to assist their learning of ancient poems. Another class was the control group consisting of 29 students, who used the conventional drawing mode. The experimental results showed that the experimental group had better learning achievement than the control group. Moreover, for the students in the experimental group, the higher creative ones showed better self-efficacy than the lower creative ones. Additionally, the drawings by the experimental group had rich contents with more details, including emotions, contexts, objects, and expressions.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose -- Writing is a difficult skill to master and improve, especially for students who learn English as a second language. Thus, this study explores the impact of employing graphic organizers on the writing performance of Form Four students and their knowledge retention. These students were 16year-olds at the time of study. Furthermore, the investigation delves into the perceptions of students on writing methods. Methodology -- This study employed a quasi-experimental design. The experimental group received instructions applying graphic organizers and the control group received instructions applying the conventional method. Pre-test, Post-test 1 and Post-test 2 were utilized to collect the data. The sample comprised 120 Form Four students chosen as intact groups from two schools, there were 60 students in each group. The study lasted for 11 weeks. One-way ANOVA and Repeated Measures were used to analyze the data collected from the Pre-test, Post-test 1 and Post-test 2, while the qualitative data gathered from the semi-structured interviews were investigated using thematic analysis for emerging themes. Findings -- The quantitative results indicate that the experimental group performed significantly better than students from the control group in their overall writing skills and retention of knowledge in writing. Findings from the qualitative data supported the quantitative findings which revealed that incorporating graphic organizers in writing boosted students' motivation in writing and facilitated their learning, especially in the domain of content, organization, elaboration of ideas, and language. Significance -- ESL teachers could use graphic organizers as an alternative method to improve students' writing skills. Teacher training should prepare teachers to use methods that effectively utilize graphic organizers in the writing process.",

    "Abstract": "Educational animation, recognized for its potential accessibility and engaging qualities, has become increasingly prevalent in classroom instruction. However, not all educational animations exhibit high quality or significantly enhance learning outcomes. This study addresses the need for optimizing educational animation design to enhance student learning outcomes and experiences, employing the construction-integration model. We developed three types of educational animations: subtitled textual cue (STC), keyword textual cue (KTC), and structured textual cue (CTC). Through a quasi-experimental research design, 257 fifth-grade students were assigned to three groups, each exposed to one type of textual cue. The results indicate that CTC leads to superior achievement, knowledge retention, higher self-efficacy, and the lowest cognitive load. In comparison, KTC demonstrates moderate results, while STC yields the poorest outcomes. Furthermore, there is a significant negative correlation between achievement and cognitive load, and a significant positive correlation between achievement and self-efficacy. Additionally, there is a significant positive correlation between the \"faded effect\" of knowledge retention and self-efficacy. These findings highlight the superior learning outcomes and experiences associated with CTC. Based on these findings, recommendations are provided for future educational animation design and instructional practices.",

    "Abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a transformative educational tool, enabling immersive learning environments that promote student engagement and understanding of complex concepts. However, despite the growing adoption of VR in education, there remains a significant gap in research exploring how generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as generative pretrained transformer can further enhance these experiences by reducing cognitive load and improving learning outcomes. This study examines the impact of an AI-driven instructor assistant in VR classrooms on student engagement, cognitive load, knowledge retention, and performance. A total of 52 participants were divided into two groups experiencing a VR lesson on the bubble sort algorithm, one with only a prescripted virtual instructor (control group), and the other with the addition of an AI instructor assistant (experimental group). Statistical analysis of postlesson quizzes and cognitive load assessments was conducted using independent t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the cognitive load being measured through a postexperiment questionnaire. The study results indicate that the experimental group reported significantly higher engagement compared to the control group. While the AI assistant did not significantly improve postlesson assessment scores, it enhanced conceptual knowledge transfer. The experimental group also demonstrated lower intrinsic cognitive load, suggesting the assistant reduced the perceived complexity of the material. Higher germane and general cognitive loads indicated that students were more invested in meaningful learning without feeling overwhelmed.",

    "Abstract": "This study compared an AI chatbot (Kimi) and a bilingual dictionary app (NCD) in supporting vocabulary tasks among Chinese junior English majors. Sixty-six participants used either Kimi or NCD to complete both receptive and productive lexical tasks. Questionnaires gathered user feedback on tool use, and a surprise retention test assessed long-term vocabulary retention one week later. Results showed that Kimi significantly outperformed NCD in vocabulary comprehension, collocation production, and productive knowledge retention. Additionally, Kimi demonstrated more consistent performance than NCD across all test items, highlighting its reliability. The study underscores the potential of AI chatbots to address language-related queries and enhance vocabulary acquisition. It also advocates for aligning technological advancements with pedagogical goals to optimize language learning tools and create a sustainable learning environment. Alternate abstract: In hierdie studie word 'n KI-kletsbot (Kimi) en 'n tweetalige woordeboektoepassing (NCD) vergelyk ten opsigte van die steun wat hulle aan Chinese junior studente met Engels as hoofvak in woordeskatopdragte bied. Ses-en-sestig deelnemers het óf Kimi óf NCD gebruik om beide reseptiewe en produktiewe leksikale opdragte te voltooi. Gebruikersterugvoer oor hulpmiddelgebruik is met behulp van vrae-lyste ingesamel, en 'n week later is die langtermynwoordeskatretensie in 'n onverwagse retensietoets bepaal. Die resultate het getoon dat Kimi beduidend beter as NCD in woordeskatbegrip, kolloka-sieproduksie en produktiewe kennisretensie gevaar het. Daarbenewens het Kimi in al die toets-items konsekwenter vertoon as NCD, wat die betroubaarheid van Kimi beklemtoon. Hierdie studie benadruk die potensiaal van KI-kletsbotte om taalverwante vrae te hanteer en om woordeskatver-werwing te verbeter. Dit bepleit ook die belyning van tegnologiese vooruitgang met pedagogiese doelwitte om hulpmiddels vir die aanleer van taal te optimaliseer en 'n volhoubare leeromgewing te skep.",

This study examines barriers to KM within the New Jersey Department of Education’s Office of Special Education (OSE) and evaluates the effectiveness of competency profiles in promoting knowledge-sharing behaviors to preserve institutional knowledge. Using a qualitative research approach, this study collected data through semi-structured interviews with OSE employees at various experience levels. Findings reveal that frequent leadership changes, employee turnover, and limited KM infrastructure create significant obstacles to knowledge retention. Participants identified both structural and cultural barriers, highlighting the need for leadership engagement, formalized knowledge-sharing mechanisms, and integration of KM strategies into hiring, training, and performance evaluations. This study contributes to the understanding of KM in the public sector by exploring strategies that enhance knowledge retention despite workforce transitions. Embedding KM practices into organizational culture through competency profiles and structured policies can mitigate knowledge loss and improve operational continuity. Recommendations include leveraging technology for knowledge transfer, fostering a culture of collaboration, and institutionalizing KM frameworks to ensure long-term sustainability.",

    "Abstract": "Background Adolescent pregnancy poses a significant health challenge for girls aged 15–19 in low- and middle-income countries. While gender transformative interventions (GTIs) aim to address this issue, a substantial research gap exists concerning the underlying mechanisms contributing to their success. This study employs a realist synthesis approach to systematically investigate how, why, for whom, and in what contexts GTIs effectively reduce adolescent pregnancy. Methods A five-step realist review examined literature from four databases and five organisational repositories, including published and grey literature. The review focused on GTIs for adolescents aged 10–19 in low- or middle-income countries. Narrative synthesis and realist analysis were used to develop context–mechanism–outcome configurations. Results The review analysed 28 documents covering 14 interventions and proposing eight programme theories across three settings. In the school, creating a supportive environment to foster positive social norms and providing a safe space was emphasised. Comprehensive sexual health education to promote critical thinking, knowledge retention, and goal setting was one of the key strategies. Empowering boys to adopt positive gender norms for behaviour change was also identified. In the health facility, providing a safe, supportive, and confidential environment for accessing services, as well as using digital health apps to empower adolescents in sexual reproductive health, were key. In the community, empowering girls through life skills and economic support and involving community members to foster stronger interpersonal bonds and a gender-positive environment were highlighted. These interventions led to increased contraceptive use, delayed marriage, and reduced adolescent pregnancy. Conclusion This realist synthesis proposes eight nuanced programme theories of successful GTIs, providing essential insights for developing, implementing, and improving future programmes. These findings offer a foundation for effective strategies to mitigate adolescent pregnancy in diverse socio-cultural contexts. Registration PROSPERO: CRD42023398293.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives : Involving patients in the preoperative anaesthetic assessment (PAA) process can improve their understanding of risks and contribute to better postoperative recovery and outcomes. The iPREDICT study aims to investigate the feasibility of using an interactive consultation tool (ICT) to improve patient awareness of anaesthesia-related risks. Methods : This prospective, single-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical study included patients scheduled for elective surgery under general or combined general and regional anaesthesia. Participants were randomly assigned to online anaesthesia risk education in the ICT group (intervention) or a control group that watched a video without anaesthetic risk content. Both groups received a face-to-face PAA and were assessed about anaesthetic risk knowledge after PAA and two days later. Results : A total of 373 participants were randomised, and 315 completed the assigned online module prior to their PAA. The proportion of male participants was higher (>60%). Most participants already had prior anaesthesia experience. After PAA, 243 patients completed the first risk recall #1 questionnaire, with the ICT group identifying significantly more correct risks than the control group (median 13.0 vs. 11.0, p < 0.05). In risk recall #2, conducted two days after the PAA, knowledge retention remained stable in the control group, while the experimental group showed further improvement (median 14.0 vs. 13.0, p < 0.05). Conclusions : Using the ICT significantly improved patients’ knowledge of anaesthesia-related risks. These results suggest that interactive patient education tools are a feasible and effective way to improve patients’ understanding of perioperative anaesthesia risks, potentially contributing to better outcomes, which needs to be addressed in future projects.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Nasal High-Flow Oxygen Therapy (NHFOT) is an evidence-based intervention that improves oxygenation and reduces hypoxemia in patients undergoing monitored anesthesia care (MAC). Despite NHFOT’s proven benefits, NHFOT remains underutilized in clinical practice due to gaps in provider education. This project aimed to assess the effectiveness of an educational intervention in increasing knowledge and likelihood of NHFOT adoption among Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) in New York State.  Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the impact of an educational workshop on NHFOT. A total of 44 participants were recruited, with 27 completed surveys included in the final analysis. Knowledge improvement was measured using paired t-tests, and the likelihood of NHFOT adoption was analyzed using Likert-scale responses. Results: The mean pre-test score was 5.67, which significantly improved to 8.89 postintervention ( p < 0.001), demonstrating a statistically significant knowledge gain. Trend analysis revealed a 100% increase in participants reporting they were “likely” or “very likely” to use NHFOT in practice. Reliability testing showed high internal consistency, while Cohen’s Kappa analysis suggested improvements resulting from actual learning rather than test familiarity. Conclusion: This project confirmed that a targeted educational intervention enhances NHFOT knowledge and increases its likelihood of use in practice. Findings supported the need for continued provider education to bridge the gap between evidence-based guidelines and clinical application. Future research should evaluate long-term knowledge retention and real-world adoption of NHFOT in anesthesia care settings.",

    "Abstract": "This secondary research analysis explored the effectiveness of the Reducing the Risk (RTR) curriculum (Barth, 2015) with a population of queer youth. RTR is an evidence-based curriculum designed to decrease adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). During the 2017-2018 academic year, a public university implemented the RTR curriculum in urban municipalities in a northeastern U.S. state with high rates of adolescent births and STIs. The study included a group of 9th and 10th grade high school students, encompassing those who self-identified as queer. This secondary research analysis utilized data from the original study, and focused on the impact of perceived respect during the RTR implementation on the curriculum outcome objectives (i.e., fostering sexual health knowledge and influencing sexual behavior) among queer youth who perceived respect compared to queer youth who did not perceive respect and cisgender/heterosexual (cishet) youth. While perceived respect did not emerge as a statistically significant factor in influencing behavioral curriculum objectives, significant differences in knowledge acquisition were observed. Specifically, queer youth who perceived respect demonstrated statistically significant knowledge gains, from pre-test to post-test, suggesting that perceived respect may enhance learning in the short term. However, these gains diminished by the 3 – month follow up, indicating a need for continued reinforcement to sustain knowledge retention over time. However, queer youth who did not perceive respect also exhibited knowledge gains immediately after the curriculum, though these gains were not retained at a follow up. When comparing queer youth who perceived respect with cishet youth, both groups achieved similar post scores gains, but cishet youth showed a marginally significant trend toward better long-term retention at the 3 month follow up, suggesting that while perceived respect fosters immediate learning acquisition, additional support may be needed for sustained retention among queer youth.

    "Abstract": "This paper presents an evaluation of the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) as a training tool for electricians working in high-risk environments within the energy infrastructure sector. A study was conducted involving 124 participants, divided into four groups, to compare the outcomes of VR-based training, traditional training, and a combination of both methods. The Virtual Electrician Training system, a comprehensive VR platform featuring realistic 3D models and interactive scenarios, was used to simulate real-world tasks. Results indicate that participants who received VR training followed by traditional training demonstrated the highest knowledge retention and skill acquisition, suggesting that VR is an effective introductory training tool. The study also identified challenges such as user discomfort and varying ease of use, highlighting the need for further refinement of VR systems. The findings support the integration of VR into technical training programs, with potential benefits including improved safety, enhanced learning outcomes, and cost savings. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the application of VR in industrial training and offers insights into optimizing training sequences for maximum effectiveness.",

    "Abstract": "Conference Title: 2025 International Conference on Emerging Smart Computing and Informatics (ESCI) Conference Start Date: 2025 March 5 Conference End Date: 2025 March 7 Conference Location: Pune, India When incremental learning models encounter new classes, they often experience what is referred to as catastrophic forgetting, wherein previously learned information is lost during the training on new data. This happens for the following reason where deep learning models are expensive to compute and necessitate significant replay of memory, this is very relevant when it involves large datasets, such as those in the case of CIFAR-10. This work introduces a novel method called Weight Space Rotation that aims to improve recall and expedite adaptation in learning new classes by strategically modifying the model's weight space to reduce interference between previously learned and incoming knowledge. WSR does this efficiently without requiring storing earlier examples and is therefore efficient and scalable. Experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset show that the WSR-enhanced model outperforms conventional techniques in class-incremental learning. WSR achieves this through the allocation of discrete regions in the weight space to different classes, thus enhancing knowledge retention and reducing catastrophic forgetting. This also enhances scalability and reduces computational load as it simplifies regularization processes. The results indicate that WSR significantly enhances the model's capability to learn rapidly new classes in incremental settings while retaining long-term knowledge. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, this approach integrates WSR into the training pipeline of a standard CNN architecture, successfully adapting to new classes while maintaining knowledge of previously learned ones. Experiments confirm that the WSR-enhanced model surpasses current systems by achieving better retention of prior knowledge and faster adaptation to new classes, thereby enhancing performance in class-incremental scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge sharing among academic staff allows universities to foster innovation and achieve competitiveness in the higher education industry. Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, this study developed an integrated model to investigate the impact of individual motivation on academics' attitudes and intentions to share knowledge, incorporating both perceived costs (loss of knowledge power, time and effort) as well as benefits (expected association, enjoyment in helping others) associated with knowledge sharing. Data was collected from 532 faculty staff in higher education institutions in China through an online questionnaire and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The findings indicated that loss of knowledge power as well as time and effort negatively impacted academics' attitudes toward knowledge sharing while expected association and enjoyment in helping others positively impacted attitudes. Additionally, attitudes significantly contribute to enhancing academics' intentions to share knowledge. The study contributes to the extant literature by highlighting the hindering role of perceived costs in developing positive attitudes toward knowledge sharing which have not been empirically verified in previous studies. In addition, the study provided recommendations on how knowledge sharing can be encouraged among academics by minimizing costs while maximizing benefits associated with knowledge sharing.",

    "Abstract": "Immersive learning is predominantly constrained to technology-based interventions but has the potential for more diverse applications. This study reports on an experiment investigating the learning affordances of psychological immersion evoked by narrative absorption. A total of 228 participants were randomly assigned to one of three forms of media, an image, a word list, and a narrative, all of which contained identical items to be memorized for immediate and delayed free recall memory tests. Other variables measured were immersion, extraneous cognitive load, and mental imagery. ANOVA and correlation analyses showed that the narrative media was found to be significantly more immersive and that it evoked mental imagery in individuals at higher levels than both the list and image media. Importantly, there was more decay in memory recall between immediate and delayed tests for those exposed to the list and the image than for those who read the narrative. This implies the utility of immersive narratives for spontaneous mental image generation, which leads to improved knowledge retention. Other implications for immersive learning theory are discussed, and practical solutions for incorporating narrative immersion in learning are also suggested.",

    "Abstract": "Background Mexico is one of the countries with the highest cultural, biological, and agrobiological diversity. However, an accelerated process of ancestral knowledge loss, related to the management of agrobiodiversity, native seeds, and other edible plant species management is affecting food sovereignty. This process of knowledge loss was documented at the Ñäñho region, of southern Querétaro, where our study took place. Our objective was to document the diversity of edible plant diversity, management, and use as well as the agroecosystems from which they are obtained. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted over 2 years (2021–2023) with 50 informants selected through a snowball sampling. Informal interviews and participant observations were also used with these and other people from the same community. Herbarium specimens and seed accessions were collected and photographed. Results In total, 119 edible plant species were identified. The richest families were Solanaceae, Rosaceae, Cactaceae, and Asteraceae. The edible species occur in 11 agroecosystems with 58.6% of the species native to Mexico, and 41.4% introduced. The orchard, rustic greenhouse, house “milpa,” mountain hill, and backyard, have the highest species diversity. The main management types were sowing and gathering plants. Eighty-five plant names were recorded in the Hñäñho language. The plant parts used were fruits (60.5%) and stems (46.2%). The gastronomic categories with the highest species percentage were stews, beverages, and refreshments, while the highest species number used in the gastronomic categories were cacti stalks or “nopales” ( Opuntia spp.), maize ( Zea mays ), and amaranth ( Amaranthus spp.). Conclusions The records in Southern Querétaro of edible plants and agroecosystems diversity were high. The plants, local knowledge documentation, and species management provide the basis for promoting projects focused on the Ñäñho biocultural wealth. Efforts are needed to encourage the least represented regional species. Community development programs are needed for food security and sovereignty; these are based on the local biocultural resources.",

    "Abstract": "Background Effective patient education is critical in enhancing treatment outcomes and reducing anxiety in dental procedures. This study compares the effectiveness of AI-generated educational materials with traditional methods in improving patient comprehension and reducing anxiety during endodontic and restorative dental treatments. Methods A cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted with 100 participants undergoing restorative or endodontic procedures. Patients were randomized into two groups: those receiving AI-generated instructional materials (via ChatGPT) and those receiving traditional education (verbal explanations and pamphlets). Baseline knowledge and post-intervention knowledge retention were assessed using structured tests. Patient perceptions of clarity, usefulness, comprehensiveness, trust, and anxiety were measured using Likert-scale surveys. Three dental experts evaluated the educational content for accuracy and suitability. Statistical analysis included t-tests and Cohen’s kappa to measure inter-rater reliability. Results AI-generated materials significantly outperformed traditional methods in all measured dimensions, including clarity (4.42 vs. 3.25), usefulness (4.63 vs. 3.50), comprehensiveness (4.50 vs. 3.29), trust (4.00 vs. 2.96), and anxiety reduction (mean anxiety score: 2.63 vs. 3.38, p  < 0.001). Pre- and post-intervention knowledge assessments revealed substantial knowledge improvement in the AI group. Expert evaluations confirmed the accuracy and suitability of AI-generated materials, with high inter-rater reliability (κ = 0.75, p  < 0.001). Conclusions AI-generated educational materials demonstrate superior effectiveness in improving patient comprehension and reducing anxiety compared to traditional methods. Their integration into dental practice could enhance patient satisfaction and streamline the educational process, particularly for complex or anxiety-inducing procedures. Future research should explore their application in diverse dental specialties and assess long-term impacts on patient behavior and clinical outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "In the scenario of class-incremental learning (CIL), deep neural networks have to adapt their model parameters to non-stationary data distributions, e.g., the emergence of new classes over time. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, typical CIL methods either cumulatively store exemplars of old classes for retraining model parameters from scratch or progressively expand model size as new classes arrive, which, however, compromises their practical value due to little attention paid to parameter efficiency . In this paper, we contribute a novel solution, effective control of the parameters of a well-trained model, by the synergy between two complementary learning subnetworks. Specifically, we integrate one plastic feature extractor and one analytical feed-forward classifier into a unified framework amenable to streaming data. In each CIL session, it achieves non-overwritten parameter updates in a cost-effective manner, neither revisiting old task data nor extending previously learned networks; Instead, it accommodates new tasks by attaching a tiny set of declarative parameters to its backbone, in which only one matrix per task or one vector per class is kept for knowledge retention. Experimental results on a variety of task sequences demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art CIL approaches, especially in accuracy gain, knowledge transfer, training efficiency, and task-order robustness. Furthermore, a graceful forgetting implementation on previously learned trivial tasks is empirically investigated to make its non-growing backbone (i.e., a model with limited network capacity) suffice to train on more incoming tasks.",

    "Abstract": "While handwritten notes offer valuable insights into students’ knowledge retention, traditional analysis methods are often time-consuming and limited in scope. This study introduces an efficient approach for educational data analysis by combining image segmentation with generative AI to extract learning insights from students’ handwritten notes. Leveraging the Attention Multi-task U-Net for accurate segmentation and GPT-4o for content analysis, our method precisely identifies and categorizes text, charts, and formulas within notes. The extracted data provides educators with a detailed view of students’ knowledge retention, highlights the areas students focus on, and identifies critical knowledge points that may be missing from notes. Our experiments on student notes from a Digital Signal Processing course demonstrate the method’s high accuracy and significant efficiency improvements in teachers’ review of student notes. This research contributes to educational technology and data mining by introducing an automated, scalable method that supports more personalized and effective educational strategies.",

However, this transition has also presented challenges in maintaining student engagement and fostering interactive learning environments. This paper explores the transformative potential of gamification as a tool to enhance student engagement in virtual classrooms. By integrating game-based elements such as rewards, leaderboards, challenges, and interactive simulations, gamification creates a dynamic and immersive learning experience. The study examines the psychological and pedagogical foundations of gamification, emphasizing its ability to stimulate intrinsic motivation, promote active participation, and improve knowledge retention. Case studies and empirical data from diverse educational settings highlight the effectiveness of gamified strategies in virtual learning environments. Moreover, the paper discusses the challenges of implementing gamification, including potential over-reliance on extrinsic rewards and the need for tailored approaches to meet diverse learner needs. The findings underscore the importance of designing gamified virtual classrooms that balance educational rigor with engaging, student-centered experiences. Ultimately, this research advocates for a thoughtful integration of gamification as a key strategy to enhance learning outcomes and reimagine the future of digital education.",

    "Abstract": "Multi-instance learning (MIL) is a widely applied technique in practical applications that involve complex data structures. MIL can be broadly categorized into two types: traditional methods and those based on deep learning. These approaches have yielded significant results, especially regarding their problem-solving strategies and experiment validation, providing valuable insights for researchers in the MIL field. However, considerable knowledge is often trapped within the algorithm, leading to subsequent MIL algorithms that rely solely on the model’s data fitting to predict unlabeled samples. This results in a significant loss of knowledge and impedes the development of more powerful models. In this article, we propose a novel data-driven knowledge fusion for deep MIL (DKMIL) algorithm. DKMIL adopts a completely different idea from existing deep MIL methods by analyzing the decision-making of key samples in the dataset (referred to as the data-driven) and using the knowledge fusion module designed to extract valuable information from these samples to assist the model’s learning. In other words, this module serves as a new interface between data and the model, providing strong scalability and enabling prior knowledge from existing algorithms to enhance the model’s learning ability. Furthermore, to adapt the downstream modules of the model to more knowledge-enriched features extracted from the data-driven knowledge fusion (DDKF) module, we propose a two-level attention (TLA) module that gradually learns shallow- and deep-level features of the samples to achieve more effective classification. We will prove the scalability of the knowledge fusion module and verify the efficiency of the proposed architecture by conducting experiments on 62 datasets across five categories.",

    "Abstract": "Task-incremental learning methods that adopt knowledge distillation face two significant challenges: confidence bias and knowledge loss. These challenges make it difficult to effectively balance the stability and plasticity of the network in the incremental learning process. In this article, we propose double confidence calibration focused distillation (DCCFD) to address these challenges. We introduce intratask and intertask confidence calibration (ECC) modules that can mitigate network overconfidence during incremental learning and reduce the degree of feature representation bias. We also propose a focused distillation (FD) module that can alleviate the problem of knowledge loss during the task increment process, improving model stability without reducing plasticity. Experimental results on the CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and CORE-50 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, with performance that matches or exceeds the state of the art. Furthermore, our method can be used as a plug-and-play module to consistently improve class-incremental learning methods.",

While machine learning serves as a crucial tool for processing complex medical data, the effective application of its techniques remains a significant challenge. Therefore, the “Medical Data Mining” course is designed to cultivate students' theoretical and practical skills in biomedical engineering. Current pedagogical practices are hindered by excessive teacher dominance and insufficient student interaction. To address these issues, this study introduces generative artificial intelligence technologies and interactive teaching models, integrated with the BOPPPS instructional design framework. This approach is designed to stimulate deep thinking, enhance student engagement and knowledge retention, and foster the development of critical and creative thinking skills among learners.",

    "Abstract": "In the last four years, COVID-19 has prompted concerns about children's well-being. While children's physical health may not be severely affected, their psychological well-being is a significant concern. Therefore, we developed an interdisciplinary psychoeducational intervention program for children named CARTOON. The study aimed to assess whether CARTOON helps kindergarten children to better adhere to mandatory hygiene measures, while also investigating its potential to reduce children's anxiety. Background In the last four years, COVID-19 has prompted concerns about children's well-being. While children's physical health may not be severely affected, their psychological well-being is a significant concern. Therefore, we developed an interdisciplinary psychoeducational intervention program for children named CARTOON. The study aimed to assess whether CARTOON helps kindergarten children to better adhere to mandatory hygiene measures, while also investigating its potential to reduce children's anxiety.A randomized controlled trial was conducted from January and June 2021 in two Viennese kindergartens involving 53 children aged 3-6 years. Children were randomized into an intervention (specific psychoeducational program) and a control group (routine hygiene practices). CARTOON comprised five sessions covering key hygiene and COVID-19 awareness aspects, facilitated by trained staff. Primary outcomes included changes in children's emotional state and knowledge about COVID-19 and hygiene measures. Secondary outcomes assessed CARTOON's long-term impact on knowledge retention and emotional well-being.

Children were randomized into an intervention (specific psychoeducational program) and a control group (routine hygiene practices). CARTOON comprised five sessions covering key hygiene and COVID-19 awareness aspects, facilitated by trained staff. Primary outcomes included changes in children's emotional state and knowledge about COVID-19 and hygiene measures. Secondary outcomes assessed CARTOON's long-term impact on knowledge retention and emotional well-being.Children in the intervention group showed increased COVID-19 knowledge from baseline to long-term assessment (3.9 ± 2.4 vs. 5.9 ± 2.0, p  = .003). Moreover, children in the intervention group demonstrated significantly improved long-term hygiene knowledge compared to baseline (8.2 ± 2.2 vs. 5.9 ± 2.3, p  < 0.001). Additionally, anxiety scores significantly decreased in the intervention group post-intervention compared to baseline (2.2 ± 1.7 vs. 5.6 ± 2.5; p  = .01). Regression analysis identified higher age, higher maternal education, and lower family mental stress as knowledge acquisition predictors.

    "Abstract": "Software projects often face developer turnover for various reasons. Since develop-ers are key sources of knowledge in these projects, their absence inevitably leads to some degree of knowledge loss. The Bus Factor (BF) is a metric used to assess the impact of this knowledge loss on a project’s continuity. Traditionally, BF is defined as the smallest group of developers whose departure would result in a loss of more than half of the project’s knowledge. Current state-of-the-art methods calculate developers’ knowledge based on the number of files they have authored, using data from version control systems (VCS). However, numerous studies have highlighted that not all files in software projects hold the same level of significance. In this study, we investigate the impact of weighting files based on their significance on the performance of two widely used BF estimators. Significance scores are calculated using five established graph metrics derived from the project’s De-pendency Graph: PageRank, In-/Out-/All-Degree, and Betweenness Centralities. Additionally, we introduce BFSig, a prototype implementing our approach. Lastly, we present a new dataset featuring BF scores reported by software practitioners from five prominent GitHub repositories. Our findings show that BFSig surpasses the baseline methods, achieving up to an 18% reduction in Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE). Additionally, BFSig reduces False Negatives by 18%when identifying potential risks linked to low BF. Furthermore, our respondents validated BFSig’s versatility, highlighting its capability to evaluate the BF of individual project subfolders. In conclusion, we believe that when estimating BF from authorship, software components of greater significance should be given higher weight.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Medicinal plant resources are rich in bioactive compounds that can be utilized to develop contemporary drugs for treating various ailments [1]. Since ancient times, medicinal herbs (MHs) have been traditionally used by different ethnic groups as a source of medication to manage multiple human health issues. [...]regrettably, like in other countries such as India [21, 22], Kenya [23], and Namibia [24], information on their traditional medicine of the Luguru has been dominated by oral tradition rather than documentation of the data for sustainability [25, 26]. [...]given the present deforestation rate, biodiversity loss, increasing urbanization, and disinterest of the young generation, accurate documentation of medicinal plants and associated traditional healing practices is paramount, as it is essential to try to circumvent the loss of knowledge by preserving information on useful MHs. [...]the required informant size was 100: (2)n=1331+133 0.052=99.8≈100. [...]among the selected informants were traditional healers (76%) and elders (24%), who are the custodians of information related to the application of MHs. 2.3.",

This study explores the impact of PA appearance and knowledge delivery methods on student learning in IVR environments. The findings reveal that the flying robot PA is regarded as the most credible, while cute creature PAs increase motivation but cause some distraction. The integrated text and audio multi-modality approach resulted in the best knowledge retention, though some participants experienced a slower learning pace. These insights are significant for designing and using PAs in IVR educational settings.",

    "Abstract": "Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) prioritizes system design through models rather than documents, and it is implemented with the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), which is the state-of-the-art language in academia and industry. Virtual Reality (VR), an immersive visualization technology, can simulate reality in virtual environments with varying degrees of fidelity. In recent years, the technology industry has invested substantially in the development of head-mounted displays (HMDs) and related virtual reality (VR) technologies. Various research has suggested that VR-based immersive design reviews enhance system issue/fault identification, collaboration, focus, and presence compared to non-immersive approaches. Additionally, several research efforts have demonstrated that the VR environment provides higher understanding and knowledge retention levels than traditional approaches. In recent years, multiple attempts have been made to visualize conventional 2D SysML diagrams in a virtual reality environment. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no empirical evaluation has been performed to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of visualizing SysML diagrams in a VR environment. Hence, the authors aimed to evaluate four key benefit types and drawbacks through experiments with human subjects. The authors chose four benefit types—Systems Understanding, Information Sharing, Modeling and Training Experience, and Digital Twin based on the MBSE value and benefits review performed by researchers and benefits claimed by the evaluations for similar visual formalism languages. Experiments were conducted to compare the understanding, interaction, and knowledge retention for 3D VR and conventional 2D SysML diagrams. The authors chose a ground-based telescope system as the system of interest (SOI) for system modeling. The authors utilized a standalone wireless HMD unit for a virtual reality experience, which enabled experiments to be conducted irrespective of location. Students and experts from multiple disciplines, including systems engineering, participated in the experiment and provided their opinions on the VR SysML implementation. The knowledge test, perceived evaluation results, and post-completion surveys were analyzed to determine whether the 3D VR SysML implementation improved these benefits and identified potential drawbacks. The authors utilized a few VR scenario efficacy measures, namely the Simulation Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and System Usability Scale (SUS), to avoid evaluation design-related anomalies.",

    "Abstract": "With diabetes reaching epidemic proportions globally, it is imperative to increase the number of providers equipped to screen, educate, and help patients achieve glycemic control. This study evaluated the long-term results of student pharmacists attending a first-year Diabetes Self-Care Education Program (DSEP) by measuring knowledge retention, confidence, and clinical applicability of skills learned over time. The DSEP, integrated into the early pharmacy curriculum, is a 9-h training program made up of interactive lectures, glucose monitoring assignments, and active-learning workshops. Following DSEP training, two cohorts of first-year student pharmacists were surveyed annually for 3 and 5 years to assess knowledge retention, confidence, and clinical use of the DSEP content in their practice sites. By the year 1 follow-up survey, the response rate from the pre-survey period for cohort 1 was 88% and 78% for cohort 2; over time, the response rate decreased. For the long-term follow-up surveys, cohort 1 (5 years) and cohort 2 (3 years) demonstrated overall significantly improved sustained knowledge of diabetes (48% higher average test score, p < 0.001), perceived confidence, and clinical ability (over 60% and 76% increases from baseline, p < 0.001). Within 12 months of completing the DSEP, about two-thirds of students applied their training to assist patients with diabetes and their caregivers. Long-term, participants in both cohorts reported educating and screening over 22,000 patients with diabetes and caregivers in multiple clinical settings over 3 years and 5 years, respectively, following DSEP training. The positive impact of improved knowledge, confidence, and clinical applicability of the DSEP training obtained by student pharmacists was sustained for 3 or more years, impacting thousands of patients with diabetes and caregivers. Considering the growing global diabetes epidemic, pharmacy schools around the world should consider implementing an early DSEP program.",

    "Abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) In this step of education: make learning more accessible and enjoyable. This paper aims to explore the implications of AR interfaces for education, highlighting their potential applications for student engagement, knowledge retention, and individualized instruction. The combination of real-time interaction and gamification with spatial visualization enable AR to create active learning environments that can cater to diverse preferences of cognition (Akçayır & Akçayır, 2016). Together, these recent studies (2020–2024) compile a literature review, presenting collective evidence for utility across a wide range of disciplines including STEM education, medical training, and collaborative learning environments, and beyond. This technological development has been underlined by factors such as improved motivation among students, better test scores, and practical experiential learning, illustrating the transformative nature of AR in contemporary education. The research also highlights challenges around technological limitations and cost barriers and recommends solutions for scalable AR integration in classrooms. The work herein will help provide a foundation to build off for future research, curriculum, and practical AR applications across educational institutions internationally.",

    "Abstract": "In an era where digital distractions dominate the attention of younger generations, the educational sector faces significant challenges in maintaining student engagement and improving learning outcomes. This article explores the integration of edutainment and gamification as transformative approaches that merge entertainment with education, presenting new possibilities for both educators and learners. Edutainment leverages multimedia and interactive platforms to make learning enjoyable and accessible, while gamification uses game-based elements to enhance knowledge retention, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. The benefits of these methods are manifold, offering personalized learning environments, fostering collaboration, and promoting creativity. However, the challenges of digital literacy, infrastructure limitations, and the need for balanced game design pose significant hurdles. An educator’s struggle starts with a facility of digital laboratories, grant acceptance for the generated idea, checking feasibility and applicability, digital literacy, designing a gamified curriculum, and sharing educational asset platforms. This paper also addresses future prospects, emphasizing the growing importance of these techniques in shaping the educational landscape of tomorrow.",

    "Abstract": "The integration of technology into physical education (PE) has grown significantly in recent years, aiming to enhance student engagement, learning outcomes, and long-term adherence to physical activity. This study aims to critically examine the impact of technology-enhanced pedagogy in PE by reviewing the latest research on digital tools used in teaching and learning. Specifically, it explores how these technologies affect student engagement, knowledge retention, motor skill development, and self-regulated learning. Additionally, it seeks to identify potential barriers and strategies for optimizing their implementation in PE curricula. This study conducts a literature review, applying thematic analysis to categorize findings into key areas such as wearable technology, gamification, virtual and augmented reality, and artificial intelligence in physical education. Focused on the literature published between 2010 and 2025, it was conducted using academic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Finally, 151 articles were selected involving data extraction and qualitative synthesis of findings. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed empirical studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that investigated the application of technology in PE. The findings suggest that integrating technology into PE enhances motivation, engagement, motor skills, tactical understanding, and cognitive learning. However, issues such as digital inequality, lack of teacher training, and ethical concerns regarding student data collection pose significant challenges to widespread adoption. Also, this review identifies critical gaps and ethical considerations in the use of technology in PE, offering practical recommendations for its effective integration. Technology-enhanced pedagogy in PE offers numerous advantages, but its success depends on proper implementation, adequate teacher training, and equitable access to resources. However, this study is limited by the variability of methodologies across the reviewed studies, which may impact the generalizability of the findings.",

    "Abstract": "Human development education often relies on traditional, lecture-based teaching methods, thus limiting opportunities for active engagement. The lack of diverse creative and active teaching approaches hinders psychology students’ ability to fully understand and apply complex concepts. This study examined the effectiveness of a designed series of board games to enhance understanding of infant development and surveillance among psychology students. A mixed-method approach using a randomized matched control group design and qualitative exploration was applied. In the experiment, there were two groups, intervention and conventional learning, in three data collection phases. A design involving 60 students (30 in each group) was employed. The qualitative exploration involved the completion of a weekly journal to explore the students’ learning experiences when playing board games. A 2 × 3 mixed-design Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with content analysis of the journal texts was performed. The results revealed that the created board games significantly enhanced students’ understanding, with them achieving significantly higher understanding scores in the posttest and follow-up phases in learning development progress. An interaction effect for the treatments and test phases was also noted. Meanwhile, the qualitative findings complemented and reinforced the quantitative results, offering deeper insights into the learning experiences and valuable suggestions for improving the design and rules of the games. In conclusion, by tailoring the board games to learning objectives associated with infant developmental psychology, educators can enhance student engagement, knowledge retention, and real-classroom application.",

    "Abstract": "The few-shot object detection (FSOD) in remote sensing (RS) faces a fundamental challenge in balancing contextual feature learning with the representation stability. Current approaches either excel at capturing rich contextual relationships through multimodal architectures but struggle with catastrophic forgetting or maintain stable feature representations through incremental learning frameworks at the cost of contextual understanding. This limitation is particularly acute in RS, where complex spatial-contextual dependencies form distinctive co-occurrence patterns important for accurate object detection. We present a memory-augmented detection transformer (MemDeT) that bridges this gap through three key modules: 1) a contextual layerwise fusion (CLF) module that progressively integrates visual and textual information across transformer layers through an adaptive attention mechanism and unified cross-modal fusion, enabling both fine-grained object feature extraction at lower layers and abstract contextual relationship learning at higher layers; 2) a unified episodic memory (UEM) that serves as a dynamic knowledge repository, employing similarity-surprise-based update mechanisms with structured key-value memory organization to strategically retrieve and update relevant past experiences while preserving base knowledge through contextual scoring and dynamic retrieval; and 3) a memory-augmented decoder (MAD) that generates context-aware queries by combining current visual observations with accumulated contextual knowledge through memory-prioritized attention and progressive query refinement. Extensive experiments on RS datasets, NWPU VHR-10, DIOR, and iSAID, demonstrate that MemDeT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both contextual understanding and knowledge retention. Cross-dataset evaluation further validates MemDeT’s robust generalization capabilities, successfully transferring knowledge from DIOR to iSAID’s urban scenes, particularly in scenarios requiring strong contextual understanding with limited training examples.",

    "Abstract": "Contribution: An innovative approach utilizing interactive software paired with stereoscopic projection hardware is introduced to enhance the teaching and learning of solid-state physics. This method is distinctive for its integration of complex 3-D visualizations directly into classroom instruction, facilitating a deeper understanding of abstract concepts through interactive engagement.Background: This study is motivated by the challenges faced in teaching abstract concepts in a solid-state physics course, such as the energy band theory and Bravais lattices, to undergraduate students. Traditional teaching methods, such as blackboard teaching, or PowerPoint presentations often fail to adequately address these complexities, leading to a significant learning gap. This gap underlines the necessity for innovative educational tools that can bridge theoretical knowledge with practical understanding, applicable globally across educational programs.Intended Outcomes: The primary outcomes targeted by this approach include improved student engagement and learning efficacy, enhanced comprehension and retention of complex physics concepts, and better transfer of theoretical knowledge to practical applications.Application and Evaluation Experiment Design: The teaching tool integrates MATLAB-based interactive software with hardware utilizing the “Pepper Ghost” technique for 3-D stereoscopic visualization. This approach aims to foster an interactive and engaging learning environment, allowing complex physics concepts to be visualized intuitively. Assessment of learning effectiveness is carried out through the design of targeted questions, participant recruitment, and statistical analysis of questionnaire responses.Findings: Noticeable improvements in performance on both retention questions and transfer questions are observed, indicating that students exposed to this new teaching approach benefit in knowledge retention and application compared to those who experienced traditional teaching methods. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the integrated teaching tool in enhancing teaching outcomes in physics, suggesting its potential broad applicability in other fields.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Gatekeeper training (GKT) programs improve knowledge and self-efficacy in suicide prevention, but the sustainability of these improvements is uncertain. While booster sessions are suggested to enhance retention, existing research is inconclusive. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of booster sessions in the LifeKeepers GKT program for maintaining long-term knowledge and self-efficacy at 6 months post-training. Method: A total of 1,732 participants who had completed LifeKeepers GKT were randomly assigned to one of three trial groups, an intervention (booster), control (training as usual), or attention control group. Participants completed measures of knowledge and self-efficacy at 3, 6, and 12 months and reported their frequency of interventions and referrals at 3 and 6 months. Results: No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of knowledge retention, self-efficacy, or behavior change at any follow-up point. However, sustained improvements were observed across all groups. Limitations: Ceiling effects and attrition may have influenced the findings. Conclusion: Booster sessions did not significantly enhance knowledge, self-efficacy, or behavior outcomes. All groups demonstrated sustained improvements, but ceiling effects and attrition caution against overinterpreting the findings. Further research is needed to explore effective strategies for long-term retention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "Background: Gatekeeper training (GKT) programs improve knowledge and self-efficacy in suicide prevention, but the sustainability of these improvements is uncertain. While booster sessions are suggested to enhance retention, existing research is inconclusive. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of booster sessions in the LifeKeepers GKT program for maintaining long-term knowledge and self-efficacy at 6 months post-training. Method: A total of 1,732 participants who had completed LifeKeepers GKT were randomly assigned to one of three trial groups, an intervention (booster), control (training as usual), or attention control group. Participants completed measures of knowledge and self-efficacy at 3, 6, and 12 months and reported their frequency of interventions and referrals at 3 and 6 months. Results: No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of knowledge retention, self-efficacy, or behavior change at any follow-up point. However, sustained improvements were observed across all groups. Limitations: Ceiling effects and attrition may have influenced the findings. Conclusion: Booster sessions did not significantly enhance knowledge, self-efficacy, or behavior outcomes. All groups demonstrated sustained improvements, but ceiling effects and attrition caution against overinterpreting the findings. Further research is needed to explore effective strategies for long-term retention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "Metacognition plays an essential role in self-regulated learning, encompassing students’ ability to monitor and effectively self-assess their performance on learning tasks with accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks substantial evidence from longitudinal studies regarding the development of students’ metacognitive abilities and neural mechanisms over time, particularly within STEM education. Across three interrelated studies, this dissertation addresses gaps in research on metacognition and its neural bases in life sciences students. The first study employs Rasch models to quantify undergraduates’ metacognitive calibration in evaluating biological models, examining the alignment between accuracy and confidence in error detection. This study investigates how metacognitive monitoring strategies influence calibration and contributes to refining the measurement of metacognition in biology. The second study investigates the relationship between metacognitive calibration and brain activity during model evaluation using fMRI, emphasizing the neural underpinnings of metacognition in STEM learning. The third study explores the longitudinal development of metacognition among STEM students, focusing on self-monitoring and error detection processes. This explanatory convergent mixed methods study examines the complicated relationships among metacognitive strategies, knowledge retention, and neural mechanisms associated with self-monitoring and error detection. Together, these studies contribute to a fuller understanding of metacognition and its implications for learning in STEM education, offering practical strategies to assist educators in enhancing students’ metacognitive abilities and problem-solving skills in STEM disciplines.",

    "Abstract": "The potential of serious games to improve students' engagement and knowledge retention in design historical education has gained significant attention in recent years. This study proposes a learning strategy integrating AI virtual characters into a role-playing serious game designed to teach design history. Utilizing the Arts and Crafts Movement as the narrative foundation, the game employs AI-driven characters to provide adaptive guidance, interactive storytelling, and personalized feedback. A quasi-experimental design was adopted with two groups of college students (N = 60): an experimental group using the AI-supported game and a control group playing the same game without AI integration. Results show that the inclusion of AI virtual characters significantly enhances students' engagement and knowledge acquisition compared to the traditional game. These findings highlight the potential of AI-powered serious games to transform historical education by fostering active participation and deep learning.",

    "Abstract": "The integration of Extended Reality (XR) technologies into Industry 5.0 offers innovative solutions for industrial training by overcoming the limitations of traditional methods, such as high costs, inefficiencies, and production disruptions. These technologies enable immersive and scalable training environments, providing workers with hands-on experience while minimizing risks and resource constraints. This study presents an XR-based training platform designed to enhance workforce skills in health and safety, robotic system operations, and maintenance through immersive Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) scenarios. Evaluated by 22 participants from diverse professional backgrounds, the platform achieved a 50% reduction in training time compared to conventional methods, while significantly improving skill acquisition and task efficiency. Participants rated immersive VR environments highly (4.4/5) for engagement and knowledge retention, with usability and instructions also scoring positively (4/5). Scenario-based performance showed the average scores in health and safety tasks (72 points), while robotic system operations (60 points) and maintenance (54 points) reflected increasing task complexity. Despite moderate cognitive demands, the platform effectively balanced mental effort with engagement, providing an accessible and effective training experience. These findings underscore the potential of XR technologies to transform industrial training by enhancing efficiency, safety, and scalability, aligning with the evolving needs of Industry 5.0.",

    "Abstract": "Hiring managers in the automotive manufacturing industry have consistently faced high turnover rates compared to other sectors, prompting efforts to understand the factors influencing employees' intention to leave. Recognizing the impact of turnover on profitability and knowledge retention, these managers require deeper insights into the underlying relationships to develop effective mitigation strategies. Grounded in Herzberg's motivation-hygiene theory, the purpose of this quantitative correlational study was to examine the relationship between interpersonal relationships, recognition, and turnover intention. The participants consisted of 155 first-line supervisors within the automotive industry in the Midwest United States who responded to the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire Recognition Subscale, Workplace Friendship Scale, and six-item Turnover Intention Scale. The results of the multiple linear regression were statistically significant, F(2,141) = 14, p < .001, R2 = .154. In the final model, one predictor, recognition, was statistically significant (B = -0.403, t = -4.058, p < 0.001). A key recommendation is for business leaders to consider employee recognition when designing initiatives to reduce turnover intention. The potential implications of positive social change include enhanced employee retention, which may lead to higher wages and increased income tax revenues. These financial gains could, in turn, bolster funding for local social programs and infrastructure, benefiting communities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "This Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) project focused on enhancing provider knowledge and supporting the integration of FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology in a family medicine and occupational health clinic. A gap in provider understanding of CGM technology and its role in diabetes management was identified. The intervention targeted a diverse group, including medical assistants, management, clerical staff, occupational health specialists, and medical providers. A pre-and post-education knowledge assessment was conducted, and results showed an increase in provider understanding. The pre-intervention average score was 76.52 (SD = 2.64), which increased to 98 (SD = 3.34) post-intervention. While the paired-samples t test did not achieve statistical significance t (13) = 0.92, p = .37), the increase in competency and confidence highlighted the value of CGM education. These findings emphasize the need for ongoing training to enhance competency and promote evidence-based diabetes management. Expanding CGM education has the potential to improve patient outcomes, address healthcare disparities, and increase access to advanced diabetes care. By promoting equitable access to CGM technology, this project contributes to positive social change, ensuring that all patients, regardless of socioeconomic status, receive high-quality, data-driven diabetes management. Key recommendations include expanding education programs, incorporating hands-on learning experiences, assessing long-term knowledge retention, and extending CGM education to additional healthcare settings. These steps are crucial for optimizing CGM adoption and fostering a healthcare environment where providers confidently utilize technology to enhance diabetes care.

    "Abstract": "Clinical reasoning (CR) is an essential skill for nursing and is necessary for safe and effective nursing practice. This skill is critical in how well nurses make clinical decisions and take action to assist their patients. However, this skill is significantly lacking in new nurses, and an academic-practice gap is thought to be the reason. This study investigated the impact of a new concept-based inquiry teaching approach on nursing students' CR and its relationship with demographics, retention, critical thinking (CT), and metacognition. A quasi-experimental pretest and posttest study design using a non-equivalent comparison group was conducted with undergraduate students enrolled in a baccalaureate pre-licensure program using a concept-based curriculum. The concept-based inquiry (CBI) approach was introduced to students in the intervention group, while the control group participated in a flipped classroom teaching approach. Both groups engaged in content related to the concept of gas exchange. Clinical reasoning was measured using an NCLEX Next Generation (NGN) style exam created by the author, the clinical reasoning exam (CRE). Test analysis on the exam revealed challenges in writing and using these types of exams to assess CR and were discussed. The relationships of CBI to demographics, critical thinking, and metacognition were also evaluated. A demographic survey assessed age, gender, race/ethnicity, learning disabilities, work experience, military experience, and education level. The Health Sciences Reasoning Test assessed CT, and the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory assessed metacognition. The results of the study revealed no significant difference in CR between the CBI intervention group and the Flipped Classroom comparison group after the gas exchange class. No significant relationships to demographics or knowledge retention were noted. However, the study revealed that the CBI significantly affected CT and metacognition, critical elements of the CR process. This study demonstrates that the CBI approach may be a promising new teaching method that should be investigated further to determine if using it for a more extended time period would have a greater impact on CR.

    "Abstract": "The problem with post-merger integrations is the significant loss of corporate knowledge and skill ability because of high turnover rates, impacting the merger's success. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive case study explores organizational behaviors, elements, and process factors in a post-merger solar company, focusing on factors influencing the success of the merger and acquisition process. The following research questions were addressed: what organizational elements and procedures management can employ to mitigate the loss of corporate knowledge and skills in merger and acquisitions (M&A) integrations in the solar industry, and what organizational behaviors management can employ to foster success in M&A integration within the solar industry. The population of supervisors, team leaders, and quality assurance managers comprised the sample size of eight people from a solar company for this case study. The case study used Yin's five-step thematic analysis and the DeDoose program to complete the data analysis of the one-on-one interviews, archived documents, and a focus group session interview to find patterns and provide information about a recently merged solar company. The participants highlighted organizational sustainability, employee loyalty, and knowledge retention in successful mergers which highlighted the use of Organizational Learning Theory, Meaningful Learning Theory, and Learning Curve Theory. Knowledge sharing, employee development, and retention help companies integrate after a merger, according to the descriptive case study.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: With an emphasis on the function of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated instructional content, the current study attempts to investigate the impact of fluoride-related cultural and literary tales on information retention. The study investigates the links between exposure to fluoride narratives, learners' attitudes about fluoride narratives, engagement with AI-based platforms, and perceived utility of AI-generated information by utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Additionally, the study looks at how AI involvement and attitudes affect knowledge retention through serial and mediating effects. Methods This study used a cross-sectional survey approach with students in China's Jiangxi and Henan provinces as its target population. The relationship between exposure to fluoride narratives in educational materials, perceptions of the value of AI-generated information, interaction with AI platforms, and knowledge retention was examined through the application of structural equation modeling, or SEM. The pathways in the Technology Acceptance Model were examined using cross-sectional and serial mediation analyses. Of particular interest was the effect of AI-driven educational material on attitudes and engagement that lead to knowledge retention. Results: The results show that learners' views regarding fluoride and their engagement with AI platforms are greatly impacted when they are exposed to fluoride narratives in instructional content. These elements also highly predict the memory of fluoride-related knowledge. The study shows that the association between knowledge retention and the perceived utility of AI-generated information is entirely mediated by positive sentiments regarding the narratives and involvement with AI-based learning platforms. The impact of AI-generated material on knowledge retention is contingent upon learners' attitudes and their degree of involvement with AI platforms, as demonstrated by serial mediation studies. Research Limitation/Implication: Since the cross-sectional methodology makes it difficult to determine causal linkages, further longitudinal research is required to fully comprehend the long-term impacts of AI-enhanced instructional content on knowledge retention. To improve the study's validity, more objective measures of engagement and information retention should be included in subsequent studies. Orginality: This work presents a unique use of TAM in the context of educational technology, focusing on how AI-generated material might support learning experiences that are narrative-driven and culturally rich. This work contributes to the understanding of how technology acceptance affects information retention within the context of fluoride-related cultural and literary tales by mapping the intermediary processes of learner attitudes and Al engagement.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Effective communication and culturally adapted educational content are critical in promoting community engagement and enhancing oral health literacy among children. However, the presence of misinformation or misbeliefs about fluoride can undermine these efforts, leading to reduced knowledge retention and adverse health outcomes. Purpose: This study aims to investigate the relationships between communication strategies, cultural adaptation of educational content, community engagement, misinformation about fluoride, knowledge retention about fluoride benefits, and oral health literacy among children. Utilizing the HBM framework, the research explores how these factors interact and influence information avoidance intentions within social media contexts. Findings: Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that effective communication strategies and culturally adapted educational content significantly enhance community engagement, which in turn positively affects knowledge retention and oral health literacy. Conversely, misinformation about fluoride negatively impacts these educational outcomes, even within highly engaged communities. Additionally, the interaction between misinformation and community engagement further diminishes knowledge retention and literacy levels. Indirect effects highlighted the mediating role of community engagement in the relationships between communication strategies, cultural adaptation, and educational outcomes. Implications: The findings underscore the importance of strategic communication and cultural sensitivity in health education programs. They also highlight the critical need for robust misinformation management strategies to safeguard the integrity of health information disseminated through social media. Health educators and policymakers should prioritize developing clear, culturally relevant communication tools and implement measures to counteract misinformation to enhance public health education effectively. Conclusion: This study contributes to the understanding of how communication and cultural adaptation influence community engagement and educational outcomes in the context of oral health. It emphasizes that combating misinformation is essential for maximizing the effectiveness of health education initiatives, thereby fostering informed and health-literate communities.",

This variability frequently causes catastrophic forgetting in continual EEG decoding tasks, where previously acquired knowledge is overwritten as new subjects are introduced. While retraining the entire dataset for each new subject can mitigate forgetting, this approach imposes significant computational costs, rendering it impractical for real-world applications. Therefore, an ideal brain-computer interface (BCI) model should incrementally learn new information without requiring complete retraining, thereby reducing computational overhead. Existing EEG decoding methods typically rely on large, centralized source-domain datasets for pre-training to improve model generalization. However, in practical scenarios, data availability is often constrained by privacy concerns. Furthermore, these methods are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in continual EEG decoding tasks, significantly limiting their utility in long-term learning scenarios. To address these issues, we propose the Personalized Continual EEG Decoding (PCED) framework for continual EEG decoding. The framework uses Euclidean Alignment for fast domain adaptation, reducing inter-subject variability. To retain knowledge and prevent forgetting, it includes an exemplar replay mechanism that preserves key information from past tasks. A reservoir sampling-based memory management strategy optimizes exemplar storage to handle memory constraints in long-term learning. Experiments on the OpenBMI dataset with 54 subjects show that PCED balances knowledge retention and classification performance, providing an efficient solution for real-world BCI applications.",

    "Abstract": "This secondary research analysis explored the effectiveness of the Reducing the Risk (RTR) curriculum (Barth, 2015) with a population of queer youth. RTR is an evidence-based curriculum designed to decrease adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). During the 2017-2018 academic year, a public university implemented the RTR curriculum in urban municipalities in a northeastern U.S. state with high rates of adolescent births and STIs. The study included a group of 9th and 10th grade high school students, encompassing those who self-identified as queer. This secondary research analysis utilized data from the original study, and focused on the impact of perceived respect during the RTR implementation on the curriculum outcome objectives (i.e., fostering sexual health knowledge and influencing sexual behavior) among queer youth who perceived respect compared to queer youth who did not perceive respect and cisgender/heterosexual (cishet) youth. While perceived respect did not emerge as a statistically significant factor in influencing behavioral curriculum objectives, significant differences in knowledge acquisition were observed. Specifically, queer youth who perceived respect demonstrated statistically significant knowledge gains, from pre-test to post-test, suggesting that perceived respect may enhance learning in the short term. However, these gains diminished by the 3 – month follow up, indicating a need for continued reinforcement to sustain knowledge retention over time. However, queer youth who did not perceive respect also exhibited knowledge gains immediately after the curriculum, though these gains were not retained at a follow up. When comparing queer youth who perceived respect with cishet youth, both groups achieved similar post scores gains, but cishet youth showed a marginally significant trend toward better long-term retention at the 3 month follow up, suggesting that while perceived respect fosters immediate learning acquisition, additional support may be needed for sustained retention among queer youth. Alternate abstract: Este análisis de investigación secundaria exploró la efectividad del currículo Reducing the Risk (RTR) (Barth, 2015) en una población de jóvenes queer. RTR es un currículo basado en evidencia diseñado para reducir el embarazo adolescente y las infecciones de transmisión sexual (ITS). Durante el año académico 2017-2018, una universidad pública implementó el currículo RTR en municipios urbanos de un estado del noreste de los Estados Unidos con altas tasas de nacimientos adolescentes y ITS. El estudio incluyó a un grupo de estudiantes de 9º y 10º grado de secundaria, incluyendo aquellos que se identificaron como queer. Este análisis de investigación secundaria utilizó datos del estudio original y se centró en el impacto de la percepción de respeto durante la implementación de RTR en los objetivos del currículo (es decir, fomentar el conocimiento sobre salud sexual e influir en el comportamiento sexual) entre jóvenes queer que percibieron respeto, en comparación con jóvenes queer que no percibieron respeto y jóvenes cisgénero/heterosexuales (cishet). Aunque la percepción de respeto no emergió como un factor estadísticamente significativo en la influencia de los objetivos conductuales del currículo, se observaron diferencias significativas en la adquisición de conocimientos. Específicamente, los jóvenes queer que percibieron respeto demostraron ganancias estadísticamente significativas en el conocimiento, desde la evaluación inicial hasta la evaluación posterior, lo que sugiere que la percepción de respeto puede mejorar el aprendizaje a corto plazo. Sin embargo, estas ganancias disminuyeron para el seguimiento a los tres meses, indicando la necesidad de refuerzos continuos para mantener la retención del conocimiento a lo largo del tiempo. Por otro lado, los jóvenes queer que no percibieron respeto también mostraron ganancias en el conocimiento inmediatamente después del currículo, aunque estas ganancias no se mantuvieron en el seguimiento. Al comparar a los jóvenes queer que percibieron respeto con los jóvenes cishet, ambos grupos lograron mejoras similares en las puntuaciones posteriores, pero los jóvenes cishet mostraron una tendencia marginalmente significativa hacia una mejor retención a largo plazo en el seguimiento a los tres meses. Esto sugiere que, si bien la percepción de respeto fomenta la adquisición inmediata del aprendizaje, puede ser necesario un apoyo adicional para lograr una retención sostenida entre los jóvenes queer.",

During the pandemic-regulated restrictions, our institute started the online CPR training course for medical undergraduates so that some training could be imparted to them if they needed to staff the clinical areas. This study compared online with traditional mannequin-based CPR training regarding skill acquisition and knowledge retention.This randomized cross-sectional study involved 108 medical undergraduates divided into two groups to receive online-based training (Group 1) and mannequin-based training (Group 2). Compression depth and rate were objectively measured using an AmbuMan CPR training mannequin. Knowledge assessment was conducted using relevant clinical vignettes, and participant performance was assessed using a skill-based checklist. MATERIALS AND METHODS This randomized cross-sectional study involved 108 medical undergraduates divided into two groups to receive online-based training (Group 1) and mannequin-based training (Group 2). Compression depth and rate were objectively measured using an AmbuMan CPR training mannequin. Knowledge assessment was conducted using relevant clinical vignettes, and participant performance was assessed using a skill-based checklist.Both groups had comparable baseline knowledge. Group 2 exhibited significantly higher post intervention knowledge assessment and skill-based checklist scores. Mean compression depth [36.28 (13.84) vs 51.6 (8.7), P < 0.001] and median rate [110 (87.5 to 129.50) vs 123.0 (111.0 to 133.0), P = 0.012] were better in mannequin trained participants. Group 2 participants demonstrated superior skills across all checklist items, with notable differences in pre compression and compression steps. Scene safety checks (62%), compression rate (44%), and compression depth (48%) showed the most significant improvements, whereas steps involving Automated External Defibrillator (AED) usage had minimal enhancements. RESULTS Both groups had comparable baseline knowledge. Group 2 exhibited significantly higher post intervention knowledge assessment and skill-based checklist scores. Mean compression depth [36.28 (13.84) vs 51.6 (8.7), P < 0.001] and median rate [110 (87.5 to 129.50) vs 123.0 (111.0 to 133.0), P = 0.012] were better in mannequin trained participants. Group 2 participants demonstrated superior skills across all checklist items, with notable differences in pre compression and compression steps. Scene safety checks (62%), compression rate (44%), and compression depth (48%) showed the most significant improvements, whereas steps involving Automated External Defibrillator (AED) usage had minimal enhancements.The findings of this study are significant, demonstrating that hands-on mannequin-based training is significantly more effective than online training in teaching BLS skills to novice medical students, particularly in achieving correct chest compression depth and rate. The study's findings indicate that hands-on training is indispensable for effective skill acquisition despite the widespread adoption of online teaching. CONCLUSION The findings of this study are significant, demonstrating that hands-on mannequin-based training is significantly more effective than online training in teaching BLS skills to novice medical students, particularly in achieving correct chest compression depth and rate. The study's findings indicate that hands-on training is indispensable for effective skill acquisition despite the widespread adoption of online teaching.",

    "Abstract": "The transition to sustainable energy systems presents a critical challenge for the 21st century, necessitating both technological advancements and transformative educational strategies to foster awareness and knowledge. Hydrogen technologies are pivotal for decarbonization, yet public understanding and acceptance remain limited. This study introduces and evaluates a novel gamified educational framework, uniquely integrating simulation-based learning, collaborative problem-solving, and adaptive instructional scaffolding to enhance hydrogen literacy and sustainability awareness. Unlike traditional pedagogical approaches, this method actively engages learners in real-world decision-making scenarios, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications. This study involved adolescents aged 13–15 from two distinct educational and cultural contexts, one in Europe and one in the Middle East. A pre–post study design assessed knowledge acquisition, gamification engagement, and environmental awareness shifts. Findings reveal statistically significant improvements in technical knowledge and strong positive perceptions of gamified learning as an effective sustainability education tool across both cultural groups (Europe and the Middle East). Variations in engagement across cultural contexts suggest the need for adaptive, context-sensitive educational frameworks. While the findings indicate significant short-term knowledge gains, this study does not assess long-term knowledge retention, which remains an important area for future research. This research contributes to sustainability education by demonstrating how strategically designed gamification can foster behavioral engagement, enhance environmental literacy, and support the global energy transition agenda. This study offers a pioneering perspective on integrating interactive learning methodologies to cultivate sustainability competencies among younger generations.",

    "Abstract": "Theoretical background: Occupational safety training is crucial for reducing workplace risks, but traditional approaches often struggle to fully engage participants or guarantee effective knowledge retention. Over the past decade, interest in using technology-based active learning strategies has grown, with active learning focusing on practical approaches that actively engage workers in the learning process. Objective: The research aims to identify the active learning strategies currently employed in OS training and assess the benefits and challenges of these approaches. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted in line with the PRISMA guidelines. After a rigorous selection process based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 24 eligible articles were identified from the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. Results: Technology-based active learning strategies, especially serious games, enhance the comprehension of safety procedures. Simulating risk scenarios and providing immediate feedback facilitates knowledge transfer to real-world environments. However, limitations are evident, such as technical complexity, high implementation costs, and difficulties in acceptance by less experienced users. Conclusions: The study concludes by emphasizing the need for targeted research to overcome the identified challenges, such as improving simulation realism, reducing costs through collaborative partnerships, and addressing usability issues for different worker populations.",

    "Abstract": "Background : Clinical nutrition is essential in nursing care, with nurses playing a key role in supporting patients’ dietary needs. Aim : To assess the impact of active learning methodologies on clinical nutrition education, focusing on knowledge retention among nursing students. Methods : Using a quasi-experimental research design, we enrolled 131 s-year nursing students. Both groups attended an eight-hour seminar on clinical nutrition, incorporating critical thinking. The experimental group had prior exposure to active learning and ICT in their first-year course, while the control group received traditional teaching. Knowledge was assessed using a validated questionnaire on basic and clinical nutrition. Results : The experimental group scored higher in both basic and clinical nutrition, indicating that active learning improves immediate learning and long-term retention. One year later, they retained significant knowledge, particularly regarding nutrient–disease relationships. Conclusions : Active learning, particularly critical thinking, enhances short- and long-term outcomes in clinical nutrition education. Future studies should refine assessment tools and explore further integration of active learning into nursing curricula.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid evolution of technology in education highlights the need for methodologies that enhance student engagement and skill development. This study examines students’ perceptions of designing educational escape rooms using ICT tools and generative AI (GenAI) as a learning methodology. A total of 47 students participated in creating digital escape rooms with GenAI, Genially, and HeroForge in the course “Mediation in Conflicts and Situations of Violence” within a Social Education degree. A qualitative approach was used, analyzing focus group discussions conducted after the activity. Results indicate that students valued the experience, emphasizing its impact on digital competence, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Collaborative learning helped overcome initial technical challenges, and students recognized the practical applicability of escape room design in mediation contexts. However, they identified areas for improvement, such as the need for more initial training, extended development time, and better access to digital tools. This study contributes to game-based learning and AI-enhanced education research, positioning students as active designers rather than passive users. Future research should explore the long-term impact on knowledge retention and transferable skills in professional settings.",

    "Abstract": "Tools such as ALEKS and BYJU’S demonstrate that the combination of AI and gamification can identify knowledge gaps and provide targeted support, resulting in greater knowledge retention, improved academic performance and increased inclusion (Suresh Babu & Dhakshina Moorthy, 2024). [...]students facing difficulties can receive additional support, while more advanced learners are challenged with demanding tasks. [...]AI enables the creation of more inclusive experiences, accommodating different learning profiles and ensuring that everyone has equal opportunities for engagement and development (Suresh Babu & Dhakshina Moorthy, 2024). While the personalization enabled by AI and gamification can offer tailored and stimulating pathways, it is essential to ensure that these tools also foster critical thinking, complex problem-solving and collaboration – essential skills for the 21st century. [...]learning should go beyond the achievement of immediate goals, promoting curiosity, reflection and the practical application of knowledge in real-world contexts. The challenge lies in integrating these technologies in a way that not only improves academic and professional outcomes but also strengthens autonomy, intrinsic motivation and the holistic development of individuals. [...]the future of learning will depend on how we balance technological advancements with the need to develop ethical, creative citizens equipped to tackle the challenges of a constantly evolving world.",

This research focuses on the development of an AI-powered system designed to automate summarization, question answering, and quiz generation from YouTube transcripts and Wikipedia articles. The system employs advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process and distill complex information into clear and concise summaries. The process begins with the extraction of text through the YouTube Transcript API or web scraping. The Pegasus-XSum model is then used for summarizing the content, ensuring that key information is retained while minimizing text length. For question answering, the Llama model is employed to generate contextually relevant answers based on the provided content. Additionally, the system generates quizzes by extracting entities from the text to enhance interactive learning. This technology aims to improve content comprehension, making it especially valuable for educational settings and knowledge management. By integrating summarization, question answering, and quiz generation into a single platform, the system supports efficient learning and better retention of critical information. This research demonstrates the potential of NLP in addressing the challenges of information overload and facilitating effective knowledge acquisition.",

Whereas the traditional methods of learning do not appeal much to digitally native learners, the existing gap in terms of the systematic improvement of outcomes lies in the understanding of immersive technologies. This paper combines both quantitative assessments of learning and qualitative phenomenological analyses from three different educational settings: schools at the secondary level, institutions of higher learning, and professional training centers. Through an effective intervention involving 742 participants using cutting-edge AR learning platforms, our study has revealed significant cognitive and engagement-related improvements. The groups experiencing AR-enhanced curricula showed a 37% increase in knowledge retention, as well as 42% higher engagement rates, along with significantly improved spatial reasoning abilities. Qualitative data further support the idea that motivation improves, as participants indicated better conceptual understanding and greater independence in learning. The findings indicate that AR is transformative in educational practice, making it simple to bring theoretical knowledge and experiential learning together. Here, the merging of digital information with the students' physical learning environment is not merely a technological intervention, but a fundamental redesign of pedagogical approaches that promises a more interactive, personalized, and immersive education paradigm.",

    "Abstract": "We live in an era where future generations are experiencing a serious loss of knowledge, sensitivity, and interest in biodiversity. This situation is thought to be unique to urbanised countries with limited green spaces. However, with the increasing urbanisation of rural areas, it is necessary to investigate what is happening in places of high biodiversity. In this study, we investigated the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of children and adolescents in the rural municipality of José María Morelos in southeastern Mexico. We analysed 1119 drawings by 117 children in their first three years of school and interviewed 280 students in their last three years of primary, secondary and high school. Younger children drew more native species, with the majority being mammals. Of the students surveyed, secondary school students had the highest level of species knowledge and considered deer and jaguar to be the most important species. They considered hunting to be the main cause of animal depletion and had a positive attitude towards nature conservation. Based on our findings, we recommend that educational strategies be implemented at all school levels to promote knowledge of the less emblematic species that inhabit the Selva Maya.",

    "Abstract": "This systematic review analyzed the role of microlearning in basic education, identifying the most widely used Digital Information and Communication Technologies, relevant learning theories, and the role of social technologies from a Science, Technology, Society, and Environment (STSE) perspective. Following PRISMA 2020, searches were conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC, and IEEE Xplore databases. Studies on microlearning were selected based on previously defined eligibility criteria. The review process in Rayyan involved deduplication, screening, and full-text analysis. Data were qualitatively analyzed using content analysis, and methodological quality was assessed with CASP and the Downs and Black. The findings highlight that microlearning, integrated with digital tools such as online platforms, mobile apps, and short videos, significantly enhances student motivation, performance, and interaction; content in short modules facilitates knowledge retention and connects concepts to real-life situations. Promising trends include mobile technologies and gamification, which foster active, meaningful learning. Grounded in theories like Self-Determination, Constructionism, and Constructivism, microlearning personalizes teaching and promotes engagement, critical thinking, and accessibility, contributing to inclusive and sustainable education. From a STSE perspective, social technologies enhance autonomy, social interaction, and ethical–environmental awareness. In Brazil, further research on digital platforms and gamified strategies is needed to drive innovative educational practices.",

    "Abstract": "Learning is deeply connected to the brain's complex mechanisms, yet traditional educational environments often overlook this, resulting in less effective outcomes. Drawing on the research of Eric Jensen and David Rock, we explore activity-based learning and its effectiveness in enhancing knowledge retention and understanding. By examining the role of learning objectives and aligning activities with specific brain functions, this approach fosters neural connections that promote long-term memory and higher reasoning. A case study in Kenya illustrates how activity-based learning improved communication skills in a multinational organization. We also discuss its implementation in various settings, including private companies. This essay highlights the importance of integrating brain science into educational practices to optimize learning outcomes, particularly for adults.",

    "Abstract": "Service-learning (S-L) is an educational method that enhances social and civic engagement among health science students, addressing unmet community needs. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSKD) represent a public health issue with increasing prevalence among school-aged population as reported by at least 1 on 5 children. Prevention programs for MSKD in schools are scarce, although evidence supports the efficacy of health education provided by physical therapists. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a musculoskeletal health promotion program through S-L on school students, teachers, and physical therapy students. Background Service-learning (S-L) is an educational method that enhances social and civic engagement among health science students, addressing unmet community needs. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSKD) represent a public health issue with increasing prevalence among school-aged population as reported by at least 1 on 5 children. Prevention programs for MSKD in schools are scarce, although evidence supports the efficacy of health education provided by physical therapists. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a musculoskeletal health promotion program through S-L on school students, teachers, and physical therapy students.A mixed-methods approach was used. A quasi-experimental design assessed the learning and satisfaction of school students and teachers using pre-and post-intervention questionnaires. Additionally, qualitative data from reflective diaries of fourth-year physical therapy students were analyzed to capture their experiences. The intervention was conducted in 10 schools in Spain over two academic years, targeting children aged 10-14 and their teachers. Methods A mixed-methods approach was used. A quasi-experimental design assessed the learning and satisfaction of school students and teachers using pre-and post-intervention questionnaires. Additionally, qualitative data from reflective diaries of fourth-year physical therapy students were analyzed to capture their experiences. The intervention was conducted in 10 schools in Spain over two academic years, targeting children aged 10-14 and their teachers.A total of 1,051 school students and 32 teachers participated. Pre-post evaluations revealed significant learnings on MSKD prevention and body awareness in both groups ( p  < 0.05), highlighting the increase in knowledge about MSKD prevention and self-treatment for school students and on MSKD derived from inadequate postures for schoolteachers. Satisfaction was high, with students and teachers rating the program 4.4/5. Teachers highlighted the value of training for their professional practice, while students appreciated learning about self-care. Physical therapy students were 4 and reflected on their motivation for the project, learning experiences, as well as positive and negative aspects of the service.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This quality improvement project aimed to impact participants' knowledge, knowledge retention, and confidence levels about using ketamine as a treatment method for patients with treatment-resistant depression.Background: Major depressive disorder is a prevalent mental health disorder within our communities. Notably, individuals with depression can experience poor responses to two first-line treatments leading to treatment-resistant depression. Therefore, there is a need for mental health care providers to utilize efficacious alternative treatment modalities like ketamine to treat this patient population. An outpatient clinic in Chandler, Arizona has identified treatment-resistant depression as a frequent outcome in the clients they serve who have depression; mental health care providers in this clinic may benefit from an educational intervention regarding the utilization of ketamine as a treatment for treatment- resistant depression. Methods: A cohort of providers was strategically selected for participation in an evidence-based educational intervention focused on ketamine's demonstrated efficacy in treatment-resistant depression. This quality improvement initiative employed quantitative methodology to assess provider knowledge and confidence metrics at an outpatient clinic in Chandler, Arizona, utilizing anonymous paper-based questionnaires administered pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and one-week post-intervention to evaluate knowledge retention and practice modification intent. The surveys incorporated open-ended questions to identify perceived barriers to ketamine implementation in TRD treatment protocols. Results: A total of 5 behavioral and mental health care providers with varying levels of experience in the field were recruited and completed all three surveys. Pretests and posttests showed an overall improvement in knowledge following the educational session. Additionally, the subsequent posttest administered at the following weekly meeting showed no statistically significant change in knowledge compared to the initial posttest. Outcomes also show that the participants' confidence level in the benefits and utility of Ketamine for TRD significantly increased after the informational PowerPoint presentation.Conclusion: Data analysis from the results of this QI project supports the implementation of education to improve providers' overall knowledge about the benefits and efficacy of ketamine for TRD. The statistically significant increase in survey scores and self-reported confidence levels may indicate that educational sessions can improve provider knowledge, long-term knowledge, and confidence.Keywords: major depressive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, ketamine.

    "Abstract": "Orientation: The ageing healthcare workforce has been an issue of concern in the health sector over the recent years. This unique demographic challenge poses numerous challenges like knowledge loss and possible skill shortages. Research purpose: This analysis seeks to examine the association between job engagement (JE), organisational engagement (OE) and employee performance (EP) of healthcare workers in Manicaland Province in Zimbabwe. Further, it assesses the moderating role of age on the association between JE and EP and OE and EP. Motivation for the study: There is restricted research on the relationship between JE, OE and EP, as well as on the moderating role of age on the association between JE and EP and OE and EP of healthcare workers. Research approach/design and method: The study’s approach is quantitative. Employing the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-17, Job and Organisation Scales and Individual Work Performance Questionnaire, the data were collected from 235 healthcare workers. Structural equation modelling was implemented to examine the relationships of interest. Main findings: Job engagement positively impacts OE, and JE positively influences EP. The positive impact of OE on EP is insignificant. Age has an insignificant moderating effect on the relationship between JE and EP and OE and EP. Practical/managerial implications: Healthcare institutions and policymakers should enforce robust intervention strategies that support JE, OE and EP. Contribution/value-add: This research immensely contributes to the existing literature on the relationship between JE, OE and EP.",

    "Abstract": "This study explored the role of human resource (HR) practices in retaining librarians' knowledge within Uganda's public university libraries. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach with an exploratory sequential design, the research examined selected libraries through qualitative interviews with university librarians. These interviews informed a questionnaire administered to 67 professional librarians to gather quantitative data. Findings revealed that while HR practices are essential for mitigating knowledge loss and supporting retention, challenges such as rigid public service guidelines, and underutilized succession planning hinder their effectiveness. Additionally, the lack of a formal knowledge retention strategy further limits these practices. The study concludes by emphasizing the need for formalized knowledge retention strategies that integrate HR practices to enhance knowledge management and address identified gaps from recruitment to retention, aligning with previous research on talent management and staff development in library settings.",

    "Abstract": "The series of evacuation drills implemented for flood disasters were mostly through monotonous traditional pedagogical methods. The application of these methods was observed to be ineffective because of the inability to realistically represent the actual dangers and have a significant impact on behavioural changes. Therefore, this research aimed to develop and test the effectiveness of Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) Flood Evacuation to improve knowledge and self-efficacy regarding flood disasters. This was achieved through the adoption of a one-group pretest-posttest design as well as the selection of 45 students as participants. The results showed that IVR significantly improved the knowledge of the best evacuation practices and self-efficacy ( T -test, p < 0.005) with long-term influence on the memory of the participants. These observations supported the previous studies that reported the ability of virtual reality in ensuring longer knowledge retention compared to traditional learning methods.The series of evacuation drills implemented for flood disasters were mostly through monotonous traditional pedagogical methods.

    "Abstract": "Peer-led team learning is a socially mediated pedagogy where trained peer leaders, students who have completed a course, return to lead students in groups within a targeted course. The effect of peer-led team learning to improve student success in chemistry has been extensively documented but it is unclear if it is just as effective at facilitating retention of knowledge across time. This paper describes two studies designed to examine this possibility, each focusing on the impact of peer-led team learning in second-semester general chemistry on students' long-term knowledge of chemical equilibrium. The first study measured student knowledge at three time points for one year following enrollment in general chemistry. The second study measured student knowledge while enrolled in analytical chemistry. Both studies used a repeated measures design and found no demonstrable effect of pedagogy on the long-term retention of knowledge. This finding indicates that concepts students hold in first-year chemistry remain long-standing throughout their undergraduate training, conceptual understanding of equilibrium shows ample room for improvement across both pedagogies, and peer-led team learning supports knowledge retention comparable to didactic instruction.",

    "Abstract": "Organizations do not learn well. As a result, they lose valuable knowledge. When knowledge is lost in organizations, workers are forced to spend as much as 25% of their workday looking for information to do their jobs, contributing to workplace frustration, anxiety, and personnel retention challenges (Businesswire, 2022). Numerous studies on knowledge management, organizational memory, and organizational forgetting have expanded organizations' view of knowledge as a valuable organizational resource. The problem of interest in this dissertation is that while prescriptive measures to retain organizational knowledge exist, organizations continue to lose valuable knowledge. Such knowledge loss in the government contributes to performance inefficiencies, unnecessary costs to U.S. taxpayers, and the potential inability of military forces to meet national security requirements. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore the contextual issues that influence how and why forgetting is tolerated within strategic-level organizations of the Air Force as experienced by the civilian workforce. The research questions that guided this study are as follows: Why do Air Force organizations tolerate forgetting despite policy directives and available prescriptive remedies? How do Air Force organizations prioritize knowledge loss in their learning and knowledge management activities? and How are organizational processes, systems, and culture managed to address knowledge loss? The study expands the existing models of organizational forgetting that focus on intentional and unintentional knowledge loss to include forgetting that is neither of these but is tolerated by organizations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 mid- to senior-level Air Force civilian employees representing eight strategic-level organizations. Four themes were identified as contributing to tolerated organizational forgetting. First, motivation and values within the organization often relegate knowledge management efforts to other tasks. Second, a culture of acceptance and lack of accountability habituate organizations to knowledge loss. Third, organizational focus on near-term objectives creates strategic blindness. Lastly, undocumented business processes contribute to a loss of governance and ad hoc practices. These findings provide practical considerations to address tolerated forgetting in organizations and provide new avenues for refining organizational forgetting theory.

    "Abstract": "With the rapid growth in satellite imagery acquisition and decreasing revisit intervals, efficient on-orbit processing of hyperspectral data has become critical due to limited onboard computing resources. In this context, lifelong learning (LLL) offers a promising solution to enable continuous learning from new data without storing all previous data or retraining from scratch. However, the plasticity-stability dilemma remains a significant challenge, particularly in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification under class-incremental scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel network architecture that integrates contrastive learning and an angular penalty loss. The contrastive learning module facilitates adaptive knowledge fusion, enabling the model to effectively incorporate new information while preserving prior knowledge. The angular penalty loss allows the classifier to dynamically expand for new classes while maintaining discrimination between old and new categories. Together, these components ensure robust knowledge retention, transfer, and adaptability. Experimental results on three benchmark hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, highlighting its efficacy in addressing LLL challenges in HSI classification. The code is available at https://github.com/Li-ZK/LLL-AFCA .",

    "Abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a transformative educational tool, enabling immersive learning environments that promote student engagement and understanding of complex concepts. However, despite the growing adoption of VR in education, there remains a significant gap in research exploring how generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as generative pretrained transformer can further enhance these experiences by reducing cognitive load and improving learning outcomes. This study examines the impact of an AI-driven instructor assistant in VR classrooms on student engagement, cognitive load, knowledge retention, and performance. A total of 52 participants were divided into two groups experiencing a VR lesson on the bubble sort algorithm, one with only a prescripted virtual instructor (control group), and the other with the addition of an AI instructor assistant (experimental group). Statistical analysis of postlesson quizzes and cognitive load assessments was conducted using independent t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the cognitive load being measured through a postexperiment questionnaire. The study results indicate that the experimental group reported significantly higher engagement compared to the control group. While the AI assistant did not significantly improve postlesson assessment scores, it enhanced conceptual knowledge transfer. The experimental group also demonstrated lower intrinsic cognitive load, suggesting the assistant reduced the perceived complexity of the material. Higher germane and general cognitive loads indicated that students were more invested in meaningful learning without feeling overwhelmed.",

    "Abstract": "This Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) project focused on enhancing provider knowledge and supporting the integration of FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology in a family medicine and occupational health clinic. A gap in provider understanding of CGM technology and its role in diabetes management was identified. The intervention targeted a diverse group, including medical assistants, management, clerical staff, occupational health specialists, and medical providers. A pre-and post-education knowledge assessment was conducted, and results showed an increase in provider understanding. The pre-intervention average score was 76.52 ( SD = 2.64), which increased to 98 ( SD = 3.34) post-intervention. While the paired-samples t test did not achieve statistical significance t (13) = 0.92, p = .37), the increase in competency and confidence highlighted the value of CGM education. These findings emphasize the need for ongoing training to enhance competency and promote evidence-based diabetes management. Expanding CGM education has the potential to improve patient outcomes, address healthcare disparities, and increase access to advanced diabetes care. By promoting equitable access to CGM technology, this project contributes to positive social change, ensuring that all patients, regardless of socioeconomic status, receive high-quality, data-driven diabetes management. Key recommendations include expanding education programs, incorporating hands-on learning experiences, assessing long-term knowledge retention, and extending CGM education to additional healthcare settings. These steps are crucial for optimizing CGM adoption and fostering a healthcare environment where providers confidently utilize technology to enhance diabetes care.",

    "Abstract": "For rising professionals to meet the needs of contemporary healthcare and biomedical innovation, educators must develop new teaching and learning approaches. Specifically, biomedical innovations are significantly influenced by the FDA's regulatory framework, requiring professionals to be equipped with regulatory science knowledge, entrepreneurial skills, and interdisciplinary training. However, biomedical education often fails to integrate these skills in an environment that mimics the interdisciplinary setting required for translational science, leaving learners unprepared for unique challenges in practice. This study details an FDA Regulation and Entrepreneurship curriculum at Case Western Reserve University and its affiliated community, leveraging a novel approach for biomedical education. Focused on preparing biomedical professionals to navigate FDA regulatory processes and innovative entrepreneurship endeavors, the curriculum is built upon five core principles: integrating multiple disciplines, ensuring real world applicability, developing a systems thinking approach, incorporating ethical considerations, and fostering a collaborative and experiential learning environment. These principles are supported by a flexible course format, targeted learning objectives, team-based learning sessions, experiential learning opportunities, a diverse participant population, and an interdisciplinary team of faculty and experts. High participant engagement and broad representation across fields over the curriculum's three-year lifespan to date affirm its relevance and value with participants representing the fields of basic science, medicine, law, business, and engineering. The flexible course format, team-based learning, and experiential learning proved instrumental in enhancing engagement, reinforcing practical learning outcomes, and supporting personalized learning goals. The flexible course format further aligns with professional needs of participants, providing a model for other institutions navigating similar challenges in biomedical education. In conclusion, participant feedback demonstrated the value of the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary training approach in promoting knowledge retention and skill development in complex medical, business management and legal contexts. Moving forward, targeted outreach and flexible engagement options will be necessary to expand the curricular reach and diverse participant population. The success of the curriculum suggests promising implications for similar approaches aimed at empowering biomedical professionals with essential regulatory, entrepreneurial and interdisciplinary competencies, ultimately advancing translational science and improving healthcare outcomes.For rising professionals to meet the needs of contemporary healthcare and biomedical innovation, educators must develop new teaching and learning approaches.

    "Abstract": "Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in education has introduced innovative approaches, particularly in personalized learning and dynamic assessment. Conventional teaching models often struggle to address learners' diverse needs and abilities, underscoring the necessity for AI-driven flexible learning frameworks. This study explores how AI-aided smart learning paths and dynamic assessments enhance learning efficiency by improving knowledge acquisition, optimizing task completion time, and increasing student engagement. A six-week quasi-experimental study was conducted with 200 students, divided into an experimental group using an AI-based learning system and a control group following traditional methods. Pre- and post-tests and engagement analyses were used to evaluate outcomes. The experimental group demonstrated a 25% improvement in performance, completed tasks 25% faster, and showed a 15% increase in engagement compared to the control group. These findings highlight the potential of AI to deliver personalized learning experiences and timely feedback, significantly enhancing student outcomes. Future research should involve larger participant groups across higher educational levels and examine the long-term impact of AI-supported education on students’ knowledge retention and skill reinforcement.",

Introduction With increasing rates of fatal opioid overdoses and substance use disorders, discussing harm reduction strategies in undergraduate medical education is imperative. Medical students learn opioid pharmacology but often lack adequate training in recognizing and responding to opioid overdoses. Incorporating naloxone training into preclinical undergraduate medical education can be lifesaving.This educational activity trained second-year medical students in opioid overdose recognition and response. The 2-hour interactive session included an informative presentation on opioid use statistics, harm reduction, and opioid overdose; a case-based learning session; and hands-on practice on task trainers using an OSCE-style checklist. Student confidence in four areas was assessed through pre- and posttraining surveys on 5-point Likert scales. Data analysis was conducted using R (programming language), with exploratory analyses for sample size, normality, and variable selection. The Wilcoxon signed rank test evaluated changes in attitudes from pre- to posttest. Methods This educational activity trained second-year medical students in opioid overdose recognition and response.

Significant improvements were observed in confidence across all areas: assessing an opioid overdose (p < .001), administering naloxone (p < .001), continuing management after naloxone (p < .001), and training others on naloxone administration (p < .001).Early training in opioid overdose management increased second-year medical students' confidence in key areas, potentially enabling them to better combat the crisis during their clinical years and educate at-risk patients. Future activities should incorporate objective skill assessments to evaluate competency and explore long-term knowledge retention during clinical rotations.

    "Abstract": "The series of evacuation drills implemented for flood disasters were mostly through monotonous traditional pedagogical methods. The application of these methods was observed to be ineffective because of the inability to realistically represent the actual dangers and have a significant impact on behavioural changes. Therefore, this research aimed to develop and test the effectiveness of Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) Flood Evacuation to improve knowledge and self-efficacy regarding flood disasters. This was achieved through the adoption of a one-group pretest-posttest design as well as the selection of 45 students as participants. The results showed that IVR significantly improved the knowledge of the best evacuation practices and self-efficacy ( T -test, p < 0.005) with long-term influence on the memory of the participants. These observations supported the previous studies that reported the ability of virtual reality in ensuring longer knowledge retention compared to traditional learning methods. Contribution: Immersive virtual reality was found to have the potential to be applied as an interesting pedagogical tool for flood evacuation training. The application of the method for drills was discovered to be more efficient, cost-effective, and provide enhanced knowledge retention for users. This research shows the significance of seamlessly incorporating knowledge with flood evacuation practices through IVR in disaster education programmes. The integration is important in the transformation of knowledge into actionable steps, thereby enhancing overall preparedness.",

    "Abstract": "Clinical reasoning (CR) is an essential skill for nursing and is necessary for safe and effective nursing practice. This skill is critical in how well nurses make clinical decisions and take action to assist their patients. However, this skill is significantly lacking in new nurses, and an academic-practice gap is thought to be the reason. This study investigated the impact of a new concept-based inquiry teaching approach on nursing students’ CR and its relationship with demographics, retention, critical thinking (CT), and metacognition. A quasi-experimental pretest and posttest study design using a non-equivalent comparison group was conducted with undergraduate students enrolled in a baccalaureate pre-licensure program using a concept-based curriculum. The concept-based inquiry (CBI) approach was introduced to students in the intervention group, while the control group participated in a flipped classroom teaching approach. Both groups engaged in content related to the concept of gas exchange. Clinical reasoning was measured using an NCLEX Next Generation (NGN) style exam created by the author, the clinical reasoning exam (CRE). Test analysis on the exam revealed challenges in writing and using these types of exams to assess CR and were discussed. The relationships of CBI to demographics, critical thinking, and metacognition were also evaluated. A demographic survey assessed age, gender, race/ethnicity, learning disabilities, work experience, military experience, and education level. The Health Sciences Reasoning Test assessed CT, and the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory assessed metacognition. The results of the study revealed no significant difference in CR between the CBI intervention group and the Flipped Classroom comparison group after the gas exchange class. No significant relationships to demographics or knowledge retention were noted. However, the study revealed that the CBI significantly affected CT and metacognition, critical elements of the CR process. This study demonstrates that the CBI approach may be a promising new teaching method that should be investigated further to determine if using it for a more extended time period would have a greater impact on CR.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Simulation is a crucial component in the training of healthcare professionals, offering a safe environment for practical learning without posing risks to patients. Aim: This study aims to evaluate the effect of simulation with a standardized patient on the acquisition and retention of knowledge, as well as on the self-efficacy of nursing students. Methods: A quasi-experimental study with a pre-test and post-test design was conducted with 120 nursing students, who were randomly assigned to two groups. The experimental group (60) received training through simulation with a standardized patient, supplemented by a lecture-based course. The control group (60) received only the same lecture-based course. A pre-test was conducted to assess students’ baseline knowledge and self-efficacy before any intervention. Student performance was then assessed with a post-test immediately after the training to measure knowledge acquisition and self-efficacy and a post-test three months after the intervention to measure long-term knowledge retention. Results: The results showed a statistically significant difference in mean scores between the intervention and control groups in terms of knowledge acquisition (14.92 vs. 13.32; p < 0.001; d = 0.99), self-efficacy (33.02 vs. 31.05; p < 0.001; d = 1.03) and knowledge retention three months after training (12.4 vs. 10.6; p < 0.001; d = 0.94). Conclusions: The results of this study confirmed the effectiveness of simulation in knowledge acquisition and retention, as well as in the self-efficacy of nursing students. These findings support the integration of this method into training programs to strengthen the skills of future healthcare professionals.",

    "Abstract": "Hiring managers in the automotive manufacturing industry have consistently faced high turnover rates compared to other sectors, prompting efforts to understand the factors influencing employees' intention to leave. Recognizing the impact of turnover on profitability and knowledge retention, these managers require deeper insights into the underlying relationships to develop effective mitigation strategies. Grounded in Herzberg’s motivation-hygiene theory, the purpose of this quantitative correlational study was to examine the relationship between interpersonal relationships, recognition, and turnover intention. The participants consisted of 155 first-line supervisors within the automotive industry in the Midwest United States who responded to the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire Recognition Subscale, Workplace Friendship Scale, and six-item Turnover Intention Scale. The results of the multiple linear regression were statistically significant, F (2,141) = 14, p < .001, R 2 = .154. In the final model, one predictor, recognition, was statistically significant ( B = -0.403, t = -4.058, p < 0.001). A key recommendation is for business leaders to consider employee recognition when designing initiatives to reduce turnover intention. The potential implications of positive social change include enhanced employee retention, which may lead to higher wages and increased income tax revenues. These financial gains could, in turn, bolster funding for local social programs and infrastructure, benefiting communities.",

    "Abstract": "Background The insertion of a tracheostomy is an established technique used to wean patients off ventilatory support, manage secretions in complex conditions, and as a potentially life-saving procedure to bypass upper airway obstruction. Life-threatening complications during aftercare are not uncommon and may be influenced by a lack of education of carers or healthcare providers of children and young people living with a tracheostomy. Education programmes designed and supported by the National Tracheostomy Safety Project are effective, but resources are not available to educate the workforce at scale. With the overarching aim of widening access to paediatric tracheostomy skills training, we present the protocol for the development and evaluation of a novel virtual reality (VR) training tool designed to simulate the emergency management of paediatric tracheostomy complications. Methods and discussion A multi-centre, non-inferiority educational interventional study with historical controls will be used to evaluate the novel VR training package. A group of 69 healthcare staff and students will have one week to use the educational intervention as often as necessary to learn paediatric emergency tracheostomy skills. The primary outcome measure is skill performance in simulation in a pre- and post-intervention structure within subjects. Participant performance will also be assessed using non-inferiority metrics against historical traditional educational control data. Secondary outcomes include knowledge gain, knowledge retention, usability, side effects, and participant satisfaction. To minimise the risk of cybersickness, teleportation was the preferred locomotion method for the user navigation within the VR environment. Trial registration Full registration of this study was completed at ClinicalTrials.gov. The registration number is NCT06350708 and was accepted on the 4th April 2024.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of using gamification implemented in immersive virtual reality for the promotion of library services in the university library including knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention and user engagement. In terms of research procedure, we divided the participants into Gamified and Non-Gamified virtual reality groups, and both groups were asked to perform the pretest questionnaire of cognitive assessments. Then, participants were informed to use virtual reality to finish all the levels within one month in the library lab setting of the university. We performed post-tests to evaluate the knowledge acquisition, including a delayed post-test of three months to verify the knowledge retention. We also collected the user data to analyze the participant behavior. Results showed no significant differences among the Gamified and Non-Gamified groups in terms of knowledge acquisition, but showed significant difference in knowledge retention and user engagement. These findings supported the presumption that the gamified virtual reality approach can improve the library user’s access and knowledge retention of library services.",

    "Abstract": "Semantic dementia (SD) is characterized by progressive impairment in conceptual knowledge due to anterior temporal lobe (ATL) neurodegeneration. Extended neuropsychological assessments can quantitatively demonstrate the semantic impairment, but this graded loss of knowledge can also be readily observed in the qualitative observation of patients' recall of single concepts. Here, we present the results of a simple task of object drawing-from-name, by patients with SD (N = 19), who have isolated atrophy of the ATL bilaterally. Both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, patient drawings demonstrated a pattern of degradation in which rare and distinctive features (such as the hump on a camel) were lost earliest in disease course, and there was an increase in the intrusion of prototypical features (such as the typical small ears of most mammals on an elephant) with more advanced disease. Crucially, patient drawings showed a continuum of conceptual knowledge loss rather than a binary \"present\" or 'absent' state. Overall, we demonstrate that qualitative evaluation of line drawings of animals and objects provides fascinating insights into the transmodal semantic deficit in SD. Our results are consistent with a distributed-plus-hub model of semantic memory. The graded nature of the deficit in semantic performance observed in our subset of longitudinally observed patients suggests that the temporal lobe binds feature-based semantic attributes in its central convergence zone.",

    "Abstract": "Hypertension is a widespread and life-threatening condition affecting one-third of adults globally. In low- and middle-income countries, like Malawi, the burden of hypertension is escalating due to inadequate healthcare resources and lifestyle changes. Family members often become primary caregivers, playing a crucial role in managing hypertension through support and adherence to treatment. This study examined caregivers' knowledge retention by evaluating their pre- and post-health education knowledge levels. This was a prospective cross-sectional study in Neno, Malawi, a rural setting. 422 caregivers were enrolled from the Integrated Chronic Care Clinic (IC3). A structured questionnaire was used to collect baseline, post-health education, and week six data. Using SPSS V 22.0, comparison of knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) scores, correlation between KAP and between KAP and social demographic characteristics were done using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Pearson correlation, and independent t-test respectively. Among the 422 caregivers who participated in the study, 267 (63.2%) were females and mean age was 44.94 years. The baseline mean knowledge level score was 9.5 (38.0%) and rose to 21.08 (84.3%) p = 0.000 immediate post-health education and a 2.1% decrease 20.54 (82.2%) p<0.001 at week six from the immediate post health education score. Attitude improved from 16.76 (93.1%) at baseline to 17.74 (98.6%) at the six-week mark. Similarly, the mean practice score rose from 25.24 (78.9%) at baseline to 27.42 (85.7%) at week six. There was a positive correlation between KAP while age had a negative correlation with knowledge (r = -0.146; p = 0.003). There was a significant difference between different education levels on knowledge retention p = 0.009. There was a positive and good knowledge retention among caregivers of hypertensive patients after health education at the week six mark. With improved knowledge and the ability to retain it resulting in improved attitude and practices, caregivers are a cornerstone for continued and improved hypertension care for the patients.Hypertension is a widespread and life-threatening condition affecting one-third of adults globally.

    "Abstract": "Talent supply and demand is a concern in many key positions in all industries, including higher education. Understanding what attracts and retains IT staff is important for organizations, particularly in a tight labor market. Institutions that experience high turnover in Information Technology (IT) staff positions risk impacting student services, research, and day-to-day administration with the loss of knowledge and experience. Often, institutions are unable to launch major initiatives or meet financial goals due to poor talent management strategies to retain staff.The focus of this dissertation was to examine the strategy of a stay interview process intervention to better understand why IT staff stay at an institution. A stay interview is a tool used by institutions to gather data from long-term employees to understand what keeps them engaged and provides them the incentive to keep coming back daily. My two guiding questions that led the process of systematic inquiry and exploration of a stay interview included: (1) What is the efficacy of stay interviews in gauging IT employees' job and organizational satisfaction? (2) Does the stay interview process provide specific actions/ideas that IT leaders can implement to strengthen employee engagement and retention in our organization? These inquiry questions played a significant role in my Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycle and helped reveal the effectiveness of the stay interview tool to drive positive change in my IT department.The key findings illustrated that if implemented correctly, stay interviews can provide institutions with ideas for improvement, and show staff their feedback is important, and their service is valued. This inquiry discovered that a main value gained from the stay interview tool is providing an opportunity for our IT staff to share their perspectives, experiences, and motivations and uncover factors that contribute to increased engagement and retention. However, this process does require time and resources to implement effectively and may be met with resistance from employees and supervisors. By adopting best practices and acting on the feedback received, institutions can successfully implement stay interviews and reap the benefits of employee feedback in improving retention and creating a more satisfied and engaged workforce.

    "Abstract": "Anatomy education faces challenges in providing engaging, interactive, and collaborative learning experiences, particularly in understanding complex three-dimensional structures and maintaining long-term knowledge retention. Although virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in addressing spatial comprehension challenges, questions remain regarding its effectiveness in supporting collaborative learning and sustained knowledge retention. This longitudinal study examined Collaborative Immersive Virtual Anatomy Laboratory (C-IVAL), an innovative VR platform designed to enhance traditional anatomy learning through integrated collaborative features, immersive technology, and serious game elements. We conducted an experimental study with 65 medical students to evaluate their knowledge acquisition and technology acceptance compared to its non-collaborative predecessor, the Immersive Virtual Anatomy Laboratory (IVAL). Our evaluation framework combined quantitative assessments (knowledge tests, comprising pre-test, immediate post-test, and delayed post-test) with Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) analysis. Knowledge assessment revealed significant cognitive improvements, with mean knowledge scores increasing from 2.48 to 3.94 in the immediate post-tests, while long-term retention of anatomy knowledge showed sustained engagement for over two months. Importantly, C-IVAL demonstrated significantly higher scores across all TAM dimensions than the non-collaborative IVAL system, particularly for perceived usefulness and intention to use. Post-session feedback analysis showed 73.8% positive responses, highlighting enhanced social presence, immersive engagement, and effective collaboration, with 26.2% of constructive feedback focusing on system refinement and feature enhancement. This study contributes to the understanding of the effectiveness of collaborative features in virtual reality education by offering insights into designing and implementing virtual learning environments that enhance both knowledge retention and user acceptance.",

    "Abstract": "Contemporary neural networks frequently encounter the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, wherein newly acquired learning can overwrite and erase previously learned information. The paradigm of continual learning offers a promising solution by enabling intelligent systems to retain and build upon their acquired knowledge over time. This paper introduces a novel approach within the continual learning framework, employing deep reinforcement learning agents that process unprocessed pixel data and interact with microcircuit-like components. These agents autonomously advance through a series of learning stages, culminating in the development of a sophisticated neural network system optimized for predictive performance in the game of tic-tac-toe. Structured to operate in sequential order, each agent is tasked with achieving forward-looking objectives based on Bellman’s principles of reinforcement learning. Knowledge retention is facilitated through the integration of specific microcircuits, which securely store the insights gained by each agent. During the training phase, these microcircuits work in concert, employing high-energy, sparse encoding techniques to enhance learning efficiency and effectiveness. The core contribution of this paper is the establishment of an artificial neural network system capable of accurately predicting tic-tac-toe moves, akin to the observational strategies employed by humans. Our experimental results demonstrate that after approximately 5000 cycles of backpropagation, the system significantly reduced the training loss to L DQN < 0.1 , thereby increasing the expected cumulative reward. This advancement in training efficiency translates into superior predictive capabilities, enabling the system to secure consistent victories by anticipating up to four moves ahead.",

    "Abstract": "Motion planning in off-road scenarios is particularly challenging due to diverse terrain features, surface characteristics, and environmental factors. Consequently, rule-based or fixed-parameter motion planning methods often fail to maintain optimal performance, especially in cross-scenario applications. To address these issues, we propose an innovative method for end-to-end motion planning in off-road cross-scenario applications that leverages lifelong learning. We employ a multi-layer map to represent various terrain features and a Transformer network to emulate human motion planning in diverse off-road environments. Additionally, we constructed a structured scene memory library to support our lifelong learning algorithm, enabling effective knowledge retention and transfer across different scenarios. This ensures robust performance even in data-scarce environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance in data-scarce off-road scenarios while ensuring robust adaptability and scalability across diverse and new scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "The construction industry faces significant challenges including a critical skill shortage and an aging workforce, threatening the industry’s productivity, resilience, and knowledge retention. To address this issue, it becomes critical to attract, hire, and retain younger generations, particularly Generation Z (Gen Z), who are projected to become a dominant workforce by 2030. To this end, this study explores the employer preferences of Gen Z students joining the USA construction industry, providing valuable insights into their priorities and expectations. The study evaluates 27 employer of choice (EOC) factors to identify key criteria influencing Gen Z’s choice of employers. Analyses were conducted across various demographic and experiential categories, including gender, racial/ethnic backgrounds, first-generation status, those with loans, family influence, prior industry experience, intimidation by macho culture, and shifts in perspectives due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings reveal that Gen Z prioritizes respect, work–life balance, and job security, and values flexibility in work schedules and hybrid work environments. The findings were also used to propose eight recommendations for employers to become EOCs. Insights from this research serve a dual purpose by offering a foundation for further academic exploration and equipping industry practitioners with the data needed to tailor their recruitment and retention strategies to Gen Z.",

    "Abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained significant prominence in science education, yet its practical applications, particularly in teacher training, remain underexplored. Specifically, there is a lack of research on AI’s potential to support personalized professional development through automated analysis of classroom interactions and tailored feedback. As science teacher education requires skill development in complex scientific concepts within problem-based learning (PBL) contexts, there is a growing need for innovative, technology-driven instructional tools. AI-generated instructional videos are increasingly recognized as powerful tools for enhancing educational experiences. This study investigates the impact of AI-generated instructional videos, designed using established instructional design principles, on self-efficacy, task performance, and learning outcomes in science teacher education. Employing a within-subjects design, the current study included pre-test, post-test, and transfer assessments to evaluate learning durability and transferability, consistent with design-based research methodology. Moreover, this study compares the effectiveness of two AI-generated instructional video formats: one with an embedded preview feature allowing learners to preview key concepts before detailed instruction (video-with-preview condition) and another without this feature (video-without-preview condition). It specifically examines the role of preview features in enhancing these outcomes during training on scientific concepts with 55 Greek pre-service science teachers (n = 55; mean age 27.3 years; range 22–35). The results demonstrated that the videos effectively supported self-efficacy, task performance, and knowledge retention. However, no significant differences were observed between videos with and without preview features across all assessed metrics and tests. These findings also indicate that AI-generated instructional videos can effectively enhance knowledge retention, transfer, and self-efficacy, positioning them as promising assets in science teacher education. The limited impact of the preview feature highlights the need for careful design and evaluation of instructional elements, such as interactivity and adaptive learning algorithms, to fully realize their potential.",

    "Abstract": "The discovery of the value and obstacles of scenario-based training for law enforcement from a phenomenological perspective was pursued from a grounded theory. The lack of empirical data and research guided the use of the grounded theory methodology, which attempts through individual professional interviews to discover the values and obstacles of scenario-based training for law enforcement. Clarifications and comprehensive definitions of the constituent elements characterizing a scenario-based training methodology are presented while concurrently identifying the intricate interdependencies between its qualitative measurement and associated cost factors. The exploration of implementing scenario-based training was conducted through personal interviews of criminal justice practitioners with significant experience in leadership and training positions who were knowledgeable about the training challenges. The data collected from these practitioners were analyzed qualitatively, and themes and patterns from the transcribed interviews were identified. Participant responses to research questions upheld underlying assumptions that scenario-based training is preferred. Benefits such as knowledge retention and obstacles such as cost and time have been identified, preventing scenario-based training from becoming a primary learning methodology. It was discovered that further research is necessary to identify solutions to the obstacles identified in the study of scenario-based training in law enforcement.

    "Abstract": "Traditional educational methods in higher education, such as lectures and hands-on exercises, often struggle to fully engage students or address the complexities inherent in audiovisual signal coding. This gap underscores the need for innovative educational tools that not only foster deeper understanding but also enhance student engagement within the university setting. Effective evaluation of these tools requires comprehensive assessment of both learning outcomes and user experience. This study introduces three novel graphical user interface applications designed to strengthen foundational knowledge in audio, image, and video signal coding. These interactive tools, specifically developed for use in university courses, allow students to experiment with various coding techniques, providing hands-on experience that bridges theoretical concepts and practical application. Furthermore, we propose a robust methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of these tools in improving learning outcomes. The tools, developed using MATLAB, were integrated into a computer vision course and assessed through a combination of pre- and post-tests, the System Usability Scale, and the Evaluation Tool for Learning Quality. Results indicate a significant improvement in student knowledge and positive feedback regarding the usability and educational value of the tools. These findings suggest that the interactive nature of the tools not only enhances knowledge retention but also boosts student engagement, offering a valuable complement to traditional educational methods in higher education.",

    "Abstract": "Online Object Detection (OOD) requires learning new object categories from a stream of images, similar to an agent exploring new environments. In this context, the widely used architecture Faster R-CNN (Region Convolutional Neural Network) faces catastrophic forgetting: the acquisition of new knowledge leads to the loss of previously learned information. In this paper, we investigate the learning and forgetting mechanisms of Faster R-CNN in OOD through three main contributions. First, we observe that the forgetting curves of the Faster R-CNN exhibit patterns similar to those described in human memory studies by Hermann Ebbinghaus: knowledge is lost exponentially over time and recall improves knowledge retention. Second, we present a new methodology to analyse the Faster R-CNN architecture and quantify forgetting across the Faster R-CNN components. We show that forgetting is mainly localised in the Softmax classification layer. Finally, we propose a new training strategy for OOD called Configurable Recall (CR). CR performs recalls on old data using images stored in a memory buffer with variable frequency and recall length to ensure efficient learning. CR also masks the logits of old objects in the softmax classification layer to mitigate forgetting. We evaluate our strategy against state-of-the-art methods on three OOD benchmarks. We analyse the effectiveness of different types of recall in mitigating forgetting and show that CR outperforms existing methods.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This research explores human factors practices in the context of Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0 and the multigenerational workforce, promoting the evolution of Human Capital 4.0. With the emergence of generations Y and Z, organizations are more volatile, heightening the risk of tacit knowledge loss. Conditions conducive to retaining employees must be created, particularly by prioritizing engagement initiatives. Design/methodology/approach Addressing these imperatives required the adoption of a comprehensive mixed-methods methodology, which integrated a systematic literature review, a qualitative thematic analysis of 30 interviews conducted with employees from three multinational organizations and a quantitative statistical analysis of a questionnaire gathering 560 responses. Findings The study identifies essential practices for enhancing employee well-being, considering blue and white collars, using the PERMA model. It recommends adopting corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives and flexible work arrangements to improve positive emotion. Engagement is strengthened by aligning roles with employee strengths, offering ongoing learning opportunities and incorporating gamification. Strong Relationships are fostered through coaching, mentoring and participatory decision-making. Meaning in work is supported by encouraging a protean career attitude and integrating CSR activities to align personal and professional values. Accomplishment is achieved through lean management principles and recognition programs that facilitate goal achievement and employee appreciation. Originality/value This is the first multigenerational study to include Gen Z, both blue- and white-collar workers and the PERMA model, offering a set of practices designed to improve Human Capital 4.0 retention. These practices target adaptation to both the digital paradigm and the multigenerational environment as well as addressing the phenomena of the Great Resignation and Quiet Quitting.",

    "Abstract": "Objective This study aimed to evaluate the impact of escape games on nursing students' intravenous (IV) drug administration knowledge and skills while exploring their learning experiences. Background Drug administration is one of the most critical responsibilities in nursing, requiring knowledge and precision. Traditional teaching methods may not sufficiently address gaps in clinical skills and knowledge retention. This highlights the need for innovative approaches like escape games to enhance student learning, particularly in high-risk tasks like IV drug administration. Design A mixed-methods study with an explanatory sequential design was conducted. Methods: The study was conducted with 80 nursing students at the Faculty of Nursing, University X, from March to June 2024. The students were randomly divided into two groups: the intervention group, which participated in escape games designed to reinforce IV drug administration skills, and the control group, which received traditional education. Quantitative data were collected through the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) as pre-test, post-test, and follow-up tests. Qualitative data were gathered through semi-structured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews and then analyzed using content analysis. Results Quantitative analyses showed that the intervention group significantly outperformed the control group in post-test and follow-up test scores (p < 0.05). Qualitative findings revealed that students found escape games enjoyable, motivating, and effective in improving knowledge retention and stress management skills. Conclusion Escape games proved to be an effective method for enhancing nursing students' IV drug administration knowledge, skills, motivation, collaboration, and stress management, supporting their use in nursing education.",

    "Abstract": "Peer-led team learning is a socially mediated pedagogy where trained peer leaders, students who have completed a course, return to lead students in groups within a targeted course. The effect of peer-led team learning to improve student success in chemistry has been extensively documented but it is unclear if it is just as effective at facilitating retention of knowledge across time. This paper describes two studies designed to examine this possibility, each focusing on the impact of peer-led team learning in second-semester general chemistry on students’ long-term knowledge of chemical equilibrium. The first study measured student knowledge at three time points for one year following enrollment in general chemistry. The second study measured student knowledge while enrolled in analytical chemistry. Both studies used a repeated measures design and found no demonstrable effect of pedagogy on the long-term retention of knowledge. This finding indicates that concepts students hold in first-year chemistry remain long-standing throughout their undergraduate training, conceptual understanding of equilibrium shows ample room for improvement across both pedagogies, and peer-led team learning supports knowledge retention comparable to didactic instruction.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Medical students often struggle to engage with and retain complex pharmacology topics during their preclinical education. Traditional teaching methods can lead to passive learning and poor long-term retention of critical concepts. Objective: This study aims to enhance the teaching of clinical pharmacology in medical school by using a multimodal generative artificial intelligence (genAI) approach to create compelling, cinematic clinical narratives (CCNs). Methods: We transformed a standard clinical case into an engaging, interactive multimedia experience called “Shattered Slippers.” This CCN used various genAI tools for content creation: GPT-4 for developing the storyline, Leonardo.ai and Stable Diffusion for generating images, Eleven Labs for creating audio narrations, and Suno for composing a theme song. The CCN integrated narrative styles and pop culture references to enhance student engagement. It was applied in teaching first-year medical students about immune system pharmacology. Student responses were assessed through the Situational Interest Survey for Multimedia and examination performance. The target audience comprised first-year medical students (n=40), with 18 responding to the Situational Interest Survey for Multimedia survey (n=18). Results: The study revealed a marked preference for the genAI-enhanced CCNs over traditional teaching methods. Key findings include the majority of surveyed students preferring the CCN over traditional clinical cases (14/18), as well as high average scores for triggered situational interest (mean 4.58, SD 0.53), maintained interest (mean 4.40, SD 0.53), maintained-feeling interest (mean 4.38, SD 0.51), and maintained-value interest (mean 4.42, SD 0.54). Students achieved an average score of 88% on examination questions related to the CCN material, indicating successful learning and retention. Qualitative feedback highlighted increased engagement, improved recall, and appreciation for the narrative style and pop culture references. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of using a multimodal genAI-driven approach to create CCNs in medical education. The “Shattered Slippers” case effectively enhanced student engagement and promoted knowledge retention in complex pharmacological topics. This innovative method suggests a novel direction for curriculum development that could improve learning outcomes and student satisfaction in medical education. Future research should explore the long-term retention of knowledge and the applicability of learned material in clinical settings, as well as the potential for broader implementation of this approach across various medical education contexts.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to explore how informational faultlines impact new product creativity through specific mechanisms. The study focuses on analyzing how knowledge hiding mediates the relationship between informational faultlines and new product creativity, and how team promotion regulatory focus and team prevention regulatory focus moderate this process. Design/methodology/approach This research investigates the proposed hypotheses by examining sample data from 65 team leaders and 370 employees, delving into the relationship between informational faultlines and new product creativity and its underlying mechanisms. Findings Knowledge hiding negatively mediates the relationship between informational faultlines and new product creativity; team promotion regulatory focus negatively moderates the relationship between informational faultlines and knowledge hiding; team prevention regulatory focus positively moderates the relationship between informational faultlines and knowledge hiding; team promotion regulatory focus negatively moderates the mediating role of knowledge hiding in the link between informational faultlines and new product creativity. The higher the level of team promotion regulatory focus, the weaker the mediating role of knowledge hiding between informational faultlines and new product creativity, and vice versa; team prevention regulatory focus positively moderates the mediating effect of knowledge hiding in the relationship between informational faultlines and new product creativity. The higher the level of team prevention regulatory focus, the stronger the mediating effect of knowledge hiding on informational faultlines and new product creativity, and vice versa. Originality/value This paper constructs a novel moderated mediation model based on the need-threat model. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first to explore the relationship between informational faultlines and new product creativity from the perspective of knowledge retention, effectively filling the research gap on the role of knowledge hiding between informational faultlines and team innovative output and the moderate role of team motivational-based psychological characteristics, such as team regulatory focus, in the aforementioned mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "When instructing very large groups of students in science, it can be difficult to engage all students in the content and measure their understanding. A major unaddressed challenge in science instruction is how specifically to design and implement strategies that engender active learning particularly in high-enrollment undergraduate courses. Active learning, which represents a diverse set of strategies, may include student engagement as part of instruction through discussions, active movement, and application (Bernstein, 2018; Cavanagh, et al. 2016; Michael, 2006 & Wilke, 2003). This study was designed to provide data addressing the gap in the literature regarding how the continual implementation of several active learning strategies in a large enrollment undergraduate Human Physiology class impacts students. I chose three active learning modalities for this study from Bernstein (2018) -- kinesthetic and movement, discussion, and problem-based learning and assigned each to units of study during the semester on a rotating basis so that the learning modality not the unit of study could be studied. This project specifically targeted students' perceptions of learning through the three modalities and students' retention of targeted content in Human Physiology. Students responded to an end of semester survey and evaluation on how their learning was impacted. A second research component analyzed students' performance on summative exams under different active learning modalities to provide a comparative analysis across modalities and duration of the study. I found that students were overwhelmingly positive toward participating in these active learning environments and found these activities to be enjoyable and improve cognizance. In survey responses, students reported that active learning improved their knowledge retention and confidence in understanding the content. Students enjoyed and retained information and improved content retention leading to improved examination performance when taught with kinesthetic methods.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the impact of escape games on nursing students' intravenous (IV) drug administration knowledge and skills while exploring their learning experiences.Drug administration is one of the most critical responsibilities in nursing, requiring knowledge and precision. Traditional teaching methods may not sufficiently address gaps in clinical skills and knowledge retention. This highlights the need for innovative approaches like escape games to enhance student learning, particularly in high-risk tasks like IV drug administration. BACKGROUND Drug administration is one of the most critical responsibilities in nursing, requiring knowledge and precision. Traditional teaching methods may not sufficiently address gaps in clinical skills and knowledge retention. This highlights the need for innovative approaches like escape games to enhance student learning, particularly in high-risk tasks like IV drug administration.A mixed-methods study with an explanatory sequential design was conducted. DESIGN A mixed-methods study with an explanatory sequential design was conducted.The study was conducted with 80 nursing students at the Faculty of Nursing, University X, from March to June 2024. The students were randomly divided into two groups: the intervention group, which participated in escape games designed to reinforce IV drug administration skills, and the control group, which received traditional education. Quantitative data were collected through the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) as pre-test, post-test, and follow-up tests. Qualitative data were gathered through semi-structured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews and then analyzed using content analysis.

    "Abstract": "There have been extensive efforts to understand how concepts are represented in the brain. One phenomenon that has received much attention is the loss of knowledge seemingly restricted to a single category of items. This clinical observation, combined with many functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that find differential activation across the cortex depending on the category of the stimuli, has led to a general view of category related functional organization across the cortex. One class of models put forward to explain this phenomenon are experiential models of cognition. Experiential models, like the one examined in this dissertation, propose that, ultimately, all semantic knowledge is grounded in what is experienced. They posit that those regions of the cortex involved in experiencing an object (e.g., perceiving an object) are also involved in representing semantic knowledge about the object. Thus, the idea that different kinds of experiential information (e.g., color, sound, shape, touch, etc.) are differentially important across categories of concepts, combined with the fact that some regions of the brain preferentially process a particular type of experiential information, is hypothesized as a potential explanation for observed category organization. However, the ability of experiential models to explain category organization has hitherto not been empirically examined. This dissertation tests for a shared representational basis, consisting of experiential features, across all semantic categories, as implied by experiential models of semantics. Throughout this dissertation, experiential information is operationalized as human ratings for concepts along different features. FMRI is used to derive neural representations of concepts from participants as they read words and perform a semantic decision task. Using these data, this dissertation also tests the hypotheses that semantic features are hierarchically organized, and that accessing semantic information involves activation of relevant perceptual regions of cortex. This dissertation first describes and validates an fMRI dataset that is well suited for addressing the mentioned predictions of experiential models of semantic cognition. Following data validation, evidence for the categorical organization of the semantic system was found via both mass univariate and multivoxel pattern analyses. Then, encoding models constructed for each point on the cortical surface demonstrated that experiential features could predict activation category contrasts as well as activation patterns for individual stimuli across categorical boundaries. The subsequent chapter examines a relatively understudied yet distinctly represented category of concepts: body parts. We found that a robust network of regions was significantly more involved in the representation of body part concepts compared to concepts from other concrete noun categories. The implicated set of areas was shown to be predicted by experiential features using several analysis techniques. Lastly, using the neural activity patterns induced from participants reading words, feature sensitivity maps across the cortex were generated for a set of 14 experiential features. These maps were observed to hierarchically converge as the distance from canonical primary sensory cortices increased. The maps are also individually discussed with reference to prior literature. Results were mixed with regard to how well individual feature maps matched expectations derived from prior literature, and possible reasons for this are discussed. Taken together, the results of this dissertation offer strong support for the proposed explanation of category-related organization posited by an experiential model of concept representation.

    "Abstract": "Suicide is preventable, however suicide rates among children and adolescents are continuing to rise (Curtin & Heron, 2019). As such it is imperative that school psychologists who have an opportunity to impact the incidence of suicidal behaviors amongst students are properly trained in suicide prevention, postvention, laws, and ethics (Miller, 2014). However, there is little known about the efficacy of certain training approaches in suicide for school psychologists that may overcome barriers to implementation such as cost and time consumption (Dunn et al., 2013; Robinson et al., 2013). The present study sought to create a measure encompassing school psychologists' objective knowledge of suicide prevention/postvention best practices, laws, and ethics and their accuracy in implementing best practices, and sought to utilize this measure to evaluate the efficacy of a one-session, virtual, expert-led workshop. The knowledge segment comprised true/false questions regarding suicide prevention, postvention, laws and ethics. The accuracy portion encompassed hypothetical prevention and postvention situations with relevant evidence-based or nonevidence-based practices that were rated by likelihood of implementation on a 5-point scale. Upon review from experts in child/adolescent suicide and piloting of this measure with school psychologists, 50 practicing school psychologists completed the knowledge measure and vignettes before, one week after, and four weeks after attending a workshop. Their ages ranged from 26-65 with majority of participants being White women who work primarily in a public school setting. Knowledge measure and vignette scores significantly increased from pre-test to post-test time point and were maintained from post-test to follow up. Overall, this study highlights the efficacy of one session, virtual, expert-led workshops in increasing knowledge and application of knowledge. Past knowledge was found to be predictive of knowledge retention upon attending the workshop. Taken together these findings suggest that this format of training can be utilized for school psychologists in the field to remain current on best practices and follow up on prior knowledge to facilitate knowledge retention. As this training was only one hour and delivered in a virtual format, training in suicide can be more approachable and accessible to school psychologists. Other implications for practice and future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)",

    "Abstract": "Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, schools were forced to close their doors and alternative learning environments had to be established (Wyse et al., 2020). Most districts addressed this issue by creating virtual learning environments (Kaffenberger, 2021). The creation, adoption, and navigation of this new virtual environment created a plethora of opportunities for learning loss. Traditionally, learning loss is defined as any loss of knowledge and/or skills or reversal in academic progress, commonly due to gaps or discontinuities in a student's education (Cooper et al., 1996). Researchers studied the effects of learning loss and its impact on the preceding academic gap school year. These findings support the learning losses identified as a result of the alternative learning environments created by the Covid-19 pandemic (Patarapichayatham et al., 2021). When students entered school post-pandemic, districts were faced with addressing the increased academic challenges as a result of virtual and hybrid instruction which appeared to be not as effective as in person schooling (Harmey & Moss, 2021). The altered academic environment had a different impact on students' learning experiences particularly on student growth in ELA and mathematics (Patarapichayatham et al., 2021). In research presented by Bielinski et al. (2020), these challenges were the result of the Covid learning loss, decreased in-person attendance, and the need to adapt to varying learning environments. According to some studies, students returning to school post-pandemic after exposure to virtual learning fell below grade level for every month that they were not exposed to in-person learning (Harmey & Moss, 2021). Pre-pandemic learning, pandemic learning, and post-pandemic learning are three distinct experiences. This study explored the effects of the three learning environments on the reading levels of fourth-grade students in a suburban district.

    "Abstract": "Pain medicine is an advanced medical subspecialty incorporating trainees from diverse primary disciplines. A curriculum that does not assess or promote the trainees' differential expertise developed from their primary specialties may silo instead of promoting collaborative learning in a multidisciplinary subspecialty. INTRODUCTION Pain medicine is an advanced medical subspecialty incorporating trainees from diverse primary disciplines. A curriculum that does not assess or promote the trainees' differential expertise developed from their primary specialties may silo instead of promoting collaborative learning in a multidisciplinary subspecialty.We created a Kern-guided curriculum for the pain medicine fellowship utilizing case-based modules and a novel note-taking and knowledge-sharing format. Nine faculty-led, case-based modules of increasing complexity were developed based on pain medicine competency content. Pain medicine fellows were instructed to actively designate prior and new knowledge into 4 categories: prior knowledge that is accurate and relevant, inaccurate prior knowledge, new knowledge gained from peers, and new knowledge for all trainees. After each case study, each fellow acknowledged \"new knowledge gained from peers\" and prepared a brief teach-back of \"new knowledge for all trainees\" at the beginning of the next session. Fellow participants were assessed for their reactions to the curriculum via anonymized surveys.

    "Abstract": "Semantic dementia (SD) is characterized by progressive impairment in conceptual knowledge due to anterior temporal lobe (ATL) neurodegeneration. Extended neuropsychological assessments can quantitatively demonstrate the semantic impairment, but this graded loss of knowledge can also be readily observed in the qualitative observation of patients’ recall of single concepts. Here, we present the results of a simple task of object drawing-from-name, by patients with SD ( N = 19), who have isolated atrophy of the ATL bilaterally. Both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, patient drawings demonstrated a pattern of degradation in which rare and distinctive features (such as the hump on a camel) were lost earliest in disease course, and there was an increase in the intrusion of prototypical features (such as the typical small ears of most mammals on an elephant) with more advanced disease. Crucially, patient drawings showed a continuum of conceptual knowledge loss rather than a binary ‘present’ or ‘absent’ state. Overall, we demonstrate that qualitative evaluation of line drawings of animals and objects provides fascinating insights into the transmodal semantic deficit in SD. Our results are consistent with a distributed-plus-hub model of semantic memory. The graded nature of the deficit in semantic performance observed in our subset of longitudinally observed patients suggests that the temporal lobe binds feature-based semantic attributes in its central convergence zone.
