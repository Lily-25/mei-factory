The aim of this article is to review, analyse and discuss in detail the problems faced by urban ecosystems due to water surplus and scarcity, as well as the need of adaptation to climate change taking into account the legislation, current challenges and knowledge gaps. The literature review indicated that urban floods are much more recognised than urban droughts. Amongst floods, flash floods are currently the most challenging, which by their nature are difficult to monitor. Research and adaptation measures related to water-released hazards use cutting-edge technologies for risk assessment, decision support systems, or early warning systems, among others, but in all areas knowledge gaps for urban droughts are evident. Increasing urban retention and introducing Low Impact Development and Nature-based Solutions is a remedy for both droughts and floods in cities. There is the need to integrate flood and drought disaster risk reduction strategies and creating a holistic approach.","[Dabrowska, Jolanta; Kilian, Wojciech; Wloka, Agata] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Environm Engn & Geodesy, Dept Civil Engn, PL-50363 Wroclaw, Poland; [Orellana, Ana Eugenia Menendez] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Civil Engn, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland; [Moryl, Andrzej] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Environm Engn, Fac Environm Engn & Geodesy, PL-50363 Wroclaw, Poland; [Cielecka, Natalia] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Fac Environm Engn & Geodesy, Students Sci Circle Wspornik, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland; [Michalowska, Krystyna] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Geodesy, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland; [Policht-Latawiec, Agnieszka] Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Environm Engn & Land Surveying, Dept Land Reclamat & Environm Dev, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; [Michalski, Adam] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Fac Environm Engn & Geodesy, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland; [Bednarek, Agnieszka] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, UNESCO Chair Ecohydrol & Appl Ecol, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland",Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; Wroclaw University of Science & Technology; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology; University of Agriculture in Krakow; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; Institute of Geodesy & Cartography; University of Lodz,"Orellana, AEM (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Civil Engn, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland.",jolanta.dabrowska@upwr.edu.pl; 263367@student.pwr.edu.pl; wojciech.kilian@upwr.edu.pl; andrzej.moryl@upwr.edu.pl; 118042@student.upwr.edu.pl; krystyna.michalowska@pg.edu.pl; a.policht@urk.edu.pl; adam.michalski@upwr.edu.pl; agnieszka.bednarek@biol.uni.lodz.pl; agata.wloka@upwr.edu.pl,"; Moryl, Andrzej/B-9735-2017; Policht-Latawiec, Agnieszka/AAK-3277-2021; Włóka, Agata/A-8815-2017; Michałowska, Krystyna/AGL-1963-2022; Dąbrowska, Jolanta/S-7901-2016","Menéndez Orellana, Ana/0000-0002-8271-5135; Policht-Latawiec, Agnieszka/0000-0003-1628-9059; Michałowska, Krystyna/0000-0001-7749-3622; Dąbrowska, Jolanta/0000-0002-6017-6919",,,,184,52,60,23,130,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Postharvest physiology and technology of specialty crops aim to extend shelf-life, increase crop quality and mitigate losses. Rabbiteye blueberries, floricane blackberries and muscadines are among the most important small fruits for Alabama. These fruits are primarily marketed through local and regional outlets across the Southeast U.S. Yet, each of these small fruits exhibits distinct differences in shelf-life, optimal storage conditions, and susceptibility to postharvest degradation, which influence best handling practices and consumer satisfaction. To meet the demands of growers and consumers, new small fruit germplasm is constantly being developed. Many breeding programs have emphasized developing disease-resistant and heat-resilient genotypes with improved flavor and texture; however, postharvest suitability has been evaluated to a limited extent across newly developed germplasm. Understanding these crop-specific differences is essential for growers, distributors, and retailers aiming to maintain fruit quality and reduce postharvest losses throughout the supply chain. Shelf-life directly influences nutritional content, sensory attributes, and texture, all of which are critical to consumer acceptance. Texture degradation, particularly softening, greatly influences small fruit postharvest quality. Biochemical changes in cell structure can lead to a rapid decline in fruit firmness and overall acceptability. Given the perishability of small fruits, especially under high heat production and suboptimal storage conditions, postharvest research is urgently needed for Alabama to develop strategies that preserve quality and extend shelf-life. This includes screening new germplasm, refining storage protocols, and understanding textural and nutritional degradation. Postharvest research can identify key traits including firmness retention, color stability, water loss resistance, and flavor, thereby enhancing molecular knowledge to fast track the development of small fruit material with longer shelf-life and field heat resistance. Such efforts are essential for reducing small fruit loss, enhancing marketability, and supporting food security in Alabama and beyond.","[Trandel-Hayse, Marlee; Cochran-Chipura, Clarisse; Ephraim, Peter] Auburn Univ, Dept Hort, 101 Funchess Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Trandel-Hayse, M (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Hort, 101 Funchess Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",mat0141@auburn.edu,,,,,,115,0,0,0,0,AMER POMOLOGICAL SOC,UNIVERSITY PK,"102 TYSON BUILDING, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",1527-3741,,J AM POMOL SOC,J.

These coatings create a protective barrier while actively suppressing spoilage microorganisms, thereby preserving nutritional value, safety, and quality, with enhanced storability. This review examines recent advancements in antibacterial coating technologies, highlighting the specific effectiveness of materials such as chitosan for its broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties, pectin for its synergy with natural additives, and bio-based polymers like alginate and gum arabic for their biodegradability. Active agents, including zinc oxide nanoparticles (oxidative stress induction), titanium dioxide nanoparticles (photocatalytic activity), and nanocomposites (enhanced durability), are also critically evaluated. Beyond microbial control, these coatings regulate physiological processes such as moisture retention and respiration, thereby enhancing storability under various postharvest conditions. The review underscores the relevance of these technologies to key stakeholders, growers, distributors, and consumers, by reducing food waste, enhancing sustainability, and ensuring food security. By synthesising current findings, this work identifies practical applications and knowledge gaps, offering insights into the role of antibacterial coatings as a sustainable, cost-effective approach to addressing postharvest challenges in fruits and vegetables.","[El-Beltagi, Hossam S.] King Faisal Univ, Coll Agr & Food Sci, Agr Biotechnol Dept, Al Hasa 31982, Saudi Arabia; [Abdel-Haleem, Mohamed] Zagazig Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Zagazig, Egypt; [Al Saikhan, Mohamed S.; Shalaby, Tarek A.] King Faisal Univ, Coll Agr & Food Sci, Dept Arid Land Agr, Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia; [Mohamed, Amal A.] Al Leith Univ Coll, Umm Al Qura Univ, Chem Dept, Mecca, Saudi Arabia; [Khedr, Emad Hamdy] Cairo Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Pomol, Giza 12613, Egypt",King Faisal University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Zagazig University; King Faisal University; Umm Al-Qura University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"El-Beltagi, HS (corresponding author), King Faisal Univ, Coll Agr & Food Sci, Agr Biotechnol Dept, Al Hasa 31982, Saudi Arabia.;Khedr, EH (corresponding author), Cairo Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Pomol, Giza 12613, Egypt.",helbeltagi@kfu.edu.sa; emad.khedr@agr.cu.edu.eg,"Abd El-Haleem, Mohamed/NOE-3117-2025; El-Beltagi, Hossam/L-8546-2019; Shalaby, Tarek/O-3535-2016; Khedr, Emad/KSM-6035-2024; AL Saikhan, Mohamed/O-7407-2016","Abd El-Haleem, Mohamed/0000-0002-3140-9971;","King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia [KFU241847]; Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia","King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia(King Faisal University); Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia","We thank to Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia (KFU241847), for support this research work.",188,13,13,9,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-0316,2380-4084,J HORTIC SCI BIOTECH,J.

Soil erosion, water scarcity and land degradation pose threats to the viability of agricultural enterprises in rainfed areas, which comprise over 39.11 lakh ha, or 58.21 % of the net planted area. Soil water conservation is a tailored-made land management strategy that encompasses increased water availability in the soil matrix. This process involves minimizing evaporative losses, improving water infiltration and promoting retention of available moisture to support plant growth and ecosystem stability. By maintaining optimal soil moisture levels, these practices contribute significantly to agricultural resilience, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, while simultaneously mitigating the adverse effects of drought and water stress on crop productivity. This paper emphasizes the necessity of tailored conservation strategies to address the unique challenges posed by erratic rainfall patterns and fragile ecosystems. It discusses the critical significance of soil water conservation in enhancing soil health, supporting agricultural productivity and fostering environmental sustainability in regions prone to drought. Techniques such as subsoiling, conservation tillage, contour cultivation and various mulching methods are elaborated, highlighting their effectiveness in improving soil moisture retention, reducing erosion and promoting crop resilience. The integration of innovative practices such as crop rotation, intercropping and the use of soil amendments also shows promise in enhancing moisture conservation and agricultural yields. Furthermore, the document emphasizes the necessity of these practices in the wake of climate change, advocating for future advancements that combine traditional knowledge with cutting-edge technology. By integrating these soil and water conservation measures, the research advocates for sustainable agricultural practices that not only enhance productivity but also protect environmental integrity in rainfed regions of India. Overall, it underscores the imperative of sustainable agricultural practices in ensuring food security and ecological balance.","[Reddy, B.

To improve the productivity of this problematic soil, these limitations must be corrected. One such solution is amelioration through biochar, which has been the focus in the recent past. Biochars have a unique property of high alkalinity, porosity, specific surface area and cation exchange capacity, and low bulk density; and vary widely depending on the feedstock type and pyrolysis condition. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of biochar in ameliorating soil acidity, improving the soil structure and water retention. By acting as a reservoir of essential nutrients and its role in nutrient cycling, it affects the soil fertility and nutrient balance. Biochar also alters the soil biological properties by changing the soil microbial diversity and community structure, and enzymes involved in soil organic matter mineralization and nutrient cycling. The role of biochar application as a negative emission technology suggests that the effects vary depending on biochar properties, specific environmental and management conditions. Although biochar application produced yield benefits, many studies have reported adverse effects such as nutrient immobilization, yield depression, and gradual loss of its effect over time. As many of these studies are under controlled conditions, extrapolation to the field scale may be misleading and should be approached with caution. Future research should focus on interdisciplinary research with special attention on its long-term effects and economic assessment.","[Haokip, Immanuel Chongboi; Srivastava, Sanjay] ICAR Indian Inst Soil Sci, All India Coordinated Res Project Soil Test & Crop, Bhopal 462038, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Mayanglambam, Homeshwari Devi] ICAR Indian Inst Soil Sci, All India Network Project Soil Biodivers & Biofert, Bhopal, India; [Tasung, Ampee] ICAR RC North Eastern Hill Reg, Div Syst Res Engn, Basar, India; [Sunil, B.

Safety training has been a widely studied topic over the past two decades. Its primary aim is to save lives and minimise damage but requires regular refreshers. New digital technologies are helping in the process of enhancing safety training for better knowledge acquisition and retention. Among them, Virtual Reality (VR) can provide an engaging and exciting training experience, and there is a need to evaluate its application and effectiveness in safety training.This study aims to investigate VR safety training solutions applied to various industries (excluding medical and military applications), such as construction, fire, aviation, and mining. This was achieved by systematically reviewing 52 articles published between 2013 and 2021 to answer nine research questions. Fourteen domains were examined, with construction and fire safety training being the most prevalent since 2018. Findings reveal that only a small percentage (9.6 %) of the studies explicitly adopted theories while developing and testing VR applications. Additionally, this review highlights a critical need for long-term retention measurements, as only 36 % of studies provided such data. Finally, the two meta-analyses proposed in this work demonstrate that VR safety training outperforms traditional training in terms of knowledge acquisition and retention.","[Scorgie, D.; Feng, Z.; Paes, D.; Lovreglio, R.] Massey Univ, Sch Built Environm, Auckland, New Zealand; [Parisi, F.] Politecn Bari, Dept Elect & Informat Engn, Bari, Italy; [Yiu, T.

Methods: Computer searches were performed on 8 common Chinese and English databases such as PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang (Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform), VIP (China Science and Technology Journal Database), China Biomedical Literature Database and Cochrane Library, as well as Clinical Trials for the treatment of urinary retention after cervical cancer with acupuncture. A randomized controlled trial of postoperative urinary retention after cervical cancer from the time of library construction to 01/2024. The quality of the included literature was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Meta-analysis and risk of bias analyses were performed using RevMan 5.4, regression and sensitivity analyses were performed using Stata 17.0. Results: A total of 31 randomized controlled trials with 2179 patients were included in the study. Interventions included filiform needling, embedding needle, electroacupuncture, moxibustion, warm acupuncture, etc. The results showed that acupuncture treatment increased clinical efficiency [relative risk = 1.32, 95% confidence intervals [CI] (1.20, 1.45), P < .00001], reduced residual urine volume [standardized mean difference = -3.21, 95% CI (-4.00, -0.40), P < .00001], and shortened the time to return to spontaneous urination [MD = -1.96, 95% CI (-3.02, -0.91), P = .0003] and indwelling catheter time [mean difference (MD) = -3.76, 95% CI (-5.66, -1.86), P = .0001], and improved maximum urine flow rate [MD = 4.57, 95% CI (0.70, 8.44), P = .02] and bladder compliance [MD = 10.04, 95% CI (8.14, 11.93), P < .00001]. Conclusion: Acupuncture treatment promotes recovery in patients with postoperative urinary retention after cervical cancer, but high-quality studies need to be included to further compare different acupuncture interventions.","[Xu, Hui; He, Yujun; Miao, Furui; Fan, Yushan; Zhang, Fangzhi; Wang, Zibin; Wu, Yu] Guangxi Univ Chinese Med, Coll Acupuncture Moxibust & Tuina, Nanning, Peoples R China",Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine,"Miao, FR (corresponding author), Guangxi Univ Chinese Med, Fac Acupuncture Moxibust & Tuina, 179 Mingxiu East Rd, Nanning, Peoples R China.",1871883505@qq.com; 422346582@qq.com; snowymiao@163.com; 2859961032@qq.com; 2987848531@qq.com; 1518602864@qq.com,,,Doctoral Research Initiation Fund Project of Guangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine [2023BS017]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [82260983]; Special Project of TCM Talent Team Construction of Guangxi Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine-Prof Yushan Fan Guangxi Famous TCM Inheritance Studio [2023017-05-07]; Innovation Project of Guangxi Graduate Education [YCBZ2024148],Doctoral Research Initiation Fund Project of Guangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Project of TCM Talent Team Construction of Guangxi Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine-Prof Yushan Fan Guangxi Famous TCM Inheritance Studio; Innovation Project of Guangxi Graduate Education,This study is supported by Doctoral Research Initiation Fund Project of Guangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (2023BS017); National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82260983); The Special Project of TCM Talent Team Construction of Guangxi Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine-Prof Yushan Fan Guangxi Famous TCM Inheritance Studio (No. 2023017-05-07); Innovation Project of Guangxi Graduate Education (No. YCBZ2024148).,58,2,2,4,6,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),FEB 21,2025,104.0,8,,,,,,e41520,10.1097/MD.0000000000041520,0.0,,12,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,Y5B0Z,39993070.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001432263900021,0

The teacher shortage has resulted in non-specialist teachers teaching STEM subjects and is likely to have a negative effect on the next generation of STEM students and STEM teachers. Numerous studies have outlined, and in some cases evaluated, recruitment and retention interventions, but to our knowledge a comprehensive review of interventions specifically aimed at recruiting STEM teachers has not yet been done. We reviewed 25 studies (9 recruitment, 11 retention, 5 both). Most interventions were financial (13/25), others included teacher education and alternative pathways. We evaluated study quality and the method each study used to assess intervention effectiveness. Financial incentives do not appear effective for recruitment despite being the most common incentive. Financial incentives seem to be more effective for retention; 3/9 higher quality studies found positive results. Findings for the other types of intervention were mixed and due to low design quality, not compelling. Our findings suggest that financial incentives might be effective for retention. Further research is needed to determine what interventions work for recruitment as the most common, financial incentives, do not appear effective. Studies investigating the efficacy of interventions need to be more rigorous with large sample sizes, comparison groups, and ideally randomised-control trials. There is also room for innovation as we did not find much evidence of novel intervention types.","[Thompson-Lee, Sophie; Klassen, Robert Mark] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [See, Beng Huat] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, England",University of Oxford; University of Birmingham,"Thompson-Lee, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",sophie.thompson-lee@education.ox.ac.uk; b.h.see.1@bham.ac.uk; robert.klassen@education.ox.ac.uk,,"Thompson, Sophie/0000-0002-6537-9555",Economic and Social Research Council,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The researchers would like to thank Rebecca Snell for insights during the conceptualisation of this work.

Innovative N management strategy is an urgent need to achieve sustainable vegetable production. This paper summarizes recent studies on Nr losses and identifies the limitations from Chinese vegetable production systems and proposes three steps for sustainable N management in Chinese vegetable production. The three N management steps include, but are not limited to, (1) knowledge-based optimization of N fertilizer rate strategy, which maintains soil N supply to meet the dynamic vegetable demand in time, space and quantity; (2) innovative products and technology, which regulates the soil N forms and promotes the vegetable root growth to reduce the Nr loss; (3) integrated knowledge and products strategy (IKPS). The knowledge-based optimization of N fertilizer rate strategy and innovative products and technology, can maintain or increase vegetable yield, significantly improve NUE, and mitigate the region-specific and crop-specific Nr losses. More importantly, IKPS, based on combination of in-season root-zone N management strategy, innovative products and technology, and best crop cultivation management, is needed to produce more vegetables with lower Nr losses.","[Zhang, Fen; Wang, Junjie; Liu, Fabo; Ma, Xiao; Cao, Hailin; Chen, Xinping; Wang, Xiaozhong] Southwest Univ, Acad Agr Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Fen; Wang, Junjie; Liu, Fabo; Ma, Xiao; Cao, Hailin; Chen, Xinping; Wang, Xiaozhong] Southwest Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Agr Green Dev Yangtze R, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China; [Gao, Xiaopeng] Univ Manitoba, Dept Soil Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada",Southwest University - China; Southwest University - China; University of Manitoba,"Wang, XZ (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Acad Agr Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China.;Wang, XZ (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Agr Green Dev Yangtze R, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China.",wxz20181707@swu.edu.cn,"; Cao, Hailin/KHX-3183-2024; Wang, Junjie/HMV-8487-2023; Xinping, Chen/F-7305-2013; Gao, Xiaopeng/AAE-9242-2020","Zhang, Fen/0000-0002-3433-5138; Gao, Xiaopeng/0000-0002-6970-866X",Regional Innovation and Development Joint Fund project of National Foundation of China [U20A2047],Regional Innovation and Development Joint Fund project of National Foundation of China,Acknowledgements This work was supported by the Regional Innovation and Development Joint Fund project of National Foundation of China (U20A2047) .,94,12,13,3,68,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-7505,2095-977X,FRONT AGRIC SCI ENG,Front.

Gamification, the use of game mechanics in non-game environments, has emerged as a promising strategy in medical education. This review explores the applicability and effectiveness of gamification in obstetrics and gynecology education. Methods Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Medline databases from January to March 2023. The search terms included medical students OR residents OR physicians OR midwives AND games OR educational games OR serious games AND gynecology OR obstetrics. The inclusion criteria encompassed studies published in English or German from 1990 to March 2023, focusing on gamification in gynecology and obstetrics education. Data extraction and analysis were structured using the PICOS framework. Results The review identified various studies demonstrating the effectiveness of gamification in obstetrics and gynecology education. Gaming shows like Jeopardy significantly boosted knowledge retention and engagement. VR technologies, such as Second Life, enhanced emergency and surgical training. Improvisational games improved empathy skills, though requiring reinforcement. Video games and laparoscopy trainers showed promise in enhancing surgical skills, with gamers performing better in initial tasks. Custom-developed games like Play and Learn for Surgeons significantly improved procedural skills. Discussion Gamification in obstetrics and gynecology education boosts learner engagement, knowledge retention, and practical skills. VR technologies and video games are effective for surgical training, while custom games can enhance specific procedural skills. Further research is needed to optimize and integrate gamification strategies into standard curricula, offering a modern approach to equip healthcare professionals with essential skills and knowledge.","[Neubacher, Melissa] Univ Dusseldorf, Med Fac, Dept Gynecol & Obstet, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Neubacher, Melissa] Univ Dusseldorf, Univ Hosp Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Siebers, Pauline; Wittek, Agnes; Recker, Florian] Univ Hosp Bonn, Dept Obstet & Prenatal Med, Venusberg Campus 1, D-53127 Bonn, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf Hospital; University of Bonn,"Recker, F (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Bonn, Dept Obstet & Prenatal Med, Venusberg Campus 1, D-53127 Bonn, Germany.",florian.recker@ukbonn.de,"Recker, Florian/ABP-4557-2022","Recker, Florian/0000-0001-9135-4338",,,,27,5,7,5,19,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0016-5751,1438-8804,GEBURTSH FRAUENHEILK,Geburtshilfe Frauenheilkd.,DEC,2024,84.0,12,,,,1126,1134,,10.1055/a-2379-8729,0.0,AUG 2024,9,Obstetrics & Gynecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Obstetrics & Gynecology,O9X4R,39649126.0,"Green Submitted, hybrid",2026-02-03,WOS:001299517500001,0

Despite its inclusion in many school curricula, there is no consensus on the most effective teaching methodologies. This systematic review aims to compare instructional strategies used in first aid training during Physical Education and evaluate their impact on students' knowledge, practical skills, and confidence. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Six databases (SCOPUS, Web of Science, ERIC, DIALNET, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) were searched up to December 2024. Eligible studies were quasi-experimental or observational, involved students aged 11-18, and focused on first aid instruction within Physical Education. Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. Results: Eleven studies with a total of 3069 students aged 11-18 were included. Active and technology-based methodologies outperformed traditional approaches, improving knowledge acquisition (10.2-30.5%) and practical skill development (18.6-42.3%). Long-term retention ranged from 14.2% to 45.8%, with longer interventions yielding better outcomes. Gamification, simulations, and peer learning improved CPR quality and boosted student confidence. However, most studies assessed only short-term outcomes, limiting conclusions about sustained learning. Conclusions: Active methodologies, particularly gamification, simulation, and cooperative learning, enhance knowledge retention, practical skills, and confidence in providing first aid. Although the results were consistently positive, methodological heterogeneity and limited long-term follow-up reduce their generalizability. Further high-quality, longitudinal research is needed to identify the most effective and sustainable strategies. These findings support integrating first aid training into Physical Education as a public health initiative to strengthen emergency preparedness in schools.","[Parada-Espinosa, Jose Maria] Univ Cadiz, Fac Educ Sci, Puerto Real 11519, Spain; [Ortega-Gomez, Sonia; Ruiz-Munoz, Manuel] Univ Cadiz, Fac Educ Sci, Inst Invest Innovac Biomed Cadiz INiB, MOVE IT Res Grp,Dept Phys Educ, Cadiz 11009, Spain; [Gonzalez-Silva, Jara] Univ Seville, Fac Educ, Seville 41013, Spain",Universidad de Cadiz; Universidad de Cadiz; University of Sevilla,"Ortega-Gómez, S (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Fac Educ Sci, Inst Invest Innovac Biomed Cadiz INiB, MOVE IT Res Grp,Dept Phys Educ, Cadiz 11009, Spain.",josemaria.paradaespinosa@alum.uca.es; sonia.ortega@uca.es; manuel.ruizmunoz@alum.uca.es,,"Ortega-Gómez, Sonia/0000-0001-8589-5672; Parada-Espinosa, Jose María/0000-0001-8686-0623",,,,58,1,2,6,9,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9032,HEALTHCARE-BASEL,Healthcare,MAY 10,2025,13.0,10,,,,,,1112,10.3390/healthcare13101112,0.0,,19,Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Health Care Sciences & Services,3AJ6R,40427949.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001495625300001,0

Prolonging the drying step causes the degradation of ascorbic acid and anthocyanins in some food matrix. Generally, the faster freezing rate, the higher drying temperature, and the shorter drying time can produce freeze-dried fruits and vegetables with higher retention of phytochemicals and bioactive activity. During storage, the small pore structure causes degradation of carotene and other compounds sensitive to oxygen, and the collapse freeze-dried sample showed higher retention of those substances. Freeze-drying has become an important technology used to extend shelf-life and to preserve food nutritional quality. It is most recommended for high-value foods and those containing heat-sensitive ingredients. However, to our knowledge, there are significant differences in the retention of phytochemicals in various fruits and vegetables during freeze-drying, which need to be summarized and explained. Thus,the evolution of the bioactive substances and free radical scavenging abilities of fruits and vegetables based on the freeze-drying procedure will be explored in this review.

This systematic review evaluated the literature between January 2000 and August 2024 to understand how virtual reality (VR) in Anatomy Education is implemented in Health Sciences and Allied Health, focusing on learning outcomes and student perceptions. Following registration with the Open Science Framework and adhering to PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search across nine databases identified fifteen eligible studies. The learning outcomes assessed included knowledge acquisition, retention, conceptual understanding, and learning confidence, alongside perceptions of VR as a learning tool, user experience, and satisfaction. Fifty percent (4/8) of the studies evaluating knowledge acquisition and retention reported statistically significant improvements following VR adoption. Enhanced conceptual understanding and learning confidence were consistently reported. All studies exploring perceptions highlighted positive views of VR, emphasizing its effectiveness as a learning tool. Additionally, user experience and satisfaction outcomes were uniformly favorable across all studies. Of the eight studies comparing alternative teaching methods, 75% (6/8) reported VR surpassed traditional teaching methods, including lectures, prosections, 2-dimensional (2D) models, 3-dimensional (3D) printing, cadavers, or advanced technologies such as augmented reality (AR). However, VR configurations, comparator modalities, and participant demographics were shown to influence learning effectiveness. Immersive VR dominated as the intervention of choice, while the role of VR controllers in anatomy education was underexplored. This review identifies the potential of VR in anatomy education while also pointing out areas needing further research, particularly the influence of VR hardware configurations and user interaction modalities on learning outcomes.","[Adnan, Sharmeen; Benson, Amanda C.; Xiao, Junhua] Swinburne Univ technol, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Biomed Hlth & Exercise Sci, Hawthorn, Vic, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology,"Xiao, JH (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Sch Hlth Sci, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",jxiao@swin.edu.au,"Benson, Amanda/JAN-9641-2023; Xiao, Junhua/AAC-6898-2022","Xiao, Junhua/0000-0002-4320-2855",,,No Statement Available,139,4,4,3,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1935-9772,1935-9780,ANAT SCI EDUC,Anat.

This comprehensive understanding and adept utilization of surface anatomy principles serve as the linchpin for deciphering normal anatomical structures within medical imaging and the aptitude to articulate the topographical attributes, visual characteristics, and interrelations of palpable anatomical entities. Despite the advent of advanced direct visualization techniques, such as ultrasound guidance, which assist in interventional procedures, clinicians have not relinquished the indispensable requirement for pertinent surface anatomy knowledge to ensure the successful and secure execution of procedures. Regrettably, evidence-based surface anatomy remains an underemphasized facet in the pedagogy of anatomical sciences. The current narrative review underscores the various methodologies employed in imparting surface anatomy education to students. However, it is noteworthy that no singular, unequivocal best practice has emerged for the teaching and acquisition of surface anatomy knowledge. Therefore, as custodians of anatomical education, there is a pressing need to innovate and amalgamate contemporary pedagogical approaches with state-of-the-art technologies to furnish students with evidence-based surface anatomy insights, thereby enhancing comprehension, retention, and the lasting utility of this essential domain of medical knowledge.","[Patra, Apurba; Chaudhary, Priti] All India Inst Med Sci, Bathinda, India; [Asghar, Adil] All India Inst Med Sci, Patna, India; [Ravi, Kumar Satish] All India Inst Med Sci, Gorakhpur, India",All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Patna,"Patra, A (corresponding author), All India Inst Med Sci, Bathinda, India.",apurba.cnmc03@gmail.com,"Asghar, Adil/AAJ-6689-2020; patra, apurba/ABB-2315-2020; RAVI, KUMAR SATISH/AAY-2021-2020","Chaudhary, Priti/0000-0002-5869-1743; patra, apurba/0000-0002-1107-4481; RAVI, KUMAR SATISH/0000-0003-0527-2825",,,,43,2,2,1,1,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2156-8650,MED SCI EDUC,Med.

However, persistent challenges in reducing header losses, enhancing adaptability to diverse agro-conditions, and advancing intelligent mechanization impede optimal performance. This critical review synthesizes current knowledge on sunflower harvesting header technology, focusing on these key challenges. It systematically analyzes the evolution of header designs and the functional intricacies of core components-dividers, gathering units, cutting mechanisms, and conveying systems-with a particular emphasis on their inherent limitations and impact on loss generation and operational flexibility. The paper critically evaluates existing loss reduction strategies for kernel shattering, head dropping, and improper stalk handling, reframing them within a systems engineering (Harvesting-Machine-Environment-Crop) context and exploring the potential of Sense-Decide-Act intelligent control paradigms. Special attention is given to the difficulties faced in adapting current technologies to varied sunflower cultivars and complex farming scenarios, such as those prevalent in China. By identifying key technological bottlenecks and knowledge gaps, this review charts a clear path towards intelligent mechanization. It outlines future research priorities and technological advancements necessary for developing next-generation sunflower headers that are not only efficient and low-loss but also highly adaptable and intelligent, thereby addressing the pressing needs of the modern sunflower industry.","[Tang, Zhong; Tai, Sheng; Jing, Tiantian; Guo, Xiaohu] Jiangsu Univ, Coll Agr Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China; [Tang, Zhong] Jiangsu Univ, Key Lab Equipment Modern Agr Equipment & Technol, Minist Educ, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Bin; Wang, Shiguo; Liu, Yang] Xinjiang Acad Agr & Reclamat Sci, Shihezi 832000, Peoples R China",Jiangsu University; Jiangsu University; Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural & Reclamation Science,"Tang, Z (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Coll Agr Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China.;Tang, Z (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Key Lab Equipment Modern Agr Equipment & Technol, Minist Educ, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China.;Li, B (corresponding author), Xinjiang Acad Agr & Reclamat Sci, Shihezi 832000, Peoples R China.",zht@ujs.edu.cn; 2222316031@stmail.ujs.edu.cn; bin175337620@shzu.edu.cn; 2212316039@stmail.ujs.edu.cn; 2222216058@stmail.ujs.edu.cn,,"Tai, Sheng/0009-0007-3151-6252; tang, zhong/0000-0002-2724-115X","Youth Science Project under the Corps Science and Technology Program [2024DB021]; Key Laboratory Equipment of Modern Agricultural Equipment and Technology (Jiangsu University), Ministry of Education [MAET202306]; Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Youth Talent Development Program; Science and technology project of the Xinjiang Production [2025CYL07]; Postgraduate Research & Practice Inno-vation Program of Jiangsu Province [KYCX25_4249]","Youth Science Project under the Corps Science and Technology Program; Key Laboratory Equipment of Modern Agricultural Equipment and Technology (Jiangsu University), Ministry of Education; Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Youth Talent Development Program; Science and technology project of the Xinjiang Production; Postgraduate Research & Practice Inno-vation Program of Jiangsu Province","This study has been supported by Youth Science Project under the Corps Science and Technology Program (2024DB021) and the Key Laboratory Equipment of Modern Agricultural Equipment and Technology (Jiangsu University), Ministry of Education (MAET202306), and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Youth Talent Development Program, and the science and technology project of the Xinjiang Production (2025CYL07), and Postgraduate Research & Practice Inno-vation Program of Jiangsu Province (KYCX25_4249).",157,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2772-3755,SMART AGR TECHNOL,Smart Agric.

Through data collected from astronauts, as well as animal and cellular experiments conducted in space, it is evident that microgravity induces skeletal deconditioning in weight-bearing bones. This review identifies contentions in current literature describing the effect of microgravity on non-weight-bearing bones, different bone compartments, as well as the skeletal recovery process in human and animal spaceflight data. Experiments in space are not readily available, and experimental designs are often limited due to logistical and technical reasons. This review introduces a plethora of on-ground research that elucidate the intricate process of bone loss, utilising technology that simulates microgravity. Observations from these studies are largely congruent to data obtained from spaceflight experiments, while offering more insights behind the molecular mechanisms leading to microgravity-induced bone loss. These insights are discussed herein, as well as how that knowledge has contributed to studies of current therapeutic agents. This review also points out discrepancies in existing data, highlighting knowledge gaps in our current understanding. Further dissection of the exact mechanisms of microgravity-induced bone loss will enable the development of more effective preventative and therapeutic measures to protect against bone loss, both in space and possibly on ground.","[Man, Joey; Graham, Taylor; Squires-Donelly, Georgina; Laslett, Andrew L.] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Mfg, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia; [Man, Joey; Graham, Taylor; Squires-Donelly, Georgina; Laslett, Andrew L.] Monash Univ, Australian Regenerat Med Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Man, Joey; Laslett, Andrew L.] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO, Space Technol Future Sci Platform, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute; Monash University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Man, J; Laslett, AL (corresponding author), Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Mfg, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia.;Man, J; Laslett, AL (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Australian Regenerat Med Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.;Man, J; Laslett, AL (corresponding author), Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO, Space Technol Future Sci Platform, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia.",joey.man@csiro.au; andrew.laslett@csiro.au,"; Laslett, Anew/A-9760-2011","Graham, Taylor/0000-0002-7864-3562; Laslett, Anew/0000-0003-4729-8193","Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) [ST-R2-04, ST-R2-04] Funding Source: Medline",Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),,160,82,105,12,67,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",,2373-8065,NPJ MICROGRAVITY,NPJ Microgravity,APR 5,2022,8.0,1,,,,,,9,10.1038/s41526-022-00194-8,0.0,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,0H6IB,35383182.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:000778834800001,0

Therefore, there has been a widespread search for learning methods that incorporate digital technologies and active student participation in recent years. Game-based learning may be an option, as it uses gamedesign elements to enhance academic performance and learning. Its use in nursing education is, however, limited.Objectives: The literature review aimed to explore student experience and learning when using game-based learning and to understand its uses in the nursing curriculum.Design: Systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis.Data sources: ESBCO Discovery Service was used to search healthcare, science and education-related databases.Review methods: A comprehensive search of English language primary research published between 2017 and 2022 on the use of game-based learning in nursing undergraduate education was conducted. Data was analysed using thematic analysis.Results: Seventeen papers from 4 different countries were included. The studies explored interventions and subjects of increased teaching complexity that required increased levels of knowledge retention and critical thinking, such as nursing theory and complex clinical skills. Three themes emerged from the literature, including: approaches to game-based learning; student experience and engagement; impact of game-based learning on student learning and knowledge retention. Studies used a wide range of learning methods, such as quizzes, escape rooms and serious games. These methods were in general well-accepted by students, who endorsed its widespread use in the nursing curriculum. Most studies reported an increase in student experience and learning when using game-based learning, although time-limited games can often increase anxiety on students.Conclusions: Game-based learning is an important alternative to traditional teaching methods.

This raises important questions for neuroanatomy education regarding which teaching techniques are most beneficial for knowledge acquisition and long-term retention, and how they are best implemented. This focused systematic review aims to provide a review of technology-enhanced teaching methods available to neuroanatomy educators, particularly in knowledge acquisition and long-term retention, compared to traditional didactic techniques, and proposes reasons for why they work in some contexts. Methods Electronic databases were searched from January 2015 to June 2020 with keywords that included combinations of 'neuroanatomy,' 'technology,' 'teaching,' and 'effectiveness' combined with Boolean phrases 'AND' and 'OR.' The contexts and outcomes for all studies were summarised while coding, and theories for why particular interventions worked were discussed. Results There were 4287 articles identified for screening, with 13 studies included for final analysis. There were four technologies of interest: stereoscopic views of videos, stereoscopic views of images, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). No recommendation for a particular teaching method was made in six studies (46%) while recommendations (from weak to moderate) were made in seven studies (54%). There was weak to moderate evidence for the efficacy of stereoscopic images and AR, and no difference in the use of stereoscopic videos or VR compared to controls. Conclusions To date, technology-enhanced teaching is not inferior to teaching by conventional didactic methods. There are promising results for these methods in complex spatial anatomy and reducing cognitive load. Possible reasons for why interventions worked were described including students' engagement with the object, cognitive load theory, complex spatial relationships, and the technology learning curve. Future research may build on the theorised explanations proposed here and develop and test innovative technologies that build on prior research.","[Newman, Hamish J.; Meyer, Amanda J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Human Sci, Dept Anat Physiol & Human Biol, Perth, WA, Australia; [Newman, Hamish J.; Carr, Sandra E.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Allied Hlth, Hlth Profess Educ, 35 Stirling Hwy, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Wilkinson, Tim J.] Univ Otago, Educ Unit, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Pather, Nalini] Univ New South Wales, Fac Med & Hlth, Dept Anat, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; University of Otago; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Newman, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Allied Hlth, Hlth Profess Educ, 35 Stirling Hwy, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",newmahj@gmail.com,"; Pather, Nalini/B-5793-2009; Wilkinson, Tim/C-5515-2008","Newman, Hamish/0000-0001-7213-7290; Pather, Nalini/0000-0001-5288-7713; carr, sana/0000-0003-0043-4362; Meyer, Amanda J/0000-0001-7953-6040; Wilkinson, Tim/0000-0002-4080-4164",,,,54,11,13,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-159X,1466-187X,MED TEACH,Med.

Several factors contribute to hair loss, including aging, androgen hormone effects, genetics, and diseases. Normally, physicians treat hair loss using medications such as minoxidil and finasteride. However, these treatments are associated with side effects and some limitations. Currently, hair transplantation is the most efficient technique; however, it requires the use of numerous hair grafts. Stem cell and hair follicle cell (HFC) treatments have been developed for hair-loss treatment. Previously, stem cell and HFC therapies have been shown to promote hair development, prolong the anagen phase, and increase hair diameter and density. In addition, growth factors and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important for prolonging the anagen phase, improving hair follicle health, and reducing dihydrotestosterone effects. Furthermore, gene therapy and tissue engineering have also been developed as treatments for hair loss. In this review, we discuss (i) the basic knowledge and molecular signaling relevant to hair regeneration and (ii) advanced technology medical treatments for hair loss (stem cells, HFCs, growth factor, EVs, gene therapy, and tissue engineers).","[Kaewmungkun, Kwanrudee; Parnpai, Rangsun] Suranaree Univ Technol, Embryo Technol & Stem Cell Res Ctr, Sch Biotechnol, Nakhon Ratchasima 30000, Thailand; [Kaewmungkun, Kwanrudee; Kaisang, Somruethai; Yokhaphachon, Nattida] MEDEZE Grp Publ Co Ltd, MEDEZE Res & Dev, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand",Suranaree University of Technology,"Parnpai, R (corresponding author), Suranaree Univ Technol, Embryo Technol & Stem Cell Res Ctr, Sch Biotechnol, Nakhon Ratchasima 30000, Thailand.",rangsun@g.sut.ac.th,,,,,,87,0,0,7,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0963-6897,1555-3892,CELL TRANSPLANT,Cell Transplant.,,2025,34.0,,,,,,,9636897251382318,10.1177/09636897251382318,0.0,,17,"Cell & Tissue Engineering; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Transplantation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Cell Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Transplantation,8UP8Q,41122868.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001597727300002,0

However, due to its bulkiness and low economic value, it is costly to transport over long distances and store for long periods. Refinement processes to valorize digestate and facilitate its handling as a fertilizer include precipitation of phosphorus-rich mineral compounds, such as struvite and calcium phosphates, membrane filtration methods that concentrate plant nutrients in organic products, and carbonization processes. However, phosphorus retention efficiency in output products from these processes can vary considerably depending on technological settings and characteristics of the digestate feedstock. The effects of phosphorus in plant fertilizers (including those analogous or comparable to refined digestate products) on agronomic productivity have been evaluated in multiple experiments. In this review, we synthesized knowledge about different refinement methods for manure-based digestate as a means to produce phosphorus fertilizers, thereby providing the potential to increase phosphorus retention in the food production chain, by combining information about phosphorus flows in digestate refinement studies and agronomic fertilizer studies. It was also sought to identify the range, uncertainty, and potential retention efficiency by agricultural crops of the original phosphorus amount in manure-based digestate. Refinement chains with solid/wet phase separation followed by struvite or calcium phosphate precipitation or membrane filtration of the wet phase and carbonization treatments of the solid phase were included. Several methods with high potential to extract phosphorus from manure-based wet phase digestate in such a way that it could be used as an efficient plant fertilizer were identified, with struvite precipitation being the most promising method. Synthesis of results from digestate refinement studies and agronomic fertilizer experiments did not support the hypothesis that solid/wet separation followed by struvite precipitation, or any other refinement combination, results in higher phosphorus retention than found for unrefined digestate. Further studies are needed on the use of the phosphorus in the solid phase digestate, primarily on phosphorus-rich soils representative of animal-dense regions, to increase understanding of the role of digestate refinement (particularly struvite precipitation) in phosphorus recycling in agricultural systems.","[Persson, Tomas; Rueda-Ayala, Victor] NIBIO, Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Dept Grassland & Livestock, As, Norway",Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research,"Persson, T (corresponding author), NIBIO, Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Dept Grassland & Livestock, As, Norway.",tomas.persson@nibio.no,"; Persson, Tomas/AGJ-5474-2022","Rueda-Ayala, Victor/0000-0002-9159-8276; Persson, Tomas/0000-0002-7117-9023",Norwegian Research Council [294625],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"This study was conducted within the project Manure, fish slurry and digestate: from problem to farmers gold (MAFIGOLD) funded by the Norwegian Research Council (project number 294625).",116,6,6,4,68,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

J,"Liu, CC; Mo, FY","Liu, Chengchun; Mo, Fanyang",Automation and AI-Powered Prediction in Chromatographic Separation,ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH,English,Review,,ORGANIC-SYNTHESIS; DIGITIZATION; SYSTEM,"Chromatography remains one of the most versatile separation technologies in chemistry, spanning thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for rapid analysis, column chromatography (CC) for purification, gas chromatography (GC) for volatile analytes, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for precise and enantioselective separations. Despite its centrality, the development of chromatographic methods has long relied on empirical trial-and-error and tacit practitioner knowledge, making reproducibility and systematic optimization difficult. The convergence of laboratory automation and artificial intelligence (AI) is now reshaping this landscape. Automated platforms generate large-scale, standardized data sets, while machine-learning models capture quantitative relationships between molecular structures, chromatographic conditions, and retention outcomes. Crucially, by embedding mechanistic constraints-such as polarity-driven adsorption, programmed heating effects, or stereochemical recognition-models transcend black-box prediction and deliver interpretable insights into separation mechanisms. Our research illustrates how chromatography can be transformed into a predictive science through the integration of automation, machine learning, and cross-method transfer. Robotic TLC and CC systems provide reproducible polarity data that inform predictive models and even transferable equations linking TLC R f values to CC retention volumes. Multimodal frameworks extend these principles to GC, combining molecular features with heating programs to predict retention under dynamic conditions. For HPLC enantioseparation, chirality-aware graph neural networks capture subtle stereochemical differences and, when coupled with uncertainty quantification, yield separation probabilities that mirror experimental decision-making. This Account focuses on the development of a unified framework for AI-assisted chromatography, highlighting advances in data acquisition, feature engineering, algorithmic design, and cross-scale modeling. Together, these developments chart a path toward universal chromatographic predictors-tools that are accurate, interpretable, and transferable across methods. By closing the loop with automated experimentation, they lay the foundation for predictive and programmable chromatography capable of accelerating discovery and enhancing reproducibility across the chemical sciences.","[Liu, Chengchun; Mo, Fanyang] Peking Univ, Sch AI Sci, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chengchun; Mo, Fanyang] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, AI Sci AI4S Preferred Program, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chengchun; Mo, Fanyang] Peking Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Adv Waterproof Mat, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Mo, Fanyang] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Mat, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Mo, Fanyang] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Nanomicro Mat Res, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School (PKU Shenzhen); Peking University; Peking University; Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School (PKU Shenzhen); Peking University; Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School (PKU Shenzhen); Peking University; Peking University; Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School (PKU Shenzhen),"Mo, FY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch AI Sci, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.;Mo, FY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, AI Sci AI4S Preferred Program, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.;Mo, FY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Adv Waterproof Mat, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Mo, FY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Adv Mat, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.;Mo, FY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Nanomicro Mat Res, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",fmo@pku.edu.cn,"Liu, Chengchun/LSI-8507-2024","Liu, Chengchun/0009-0002-5550-4145","Shenzhen Government [NA]; Shenzhen Graduate School, Peking University [NA]","Shenzhen Government; Shenzhen Graduate School, Peking University",We thank Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School and Shenzhen Government for the start-up funding support.

The hydrochar solid product's capacity to prepare precursors of activated carbon has attracted attention. HTC has been utilized to solve practical issues and produce desired carbonaceous products on a variety of generated wastes, including municipal solid waste, algae, and sludge in addition to the typically lignocellulose biomass used as sustainable feedstock. This study aims to assess the in-depth description of hydrothermal carbonization, highlighting the most recent findings with regard to the technological mechanisms and practical advantages. The process parameters, which include temperature, water content, pH, and retention time, determine the characteristics of the final products. The right setting of parameters is crucial, since it significantly affects the characteristics of hydrothermal products and opens up a range of opportunities for their use in multiple sectors. Findings reveal that the type of precursor, retention time, and temperature at which the reaction is processed were discovered to be the main determinants of the HTC process. Lower solid products are produced at higher temperatures; the carbon concentration rises, while the hydrogen and oxygen content declines. Current knowledge gaps, fresh views, and associated recommendations were offered to fully use the HTC technique's enormous potential and to provide hydrochar with additional useful applications in the future.","[Sivaranjanee, R.; Kumar, P.

However, their practical application is often constrained by instability under environmental stressors such as pH fluctuations, heat, light, and oxygen. In response, both traditional and innovative strategies have emerged to improve pigment stability, with some studies reporting up to 50-80% retention of colour intensity under optimised conditions. Most existing research focuses on extraction, with limited emphasis on post-processing stability. This article reviews a wide range of food processing strategies aimed at enhancing the stability of natural pigments. It covers conventional and emerging approaches, including natural chemical stabilisers such as co-pigments, antioxidants, and metal ion chelators, physicochemical methods such as micro- and nanoencapsulation using biopolymers, and physical interventions involving drying technologies, particle size modification, and protective packaging. Modern technologies such as high-pressure processing, pulsed electric fields, ultrasound, and cold plasma are discussed as promising non-thermal alternatives, demonstrating 20-70% improvement in pigment retention compared to untreated controls.

H.; Uribe, Juan S.",Mixed reality neurosurgical simulations and adult learning theories: a systematic review,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE,English,Review,Learning theories; Mixed reality; Neurosurgical education; Skill acquisition; Virtual simulation,,"Background: Neurosurgical education relies on rigorous training to help learners develop technical proficiency and neuroanatomical comprehension. Traditional teaching methods, such as cadaveric dissections and live surgical observations, face limitations associated with accessibility, cost, and ethical concerns. Mixed reality (MR), an emerging technology within extended reality, offers an interactive and immersive approach to surgical training. This review examines the effectiveness of MR in neurosurgical education through established adult learning theories, aiming to determine the optimal integration model for enhancing trainee skill acquisition and knowledge retention. Methods: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane databases was conducted. The search included studies of MR applications in neurosurgical education aligned with adult learning theories. A total of 341 articles were identified, with 18 meeting the inclusion criteria after screening. Studies were categorized based on their integration of adult learning theories, including experiential learning, constructivism, behaviorism, cognitivism, and self-directed learning. Data extraction focused on MR applications, assessment metrics, and performance improvements among trainees. Results: The review found that MR-based neurosurgical training improved spatial understanding, procedural accuracy, and trainee engagement. Experiential learning was the most frequently applied model (18 studies), followed by constructivism (15 studies), behaviorism (7 studies), and cognitivism (6 studies). Studies on cranial procedures demonstrated enhanced spatial cognition and motor skills, whereas studies exploring spinal procedures, such as pedicle screw placement, showed increased precision and greater trainee confidence. Although no studies explicitly emphasized andragogy or connectivism, MR's integration of feedback mechanisms and realtime simulation was found to facilitate skill refinement and knowledge retention. Conclusions: MR-based neurosurgical training aligns effectively with theories of adult learning, particularly experiential and constructivist learning. The technology enhances procedural accuracy and spatial awareness, contributing to improved neurosurgical education. Although MR accelerates the learning curve, randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate its long-term impact on surgical performance. Incorporating MR into neurosurgical curricula could revolutionize training by fostering active learning, optimizing skill acquisition, and improving patient safety.","[Giraldo, Juan P.; Dholaria, Nikhil; Williams, Nicholas; Michaels, Chinami; Ehredt, Ryan B.; Fotias, Demos J.; Cho, Steve S.; Sonntag, Volker K.

Understanding human anatomy requires specific skills from physiotherapy students to comprehend and memorize the location and relationships of anatomical structures. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on teaching methodologies in anatomy education for undergraduate physiotherapy students. A scoping review was conducted consulting the PubMed, EBSCO, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases. By analyzing ten studies involving over 1380 students, we identified four primary pedagogical approaches: the use of technological tools, combined traditional methods (such as dissections and radiological imaging), interprofessional education, and the innovative use of animal dissections. The findings highlight that hands-on, practical activities, especially those integrating technology (e.g., virtual reality and interactive quizzes), significantly enhance student engagement and knowledge retention. Collaborative learning through interprofessional education was found to foster a deeper understanding of anatomical concepts and improve teamwork skills, which are crucial for clinical practice. Additionally, the inclusion of traditional methods like dissections and radiological imaging, when paired with modern tools, offers a comprehensive approach that bridges theoretical knowledge with practical application. The use of animal dissections also emerged as an innovative strategy to enhance anatomical comprehension. In conclusion, the literature underscores the importance of adopting diverse and innovative teaching strategies in gross anatomy education for physiotherapy students. Such approaches not only enrich the learning experience but also ensure that students are well prepared for the demands of professional practice.","[Soto-Correia, Mariangela; Plaza-Manzano, Gustavo; Valera-Calero, Juan Antonio] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Nursery Physiotherapy & Podiatry, Dept Radiol Rehabil & Physiotherapy, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Plaza-Manzano, Gustavo; Valera-Calero, Juan Antonio] Inst Invest Sanitaria Hosp Clin San Carlos IdISSC, Grp InPhysio, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Plaza-Manzano, Gustavo; Valera-Calero, Juan Antonio] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Grp Innovac Docente Grp Innovac Docente Consolidad, Alcorcon 28922, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Plaza-Manzano, G; Valera-Calero, JA (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Nursery Physiotherapy & Podiatry, Dept Radiol Rehabil & Physiotherapy, Madrid 28040, Spain.;Plaza-Manzano, G; Valera-Calero, JA (corresponding author), Inst Invest Sanitaria Hosp Clin San Carlos IdISSC, Grp InPhysio, Madrid 28040, Spain.;Plaza-Manzano, G; Valera-Calero, JA (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Grp Innovac Docente Grp Innovac Docente Consolidad, Alcorcon 28922, Spain.",masoto06@ucm.es; gusplaza@ucm.es; juavaler@ucm.es,"Valera Calero, Juan Antonio/GVS-2413-2022; PLAZA MANZANO, GUSTAVO/Y-3263-2018","Valera Calero, Juan Antonio/0000-0002-3379-8392; PLAZA MANZANO, GUSTAVO/0000-0003-1596-5027",Camilo Jose Cela University (VIRDITA) [SF01_2022],Camilo Jose Cela University (VIRDITA),"This research was funded by Camilo Jose Cela University (VIRDITA, SF01_2022).",37,2,3,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7102,EDUC SCI,Educ.

This review summarizes current knowledge (with emphasis placed on the US Midwest) related to corn response to short-term weather stresses of (i) cold temperature, (ii) excess water, (iii) hail/defoliation damage, and (iv) wind damage. Each section presents summaries of how corn growth and yield are affected, provides context into past events experienced, identifies agronomic or production recommendations to correct or alleviate the stress condition, and proposes areas where future research is needed. This review also highlights challenges associated with controlled simulation work on these stressors, and also identifies key areas to expand future research efforts. In general, yield losses associated with strong storms and short-term weather events often ranged from 5% to 35%, but extreme cases could result in up to 80%-100% yield loss. Much of the literature on these topics was published prior to 1995, though it still forms the basis for modern agronomic guidance, which is problematic given the changes in agriculture in the last 20 years in management practices, available genetics and technologies, and changing environmental conditions. Revisiting these foundational studies and expanding them to examine current and future weather conditions are critical for better informing agronomic recommendations, for devising mitigation strategies, and for determining accurate yield loss expectations following these stresses. Climatic shifts are resulting in more frequent strong storms and adverse weather for corn. Storms and weather stress reduce corn yield 5%-35%, though greater losses are possible. Foundational knowledge produced prior to 1995 should be re-assessed to ensure accuracy in modern systems. Updating agronomic recommendations with modern technology is critical to ensure crop security.","[Lindsey, Alexander J.; Thomison, Peter R.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Hort & Crop Sci, Columbus, OH USA; [Ortez, Osler A.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Hort & Crop Sci, Wooster, OH USA; [Carter, Paul R.] Corteva Agrisci LLC, Johnston, IA USA; [Coulter, Jeffrey A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Agron & Plant Genet, St Paul, MN USA; [Roth, Greg W.; Carrijo, Daniela R.] Penn State Univ, Dept Plant Sci, State Coll, PA USA; [Quinn, Daniel J.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agron, W Lafayette, IN USA; [Licht, Mark A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Agron, Ames, IA USA; [Lindsey, Alexander J.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Hort & Crop Sci, 312A Kottman Hall,2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Iowa State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Lindsey, AJ (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Hort & Crop Sci, 312A Kottman Hall,2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",lindsey.227@osu.edu,"Ortez, Osler/JDM-3861-2023; Licht, Mark/L-4030-2019; Lindsey, Alexander/ADH-8342-2022","Licht, Mark/0000-0001-6640-7856; Lindsey, Alexander/0000-0002-3216-1496",Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC); Ohio State University [HCS23-14],Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC); Ohio State University(Ohio State University),"The authors would like to thank Chad Lee, Jennifer Rees, and Carl Joern for their photo contributions used in this manuscript.

This study examines the significance of traditional soil management techniques used in Uttar Pradesh, India, and assesses their effectiveness in addressing modern agricultural challenges. The primary objective of this analysis is to investigate how indigenous practices, such as crop rotation, intercropping, organic manure application, and traditional water conservation techniques, contribute to soil fertility and sustainability. By examining these traditional methods, the study aims to assess their potential for integration with contemporary agricultural practices to enhance overall soil health and agricultural productivity. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature was conducted to synthesize findings from various studies on traditional soil management practices in Uttar Pradesh. The analysis highlights the mechanisms by which these practices affect soil properties and fertility and identifies the strengths and limitations associated with their use. The findings reveal that traditional methods offer significant benefits, including enhanced soil structure, improved nutrient availability, and increased moisture retention. However, challenges such as limited adoption of modern technologies and varying regional practices are also noted. The integration of traditional knowledge with modern techniques is evaluated as a means to address these challenges and optimize soil management strategies. This analysis bridges the gap between traditional knowledge and contemporary agricultural practices, providing valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners. The study underscores the importance of integrating traditional soil management practices with modern approaches to foster sustainable agriculture in Uttar Pradesh and similar regions.","[Sahu, Himanshu; Purohit, Pooja] Wildlife Inst India, Dept Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Sahu, Himanshu; Purohit, Pooja] Bhomya Fdn, Res & Dev, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Sahu, Himanshu] Acad Sci & Innovat Res AcSIR, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mishra, Arun Pratap] Earthtree Enviro Pvt Ltd, Dept Forestry & Remote Sensing, Shillong, Meghalaya, India; [Kumar, Amit] Wildlife Inst India, Dept Habitat Ecol, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Sardar, Purnendu] Lund Univ, Ctr Adv Middle Eastern Studies, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci INES, Lund, Sweden; [Durin, Bojan] Univ North, Dept Civil Engn, Varazhdin, Croatia; [Rathnayake, Upaka] Atlantic Technol Univ Sligo, Fac Engn & Design, Dept Civil Engn & Construct, Sligo, Ireland",Wildlife Institute of India; Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR); Wildlife Institute of India; Lund University; University North - Croatia; Atlantic Technological University (ATU),"Mishra, AP (corresponding author), Earthtree Enviro Pvt Ltd, Dept Forestry & Remote Sensing, Shillong, Meghalaya, India.;Rathnayake, U (corresponding author), Atlantic Technol Univ Sligo, Fac Engn & Design, Dept Civil Engn & Construct, Sligo, Ireland.",arunpratap7371@gmail.com; upaka.rathnayake@atu.ie,"Rathnayake, Upaka/S-2435-2019; Đurin, Bojan/AAW-6282-2021; Sahu, Himanshu/LFU-6307-2024; Sardar, Purnendu/AAD-7172-2021; Mishra, Arnab/AEN-7117-2022","Sardar, Purnendu/0000-0001-5491-3700;",,,,169,0,0,2,4,Accscience Publishing,Singapore,"8 Burn Road#15-03 Trivex, Singapore, SINGAPORE",0972-9860,1875-8568,ASIAN J WATER ENVIRO,Asian J.

Background: Understanding bioscience is essential for nurses to provide effective patient care. Despite its importance, students often struggle with the complex content and limited learning time. Design: A mixed-methods systematic review was employed following the PRISMA guidelines. Methods: Four databases (CINAHL, Medline, Web of Science and PubMed) were searched using keywords related to nursing education and bioscience. Inclusion criteria focused on peer-reviewed studies published from 2003 to 2023 that evaluated teaching or learning methods for bioscience in undergraduate nursing students. A narrative synthesis was conducted. Results: This review includes 98 studies from 28 countries. Active learning methods generally improved student engagement, understanding, and retention of knowledge. Technology-enhanced learning provided immersive and interactive experiences, despite cost and scalability challenges. Traditional teaching methods were valued by students for their insights and application to clinical practice. Blended learning approaches catered to diverse learning preferences and improved learning. Conclusions: Most teaching and learning approaches appear to improve bioscience education for undergraduate nursing students, supporting short-term improvements in knowledge and student satisfaction. No single active learning method was identified as the most effective. Effective support and learning opportunities both in and out of the classroom are important, as are strategies to allow application of theory to practice. Future research should further evaluate the long-term impact of different teaching and learning methods for bioscience in undergraduate nursing education.","[Manchester, Kieran R.; Roberts, Debbie] Univ Bradford, Sch Nursing & Healthcare Leadership, Bradford, England",University of Bradford,"Manchester, KR (corresponding author), Univ Bradford, Sch Nursing & Healthcare Leadership, Bradford, England.",k.r.manchester@bradford.ac.uk,"Manchester, Kieran/JQJ-4280-2023",,,,,120,5,5,3,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",1471-5953,1873-5223,NURSE EDUC PRACT,Nurse Educ.

This makes it more important than ever to look closely at how melting glaciers affect both the environment and the communities that depend on them. To truly understand what is being lost- or even gained- we need to study glaciers from many angles. This includes looking at the science of ice and water, the plural value of nature, local politics, and possible future changes. We bring these different aspects under the framework called socio-glaciology. This method looks beyond just economic impacts and includes political ecology and plural valuations to cover knowledge about health, the ability to move or adapt, cultural traditions, local knowledge, and people's connection to their land.Technical summary As ice retreat undermines glaciers' contributions to people, there is a pressing need for in-depth analysis of the complex interactions between the glacier environments and the societies living in, and engaging with affected areas in the decades to come. In order to fully understand what is lost, damaged, and even gained, we advocate for a research design that combines glaciology, hydrology, ecosystems services, political ecology, and future scenarios studies. A socio-glaciology approach (SG) can uncover the nuances of non-economic losses, including, but not limited to loss of life, health, technology, human mobility, territory, cultural heritage, and local knowledge. SG as an interdisciplinary framework proposes to study society-glacier interactions as well as values with a circular research design, by integrating local knowledge, experiences, and preferences with more instrumental tools of scientific observations and computer modeling. We argue for reflexivity, meaning that methodologies for understanding glacier change in relation to people should be grounded in local experiences and preferences, while also being relevant and useful for policy, decision-making, and the development of strategies to manage environments and societies of the cryosphere.Technical summary As ice retreat undermines glaciers' contributions to people, there is a pressing need for in-depth analysis of the complex interactions between the glacier environments and the societies living in, and engaging with affected areas in the decades to come.

Simulation-based training is prominently used in the military for all roles of care to provide the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to render care from the battlefield to the hospital. The purpose of this scoping review is to synthesize the body of research in military healthcare simulation, highlight trends in the literature, and identify research gaps. Materials and Methods: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis process, the databases of PubMed, Google Scholar, and targeted conferences were searched for articles focused on simulation-based training in the military healthcare community. Inclusion criteria required that the studies assessed a healthcare simulation intervention and had military participants. Data were gathered on population parameters (branch of service and provider level) as well as study parameter (simulation modality, medical domain, and outcome measures). Outcome measures were categorized according to the Kirkpatrick model of training evaluation. Results: A total of 43 articles met inclusion criteria. Article summaries and descriptive data on the participant populations and study parameters are provided in Tables 1 , 2 , and Supplementary Table S1 . Conclusions: Participant populations were inclusive of all the services and roles of care, suggesting appropriate representation of the broad military healthcare community. The majority of literature has studied physical simulations, such as manikins or task trainers. Few studies employed augmented or virtual reality as the training intervention, likely because of the nascency of the technology. Trauma care was the focus of 65% of the studies; this is attributable to the criticality of trauma care within battlefield medicine and casualty response. Related to study outcomes, participant reactions, such as usability and user acceptance, and immediate learning outcomes were heavily studied. Retention and behavioral changes were rarely studied and represent a significant research gap. Future research assessing mixed reality technologies would be beneficial to determine whether the technology warrants inclusion in programs of instruction. Finally, studies with outcome measures including long-term knowledge and skills retention, behavioral change, or patient outcomes are strongly recommended for future research.","[Caffery, Sophia J.; Ferrari, Brock D.; Hackett, Matthew G.] US Army DEVCOM Soldier Ctr, Orlando, FL 32826 USA",,"Caffery, SJ (corresponding author), US Army DEVCOM Soldier Ctr, Orlando, FL 32826 USA.",Sophia.J.Caffery2.civ@army.mil,"; Hackett, Matthew/HKO-3783-2023","Caffery, Sophia/0009-0000-1639-5885;",,,,47,1,3,3,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0026-4075,1930-613X,MIL MED,Milit.

By examining patient satisfaction with and the usability and efficacy of chatbot interventions, this study seeks to support the integration of chatbot technology into cancer education.MethodsThis review, which was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, included studies from MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to May 2024. The main inclusion criterion was chatbot interventions for breast cancer education. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager and Open Meta-Analyst software.ResultsOf the 208 articles initially identified, 6 studies met the inclusion criteria, involving a total of 1342 women with early-stage or at-risk hereditary breast cancer. The meta-analysis revealed that most participants (85 to 99%) reported high satisfaction with chatbot interventions for breast cancer education, with no significant differences in satisfaction compared to genetic counselors or physicians. The chatbot interventions also showed positive effects on knowledge acquisition (mean proportion = 90.8%) and alleviated patients' symptoms significantly more than routine care.ConclusionThis study demonstrated that chatbots can effectively provide personalized and interactive educational support, enhancing patients' understanding and retention of disease-related information.

Spaced repetition, grounded in the forgetting curve, strengthens long-term retention and promotes meaningful learning. Its integration with artificial intelligence (AI) enables personalized review intervals, automated generation of learning materials, and immediate feedback, thereby expanding the pedagogical potential of this strategy. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of AI-assisted spaced repetition in Health Sciences education. Methods: A descriptive systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020. Searches were performed in Google Scholar and Web of Science (2020-2025) using the terms spaced repetition, medical education, learning, and artificial intelligence. Original studies, reviews, and applied reports addressing spaced repetition with or without AI were included. From 1870 initial records, 18 studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed qualitatively. Results: Direct evidence showed that AI enhances the personalization of review intervals, improves feedback quality, and supports knowledge consolidation. Indirect evidence confirmed the effectiveness of traditional spaced repetition, with sustained benefits in academic performance and memory in standardized examinations. Complementary evidence highlighted that AI strengthens other educational processes, such as automated tutoring, clinical simulation, and microlearning. Conclusions: AI-assisted spaced repetition represents an innovative pedagogical strategy aligned with competency-based medical education. It facilitates personalized learning, strengthens retention, and promotes student autonomy. However, methodological limitations in the available studies highlight the need for longitudinal and multicenter research to assess its educational and clinical impact, along with ethical strategies to ensure equity and human verification in the use of these technologies.","[Espinel, Jennifer Carolina Duque] Univ San Gregorio Portoviejo, Docencia Ciencias Salud, Manabi, Ecuador; [Casquete, Andres Leonardo Garcia] Univ San Gregorio Portoviejo, Portoviejo, Ecuador; [Garcet, Yoiler Batista] Univ San Gregorio Portoviejo, Med, Portoviejo, Ecuador",Universidad San Gregorio de Portoviejo USGP; Universidad San Gregorio de Portoviejo USGP; Universidad San Gregorio de Portoviejo USGP,"Espinel, JCD (corresponding author), Univ San Gregorio Portoviejo, Docencia Ciencias Salud, Manabi, Ecuador.",e.jcduque@sangregorio.edu.ec; ybatista@sangregorio.edu.ec,"; Batista Garcet, Yoiler/IUN-5938-2023","García Casquete, Andrés Leonardo/0009-0001-2185-2363; Batista Garcet, Yoiler/0000-0002-7851-5763",,,,23,0,0,0,0,UNIV MURCIA,Murcia,"Edificio Pleiades Campus de Espinardo, Murcia, 30071, SPAIN",,2660-8529,SPAN J MED EDUC,Span.

This study, through a meta-analysis, reviewed 32 empirical studies with 2201 participants published between 2010 and 2022. The results showed that chatbot technology exerted a medium-to-high effect on overall learning outcomes regardless of moderator variables, i.e., intervention duration, chatbot roles, and learning content. In terms of learning components, chatbots could significantly improve explicit reasoning, learning achievement, knowledge retention, and learning interest despite negative findings in critical thinking, learning engagement, and motivation. Future research could expand chatbot research by including different learning components.","[Deng, Xinjie; Yu, Zhonggen] Beijing Language & Culture Univ, Fac Foreign Studies, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Beijing Language & Culture University,"Yu, ZG (corresponding author), Beijing Language & Culture Univ, Fac Foreign Studies, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",yuzhonggen@blcu.edu.cn,"Deng, Xinjie/GLR-9248-2022; Yu, Zhonggen/AAJ-3063-2020","Deng, Xinjie/0000-0002-8901-3080;",,,,71,124,160,64,425,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2023,15.0,4,,,,,,2940,10.3390/su15042940,0.0,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,9L3WF,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:000941481900001,0

While abundant data support their positive effect on weight loss, there remains a notable dearth of information regarding their effects on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). As rates of type 2 diabetes and obesity have grown worldwide, so has the rate of MASLD. Therefore, addressing these knowledge gaps is crucial in improving liver health worldwide. In this review, we aim to provide the existing evidence delineating the effects of primary and secondary endoscopic bariatric therapies on MASLD and determine knowledge gaps requiring future study. Utilizing PubMed search with relevant keywords such as endoscopic bariatric therapies, NAFLD (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease), we gathered case reports, reviews, and retrospective analyses, evaluating their data and limitations. In our manuscript, we detail many primary and secondary endoscopic therapies and the literature available exploring their impact on liver health. This review demonstrates that primary EBMTs improve noninvasive liver markers, weight loss, and overall metabolic syndrome suggesting significant benefit in MASLD. There is, however, a significant lack of literature studying how primary endoscopic therapies compare amongst each other and how revisional therapies affect MASLD. We additionally offer suggestions for future research to deepen our understanding of EBMTs and their effects on MASLD. (Surg Obes Relat Dis 2025;21:175-183.)

The risks of such floods involve multiple factors and stakeholders, and frameworks for integrated approaches have attracted a global community of experts. The paper reviews the knowledge base for integrated flood risk management frameworks, including more than twenty bibliometric reviews of their elements. The knowledge base illustrates how integrated strategies for the reduction of flood risk are required at different scales and involve responses ranging from climate and weather studies to the construction of infrastructure, as well as collective action for community resilience. The Integrated Flood Management framework of the Associated Programme on Flood Management of the World Meteorological Organization was developed more than twenty years ago and is explained in some detail, including how it fits within the Integrated Water Resources Management concept that is managed by the Global Water Partnership. The paper reviews the alignment of the two approaches and how they can be used in tandem to reduce flood losses. Success of both integrated management approaches depends on governance and institutional capacity as well as technological advances. The knowledge base for flood risk management indicates how technologies are advancing, while more attention must be paid to social and environmental concerns, as well as government measures to increase participation, awareness, and preparedness. Ultimately, integrated flood management will involve solutions tailored for individual situations, and implementation may be slow, such that perseverance and political commitment will be needed.","[Grigg, Neil S.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University System; Colorado State University Fort Collins,"Grigg, NS (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",neilg@engr.colostate.edu,,,,,,117,13,16,2,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,CLIMATE,Climate,MAY,2024,12.0,5,,,,,,67,10.3390/cli12050067,0.0,,17,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,SD8M8,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001232612200001,0

C. CHENG; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; GENE LOSSES; PINACEAE; INSIGHTS; PLASTOMES,"Background Advances in DNA sequencing technology have led to a rapid increase in the number of species with organelle genomes and even complete nuclear genomes being sequenced. Thousands of plastid genomes from across all major clades of land plants are now available, and one of the surprising findings is the recurring event of complete or functional loss of genes involved in cyclic electron transport during photosynthesis, i.e. the ndh genes that encode subunits of the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex. Gene loss in non-photosynthetic, heterotrophic plants might be expected, but the increasing number of losses being discovered in autotrophic plants calls into question the role and potential dispensability of the ndh genes and the entire NDH complex.Scope With a focus on autotrophic plants, the present review compiles published evidence about the loss of both plastid and nuclear encoded NDH genes, providing an overview spanning all major clades of land plants. Current knowledge about the function of NDH and the possible reasons behind repeated loss are discussed.Conclusions More than 100 independent events of plastid ndh gene loss have been reported from autotrophic land plants, and strong evidence exists that these losses go hand in hand with the loss of nuclear encoded NDH genes. Although loss is almost inevitable in heterotrophic plants and common among carnivorous plants, it occurs in what appears to be a random manner among normal, autotrophic plants. No single underlying reason for the events of loss can be discerned, although a link to nutrient acquisition prevails. Even in autotrophic plants, the NDH complex might simply be dispensable owing to the existence of an alternative and major pathway of cyclic electron transport around photosystem I.","[Petersen, Gitte] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Petersen, G (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",gitte.petersen@su.se,"Petersen, Gitte/H-1903-2011","Petersen, Gitte/0000-0002-2325-0059",,,,228,1,1,3,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Despite their analogous physical processes can be used for accelerating the advancements in UHS technology, the existing distinctions possibly may hinder direct applicability. This review therefore contributes to advancing our fundamental understanding on the key differences between UCS and UHS through multi-scale comparisons. These comparisons encompass key factors influencing underground gas storage, including storage media, trapping mechanisms, respective fluid properties, petrophysical properties, and injection scenarios. They provide guidance for the conversion of our existing knowledge from UCS to UHS, emphasizing the necessity of incorporating these factors relevant to their trapping and loss mechanisms.

Safety training is critical for enhancing personal safety awareness and reducing accident severity and numbers. Augmented Reality (AR) is an emerging technology that superimposes digital information onto the real-world environment, which can offer an active, immersive, and interactive learning environment, making it a promising tool for safety training. However, to date, there is limited research that systematically evaluates the application and effectiveness of AR safety training. This study aims to comprehensively explore the application and effectiveness of AR safety training solutions in various industries, excluding the military and medicine. To achieve this, a systematic analysis of 37 papers published between 2014 and February 2024 was conducted. Our analysis addresses eight research questions. The results indicate that existing AR applications cover thirteen domains, with the construction, manufacturing, and transportation industries being the most common domains. The results also indicate a limited focus on measuring knowledge retention in the selected studies. Additionally, there is a lack of comparison between different AR hardware and display technologies. Two meta-analyses were carried out and they reveal that AR technology has a significant positive impact on safety training. However, no significant difference in knowledge acquisition was observed between AR training and traditional training. These findings have implications for future research and applications of AR safety training.","[Gong, Peizhen; Lu, Ying] Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Southeast Univ Rd 2, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lovreglio, Ruggiero] Massey Univ, Sch Built Environm, Auckland, New Zealand; [Lv, Xiaofeng] Zhoushi Town Construct Management Off, Kunshan, Suzhou 215314, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chi, Zexun] China Railway 9th Bur Grp 1th Bldg Co Ltd, Suzhou 215229, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Massey University,"Lu, Y (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Southeast Univ Rd 2, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",pzgong@seu.edu.cn; luying_happy@126.com; R.Lovreglio@massey.ac.nz; 15950166050@139.com; czx13291193666@163.com,"Lovreglio, Ruggiero/AAH-7275-2019",,Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Project of China [23YJA630069]; Jiangsu Province Construction System Science and Technology Project [2023JH04004]; Marsden Fast Start [MAU2204]; Rutherford Discovery Fellowship [RDF-MAU2201],Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Project of China; Jiangsu Province Construction System Science and Technology Project; Marsden Fast Start(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)); Rutherford Discovery Fellowship(Royal Society of New Zealand),"This research was supported by the Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Project of China (Grant No. 23YJA630069), the Jiangsu Province Construction System Science and Technology Project (Grant No. 2023JH04004), the Marsden Fast Start (MAU2204) and the Rutherford Discovery Fellowship (RDF-MAU2201).",148,20,22,19,71,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-7535,1879-1042,SAFETY SCI,Saf.

Although the production of fruit has increased recently, there is still a gap between demand and supply. Improper handling, transportation, packaging and storage, mechanical damage, and susceptibility to chilling injury and its related physiological disorders during long-term storage are the most important causes of pomegranate postharvest losses. Fruit quality is lost with visible symptoms such as weight loss, shriveling, husk scald, fungal rot, aril color degradation, and off-flavor during long-term storage. Preserving the quality is the most important goal of the postharvest physiology industry. To minimize both qualitative and quantitative postharvest losses, it is crucial to apply appropriate knowledge and technologies during both the harvest and postharvest stages of pomegranate production. This helps to maintain the quality and shelf life of the fruit.

Pitaya fruit functional properties are mainly defined by the presence of betalains, heat-labile molecules with high antioxidant potential. The guava fruit is very-well-known because of its high ascorbic acid contents and, depending on the genetic background, also lycopene and anthocyanins. Finally, the relevance of the papaya fruit relies mostly on high carotenoid contents and their role as precursors of vitamin A and as antioxidants.

FTWs have emerged as promising and environmentally sustainable solutions for water purification. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on FTW design, plant selection, and performance evaluation. It highlights key factors influencing nutrient and heavy metal removal, including the hydraulic retention time, mat thickness, and types of plant species. Recent findings on the roles of root architecture, microbial interactions, and seasonal variability in treatment efficiency are also discussed. Additionally, the review explores advanced analytical methods for monitoring water quality and assessing plant growth and contaminant uptake. Case studies from both laboratory- and field-scale experiments illustrate how variation in FTW configurations impacts pollutant removal efficiency. The review concludes by identifying critical research gaps, including the need for standardized monitoring protocols, strategies to enhance long-term performance, and the integration of FTWs with complementary treatment technologies to improve effectiveness across diverse aquatic environments.","[Kumar, Nirmal; Ray, Ram L.] Prairie View A&M Univ, Coll Agr Food & Nat Resources, Prairie View, TX 77446 USA; [Singh, Bhupinder; Balan, Venkatesh] Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Engn Technol, Biotechnol Program, Sugar Land, TX 77479 USA; [Chen, Yuanze; Shan, Xiaonan] Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Kafle, Abishek; Zhu, Weihang] Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Engn Technol, Mech Engn Technol Program, Sugar Land, TX 77479 USA; [Kumar, Sandeep] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Biomass Res Lab, Kaufman Hall Room 135, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Texas A&M University System; Prairie View A&M University; University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of Houston System; University of Houston; Old Dominion University,"Balan, V (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Engn Technol, Biotechnol Program, Sugar Land, TX 77479 USA.;Shan, XA (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",nikumar@pvamu.edu; ychen258@cougarnet.uh.edu; wzhu21@central.uh.edu; raray@pvamu.edu; skumar@odu.edu; xshan@central.uh.edu; vbalan@central.uh.edu,"; Zhu, Weihang/G-6668-2019; Kafle, Abishek/HLG-7815-2023; balan, Venkatesh/AAG-8332-2020; Ray, Ram L/L-1286-2015","Kumar, Sandeep/0000-0003-3173-6101; Zhu, Weihang/0000-0002-6092-1608; Kafle, Abishek/0000-0003-2047-8186; balan, Venkatesh/0000-0003-3109-5156; Ray, Ram L/0000-0002-7833-9253; Kumar, Nirmal/0000-0003-0739-2038",Environmental Protection Agency [02D48123]; Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); UH Center for Carbon Management and Energy (CCME),Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(United States Environmental Protection Agency); UH Center for Carbon Management and Energy (CCME),B.V. and R.L.R. have received funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA No. 02D48123).

Its goal is to encourage users to change their behavior for the better. However, it still has empirical and theoretical challenges to overcome to show the benefits of its use and solidify the guiding principles for effective gamification designs. The goal of the current study is to synthesize and intellectualize, through a systematic literature review (SLR), the current state of gamification knowledge in human resource management, providing a road map for future research recommendations for both academician and practitioners The review examines the most influential writing on the application of gamification to association settings, portrays the fundamental concepts of gamification, and develops based on an effective writing survey of insightful articles available in the Scopus and Web of Science information bases. The study uses a systematic quantitative approach to review the evidence for the use of gamification in Human Resources management, focusing on the pertinent literature on gamification in organizations. The authors examined 244 papers published between 2013 and 2022 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) technique. One of the major goals of the study's findings is to illustrate the value of gamification in the human resources field in relation to the analysis of employee performance, employee engagement, and training and development. These results suggest that there is more opportunity for research into the elements of gamification, which may be relate to knowledge retention, learning outcomes, learning motivation, employee efficacy, and employee productivity. Purpose- The present study's goal is to amalgamate and intellectualize, through a systematic literature review (SLR), the modern state of gamification knowledge in Human Resource Management Management, providing a roadmap for future research recommendations for service research and practice. Methods- The research is based on a systematic literature review. It implements a systematic quantitative approach to review existing evidence on gamification usage in employee management, focusing on relevant literature on gamification in organizations. The authors analyzed 108 papers published between 2013 and 2022. Conclusion- The study's findings is to illustrate the value of gamification in the human resources field in the analysis of employee performance, employee engagement, and training and development. These results suggest that there is more opportunity for research into gamification elements, which may relate to knowledge retention, learning outcomes, learning motivation, employee efficacy, and employee productivity. Limitations of study- several pilot searches in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases were conducted before obtaining the final dataset. Besides Science Direct, PubMed, Academia, and Google Scholars could have used other databases for this research. Since it is the most widely used product, uses rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria that are transparent and consistent, is publisher independent, and is a multidisciplinary global citation database, the author built the dataset from WoS and Scopus. Because of the limitations of using only two databases, we could not include in our dataset any high-caliber relevant works that weren't indexed by WoS and Scopus.","[Mohanty, Sattwik; Christopher, Prabu B.] Vellore Inst Technol, Business Sch, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India",Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT); VIT Vellore,"Christopher, BP (corresponding author), Vellore Inst Technol, Business Sch, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India.",prabuchristopher.b@vit.ac.in,"Mohanty, Sattwik/HII-6931-2022","Mohanty, Sattwik/0000-0003-2626-6598",,,,41,3,4,19,66,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2158-2440,,SAGE OPEN,SAGE Open,APR,2024,14.0,2,,,,,,21582440241243152,10.1177/21582440241243154,0.0,,18,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,OS5L1,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001209278600001,0

In this context, we examine how EA tools, governance procedures and artifacts influence organizational learning and strategic alignment, drawing on existing literature. Design/methodology/approach - To conduct this study, we adopted a hybrid methodology that combines integrated synthesis and a semi-systematic review, based on the typology proposed by Snyder (2019). Findings - This study demonstrates that EA continues to face several challenges, such as knowledge fragmentation into silos, loss of tacit knowledge, semantic underspecification, tool-related constraints and governance misalignment. However, in the coming years, EA could evolve into an intelligent and adaptive information system thanks to emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI). The article concludes with a research agenda aimed at enhancing EA using the capabilities offered by AI. This paradigm shift would enable EA to support ongoing business transformation and act as a strategic accelerator in complex environments. Originality/value - This article advances EA research by proposing a three-dimensional framework (epistemological, technological and organizational) that positions EA as a dynamic knowledge management discipline. Key contributions include (1) mapping EA artifacts and governance to knowledge management processes (capture, formalization, sharing and reuse); (2) systematically linking five EA-KM barriers to specific AI capabilities and (3) proposing a testable research agenda for AI-augmented EA systems. This synthesis uniquely bridges the EA, KM and AI literature, transforming EA from static documentation to intelligent knowledge infrastructure.","[Toumi, Aissa; Fosso Wamba, Samuel] TBS Business Sch, Toulouse, France; [Toumi, Aissa; Hafsi, Mouaad] HepTa Advisory Labs, Paris, France",,"Toumi, A (corresponding author), TBS Business Sch, Toulouse, France.;Toumi, A (corresponding author), HepTa Advisory Labs, Paris, France.",aissa.toumi@tsm-education.fr; s.fosso-wamba@tbs-education.fr; mouaad.hafsi@hepta-al.com,"Fosso Wamba, Samuel/AAB-4953-2019","Fosso Wamba, Samuel/0000-0002-1073-058X; Toumi, Aissa/0009-0006-1105-3724",,,,67,0,0,4,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1741-0398,1758-7409,J ENTERP INF MANAG,J.

While individual studies and systematic reviews highlight benefits for knowledge and skills, less is known about the broader research landscape, particularly in relation to skill transfer and clinical application. Objectives: The objectives were to: (1) analyze global publication trends in immersive nursing education from 20 0 0 to 2025; (2) identify leading journals, authors, and institutions contributing to the field; and (3) map thematic emphases through keyword and co-citation analysis, with a focus on clinical transfer and retention outcomes. Design: A descriptive bibliometric study of immersive technologies in nursing education. Methods: Data were retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed/MEDLINE. Publications were included if they reported on VR/AR/XR or haptics applied to nursing education. Duplicates were removed, and bibliometric analyses were conducted using Excel and VOSviewer. Results: A total of 1,622 publications were analyzed. Annual output rose sharply after 2017, peaking in 2024. The most productive journals were Clinical Simulation in Nursing and Nurse Education Today . The United States, South Korea, Taiwan, and China dominated contributions. Keyword clustering revealed a strong emphasis on skills training and engagement but limited focus on transfer and patient outcomes. Conclusion: Immersive nursing education research is expanding globally, but evaluation of transfer and retention remains underdeveloped. Future studies should prioritize standardized outcome frameworks and longitudinal designs to establish clinical impact.

An analysis of the literature with regard to fields of application and functions shows that cultural heritage is discussed in almost all fields of climate adaptation. Relevant fields of application include the planning of protective infrastructure as well as technological and behavioral options, education, and informational adaptation measures. The functions attributed to the inclusion of cultural heritage in adaptation measures include informational, emotional, community-building, economic, and aesthetic functions. With respect to the integration of heritage in adaptation processes, different approaches exist, ranging from the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage over the integration of heritage in infrastructure planning to new approaches that focus on proactive engagement with the change and loss of heritage sites or objects. The broad spectrum of at times conflicting approaches demonstrates that the question of how to use cultural heritage in adaptation depends on which adaptation strategies are prioritized. This narrative review structures the vast but only partially explored field and proposes an analysis of the functions of cultural heritage in the different fields of climate adaptation.

DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted in OVID MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and SocINDEX databases from January 2005 to April 2022. Eligible references from a concurrent systematic review evaluating contraceptive care were also included for review. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies were included if a contraceptive decision aid was technology-based (ie, mobile/tablet application, web, or computer-based) and assessed contraceptive use and/or continuation or patient-reported outcomes (knowledge, selfefficacy, feasibility/acceptability/usability, decisional conflict). The protocol was registered under the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42021240755). METHODS: Three reviewers independently performed data abstraction and quality appraisal. Dichotomous outcomes (use and continuation) were evaluated with an odds ratio, whereas continuous outcomes (knowledge and self-efficacy) were evaluated with the mean difference. Subgroup analyses were performed for the mode of delivery (mobile and tablet applications vs web and computer-based) and follow-up time (immediate vs >1 month). RESULTS: This review included 18 studies evaluating 21 decision aids. Overall, there were higher odds of contraceptive use and/or continuation among decision aid users compared with controls (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, [1.05-1.55]). Use of computer and web-based decision aids was associated with higher odds of contraceptive use and/or continuation (odds ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, [1.08-1.72]) than mobile and tablet decision aids (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, [0.83-1.94]). Decision aid users also had statistically significant higher self-efficacy scores (mean difference, 0.09; 95% confidence interval, [0.05-0.13]), and knowledge scores (mean difference, 0.04; 95% confidence interval, [0.01-0.07]), with immediate measurement of knowledge having higher retention than measurement after 1 month. Other outcomes were evaluated descriptively (eg, feasibility, applicability, decisional conflict) but had little evidence to support a definite conclusion. Overall, the review provided moderate-level evidence for contraceptive use and continuation, knowledge, and self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: The use of technology-based contraceptive decision aids to support contraceptive decision-making has positive effects on contraceptive use and continuation, knowledge, and self-efficacy. There was insufficient evidence to support a conclusion about effects on other decision-making outcomes.","[Goueth, Rose C.; Babatunde, Ayo; Eden, Karen B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Maki, Kristin G.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Hlth Serv Res, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Eden, Karen B.] Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Portland, OR USA; [Darney, Blair G.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Darney, Blair G.] Portland State Univ, Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Darney, Blair G.] Inst Nacl Salud Publ, Ctr Populat Hlth Res, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico",Oregon Health & Science University; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; Oregon Health & Science University; Portland State University; Oregon Health & Science University; Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica,"Goueth, RC (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",goueth@ohsu.edu,,"Goueth, Rose/0000-0003-0827-5159; Darney, Blair/0000-0001-8120-028X",National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health [T15LM007088]; National Library of Medicine; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [T15LM007088] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM)); National Library of Medicine; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM)NIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)),R.C.G. and A.B. are funded by the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health under award number T15LM007088.

Post-collision scene reconstruction, which involves knowledge of multiple disciplines, is an important approach to restore the traffic collision and infer the cause of it. This paper uses software CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and SciMAT to conduct a visualization study of knowledge mapping on the literature of traffic collision scene reconstruction from 2001 to 2021 based on the Web of Science database. Knowledge mapping is a cutting-edge research method in scientometric, which has been widely applied in medicine and informatics. Compared with traditional literature review, knowledge mapping with visual techniques identifies hot keywords and key literature in the field more scientifically, and displays them in schematic diagrams intuitively which allows to further predict potential hotspots. A total of 803 original papers are retrieved to analyze and discuss the evolution of the field in the past 20 years, from macro to micro, in term of background information, popular themes, and knowledge structure. Results indicate the number of publications in this field is limited, and collaborations among authors and among institutions are insufficient. In the meantime, mappings imply the top three hot themes being scene reconstruction, computer technology, and injuries. The introduction of AI related technologies, such as neural networks and genetic algorithms, into collision reconstruction would be a potential research direction.","[Shen, Zefang; Han, Zhengqi; Liu, Hongxia] China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China; [Ji, Wei; Yu, Shengnan; Yang, Tiantong; Cheng, Gang] China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Fada Inst Forens Med & Sci, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Quan] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Vehicle & Mobil, State Key Lab Automot Safety & Energy, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yang, Tiantong] China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Judicial Civilizat, Key Lab Evidence Sci, Minist Educ Forens Pathol & Clin Med, 26th Houtun South Rd,Haidian Dist, Beijing, Peoples R China",China University of Political Science & Law; China University of Political Science & Law; Tsinghua University; China University of Political Science & Law,"Yang, TT (corresponding author), China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Fada Inst Forens Med & Sci, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China.;Yang, TT (corresponding author), China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Judicial Civilizat, Key Lab Evidence Sci, Minist Educ Forens Pathol & Clin Med, 26th Houtun South Rd,Haidian Dist, Beijing, Peoples R China.",113977236@qq.com; Joe@cupl.edu.cn; yushengnan666@hotmail.com; yuanq@tsinghua.edu.cn; yangtiantong@126.com,,"Ji, Wei/0009-0009-6582-4469; Shen, Zefang/0000-0001-5153-8095",National Natural Science Founda- tion of China; [52072214],National Natural Science Founda- tion of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC));,Funding This study was supported by The National Natural Science Founda- tion of China under Grant No. 52072214.,78,43,52,6,88,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",1355-0306,1876-4452,SCI JUSTICE,Sci.

The accumulation of knowledge via several studies during the past decades on their functional and biological characteristics has significantly improved the aquacultural aspects, namely their reproductive success, survival, and growth. Despite the remarkable progress in the aquaculture industry, hatchery conditions are still far from ideal, resulting in frequent challenges at the beginning of intensive culture, entailing significant economic losses. Given its increasing importance and the persistent challenges faced in its aquacultural practices, a thorough review is essential to consolidate knowledge, and elucidate the intricate facets concerning its distribution, life cycle, growth dynamics, genetics, aquaculture methodologies, economic dimensions, and the challenges inherent to its cultivation.","[Mhalhel, Kamel; Levanti, Maria; Abbate, Francesco; Laura, Rosaria; Guerrera, Maria Cristina; Aragona, Marialuisa; Porcino, Caterina; Briglia, Marilena; Germana, Antonino; Montalbano, Giuseppe] Univ Messina, Dept Vet Sci, Zebrafish Neuromorphol Lab, Via Palatucci Snc, I-98168 Messina, Italy",University of Messina,"Mhalhel, K (corresponding author), Univ Messina, Dept Vet Sci, Zebrafish Neuromorphol Lab, Via Palatucci Snc, I-98168 Messina, Italy.",kmhalhel@unime.it; mblevanti@unime.it; abbatef@unime.it; laurar@unime.it; mguerrera@unime.it; mlaragona@unime.it; catporcino@unime.it; marilena.briglia@unime.it; agermana@unime.it; giuseppe.montalbano@unime.it,"; Briglia, Marilena/NRB-8622-2025; Germana, Antonino/AAH-2505-2020; Mhalhel, Kamel/GPK-8473-2022","ARAGONA, MARIALUISA/0000-0001-5551-9326; Briglia, Marilena/0000-0002-6386-8718; Abbate, Francesco/0000-0002-8399-5941; Germana, Antonino/0000-0003-0934-3619; Mhalhel, Kamel/0000-0002-9432-4588","INNOVITICA Project [G35F20006240009]; Rural Development and Mediterranean Fisheries of the Sicily Region, Italy","INNOVITICA Project; Rural Development and Mediterranean Fisheries of the Sicily Region, Italy","This work was jointly supported by the INNOVITICA Project (grant number: G35F20006240009)of the Regional Department of Agriculture, Rural Development and Mediterranean Fisheries of the Sicily Region, Italy (PO FEAMP SICILIA 2014/2020).",108,36,39,4,71,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

A novel implementation of this approach is PF simulation, in which they engage in simulation before receiving comprehensive teaching on the involved aspects. PF commences with the generation and consolidation phases, where resident physicians develop and analyze the advantages and constraints of various Representations and Solution Methods. These are followed by the knowledge assembly phases, respectively. Wherein physicians gain essential concepts by organizing their representations and thoughts in alignment with established responses. PF is deliberately designed to induce failure in problem-solving; however, in the following review, this process of failure can help resident physicians better acquire target ideas. The crucial aspect of PF design is that throughout the problem-solving phase, physicians receive no instructional support or scaffolding. Explicit failure-driven scaffolding is an alternative method for enhancing the efficacy of preparatory problem-solving. This narrative review examines the theoretical foundation of PF and its role in collaboration, clinical reasoning development, stress management, and knowledge retention among resident physicians. Using cognitive psychology, clinical reasoning theories, and reflective practice, we examined how PF helps people learn from failure, shift from traditional teaching to retain knowledge longterm, and develop flexible skills in complex clinical settings. Highlighting these components underscores the significance of practical simulations, varied information sources, and systematic feedback in cultivating these competencies. The role of PF in medical education policy suggests ways to integrate it into future training models to address current curriculum gaps. Future directions for PF in medical education include individualized learning, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the integration of future technologies such as virtual reality (VR). PF constitutes a viable educational approach for augmenting the clinical and cognitive competencies of resident physicians, equipping them with the intricacies of contemporary medical practices.","[Ding, Yingjie; Wang, Heng; Wang, Xin; Angula, Laina Ndapewa; Fang, Ning] Jilin Univ, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Hosp 1, Changchun 130021, Jilin, Peoples R China",Jilin University,"Fang, N (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Hosp 1, Changchun 130021, Jilin, Peoples R China.",fn2017@jlu.edu.cn,,,"Jilin Province Postgraduate Education and Teaching Reform Research Project [20241994G99005B, 202419925EH001P]; Jilin Provincial Higher Education Teaching Reform Research Project [2024L5LJO6C000X]",Jilin Province Postgraduate Education and Teaching Reform Research Project; Jilin Provincial Higher Education Teaching Reform Research Project,"Jilin Province Postgraduate Education and Teaching Reform Research Project (20241994G99005B, 202419925EH001P) .

A systematic review,TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH IN ANATOMY,English,Review,,IMPLEMENTATION; TECHNOLOGY,"Background: Musculoskeletal (MSK) anatomy is fundamental to clinical practice in various healthcare disciplines, including medicine, physiotherapy, and orthopedics. Advancements in technology have led to an increased focus on online learning tools, providing alternatives to traditional teaching methods. Objective: This systematic review assesses the impact of online learning (e-learning) modules on musculoskeletal anatomy education among health professionals. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and CINAHL. The eligibility criteria included studies involving health professionals and students in anatomy education using online learning interventions such as video lectures, 3D models, and virtual labs. The risk of bias of the studies was evaluated via the JBI Checklist. Results: Out of 947 records, 18 studies were included in this review. This review included 8 quasi experimental, 7 cross-sectional, 1 case-control, and 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A total of 78 % of the studies incorporated multiple online interventions, such as video tutorials, interactive 3D models, and virtual laboratories. Additionally, 67 % of the studies indicated that learners preferred hybrid models that combined online and in-person teaching, as they significantly enhanced the learning experience compared with traditional methods in improving anatomical knowledge and musculoskeletal competency. Modules that incorporated practical elements significantly increased learners' confidence in handling musculoskeletal cases. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of online anatomy education, with many studies demonstrating that digital platforms successfully replaced traditional methods while achieving comparable educational outcomes. Conclusions: Online educational modules offer a beneficial alternative to traditional anatomy teaching methods, particularly when interactive and hybrid models are in use. They enhance MSK knowledge retention, clinical skills, and learner satisfaction. Future studies should aim to optimize these technologies to integrate theoretical knowledge with clinical practices and patient education.","[Bandekar, Nikita; Rao, K. G. Mohandas; Aithal, P.

Technologies to predict erosion are strongly related to measurements and vice versa. Measurements can simply provide empirical evidence of the erosion process and are hard to extrapolate in time and space. Measurements were used to develop some erosion models, such as the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), and also for their calibration and validation. Several measurement techniques are used to collect soil erosion data at different spatial and temporal scales, but they cannot be considered fully accurate in any experimental condition. Each technique exhibits advantages and disadvantages, so extensive knowledge of their feasibility, accuracy, and limitations is required to correctly plan experiments and use the performed measurements. In this paper, recent scientific developments on the measurement of rainfall erosivity, soil loss at the plot scale, and rill and gully erosion using close-range photogrammetry are presented. Further considerations are made on the quality of soil erosion measurements and the usefulness and importance of measuring plot soil loss. Our critical analysis highlighted that the techniques reported in the literature are a solid basis, which, however, should be developed to improve their range of applicability and data quality.","[Nicosia, Alessio; Carollo, Francesco Giuseppe; Di Stefano, Costanza; Palmeri, Vincenzo; Pampalone, Vincenzo; Serio, Maria Angela; Bagarello, Vincenzo; Ferro, Vito] Univ Palermo, Dept Agr Food & Forest Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Palmeri, Vincenzo; Ferro, Vito] Natl Biodivers Future Ctr NBFC, I-90133 Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo; National Biodiversity Future Center,"Ferro, V (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Agr Food & Forest Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.;Ferro, V (corresponding author), Natl Biodivers Future Ctr NBFC, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",alessio.nicosia@unipa.it; francescogiuseppe.carollo@unipa.it; costanza.distefano@unipa.it; vincenzo.palmeri02@unipa.it; vincenzo.pampalone@unipa.it; mariaangela.serio@unipa.it; vincenzo.bagarello@unipa.it; vito.ferro@unipa.it,"Palmeri, Vincenzo/NXC-1287-2025; NICOSIA, Alessio/AAD-9145-2021; Serio, Maria Angela/IVH-2176-2023; Ferro, Vito/H-6218-2019; CAROLLO, Francesco Giuseppe/HKN-7394-2023; Pampalone, Vincenzo/K-8059-2015","Palmeri, Vincenzo/0000-0001-6594-9530; NICOSIA, Alessio/0000-0003-0540-8788; Serio, Maria Angela/0000-0002-4902-4877; Ferro, Vito/0000-0003-3020-3119; Bagarello, Vincenzo/0000-0003-3575-549X; DI STEFANO, Costanza/0000-0003-2941-4664; CAROLLO, Francesco Giuseppe/0000-0001-9782-998X; Pampalone, Vincenzo/0000-0002-5195-9209","National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), Mission 4, Component 2, Investment 1.4 of the Italian Ministry of University and Research by the European Union-NextGenerationEU [3138, CN_00000033, 3175, 1034, CUP B73C22000790001]; SiciliAn MicronanOTecH Research And Innovation CEnter SAMOTHRACE (MUR, PNRR-M4C2), spoke 3-Universita degli Studi di Palermo S2-COMMs-Micro and Nanotechnologies for Smart & Sustainable Communities [ECS_00000022]; European Union Next-GenerationEU (National Recovery and Resilience Plan-NRPP) [2022PB2NSP_002, CUP B53D23017980006]","National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), Mission 4, Component 2, Investment 1.4 of the Italian Ministry of University and Research by the European Union-NextGenerationEU; SiciliAn MicronanOTecH Research And Innovation CEnter SAMOTHRACE (MUR, PNRR-M4C2), spoke 3-Universita degli Studi di Palermo S2-COMMs-Micro and Nanotechnologies for Smart & Sustainable Communities(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); European Union Next-GenerationEU (National Recovery and Resilience Plan-NRPP)(Marie Curie ActionsEuropean Union (EU))","This project was funded by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), Mission 4, Component 2, Investment 1.4-Call for tender no. 3138 of 16 December 2021, rectified by Decree no. 3175 of 18 December 2021 of the Italian Ministry of University and Research funded by the European Union-NextGenerationEU Project Code CN_00000033, Concession Decree no. 1034 of 17 June 2022 adopted by the Italian Ministry of University and Research, CUP B73C22000790001, Project Title National Biodiversity Future Center (NBFC).

Pacific Island Countries (PICs), with limited resources, being geographically isolated, and vulnerable to climate change, face unique challenges when it comes to the issue of food loss. This scoping review aims to systematically map the literature on food loss in PICs, addressing knowledge gaps and understanding specific methodological aspects. The review utilizes the PRISMA-ScR process to identify, categorize, and synthesize relevant literature, offering a comprehensive overview of the existing evidence. Studies focusing on food loss in PICs published in English from 2011 to 2023 were included. Exclusion criteria considered studies conducted outside PICs, those lacking food loss reduction interventions, and non-peer-reviewed sources. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the databases of JSTOR, Scopus, Science Direct and Web of Science. A total of 5,787 studies for food loss interventions were identified and out of these only 49 met the inclusion criteria. A notable increase in publications from 2011, with a significant surge in 2018 and 2019, indicate a growing interest on the topic. The review reveals a limited focus on this issue across individual PICs and underscores the need for more localized expertise in the region. The review also highlights critical inefficiencies in PIC food supply chains and the need for more studies outside the common root crop agricultural system. The scoping review identified three thematic categories addressing food loss in PICs, namely., the lack of infrastructure and need for innovative technology for post-harvest management; increased vulnerability to climate change and postharvest risks of newer convenient markets. The findings underscore the need for holistic and context-specific approaches to create resilient and sustainable food systems in the Pacific, providing valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners involved in addressing these challenges.","[Amato-Ali, Christian-Yves; Sakiti-Waqa, Hilda] Univ South Pacific, Pacific Ctr Environm & Sustainable Dev, Suva, Fiji; [Iese, Viliamu; Mekala, Gayathri] Univ Melbourne, Sch Agr Food & Ecosyst Sci, Dookie Campus, Dookie, Vic, Australia; [Hidalgo, Daniela] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sippy Downs Campus, Maroochydore, Qld, Australia",University of the South Pacific; University of Melbourne; University of the Sunshine Coast,"Amato-Ali, CY (corresponding author), Univ South Pacific, Pacific Ctr Environm & Sustainable Dev, Suva, Fiji.",christianamatoali@gmail.com,"Iese, Viliamu/LXW-4883-2024; Medina Hidalgo, Daniela/AEG-3953-2022","Amato-Ali, Christian-Yves/0000-0002-4075-9594; Waqa-Sakiti, Hilda/0000-0002-3781-8928; Medina Hidalgo, Daniela/0000-0002-7064-0455","University of the South Pacific10.13039/100018226; Australian Center for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR) Pacific Agriculture Scholarship and Support and Climate Resilience (PASS-CR) Program [CROP/2020/185]; ACIAR Research Projects, Conservation agriculture and sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems in Pacific Countries [CLIM/2020/186]; Sustainable agricultural intensification systems for climate resilient development in Pacific Island Countries; Oceania Institute, The University of Melbourne","University of the South Pacific10.13039/100018226; Australian Center for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR) Pacific Agriculture Scholarship and Support and Climate Resilience (PASS-CR) Program; ACIAR Research Projects, Conservation agriculture and sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems in Pacific Countries; Sustainable agricultural intensification systems for climate resilient development in Pacific Island Countries; Oceania Institute, The University of Melbourne","We acknowledge the Australian Center for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR) Pacific Agriculture Scholarship and Support and Climate Resilience (PASS-CR) Program, and two ACIAR Research Projects, Conservation agriculture and sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems in Pacific Countries (CROP/2020/185); Sustainable agricultural intensification systems for climate resilient development in Pacific Island Countries (CLIM/2020/186).

Both naturally occurring and modified nucleosides and nucleotides have been successfully separated in HILIC. A wide range of stationary phases with different retention and selectivity are suitable for the separation of nucleobases, nucleosides and nucleotides; and a sufficient knowledge base is also available to guide method development. Although oligonucleotides are significantly different from nucleotides in terms of polarity and charges, HILIC has been shown to be a viable alternative to ion-pairing reversed-phase liquid chromatography (IP-RPLC). Only a few polar stationary phases have been shown to provide satisfactory performance; however, the requirements for the mobile phase composition including organic solvent, mobile phase pH and salt concentration are sufficiently understood. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of the chromatographic conditions with a historical perspective on adopting and developing HILIC for the separation of nucleobases, nucleosides, nucleotides and oligonucleotides.

This review summarizes recent developments in the application of key polysaccharides-such as inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), beta-glucan, arabinoxylan, pectin, cellulose derivatives, resistant starch, maltodextrins, and dextrins-in bread, pasta, and fine bakery systems. Their incorporation affects dough rheology, fermentation behavior, and gas retention, leading to modifications in texture, volume, and shelf-life stability. Technologically, polysaccharides function as hydrocolloids, fat and sugar replacers, or water-binding agents, influencing gluten network formation and starch gelatinization. Nutritionally, they contribute to higher dietary fiber intake, improved postprandial glycemic response, enhanced satiety, and favorable modulation of gut microbiota. From a sensory perspective, optimized formulations can maintain or even improve product acceptability despite structural changes. However, challenges remain related to dosage optimization, interactions with the gluten-starch matrix, and gastrointestinal tolerance (particularly in FODMAP-sensitive individuals). This review summarizes current knowledge and future opportunities for creating innovative bakery products that unite technological functionality with nutritional and sensory excellence.","[Petrovic, Jovana; Zahorec, Jana; Soronja-Simovic, Dragana; Loncarevic, Ivana; Nikolic, Ivana; Pajin, Biljana; Stozinic, Milica] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Technol Novi Sad, Bul Cara Lazara 1, Novi Sad 2100, Serbia; [Subaric, Drago; Ackar, Durdica; Jozinovic, Antun] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Food Technol Osijek, Franje Kuhaca 18, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of Novi Sad; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Jozinovic, A (corresponding author), Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Food Technol Osijek, Franje Kuhaca 18, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",jovana.petrovic@uns.ac.rs; jana.zahorec@uns.ac.rs; dragana@tf.uns.ac.rs; ivana.loncarevic@uns.ac.rs; ivananikolic@uns.ac.rs; biljana.pajin@uns.ac.rs; milica.stozinic@uns.ac.rs; dsubaric@ptfos.hr; dackar@ptfos.hr; ajozinovic@ptfos.hr,"Ačkar, Đurđica/AAB-3876-2020; Jozinović, Antun/NDS-0724-2025; Zahorec, Jana/HDM-8310-2022; Šoronja-Simović, Dragana/HPH-9905-2023; Petrovic, Jovana/AHE-1684-2022; Nikolić, Ivana/ABA-8356-2021","Jozinović, Antun/0000-0001-9627-1013; loncarevic, Ivana/0000-0001-5028-8514; Zahorec, Jana/0000-0002-8313-2644; Šubarić, ago/0000-0002-6956-5814; Pajin, Biljana/0000-0002-4552-7880; Petrovic, Jovana/0000-0003-3983-6801; Nikolić, Ivana/0000-0002-3028-1638; Stožinić, Milica/0009-0002-6704-8626","Ministry of Science, Technological Development and Innovation of the Republic of Serbia [451-03-136/2025-03/200134, 451-03-137/2025-03/200134]","Ministry of Science, Technological Development and Innovation of the Republic of Serbia","This research was supported by the Ministry of Science, Technological Development and Innovation of the Republic of Serbia, No. 451-03-136/2025-03/200134 and No. 451-03-137/2025-03/200134.",194,0,0,8,8,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

The problem of leachate treatment has subsisted for some time, but an efficient and cost-effective universal solution capable of ensuring environmental resources protection has not been found. Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) has been considered a promising technology for biological wastewater treatment in recent years. Granules' layered structure, with an aerobic outer layer and an anaerobic/anoxic core, enables the presence of diverse microbial populations without the need for support media, allowing simultaneous removal of different pollutants in a single unit. Besides, its strong and compact arrangement provides higher tolerance to toxic pollutants and the ability to withstand large load fluctuations. Furthermore, its good that settling properties allow high biomass retention and better sludge separation. Nevertheless, AGS-related research has focused on carbon-nitrogen-phosphorus removal, mainly from sanitary sewage. This review aims to summarize and analyze the main findings and problems reported in the literature regarding AGS application to landfill leachate treatment and identify the knowledge gaps for future applications.","[da Silva, Vicente E.

With the advance in gene-targeting technology, many integrin/dystroglycan knockout/mutant mice were generated in the past 3 decades. These mutants enable loss-of-function studies and have substantially enriched our knowledge of integrin/dystroglycan functions. In this review, we summarize the functions of laminin receptors during embryonic development and in the central nervous system and vasculature. First, the biochemical properties of integrins and dystroglycan are briefly introduced. Next, we discuss loss-of-function studies on laminin receptors, including integrin-alpha 3, integrin-alpha 6, integrin-alpha 7, integrin-beta 1, integrin-beta 4, and dystroglycan, focusing on embryonic development, the central nervous system, and vasculature. The phenotypes of compound knockout mice are described and compared with that of single mutants. Last, important questions and challenges in the field as well as potential future directions are discussed. Our goal is to provide a synthetic review on loss-of-function studies of laminin receptors in the central nervous system and vasculature, which could serve as a reference for future research, encourage the formation of new hypotheses, and stimulate new research in this field.","[Yao, Yao] Univ S Florida, Morsani Coll Med, Dept Mol Pharmacol & Physiol, 12901 Bruce B Downs Blvd,MDC 8, Tampa, FL 33612 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Yao, Y (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Morsani Coll Med, Dept Mol Pharmacol & Physiol, 12901 Bruce B Downs Blvd,MDC 8, Tampa, FL 33612 USA.",yao7@usf.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health grants [R01HL146574, R01AG065345, R01NS134134, R21AG073862, R21AG0 64422]",National Institutes of Health grants(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"This work was partially supported by National Institutes of Health grants (R01HL146574, R01AG065345, R01NS134134, R21AG073862, and R21AG0 64422) to Dr Yao.",34,0,0,2,2,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0039-2499,1524-4628,STROKE,Stroke,AUG,2025,56.0,8,,,,2348,2359,,10.1161/STROKEAHA.125.051560,0.0,,12,Clinical Neurology; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,5JU9X,40421534.0,,2026-02-03,WOS:001537381800044,0

It is commonly commercialized in fresh-cut format, satisfying consumer demand for freshness and convenience, but its shelf-life is limited. Despite the potential for growth in fresh-cut watermelon sales, the industry faces the challenge of maintaining quality attributes during storage. Fresh-cut processing induces a series of physiological and biochemical events that lead to alterations in sensory, nutritional and microbiological quality. A signal transduction cascade involving increases in respiration and ethylene production rates and elevated activities of cell wall and membrane-degrading enzymes compromise cellular and tissue integrity. These responses contribute to the development of quality defects like juice leakage, firmness loss and water-soaked appearance. They also drive the loss of bioactive compounds like lycopene, affecting flesh color and reducing nutritional value, ultimately culminating in consumer rejection, food losses and waste. Although great research progress has been achieved in the past decades, knowledge gaps about the physiological, biochemical and molecular bases of quality loss persist. This review article summarizes the advances in the study of physicochemical, microbiological, nutritional, and sensory changes linked to the deterioration of watermelon after processing and during storage. Different technological approaches for quality improvement and shelf-life extension are summarized: pre- and postharvest, physical, and chemical. We also discuss the advantages, disadvantages and challenges of these interventions and propose alternative directions for future research aiming to reduce qualitative and quantitative fresh-cut watermelon losses.","[Quandoh, Ebenezer; Albornoz, Karin] Clemson Univ, Coastal Res & Educ Ctr, Dept Food Nutr & Packaging Sci, Charleston, SC 29401 USA",Clemson University,"Albornoz, K (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Coastal Res & Educ Ctr, Dept Food Nutr & Packaging Sci, Charleston, SC 29401 USA.",kpalbor@clemson.edu,"Albornoz, Karin/AAU-3095-2020; Quandoh, Ebenezer/KEI-4006-2024","Albornoz, Karin/0000-0002-0483-4323;","NIFA/USDA [SC-1700674, SC-1700666]",NIFA/USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Results from a scoping review of empirical research,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,English,Review,360 degrees video; education; scoping literature review; virtual reality,VIRTUAL-REALITY; EXPERIENCES; SIMULATION,"Background: Over recent years, interest towards the use of immersive technologies has grown in parallel with the lowering of equipment costs: educators have started embedding them into their teaching practices at different levels of the educational system, from primary school to higher education. In general, immersive technologies are seen as suitable tools to live vicarious experiences, when the reality is hardly accessible, for instance due to safety issues. Objectives: In this paper, we focus on 360 degrees videos with the aim of developing a more systematic and evidence informed approach to the understanding of the educational uses of 360 degrees in different educational contexts. Methods: A scoping literature review approach has been adopted in order to obtain a comprehensive insight based on objective, replicable and transparent procedures. Results and conclusions: The review includes studies published from 2016 onwards. According to the findings, 360 degrees videos are more suitable for disciplines requiring careful observation of how knowledge is transferred into practice and where practical scenarios are involved: 360 degrees videos have positive effects on learning, especially referring to motivation, attentiveness, information retention and transfer of knowledge. However, as for learners' reactions, physical discomfort is reported, mainly associated with the use of HMD. In addition, challenges, and barriers to the educational use of 360 degrees video should be further analysed, since up to now logistical constraints have limited the studies to a very small sample population, without the possibility of providing suggestions for a wider adoption at organisation and institution level.","[Ranieri, Maria; Luzzi, Damiana; Cuomo, Stefano] Univ Florence, Dept Educ Languages Intercultures, Florence, Italy; [Bruni, Isabella] Univ Florence, Ctr IT Serv, Florence, Italy",University of Florence; University of Florence,"Ranieri, M (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Florence, Italy.",maria.ranieri@unifi.it,"RANIERI, MARIA/AAE-5599-2019; Luzzi, Damiana/KBA-1787-2024","RANIERI, MARIA/0000-0002-8080-5436; Luzzi, Damiana/0000-0002-8843-2072",European Union's Erasmus Plus Key Action 2 programme,European Union's Erasmus Plus Key Action 2 programme,European Union's Erasmus Plus Key Action 2 programme,65,53,60,6,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0266-4909,1365-2729,J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR,J.

This review critically examines the current knowledge on buffalo milk and its potential applications in developing functional probiotic dairy products. Buffalo milk offers a rich matrix of bioactive components, with higher levels of fat, vitamin A, and biotin, along with comparable calcium content but lower sodium levels relative to cow milk. These compositional differences may have implications for calcium absorption and retention. Lower sodium levels support calcium balance, whereas higher saturated fat content may reduce calcium absorption efficiency, highlighting the need for further study. The review explores the microbial diversity of buffalo milk, emphasizing the prevalence of lactic acid bacteria and other probiotic candidates, and discusses their suitability for use in fermented dairy products such as yoghurt, kefir, and cheese. Innovative processing strategies, including microencapsulation and non-thermal technologies, are assessed for their roles in enhancing probiotic survival and product quality. Additionally, global regulatory frameworks and safety considerations for probiotic dairy products are outlined, along with advanced analytical approaches such as metagenomics and metabolomics for product evaluation. Despite its promising attributes, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding probiotic strain performance, nutrient bioavailability, consumer acceptance, and clinical validation of health benefits specific to buffalo milk-based products. Addressing these gaps through targeted research will support the development of high-value, health-promoting functional dairy products derived from buffalo milk, particularly in regions where buffalo farming contributes to sustainable food systems.","[Habiba, Mst.

However, most studies do not specifically focus on the removal of micro-pollutants from the effluent of conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) that still contains micro-pollutants, but on the removal of micropollutants from raw wastewater. Raw wastewater has a significantly different composition compared to WWTP effluent, which positively or negatively affects micropollutant removal mechanisms. To determine the optimal CW design for post-treatment of WWTP effluent to achieve additional micropollutant removal, this review analyzes the removal of 16 Dutch indicator micropollutants for post-treatment technology evaluation from WWTP effluent by different types of CWs. It was concluded that CW systems with organic enhanced adsorption substrates reach the highest micropollutant removal efficiency as a result of adsorption, but that the longevity of the enhanced adsorption effect is not known in the systems studied until now. Aerobic biodegradation and photodegradation are other relevant removal mechanisms for the studied micropollutants. However, a current knowledge gap is whether active aeration to stimulate the aerobic micro-pollutant biodegradation results in an increased micropollutant removal from WWTP effluent. Further knowledge gaps that impede the wider application of CW systems for micropollutant removal from WWTP effluent and allow a fair comparison with other post-treatment technologies for enhanced micropollutant removal, such as ozonation and activated carbon adsorption, relate to i) saturation of enhanced adsorption substrate; ii) the analysis of transformation products and biological effects; iii) insights in the relationship between microbial community composition and micropollutant biodegradation; iv) plant uptake and in-plant degradation of micropollutants; v) establishing design rules for appropriate hydraulic loading rates and/or hydraulic retention times for CWs dedicated to micropollutant removal from WWTP effluent; and vi) the energy-and carbon foot-print of different CW systems. This review finishes with detailed suggestions for future research directions that provide answers to these knowledge gaps.","[Wagner, Thomas, V; Langenhoff, Alette] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Environm Technol, POB 17, NL-6700 EV Wageningen, Netherlands; [Rempe, Fleur; Hoek, Mirit] TAUW BV, Handelskade 37, NL-7400 AC Deventer, Netherlands; [Schuman, Els] LeAF BV, Bornse Weilanden 9, NL-6708 WG Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Wagner, TV (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Environm Technol, POB 17, NL-6700 EV Wageningen, Netherlands.",thomas.wagner@wur.nl,"Langenhoff, Alette/J-5795-2012; Wagner, Thomas/NYT-2542-2025","Wagner, Thomas/0000-0001-8540-0123",,,,114,28,31,28,173,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0043-1354,1879-2448,WATER RES,Water Res.,OCT 1,2023,244.0,,,,,,,120534,10.1016/j.watres.2023.120534,0.0,AUG 2023,19,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,T8IW2,37659177.0,"Green Submitted, hybrid",2026-02-03,WOS:001080372900001,0

Historically, there has been concern that resection of the MT may result in smell loss and frontal sinus stenosis. However, these concerns must be balanced by knowledge that a residual diseased MT may result in surgical failure. This review discusses the current evidence on treatment of the MT during and after ESS. Recent findings Several review articles have shown the safety of performing MT resection. Studies have not shown increase rates of frontal sinus stenosis, olfactory loss, or empty nose syndrome. However, the benefit of MT resection is highly debated. There have also been many recent advances and technological developments to assist in management of the postoperative MT. The literature supports the safety of performing MT resection, however, the benefit of resection over preservation is controversial. New technologies and techniques exist that may aid in preventing postoperative MT lateralization.","[Tang, Dennis M.] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Div Otolaryngol, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA; [Roxbury, Christopher R.] Univ Chicago Med & Biol Sci, Dept Surg, Sect Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 5841 S Maryland Ave,Rm E102-A, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Cedars Sinai Medical Center; University of Chicago,"Roxbury, CR (corresponding author), Univ Chicago Med & Biol Sci, Dept Surg, Sect Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 5841 S Maryland Ave,Rm E102-A, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",croxbury@bsd.uchicago.edu,,"Tang, Dennis/0000-0003-2315-9930",,,,39,3,3,1,9,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1068-9508,1531-6998,CURR OPIN OTOLARYNGO,Curr.

However, knowledge of compliance risks in residential construction remains fragmented. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches across databases such as Scopus and Web of Science identified 41 peer-reviewed publications, which were analyzed through descriptive and content analysis methods. Findings The analysis identifies three key categories of compliance risks: (1) structural, (2) aesthetic and (3) thermal. These risks are attributed to poor workmanship, inadequate detailing of design, poor supervision and quality control, inadequate knowledge and skills, organizational culture, low-quality materials and limited knowledge sharing within and across projects. Key mitigation strategies target improvement in supervision, quality control, organizational culture, training and education, inspection processes, supplying quality material, understanding defect causation, defect prediction and learning from defects. The use of digital technologies is particularly emphasized. Other proposed measures include mandating detailed drawings and imposing warranty contracts. Practical implications The findings highlight the need for proactive measures, regulatory clarity and the integration of digital technologies in mitigating compliance risks in residential construction. Originality/value This study underscores the urgency of addressing compliance risks and offers a conceptual framework for understanding and managing these risks.

One of the reasons for this condition may be the fact that dental implants cannot yield a proper osseointegration process due to the development of oral microbiota dysbiosis and the accompanying inflammation caused by immunological imbalance. This study aims to present current knowledge as to the impact of oral microflora dysbiosis and deregulation of the immune system on the course of failures observed in dental implantology. Evidence points to a strong correlation between these biological disturbances and implant complications, often stemming from improper osseointegration, pathogenic biofilms on implants, as well as an exacerbated inflammatory response.

Weight loss through nonpharmaceutical lifestyle interventions is achievable. Weight loss can normalize menstrual cycle irregularities and can increase fecundability. Pregnancy-associated risks, such as gestational diabetes can be decreased by preconception weight reduction.Weight loss through lifestyle changes (i.e., lower caloric intake and increased physical activity), may increase fecundability and may have a positive impact on the course of pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. Accordingly, women should be motivated to reduce their weight before conception. However, the effectiveness of life-style intervention programs for women actively seeking medical support in achieving pregnancy has not convincingly been demonstrated. In the few randomized controlled trials (RCTs), selection bias for trial participation by patient motivation may have been present, yet participant attrition was still high and mean effects were small, casting doubts on the utility of such programs in routine care. Pharmacological and surgical intervention may be more effective or necessary complements to lifestyle intervention programs.","[Hiller, Roman Alexander Friedrich] Dept Gynecol Endocrinol & Reprod Med, Lubeck, Germany; [Griesinger, Georg] Univ Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Campus Luebeck, Lubeck, Germany; [Griesinger, Georg] Univ Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Dept Gynecol Endocrinol & Reprod Med, Campus Luebeck,Ratzeburger Allee 160, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany",University of Kiel; Schleswig Holstein University Hospital; University of Kiel; Schleswig Holstein University Hospital,"Griesinger, G (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Dept Gynecol Endocrinol & Reprod Med, Campus Luebeck,Ratzeburger Allee 160, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany.",georg.griesinger@uni-luebeck.de,,,,,,42,4,4,0,2,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1040-872X,1473-656X,CURR OPIN OBSTET GYN,Curr.

Knowledge jobs involve many health-promoting features, but stress and burnout may be caused by the rapid increase in the knowledge intensity of work, new job demands, and emerging new professional subcultures emphasizing the excessive commitment to work. Although there are studies on job burnout and predictors among nurses worldwide, evidence specific to Chinese nurses is lacking. The purpose of this review is to synthesize current research on predictors related to burnout affecting Chinese nurses. We searched the Chinese databases including National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang, China Science and Technology Journal Database, and Chinese Biological Medical Database (CBM); and international databases including Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science published up to 30th August 2022. The 125 studies identified assessed a range of predictors of job burnout. The results showed good working relationships and internally controlled individuals were found to be predictive of job burnout. Moreover, numerous predictors produced contradictory data.

Notwithstanding all these efforts, the water quality in many AUWs has not significantly improved. Diffuse nutrient pollution involves the movement of these pollutants between soil and water. Excessive diffuse pollution has been accepted as one of the main causes of failure to attain favorable environmental conditions in freshwater systems. Recently, several technologies and practices have been implemented to manage diffuse pollution, namely: a) source reduction, b) pollutant retention over the movement process; c) nutrient recycling, and d) purification and restoration of the eutrophic water bodies. This paper synthesized the existing knowledge of key methods to tackle diffuse pollution from AUWs. Furthermore, the predominant purification mechanisms and impacting factors are explored, allowing a comprehensive and critical understanding of different control strategies to improve the management of diffuse pollution. Therefore, potential approaches for strengthening the performance of control technologies for diffuse pollution treatment and remediation are discussed. Although adopting source reduction strategies (e.g., the 4R approach: right rate, right time, right source, and right placement of nutrients) could efficiently decrease surface runoff and pollutant levels, they may not stop runoff from entering nearby streams. Consequently, comprehensive treatment of agricultural runoff still requires extra process retention strategies. Overall, the findings of this paper showed that treatment system design and operational and environmental factors played crucial but variable roles in diffuse pollution treatment. Moreover, the results showed that combining or integrating constructed wetlands with other control technologies could enhance the comprehensive purification of diffuse pollution compared to using a single method. This review proposes a systematic approach for diffuse pollution control based on three components (water, soil and microbiota) and maximizing the regulating services of agroecosystems via land use/cover types. The current review contributes to the documentation of existing research trends. It sheds light on diffuse pollution control approaches in AUWs, and further encourages the development of this vital field.","[Kumwimba, Mathieu Nsenga] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kumwimba, Mathieu Nsenga; Zhu, Bo; Ajibade, Fidelis O.; Wang, Tao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kumwimba, Mathieu Nsenga] Univ Lubumbashi, Fac Agron, Lubumbashi, DEM REP CONGO; [Zhu, Bo; Wang, Tao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Key Lab Mt Surface Proc & Ecol Regulat, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Stefanakis, Alexandros I.] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Chem & Environm Engn, Lab Environm Engn & Management, Khania, Greece; [Ajibade, Fidelis O.] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Akure, Nigeria; [Dzakpasu, Mawuli] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Environm & Municipal Engn, Xian, Peoples R China; [Soana, Elisa] Univ Ferrara, Dept Environm & Prevent Sci, Ferrara, Italy; [Arif, Muhammad] Southwest Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Ecoenvironm Three Gorges Reservoir Reg, Minist Educ, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Muyembe, Diana Kavidia] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Food Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Agboola, Temitope Deborah] Olusegun Agagu Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Okitipupa, Nigeria","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES), CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University Lubumbashi; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Mountain Hazards & Environment, CAS; Technical University of Crete; Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology; University of Ferrara; Southwest University - China; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Food Science & Technology, CAAS","Kumwimba, MN (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Kumwimba, MN (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Kumwimba, MN (corresponding author), Univ Lubumbashi, Fac Agron, Lubumbashi, DEM REP CONGO.",mathieunsenga@gmail.com,"; NSENGA KUMWIMBA, Mathieu/O-5146-2019; Arif, Muhammad/Q-2498-2019; Soana, Elisa/W-1618-2018; Arif, Muhammad/Q-2498-2019; Stefanakis, Alexandros/H-6523-2019; Ajibade, Fidelis/D-7893-2019; Dzakpasu, Mawuli/D-2506-2011","Agboola, Temitope Deborah/0000-0002-3715-7795; NSENGA KUMWIMBA, Mathieu/0000-0002-1355-9175; Arif, Muhammad/0000-0003-0359-5161;",National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC) Project for International Young Scientists [42050410314]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2020M670482]; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI) [2019PC0097]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China,"National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC) Project for International Young Scientists; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI); Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC) Project for International Young Scientists (42050410314), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2020M670482), the Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI) (2019PC0097), and the funding support for foreign experts through Foreign Young Talents Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China.",255,22,25,11,77,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

In this narrative review, the challenges to pharmacology education in the medical curricula were broadly identified to include issues around content and pedagogies. The increasing number of approved drugs and drug targets, expanding field of pharmacology and the often-changing treatment guidelines and board-defined competencies can make pharmacology education in the medical curriculum daunting. There has been a consensus around the deployment of innovative medical curricula with emphasis on vertical and horizontal integration. This strategy, effective as it has been, presents new challenges to pharmacology education. As a discipline often perceived by students to be hard-to-learn, the future of pharmacology education must include heavy reliance on active learning strategies. The continuing utilization of problem-based, team-based and case-based learning can be complemented with personalized learning which aims to identify the learning gaps in individual students. Technology-inspired student engagement can foster pharmacology learning and retention. Early exposure to pharmacology from premedical preparation through an enduring across-the-level integration can be an effective way to enhance pharmacology learning in the medical curricula.","[Fasinu, Pius S.; Wilborn, Teresa W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Heersink Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham,"Fasinu, PS (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Heersink Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",pfasinu@uab.edu,"Fasinu, Pius/AAO-7183-2020","Fasinu, Pius/0000-0002-3160-1824","Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology; Heersink School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham","Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology; Heersink School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham","Both authors are supported by departmental grants from the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, The Heersink School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham.",73,29,31,4,14,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",2052-1707,,PHARMACOL RES PERSPE,Pharmacol.

As the Islamic fintech landscape continues to grow and transform, it is crucial to understand the factors that influence the acceptance or adoption of Islamic fintech services from the past literature. Therefore, this paper aims to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to investigate and compile factors that could influence a user to adopt Islamic fintech. Design/methodology/approach - The current study adopted the systematic literature review approach using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses technique to examine research on Islamic fintech adoption. A set of inclusion criteria was applied to filter out irrelevant documents and ensure the selection of only the most relevant ones. The criteria were limited to quantitative journals published in English between 2012 and 2022, as identified in Scopus outlets. Findings - Despite the existence of various theoretical frameworks, the technology acceptance model and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 frameworks have gained prominence as the most frequently applied frameworks in examining Islamic fintech adoption. In addition, trust is the most important self-developed construct for the adoption of Islamic Fintech. Research limitations/implications - The current study does not segregate the intention, actual usage and retention, as the author is interested in understanding the overall adoption of Islamic fintech services. To obtain more specific analysis results, future research could potentially separate the three types of adoption exposure, i.e., consumer acceptance, intention and retention. Next, future studies can also expand their analysis and gain a better understanding of the research topic by exploring alternative data sources such as Web of Science, ERA or JSTOR. Originality/value - To the best of the author's knowledge, this study makes a significant contribution to the literature by providing the first systematic literature review of factors influencing fintech adoption from an Islamic perspective.","[Maniam, Shatheish] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Labuan Fac Int Finance, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia",Universiti Malaysia Sabah,"Maniam, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Sabah, Labuan Fac Int Finance, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia.",shatheishmaniam@gmail.com,"Maniam, Shatheish/LLL-0734-2024","Maniam, Shatheish/0009-0005-6744-1200",,,,74,7,12,4,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1759-0833,1759-0841,J ISLAMIC MARK,J.

Ensuring global food and nutritional security remains a major challenge, particularly in developing countries facing climate change and resource limitations. To address this, the valorization of underutilized local crops such as Dioscorea bulbifera (aerial yam) is crucial. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the nutritional composition, bioactive compounds, and therapeutic and technological potentials of Dioscorea bulbifera. It reports a richness in carbohydrates and minerals such as potassium in dana tubers. It highlights that boiling, steaming, and roasting enhance its functional and antioxidant properties, while fermentation and sulfiting improve its bioavailability and safety especially minerals and protein digestibility. Furthermore, Dioscorea bulbifera flour demonstrates strong potential for gluten-free and composite bakery formulations according to his starch content and functional properties especially water retention and resistance to shear stress. These findings underscore the crop's value as a sustainable ingredient for functional food development and nutritional security.","[Fossouo Towa, Patrik Florent; Tambo Tene, Stephano; Kouam, Etoile Brillant; Maffo Tazoho, Ghislain] Univ Dschang, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, Res Unit Med Plant Biochem Food Sci & Nutr, POB 67, Dschang, Cameroon",Universite de Dschang,"Towa, PFF; Tene, ST; Tazoho, GM (corresponding author), Univ Dschang, Fac Sci, Dept Biochem, Res Unit Med Plant Biochem Food Sci & Nutr, POB 67, Dschang, Cameroon.",florent.fossouo05@gmail.com; stambotene@yahoo.fr; maghis2006@yahoo.fr,"TAMBO TENE, Stephano/IYS-3877-2023",,,,,72,0,0,0,0,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2731-4286,DISCOV FOOD,Discov.

The preferential accumulation of NMs in tumors has been widely verified by macroscopical technologies. Accordingly, several classic and emerging targeting mechanisms have been proposed to support the tumor-specific delivery of NMs. The targeting mechanism has been a topic of intense interest and controversy in the field of NMs development. Especially, the mechanisms by which NMs target tumor remain elusive. Area covered: This topical review mainly discussed the evolution of the targeting mechanisms, crucial issues associated with each mechanism, and confused debates among the mechanisms. The targeting mechanisms of tumor-specific NMs discussed here include the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, protein corona-mediated targeting delivery, circulating cell mediated transportation, and transcytosis. Expert opinion: It is of great significance for ultimate clinical translation to have more comprehensive considerations on the mechanism driving the pathway of NMs toward tumors. Our thoughts in this review are expected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and elicit thorough explorations of new mechanisms to renovate the knowledge framework of NMs delivery.

However, high dropout rates may undermine the benefits of postgraduate education. This study aims to identify which individual, academic, socio-economic, and institutional variables influence student attrition at the postgraduate level (master's and doctoral) through a scoping review. Using the PRISMA-ScR method, we analyzed 40 research articles for bibliometric insights and specifically examined explanatory variables for postgraduate dropout. Within the individual determinant, explanatory variables include nationality, gender, age, marital status, family support, family and work obligations, and motivation levels. Socio-economic variables encompass the student's income, employment status, and the national macroeconomic environment. In the academic context, key variables comprise prior knowledge, academic performance, student satisfaction, autonomy, self-efficacy, and research interest. Lastly, variables such as insufficient financial resources, institutional policies, teacher-student interaction, student support, academic infrastructure, and curriculum design play pivotal roles in the institutional realm. In conclusion, this study enhances our understanding of postgraduate dropout, offering valuable insights for the academic community and States to develop strategies that improve retention rates and reduce dropout levels in postgraduate education.","[Rincon, Alfredo Guzman] Corp Univ Asturias, Sch Econ & Adm Sci, Bogota, Colombia; [Moreno, Sandra Barragan] Univ Bogota Jorge Tadeo Lozano, Fac Nat Sci & Engn, Bogota, Colombia; [Quecano, Lira Isis Valencia] Corp Univ Asturias, Sch Econ & Adm Sci, Bogota 110221, Colombia",Universidad de Bogota Jorge Tadeo Lozano,"Quecano, LIV (corresponding author), Corp Univ Asturias, Sch Econ & Adm Sci, Bogota 110221, Colombia.",lira.valencia@asturias.edu.co,"; Guzmán Rincón, Alfredo/HOI-0559-2023; Barragán-Moreno, Sana Patricia/AAO-6651-2020","Valencia Quecano, Lira Isis/0000-0002-3501-4774; Guzmán Rincón, Alfredo/0000-0003-1994-6261; Barragán-Moreno, Sana Patricia/0000-0001-6503-4445",,,,98,8,16,3,28,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-186X,,COGENT EDUC,Cogent Educ.,DEC 31,2024,11.0,1,,,,,,2326705,10.1080/2331186X.2024.2326705,0.0,,20,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Education & Educational Research,LN7X0,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001187558400001,0

Numerous studies have highlighted the potential of concept mapping to enhance students' achievement. However, comprehensive quantitative analyses focusing on its impact specifically in STEM education are limited. This meta-analysis synthesizes findings from 37 studies conducted between 2004 and 2023, identifying a moderate overall effect size of concept mapping on students' achievement in STEM disciplines (ES = 0.630). The analysis of six moderating variables (subject, educational level, duration of the experiment, concept map construction mode, learning equipment, and pedagogical approach) reveals that concept mapping is particularly effective in science and technology, with the greatest impact observed at the secondary education level. Interventions lasting between one week and one month yielded the most significant improvements in learning outcomes, especially when students independently constructed their concept maps. Both digital and paper-based tools demonstrated moderate and comparable effects on students' achievement. In addition, among various pedagogical approaches, contextual and inquiry-based pedagogical approaches are more effective when integrated into STEM education. This study provides recommendations for future research and practical implementation of concept mapping in educational contexts.","[Wang, Xiao-Ming; Wang, Jing-Lin; Xu, Shu-Yan; Xu, Si-Jie] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Zhejiang Key Lab Intelligent Educ Technol & Applic, Jinhua, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Normal University,"Wang, XM (corresponding author), Zhejiang Normal Univ, Zhejiang Key Lab Intelligent Educ Technol & Applic, Jinhua, Peoples R China.",zsdwxm@126.com; wangjinglin@zjnu.edu.cn; 2057124539@qq.com; 2954960659@qq.com,"Wang, Xiao-Ming/NXC-7031-2025","Wang, Xiao-Ming/0000-0002-4943-5908",Higher Education Teaching Reform Project of Zhejiang Province [JG-2022-0146],Higher Education Teaching Reform Project of Zhejiang Province,This study is supported by the Higher Education Teaching Reform Project of Zhejiang Province under contract numbers JG-2022-0146.,95,2,4,47,50,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2196-7822,,INT J STEM EDUC,Int.

Although women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields are continuing to share their diverse wealth of knowledge and innovation, even today many are under-recognized and under-supported in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This review will highlight women in virology from LMICs in Africa, Asia, and Latin America where the barriers to scientific education and achievement for women can be far greater than in high income countries.

This systematic review unites current literature relevant to VR in surgical education to showcase tool transferability, and subsequent impact on knowledge acquisition, skill development, and technological innovation. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines and included three databases. Among the 1926 studies that were screened, 31 studies met the inclusion criteria. ChatGPT assisted in generating variables for data extraction, and the authors reached unanimous consensus on 13 variables that provided a framework for assessing VR attributes. Surgical simulation was examined in 26 studies (83.9%). VR applications incorporated anatomy visualization (83.9%), procedure planning (67.7%), skills assessment (64.5%), continuous learning (41.9%), haptic feedback (41.9%), research and in novation (41.9%), case-based learning (22.6%), improved skill retention (19.4%), reduction of stress and anxiety (16.1%), and remote learning (12.9%). No instances of VR integration addressed patient communication or team-based training. Novice surgeons benefited the most from VR simulator experience, improving their confidence and accuracy in tackling complex procedural tasks, as well as decision-making efficiency. Enhanced dexterity compared to traditional modes of surgical training was also notable. VR confers significant potential as an adjunctive teaching method in plastic and reconstructive surgery (PRS). Studies demonstrate the utility of virtual simulation in knowledge acquisition and skill development, lated to collaboration and patient communication. Given the underrepresentation of PRS among surgical disciplines regarding VR implementation in surgical education, longitudinal curriculum integration and PRS-specific technologies should be further investigated.","[Landau, Madeleine; Comeaux, Marie; Mortell, Tatjana; Boyle, Rebecca] Tulane Univ, Sch Med, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; [Imbrescia, Kory; Chaffin, Abigail E.] Tulane Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Div Plast & Reconstruct Surg, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA",Tulane University; Tulane University,"Landau, M (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, Sch Med, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",mlandau@tulane.edu,,"Chaffin, Abigail/0000-0001-6446-7142; Boyle, Rebecca/0000-0001-5126-0468; Mortell, Tatjana/0000-0002-0952-4930; Landau, Madeleine/0009-0007-7315-8326; Imbrescia, Kory/0000-0001-5122-7078",,,"Funding This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",59,9,11,1,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-5878,,JPRAS OPEN,JPRAS Open,SEP,2024,41.0,,,,,295,310,,10.1016/j.jpra.2024.06.015,0.0,AUG 2024,16,Surgery,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Surgery,C3U6V,39188661.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001288649900001,0

Addressing these issues, biochar, a carbon-rich by product of pyrolysis, has emerged as a promising soil amendment due to its ability to enhance soil health, support nutrient cycling, and contribute to climate mitigation. However, its interactive effects with rhizosphere dynamics and soil enzymatic process, particularly when used with organic fertilizers, remain insufficiently explored. This review compiles current knowledge on the short-term and long-term impacts of biochar, particularly in combination with organic fertilizers, on rhizosphere properties, enzyme activities, and nutrient dynamics. In the short term, biochar improves soil structure, water retention, and microbial activity, while reducing nutrient leaching and increasing enzymatic functions. Over the long term, it facilitates carbon sequestration, stabilizes soil organic matter (SOM), and ensures nutrient availability, thereby promoting sustainable crop production. The synergistic application of biochar with organic amendments, such as compost and crop residues, further enhances soil fertility and ecosystem services. Despite its numerous benefits, the adoption of biochar on a larger scale is hindered by challenges related to cost-effectiveness, production consistency, and logistical constraints in diverse agricultural systems. Addressing knowledge gaps related to optimal feedstock selection, pyrolysis conditions, and application rates is essential for maximizing biochar's potential. By integrating biochar into sustainable agricultural practices, farmers can enhance soil productivity, reduce environmental impacts, and contribute to climate change mitigation. A strategic and evidence-based implementation of biochar technologies holds promise for achieving long-term sustainability and food security goals.","[Ali, Aamir; Yang, Zhenping] Shanxi Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Jinzhong, Peoples R China; [Ali, Aamir; Farruhbek, Rasulov] Andijan State Med Inst, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Andijan, Uzbekistan; [Jabeen, Nida] Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Commun & Informat Engn, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Chachar, Zaid] Zhongkai Univ Agr & Engn, Coll Agr & Biol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Chachar, Sadaruddin; Ahmed, Nazir] Zhongkai Univ Agr & Engn, Coll Hort & Landscape Architecture, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Ahmed, Shoaib] Sindh Agr Univ, Dept Agron, Tandojam, Pakistan; [Ahmed, Shoaib] Sindh Agr Univ, Fac Crop Prod, Dept Agron, Tandojam, Pakistan; [Laghari, Azhar Ali] Shanxi Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Jinzhong, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Sahito, Zulfiqar Ali] Yunnan Acad Agr Sci YAAS, Ind Crops Res Inst, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Shanxi Agricultural University; Chongqing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Zhongkai University of Agriculture & Engineering; Zhongkai University of Agriculture & Engineering; Sindh Agricultural University; Sindh Agricultural University; Shanxi Agricultural University; Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences,"Ali, A; Yang, ZP (corresponding author), Shanxi Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Jinzhong, Peoples R China.",amshaikh_27@yahoo.com; yangzhenping340@163.com,"Laghari, Azhar/KBQ-4271-2024; Chachar, Sadaruddin/U-7841-2018; Rasulov, Farruhbek/HLP-8957-2023; Sahito, Zulfiqar/JXW-9168-2024; Chachar, Zaid/GLT-0741-2022; Ahmed, Nazir/GPK-1244-2022","Laghari, Azhar/0000-0001-8396-7820; Ali, Aamir/0009-0003-0370-8901; Chachar, Sadaruddin/0000-0002-9714-7775; Jabeen, Nida/0000-0001-7508-5991; Rasulov, Farruhbek/0009-0000-7362-5050;",,,,135,19,22,26,28,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Rice production in SSA faces pressing challenges, such as low productivity, labor shortages, and high postharvest losses, largely attributed to inefficient manual harvesting methods. This review explores the transformative potential of mechanized rice harvesting to address these challenges and enhance productivity in the region. It examines the evolution of harvesting technologies, from simple reapers to advanced combine harvesters, and their suitability for smallholder farming systems. While mechanization offers significant advantages, including increased throughput capacity (up to 1500 kg/h), reduced grain losses (less than 10%), and potential for job creation and youth engagement, adoption in SSA faces constraints related to farmer access, technical knowledge, farm size and infrastructure, crop characteristics, and equipment affordability and adaptability. This review analyzes these constraints and proposes strategies to overcome them, including the import-and-adapt approach for technology transfer. By drawing on case studies and empirical evidence, the review demonstrates the positive impacts of mechanization on productivity, efficiency, and postharvest loss reduction. The review concludes by advocating for intensified research, supportive policies, and capacity-building initiatives, to promote sustainable mechanization practices and transform the rice sector in SSA, contributing to food security and economic growth.","[Amponsah, Shadrack Kwadwo; Azumah, Divine Dogbeda] CSIR Crops Res Inst, Agr Engn & Transport Div, Kumasi, Ghana; [Kumi, Francis] Univ Cape Coast, Sch Sustainable Engn, Dept Agr & Mech Engn, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Akolgo, Gilbert] Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Dept Agr Engn, Sunyani, Ghana",University of Cape Coast,"Amponsah, SK (corresponding author), CSIR Crops Res Inst, Agr Engn & Transport Div, Kumasi, Ghana.",skamponsah@hotmail.com,"Akolgo Ayine, Gilbert/ABF-5036-2021; Kumi, Francis/AAR-2123-2020","Akolgo Ayine, Gilbert/0000-0001-8424-8983; Amponsah, Shaack/0000-0003-2507-8827;",,,,70,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2356-654X,2314-7539,ADV AGR,Adv.

Fruit and vegetables are highly perishable products and, as a result significant amounts are wasted at various stages of the food supply chain. In addition to this, the hard truth is that a high percentage of fresh produce is wasted because it does not meet quality requirements, mainly in terms of aesthetics. One potential solution to reduce fruit and vegetables losses would be to implement technologies in the industry capable of identifying products that may then be discarded at their destination, which will lead to the search for other commercial strategies, including valorization ones. With this focus, the case of tomato, one of the most produced and consumed commodities worldwide and responsible for high food losses, is addressed in this review. Gas sensors, e-nose systems, acoustic technologies, various spectroscopic techniques, as well as optical imaging techniques, have been proposed for non-invasive monitoring of tomato quality parameters. Indeed, their use has allowed the analysis of CO2, ethylene and aroma components, as gas indicators of the physiological state of the fruit, to detect the presence of surface defects and to estimate, color, firmness, titratable acidity, and the content of total soluble solids and bioactive compounds. However, despite their promising results, most of them have important drawbacks for industrial applications. Among the reviewed technologies, multispectral and hyperspectral analysis are particularly advantageous due to their ability to monitor multiple tomatoes quality parameters and their possibility to operate in online multisensory platforms. The review provides, for the first time to our knowledge, a comprehensive overview of the current scientific efforts and knowledge gaps, as well as future directions of the non-invasive techniques investigated for the analysis of tomato quality parameters. These considerations are crucial for the development of technological solutions to be implemented in the agri-food industry in order to minimize food waste while improving process quality and efficiency, thus contributing to a more circular food system.","[Dominguez, Irene] IFAPA La Mojonera, Camino De San Nicolas 1, La Mojonera 04475, Almeria, Spain; [del Rio, Jose Luis] IFAPA Serv Cent, Avda Grecia S N, Seville 41012, Spain; [Ortiz-Somovilla, Victor] IFAPA Alameda del Obispo, Avda Menendez Pidal S N, Cordoba 14004, Spain; [Cantos-Villar, Emma] IFAPA Rancho de La Merced, Ctra Canada De La Loba, Jerez de la Frontera 11471, Cadiz, Spain",,"Domínguez, I (corresponding author), IFAPA La Mojonera, Camino De San Nicolas 1, La Mojonera 04475, Almeria, Spain.",irene.dominguez.perez@juntadeandalucia.es,"Villar, Emma/C-6865-2016; Domínguez Pérez, Irene/A-4598-2017; Somovilla, Victor/F-7165-2011","Domínguez Pérez, Irene/0000-0002-5707-3046;",European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [PP.AVA23.INV2023.036]; ZeroW project (Horizon 2020 Program) [101036388],European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)); ZeroW project (Horizon 2020 Program),"Financial support granted by ZeroW project (Horizon 2020 Program, Grant Agreement no. 101036388) and by PP.AVA23.INV2023.036, co-funded at 80 %, within the Operational Program for Andalusia 2021-2027 by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) .",98,6,6,9,30,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0963-9969,1873-7145,FOOD RES INT,Food Res.

Eligibility criteria Studies addressing outcomes related to the use of technologies for hypertension healthcare (all points in the healthcare cascade) in SSA. Methods Databases were searched from inception to 2 August 2021. Screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were done in duplicate. Data were extracted on study design, setting, technology(s) employed and outcomes. Blood pressure (BP) reduction due to intervention was extracted from a subset of randomised controlled trials. Methodological quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results 1717 hits were retrieved, 1206 deduplicated studies were screened and 67 full texts were assessed for eligibility. 22 studies were included, all reported on clinical investigations. Two studies were observational, and 20 evaluated technology-based interventions. Outcomes included BP reduction/control, treatment adherence, retention in care, awareness/knowledge of hypertension and completeness of medical records. All studies used mobile technology, three linked with IoT devices. Short Message Service (SMS) was the most popular method of targeting patients (n=6). Moderate BP reduction was achieved in three randomised controlled trials. Patients and healthcare providers reported positive perceptions towards the technologies. No studies using AI were identified. Conclusions There are a range of successful applications of key enabling technologies in SSA, including BP reduction, increased health knowledge and treatment adherence following targeted mobile technology interventions. There is evidence to support use of mobile technology for hypertension management in SSA. However, current application of technologies is highly heterogeneous and key barriers exist, limiting efficacy and uptake in SSA. More research is needed, addressing objective measures such as BP reduction in robust randomised studies.

A Scoping Review of the Impact of Visual Aids on Patients Undergoing Surgery,JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION,English,Review,surgery; art; drawing; visual aid; patient education; education,INFORMED-CONSENT; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; DECISION AID; LITERACY; COMPREHENSION; SATISFACTION; EDUCATION; ANXIETY; CARE,"OBJECTIVE: While graphics are commonly used by clinicians to communicate information to patients, the impact of using visual media on surgical patients is not understood. This review seeks to understand the current landscape of research analyzing impact of using visual aids to communicate with patients undergoing surgery, as well as gaps in the present literature. DESIGN: A comprehensive literature search was performed across 4 databases. Search terms included: visual aids, diagrams, graphics, surgery, patient education, informed consent, and decision making. Inclusion criteria were (i) full-text, peer-reviewed articles in English; (ii) evaluation of a nonelectronic visual aid(s); and (iii) surgical patient population. RESULTS: There were 1402 articles identified; 21 met study criteria. Fifteen were randomized control trials and 6 were prospective cohort studies. Visual media assessed comprised of diagrams as informed consent adjuncts (n = 6), graphics for shared decision-making conversations (n = 3), other preoperative educational graphics (n = 8), and postoperative educational materials (n = 4). There was statistically significant improvement in patient comprehension, with an increase in objective knowledge recall (7.8%-29.6%) using illustrated educational materials (n = 10 of 15). Other studies noted increased satisfaction (n = 4 of 6), improvement in shared decision-making (n = 2 of 4), and reduction in patient anxiety (n = 3 of 6). For behavioral outcomes, visual aids improved postoperative medication compliance (n = 2) and lowered postoperative analgesia requirements (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: The use of visual aids to enhance the surgical patient experience is promising in improving knowledge retention, satisfaction, and reducing anxiety. Future studies ought to consider visual aid format, and readability, as well as patient language, race, and healthcare literacy. ( J Surg Ed 81:1276-1292.- 1292.

Our search identified 23 interventions. Text messaging was the most common telehealth delivery mode, followed by videoconferencing, commercially available applications, and novel applications. Nine interventions used more than one delivery mode. Common features across interventions to address barriers along the HIV care continuum included: HIV care self-management and monitoring tools; HIV treatment and adherence education; resources and referrals provision; live messaging for ongoing support or urgent issues; videoconference-based coaching, counseling, case management, or care; online peer-to-peer support; ecological momentary assessments to monitor and address barriers; and game-based elements to increase engagement. Interventions were reported as acceptable and feasible, with several showing an effect on antiretroviral therapy adherence.

Purpose: The purpose of this review was to identify best practices in virtual clinical experiences for undergraduate and graduate nursing students using the Community of Inquiry model as a framework. Method: A scoping review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute Scoping Review process. Ten databases were searched systematically for literature related to virtual nursing student clinical experiences. The 36 articles retained for review were appraised using evidence-based rapid critical appraisal tools. Results: The literature suggests virtual clinical experiences may positively impact clinical reasoning and judgement; knowledge gain, retention, and application; affective learning; communication and teamwork; competence; engagement; confidence; and satisfaction. However, increased anxiety, frustration with technology and access, difficulty asking questions, and increased cost were reported. Additional considerations included appropriate faculty training, student support, and accreditation and board certification requirements. Standards related to virtual clinical experiences and simulation for advanced practice registered nurses needs further study. Conclusion: Virtual clinical experiences resulted in positive student learning outcomes. Through the provision of quality virtual clinical experiences, nurse educators have the potential to maximize student learning and professional growth.","[Kolcun, Kaitlyn; Ulloa, Jodi; Zehala, Anita; Zeno, Rosie; Tornwall, Joni] Ohio State Univ, Coll Nursing, 1585 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Zellefrow, Cindy] Ohio State Univ, Helene Fuld Hlth Trust Natl Inst Evidence Based Pr, Coll Nursing, 1585 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Karl, Joyce] 2050 Carriage Rd, Powell, OH 43065 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Kolcun, K (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Coll Nursing, 1585 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",Kolcun.6@osu.edu,,"Kolcun, Kaitlyn/0000-0002-8909-6779; Zeno, Rosie/0000-0002-2632-4316; Tornwall, Joni/0000-0001-8479-8352; Ulloa, Jodi/0000-0002-6624-2462",,,,62,8,9,4,16,W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC,PHILADELPHIA,"1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA",8755-7223,1532-8481,J PROF NURS,J.

Obtaining adequate water and nutrients involves taking up both desired and undesired elements from the soil solution and separating resources from waste. Desirable and undesirable elements in the soil solution can share similar chemical properties, such as size and charge. Plants use membrane separation mechanisms to distinguish between different molecules that have similar chemical properties. Membrane separation enables distribution or retention of resources and efflux or compartmentation of waste. Plants use specialised membrane separation mechanisms to adapt to challenging soil solution compositions and distinguish between resources and waste. Coordination and regulation of these mechanisms between different tissues, cell types and subcellular membranes supports plant nutrition, environmental stress tolerance and energy management. This review considers membrane separation mechanisms in plants that contribute to specialised separation processes and highlights mechanisms of interest for engineering plants with enhanced performance in challenging conditions and for inspiring the development of novel industrial membrane separation technologies. Knowledge gained from studying plant membrane separation mechanisms can be applied to developing precision separation technologies. Separation technologies are needed for harvesting resources from industrial wastes and transitioning to a circular green economy.","[De Rosa, Annamaria; McGaughey, Samantha; Magrath, Isobel; Byrt, Caitlin] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Plant Sci, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"McGaughey, S; Byrt, C (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Plant Sci, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",samantha.mcgaughey@anu.edu.au; caitlin.byrt@anu.edu.au,"; Byrt, Caitlin/I-9785-2018; De Rosa, Annamaria/AAT-6060-2021","Magrath, Isobel/0000-0002-9065-2015; Byrt, Caitlin/0000-0001-8549-2873; De Rosa, Annamaria/0000-0002-2610-9149; McGaughey, Samantha/0000-0001-6133-0415","Australian Research Council [FT180100476]; Australian Academy of Sciences Thomas Davies Research Grant for Marine, Soil and Plant Biology; Australian Research Council [FT180100476] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Academy of Sciences Thomas Davies Research Grant for Marine, Soil and Plant Biology; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","CB was supported by the Australian Research Council FT180100476 and through funding from the Australian National University.

Technologies such as high-moisture extrusion (HME) have the potential to develop anisotropic structures using alternative protein ingredients. This article discusses the different possible mechanisms responsible for structure formation and the effect of extrusion process parameters and outlines the recent advances in the long cooling dies (LCDs) used for meat alternative development. The role of different protein ingredients and the impact of combining them with other biopolymers were also evaluated. The underlying mechanism behind anisotropic structure formation during HME is a synergistic effect, with substantial dependence on the source of ingredients and their processing background. Formulation including proteins derived from plants, insects, animals, and microalgae with other biopolymers could pave the way to develop structured meat alternatives and fill nutritional interstices. Dynamic or rotating annular gap cooling dies operating at freely controllable shear and static annular gap dies are recent developments and assist to produce layered or fibrous structures.

Furthermore, SW harbors valuable resources that possess substantial economic potential. As such, SW treatment technologies place increased emphasis on resource recycling, while progressively advancing towards energy saving, sustainability, and circular economy principles. This review comprehensively encapsulates the state -of -the -art knowledge for treating SW, including conventional (i.e., constructed wetlands, air stripping and aerobic system) and resource-utilization-based (i.e., anaerobic digestion, membrane separation, anaerobic ammonium oxidation, microbial fuel cells, and microalgal-based system) technologies. Furthermore, this research also elaborates the key factors influencing the SW treatment performance, such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, hydraulic retention time and organic loading rate. The potentials for reutilizing energy, biomass and digestate produced during the SW treatment processes are also summarized. Moreover, the obstacles associated with full-scale implementation, long-term treatment, energyefficient design, and nutrient recovery of various resource -utilization -based SW treatment technologies are emphasized.

Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines four electronic databases were systematically searched. Inclusion criteria: empirical studies using any type of AR intervention in patient education across all medical specialties. Quality assessment of the retrieved literature was carried out. Results: Ten papers, comprising 788 patients, were identified and included (Randomized controlled trial (RCT)(n = 3), non-randomized controlled trial (n = 3), before-and-after study (n = 3), and qualitative survey (n = 1)). Retrieved literature showed itself to be highly heterogeneous. The studied population included patients suffering from a diverse spectrum of chronic diseases (e.g., prostate cancer, diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy). Quantitative results indicated that the use of AR had a positive effect on knowledge retention and patient satisfaction. Qualitative findings suggested that patients liked the technology and felt comfortable with its use for educational purposes. The quality of the retrieved results was shown to be moderate to low. Conclusion: The limited evidence of this topic suggests the possible potential of AR in patient education. Practice implication: More research, using high-quality study designs and more evidence-based interventions, is needed to fully appreciate the value of AR on patient education.","[Urlings, Julie; Sezer, Sumeyye; ter Laan, Mark; Bartels, Ronald; Boogaarts, Jeroen] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Neurosurg, Med Ctr, Reinier Postlaan 4, NL-6525 GC Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Urlings, Julie; Maal, Thomas] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, 3D Lab Radboudumc, Med Ctr, Geert Grootepl Zuid 10, NL-6525 GA Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Urlings, Julie; Henssen, Dylan] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Med Imaging, Med Ctr, Geert Grootepl 10, NL-6525 GA Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Urlings, J (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Neurosurg, Med Ctr, Reinier Postlaan 4, NL-6525 GC Nijmegen, Netherlands.",julie.urlings@radboudumc.nl,"Bartels, Ronald/L-4184-2015; Maal, Thomas/L-4497-2015; Boogaarts, Jeroen/L-4216-2015; Ter Laan, Mark/L-4466-2015; Henssen, Dylan/F-2452-2016","Ter Laan, Mark/0000-0002-9213-430X; Henssen, Dylan/0000-0002-3915-3034",,,,51,46,54,1,16,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0738-3991,1873-5134,PATIENT EDUC COUNS,Patient Educ.

This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, analyzing 31 articles published between 2020 and 2025 across four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Dimensions, and ScienceDirect). Articles were included if they complied with the following inclusion criteria: using (any) immersive tools, carrying out evaluation methods, and participation of students in STEM-related engineering courses. The data extracted encompassed sample characteristics, game attributes, evaluation methods, and results. The findings suggest that immersive tools positively impact students' engagement and motivation. However, challenges such as potential motion sickness, complexity of serious games (SGs), and high implementation costs exist. SG design must balance engagement, immersion and pedagogical effectiveness to ensure viability. Future research should assess long-term impacts and promote methodological consistency across studies, particularly in subject areas and sample demographics, while determining a way to reduce motion sickness and alleviating SG complexity and difficulty.","[Reis, Vasco] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal; [Baptista, Joao Santos; Duarte, Joana] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Associated Lab Energy Transports & Aeronaut LAETA, PROA, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Duarte, J (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Associated Lab Energy Transports & Aeronaut LAETA, PROA, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal.",up202005146@edu.fe.up.pt; jsbap@fe.up.pt; jasduarte@fe.up.pt,"Santos Baptista, João/N-7149-2013","Santos Baptista, João/0000-0002-8524-5503",EU Erasmus+ under STRIM (Safety Training with Real Immersivity for Mining) [101083272]; EU Erasmus+ under STRIM,EU Erasmus+ under STRIM (Safety Training with Real Immersivity for Mining); EU Erasmus+ under STRIM,This publication was financed by EU Erasmus+ under STRIM (Safety Training with Real Immersivity for Mining) project 101083272.,53,1,3,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Processed food shows a higher retention of health-related compounds and an extension of the shelf-life compared to conventional pasteurization methods. This technology is gradually moving from the laboratory and pilot-plant scale to the commercial scale. In the current review, we focus on the way existing knowledge on mathematical modeling and computational approaches is structured, connected, and interpreted across scales. We start with the electroporation models, progressing from those that are derived from simple physical and chemical considerations to those that are based on more complex probabilistic approaches. They attempt to predict how electric pulses create pores in cell membranes and form the basis of kinetic inactivation models. Subsequently, we examine the most common kinetic models of microorganism inactivation, from first-order models to models based on random and probabilistic considerations. We then review the works carried out on the numerical simulations of the electric field in a continuous PEF chamber and the works related to coupled simulations of the electric, fluid flow, temperature, and inactivation kinetic field. Finally, we conclude the manuscript with a section dedicated to the current applications of the PEF process to demonstrate its effectiveness.","[Luzi, Giovanni; Cho, Man-Gi] LSTME Busan, 2B 1276 Jisa-dong,Gangseo-gu, Busan 46742, South Korea; [Bashir, Khawaja Muhammad Imran; Choi, Jae-Suk] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Inst Marine Ind, Dept Seafood Sci & Technol, Tongyeong 53064, South Korea; [Lyu, Wenjing] DST Entwicklungszentrum Schiffstechn & Transportsy, Oststrasse 77, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany",Gyeongsang National University,"Choi, JS (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Inst Marine Ind, Dept Seafood Sci & Technol, Tongyeong 53064, South Korea.",giovanni.luzi@lstme.org; imranbashir@gnu.ac.kr; wenjing.lyu@lstme.org; man-gi.cho@lstme.org; jsc1008@gnu.ac.kr,"Bashir, Khawaja Muhammad Imran/J-9192-2018","Bashir, Khawaja Muhammad Imran/0000-0002-6830-2588; Choi, Jae-Suk/0000-0002-8151-6054",Korea government (MSIT) [RS-2024-00335405],"Korea government (MSIT)(Ministry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (RS-2024-00335405).,112,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2304-8158,FOODS,Foods,JAN 3,2026,15.0,1,,,,,,164,10.3390/foods15010164,0.0,,45,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food Science & Technology,AV2ZI,41517230.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001657608300001,0

The review process in Rayyan involved deduplication, screening, and full-text analysis. Data were qualitatively analyzed using content analysis, and methodological quality was assessed with CASP and the Downs and Black. The findings highlight that microlearning, integrated with digital tools such as online platforms, mobile apps, and short videos, significantly enhances student motivation, performance, and interaction; content in short modules facilitates knowledge retention and connects concepts to real-life situations. Promising trends include mobile technologies and gamification, which foster active, meaningful learning. Grounded in theories like Self-Determination, Constructionism, and Constructivism, microlearning personalizes teaching and promotes engagement, critical thinking, and accessibility, contributing to inclusive and sustainable education. From a STSE perspective, social technologies enhance autonomy, social interaction, and ethical-environmental awareness.

However, widespread adoption of 3DCP requires overcoming key material challenges. These include controlling rheology for pumpability and buildability and achieving sufficient mechanical strength. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the application of nanoclays (NCs) as a key admixture to address these challenges. The effects of three primary NCs (attapulgite (ATT), bentonite (BEN), and sepiolite (SEP)) on the fresh- and hardened-state properties of printable mortars are systematically analyzed. This review summarize findings on how NCs enhanced thixotropy, yield stress, and cohesion, which are critical for shape retention and the successful printing of multilayered structures. Quantitative analysis reveals that optimized dosages of NCs can increase compressive strength by up to 34% and flexural strength by up to 20%. For enhancing rheology and printability, a dosage of approximately 0.5% by binder weight is often suggested for ATT and SEP. In contrast, BEN can be used at higher replacement levels (up to 20%) to also function as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM), though this significantly impacts workability. This review consolidates the current knowledge to provide a clear framework for selecting appropriate NCs and dosages to develop high-performance, reliable, and sustainable materials for 3DCP applications.","[Si, Wen; Carr, Liam; Zia, Asad; Khan, Mehran; McNally, Ciaran] Univ Coll Dublin, Ctr Crit Infrastruct, Sch Civil Engn, Dublin D04 V1W8, Ireland; [Si, Wen; Khan, Mehran; McNally, Ciaran] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Civil Engn, Construct Innovate, Dublin D04 V1W8, Ireland",University College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Khan, M; McNally, C (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Ctr Crit Infrastruct, Sch Civil Engn, Dublin D04 V1W8, Ireland.;Khan, M; McNally, C (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Civil Engn, Construct Innovate, Dublin D04 V1W8, Ireland.",wen.si@ucd.ie; liam.carr@ucdconnect.ie; asad.zia@ucdconnect.ie; khan.mehran@ucd.ie; ciaran.mcnally@ucd.ie,"khan, Mehran/ABE-3054-2021; McNally, Ciaran/E-5364-2010","khan, Mehran/0000-0003-2898-1827; McNally, Ciaran/0000-0003-2159-2634; Zia, Asad/0000-0002-5528-929X",Construct Innovate Technology Centre and Harcourt Technologies Limited (HTL); Construct Innovate Technology Centre [CISFC1-23_013]; Harcourt Technologies Limited (HTL) [13/RC/2092_P2]; Ecocem Materials and the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) Research Centre in Applied Geosciences; MDPI,Construct Innovate Technology Centre and Harcourt Technologies Limited (HTL); Construct Innovate Technology Centre; Harcourt Technologies Limited (HTL); Ecocem Materials and the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) Research Centre in Applied Geosciences; MDPI,This publication emanated from 2 separate projects.

Surveys have shown that digital games are very popular among all age groups, including when they are used in foreign language education, such as in Digital Game-Based Vocabulary Learning (DGBVL). Therefore, the purpose of this review study is to summarize the existing knowledge on DGBVL and to provide new, cutting-edge information based on available literature accessible within three databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria and conducting the search, 13 articles were identified for a deeper analysis. The main findings reveal that DGBVL can create a positive learning environment. In this kind of environment, students experience predominantly positive emotions which may in turn enhance their vocabulary retention. The review suggests that DGBVL is useful in vocabulary learning and may even surpass conventional teaching methods in an English classroom. The findings of this review can serve as a basis for further research, which could ultimately lead to the implementation of DGBVL in the process of English instruction, not only as a supplementary method, but possibly as a full alternative to conventional English lessons.","[Vnucko, Gregor] Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Fac Pedag, Dept English Language & Culture, Drazovska 4, Nitra 94901, Slovakia; [Klimova, Blanka] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Appl Linguist, Hradecka 1249-6, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic",Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra; University of Hradec Kralove,"Vnucko, G (corresponding author), Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Fac Pedag, Dept English Language & Culture, Drazovska 4, Nitra 94901, Slovakia.",gregor.vnucko@ukf.sk,"Klimova, Blanka/F-7016-2019; Vnučko, Gregor/MTF-2607-2025","Klimova, Blanka/0000-0001-8000-9766; Vnučko, Gregor/0000-0002-2170-5961",SPEV project 2023,SPEV project 2023,The study was supported by the SPEV project 2023.,70,33,35,12,122,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-8954,SYSTEMS-BASEL,Systems-Basel,FEB,2023,11.0,2,,,,,,57,10.3390/systems11020057,0.0,,18,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,9M1HJ,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:000941988700001,0

One such class of software, purpose-created to take advantage of spaced learning and spaced testing principles, are electronic flashcard applications. We provide a perspective on the novel use of the Quizlet flashcard application in a tertiary educational setting. To reduce cognitive load for international graduate dental students taking a pharmacology review course, we implemented Quizlet, which integrates both spaced learning and self-testing, to improve the student learning experience. This study assessed students' perceptions of the Quizlet flashcard system in a student cohort comprised of two consecutive years' classes (n = 51 students in total).

Aerobic Granular Sludge (AGS) has emerged as a transformative technology in sustainable wastewater treatment, characterized by its compact structure, high biomass retention and multiple pollutants removal capability. The unique spatial layered structure allows AGS to simultaneously remove COD, nitrogen, phosphorus and other pollutants from wastewater in a single reactor. This paper analyzed 3289 retrieved articles and found that research hotspots in the past 15 years cover both macroscale applications and molecular mechanisms related to AGS. There is no unified view on the formation mechanism of AGS. The connections and differences between the mechanisms of various strategies to accelerate AGS granulation are still unclear. Based on relevant studies in the past 25 years, this paper proposes a 6-step granulation mechanism of AGS, including 6 processes from nucleus formation to AGS fragmentation. It comprehensively summarizes the influencing factors in the granulation process, the mechanisms of 4 strategies to accelerate granulation, their connections and the latest knowledge. It emphasizes the crucial role of AGS in integrating the treatment of emerging pollutants in wastewater and resource recovery. This work is of great significance for developing efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment systems.","[Zhang, Peiyuan; Xiong, Wei; Xiao, Gang; Su, Haijia] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Life Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Green Biomfg, Beijing Key Lab Green Chem Biomfg, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Chemical Technology,"Xiao, G; Su, HJ (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Life Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Green Biomfg, Beijing Key Lab Green Chem Biomfg, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",sewicxiao@hotmail.com; suhj@mail.buct.edu.cn,"Xiao, Gang/L-8997-2019","Xiao, Gang/0000-0002-0635-8965; Xiong, Wei/0009-0009-1147-8388",National Natural Science Foundation of China [22408019]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [PY2517],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),We express our thanks for funding support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22408019) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (PY2517).,136,3,3,54,54,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

There is a lack of recently published papers regarding this theme. The aim of the present work is to organize current knowledge. (2) Methods: A review of the literature regarding the topics vestibular schwannoma, hearing loss, and hearing aid was performed. Nineteen studies were thus considered. (3) Results: Conventional hearing aids, contralateral routing of signal (CROS) aids, bone anchored hearing aids (BAHA), and others are available options for hearing rehabilitation in VS patients. The speech discrimination score (SDS) is considered the best measure to assess candidacy for rehabilitation with hearing aids. The best hearing rehabilitative conditions in VS patients when using conventional hearing aid devices are a mild-moderate hearing loss degree with good word recognition (more than 50% SDS). CROS-Aid and BAHA are reported to be beneficial. CROS-Aid expands on the area of receiving hearing. BAHA aids use direct bone-conduction stimulation. Unfortunately, there are no available studies focused specifically on VS patients that compare CROS and BAHA technologies. (4) Conclusions: Hearing aids, CROS, and BAHA are viable options for rehabilitating hearing impairment in VS, but require an accurate case-by-case audiological evaluation for rehabilitating hearing impairment in VS. Further studies are needed to prove if what is currently known about similar hearing illnesses can be confirmed, particularly in the case of VS.","[Fiasca, Valerio Maria Di Pasquale; Sorrentino, Flavia; Conti, Martina; De Lucia, Giulia; Trevisi, Patrizia; Zanoletti, Elisabetta; Brotto, Davide] Univ Padua, Dept Neurosci, Otolaryngol Unit, Sect Otolaryngol, Via 5 Giustiniani 2, I-35128 Padua, Italy; [de Filippis, Cosimo] Univ Padua, Dept Neurosci DNS, Audiol Unit, I-31100 Treviso, Italy",University of Padua; University of Padua,"Fiasca, VMD (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Neurosci, Otolaryngol Unit, Sect Otolaryngol, Via 5 Giustiniani 2, I-35128 Padua, Italy.",valeriomaria.dipasqualefiasca@studenti.unipd.it,"zanoletti, elisabetta/AAC-3012-2022; Trevisi, Patrizia/AAC-3833-2022; De Lucia, Giulia/JXN-4489-2024; Brotto, Davide/ABD-5332-2021",,,,,56,1,1,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2039-4330,2039-4349,AUDIOL RES,Audiol.

With increasing production and stricter quality standards, the demand for energy-efficient postharvest primary processing technologies (blanching and drying) has become increasingly urgent. Traditionally, G. jasminoides Ellis is blanched with hot water or steam followed by sun drying or hot air drying, which often results in prolonged processing times and compromised product quality. Although extensive research has been conducted on improving processing efficiency and quality retention, the existing knowledge remains fragmented. This paper provides a comprehensive review of post-harvest primary processing technologies for G. jasminoides Ellis, focusing on efficiency optimization and quality control mechanisms in blanching and drying processes. It proposes innovative solutions and future development trends. Research findings demonstrate that vacuum-steam pulsed blanching combined with radio-frequency hot air drying could replace traditional hot water blanching and hot air drying in commercial production for enhancing product quality and processing efficiency of G. jasminoides Ellis. The integration of machine learning and blanching-drying processes is the future development trend to improve the primary processing level of G. jasminoides Ellis. The information presented here will provide technological recommendations for the industrialization and high-quality processing of fruit medicinal materials.","[Xiao, Zhifeng; Yang, Lingjian; Ai, Ziping; Li, Tao; Liu, Muhua; Xiong, Qiangqiang] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Jiangxi Key Lab Modern Agr Equipment Jiangxi Prov, Nanchang 330045, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Lingqu] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Nanchang 330045, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Hongwei] China Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Jiangxi Agricultural University; Jiangxi Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Ai, ZP; Li, T (corresponding author), Jiangxi Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Jiangxi Key Lab Modern Agr Equipment Jiangxi Prov, Nanchang 330045, Peoples R China.",aiziping@jxau.edu.cn; litao517207995@163.com,,,"Jiangxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation [20242BAB20330, 20242BAB25363]; Jiangxi Provincial Early-Career Young Scientific and Technological Talent Development Program [20244BCE52036]; Jiangxi Province Key R & D Program project [20232BBF60016]",Jiangxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation; Jiangxi Provincial Early-Career Young Scientific and Technological Talent Development Program; Jiangxi Province Key R & D Program project,"This work was supported by Jiangxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation (20242BAB20330 and 20242BAB25363) , Jiangxi Provincial Early-Career Young Scientific and Technological Talent Development Program (No.20244BCE52036) , and the Jiangxi Province Key R & D Program project (No.20232BBF60016) .",132,1,1,18,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-6690,1872-633X,IND CROP PROD,Ind.

Ubiquitination is also reversible, and the human genome encodes over 90 deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), many of which appear to target specific subsets of ubiquitinated proteins. This review focuses on the roles of DUBs in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). We present the current genetic evidence connecting 12 DUBs to a range of NDDs and the functional studies implicating at least 19 additional DUBs as candidate NDD genes. We highlight how the study of DUBs in NDDs offers critical insights into the role of protein degradation during brain development. Because one of the major known functions of a DUB is to antagonize the UPS, loss of function of DUB genes has been shown to culminate in loss of abundance of its protein substrates. The identification and study of NDD DUB substrates in the developing brain is revealing that they regulate networks of proteins that themselves are encoded by NDD genes. We describe the new technologies that are enabling the full resolution of DUB protein networks in the developing brain, with the view that this knowledge can direct the development of new therapeutic paradigms. The fact that the abundance of many NDD proteins is regulated by the UPS presents an exciting opportunity to combat NDDs caused by haploinsufficiency, because the loss of abundance of NDD proteins can be potentially rectified by antagonizing their UPS-based degradation.",,,,,"; jolly, lachlan/B-5892-2015; Gecz, Jozef/X-3469-2019; Piper, Michael/B-2805-2010; Penzes, Peter/L-3987-2016","Sharma, Raman/0000-0001-7976-8386; jolly, lachlan/0000-0003-4538-2658; Gecz, Jozef/0000-0002-7884-6861; Piper, Michael/0000-0002-6759-2560;","SFARI Explorer Grant [527556]; Australian Research Council [DE160100620]; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia Research Fellowship [1155224]; National Institutes of Health [R01MH107182]; Common Fund of the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health; National Cancer Institute; National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institute of Mental Health, and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; Australian Research Council [DE160100620] Funding Source: Australian Research Council; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH107182] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","SFARI Explorer Grant; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia Research Fellowship(National Health & Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Common Fund of the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Office of the Director); National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institute of Mental Health, and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))","This work was supported by SFARI Explorer Grant 527556 to MP and LAJ.

Its introduction into healthcare has transformed the industry, significantly impacting various aspects such as education, teaching, diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care. Researchers have tested the accuracy of various generations of AI models for detecting peri-implant bone loss using radiographic images. While studies have reported promising outcomes, there remains significant potential for improving these models. This systematic review aims to critically analyze the existing published literature on the accuracy of AI models in detecting peri-implant bone loss and to evaluate the current state of knowledge in this area. Methods: The guidelines established by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) were pivotal and provided a framework for preparing, implementing, and recording this systematic review. The protocol for this review was registered in PROSPERO. Four electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane) were diligently searched on 5-6 January 2025, targeting articles published between January 2000 and December 2024. The PIRD elements (population, index test, reference test, diagnosis of interest) that helped in structuring the protocol of the present review were: P: X-ray images of humans demonstrating the bone loss around the dental implant; I: Artificial intelligence models used for detecting radiographic peri-implant bone loss; R: Expert opinions and reference standards; D: Radiographic peri-implant bone loss. The Quality Assessment and Diagnostic Accuracy Tool (QUADAS-2) was used to assess the quality of each included study. Results: Seven studies met the selection criteria and were included in the qualitative analysis. A self-designed table was used to tabulate all the relevant study characteristics. The included studies were reported to have a moderate level of certainty of evidence as assessed by the GRADE assessment. In general, all studies included in this review demonstrated a low risk of bias. Overall accuracy of the AI models varied and ranged between 61% and 94.74%. The precision values ranged from 0.63% to 100%. Whereas sensitivity and specificity values range between 67% and 94.44%, and 87% and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: The present systematic review highlights that AI models demonstrate high accuracy in detecting peri-implant bone loss using dento-maxillofacial radiographic images. Thus, AI models can serve as effective tools for the practicing dentist in confirming the diagnosis of peri-implant bone loss, ultimately aiding in accurate treatment planning and improving treatment outcomes.","[Mugri, Maryam H.] Jazan Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Maxillofacial Surg & Diagnost Sci, Jazan 45142, Saudi Arabia",Jazan University,"Mugri, MH (corresponding author), Jazan Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Maxillofacial Surg & Diagnost Sci, Jazan 45142, Saudi Arabia.",mmugri@jazanu.edu.sa,,,,,,60,3,3,12,16,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4418,DIAGNOSTICS,Diagnostics,MAR 7,2025,15.0,6,,,,,,655,10.3390/diagnostics15060655,0.0,,18,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,0OM4X,40149998.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001452243600001,0

Improved solar drying technologies offer a sustainable solution by extending shelf life and enhancing product quality. However, their adoption among smallholder mango farmers remains limited. This study investigates the key barriers and drivers influencing the uptake of these technologies in three districts of Inhambane Province, through a combination of literature review and semi-structured interviews. Major barriers include limited technical knowledge, high upfront costs, poor market access, and limited institutional support. Field data show that over 80% of farmers are unaware of improved fruit drying techniques, and fewer than 5% have received any training. While the literature emphasizes environmental sustainability and policy support, field interviews highlight a stronger interest in practical enablers, such as affordable systems, hands-on training, and income-generating potential. The study calls for a multisectoral approach, involving financial support, capacity-building, and strengthened extension services to promote adoption. Scaling solar drying technologies can significantly reduce post-harvest losses and strengthen the mango value chain, contributing to food security and rural development in Mozambique.","[Salvador, Paula Viola; Lazarte, Claudia; Galindo, Federico Gomez] Lund Univ, Dept Proc & Life Sci Engn, Div Food & Pharm, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Salvador, Paula Viola; Tivana, Lucas] Eduardo Mondlane Univ, Fac Agron & Forestry Engn, Ctr Excellence Agri Food Syst & Nutr, Maputo 257, Mozambique; [Kugbega, Selorm] Stockholm Environm Inst, S-11523 Stockholm, Sweden",Lund University; Eduardo Mondlane University; Stockholm Environment Institute,"Salvador, PV (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Proc & Life Sci Engn, Div Food & Pharm, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.;Salvador, PV (corresponding author), Eduardo Mondlane Univ, Fac Agron & Forestry Engn, Ctr Excellence Agri Food Syst & Nutr, Maputo 257, Mozambique.",paula.viola@ple.lth.se; selorm.kugbega@sei.org; claudia.lazarte@ple.lth.se; lucastivana@yahoo.co.uk; federico.gomez@ple.lth.se,"Gomez Galindo, Federico/H-4230-2019","Gomez Galindo, Federico/0000-0003-4994-8073; Tivana, Lucas Daniel/0000-0002-0905-8829; Lazarte, Claudia E/0000-0002-5174-809X",Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA); [2017-05625],Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA)(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD);,"This research was funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), Grant number: Dr.n. 2017-05625.",70,1,2,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP 17,2025,17.0,18,,,,,,8325,10.3390/su17188325,0.0,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,7WD2T,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001581072900001,0

It occurs due to mutations in three genes that encode for the alpha chains of type IV collagen. Globally, the disease is classified based on the pattern of inheritance into X-linked AS (XLAS), which is caused by pathogenic variants in COL4A5, representing 80% of AS. Autosomal recessive AS (ARAS), caused by mutations in either COL4A3 or COL4A4, represents 15% of AS. Autosomal dominant AS (ADAS) is rare and has been recorded in 5% of all cases due to mutations in COL4A3 or COL4A4. This review provides updated knowledge about AS including its clinical and genetic characteristics in addition to available therapies that only slow the progression of the disease. It also focuses on reported cases in Saudi Arabia and their prevalence. Moreover, we shed light on advances in genetic technologies like gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, the need for an early diagnosis of AS and managing the progression of the disease. Eventually, we provide a few recommendations for disease management, particularly in regions like Saudi Arabia where consanguineous marriages increase the risk.","[Mahrous, Nahed N.] Univ Hafr Al Batin, Coll Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Hafar al Batin 39524, Saudi Arabia; [Jamous, Yahya F.] King Abdulaziz City Sci & Technol, Natl Ctr Vaccines & Bioproc, Riyadh 12354, Saudi Arabia; [Almatrafi, Ahmad M.] Taibah Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Madinah 42353, Saudi Arabia; [Fallatah, Deema I.] Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Appl Med Sci, Dept Med Lab Sci, Al Kharj 11942, Saudi Arabia; [Theyab, Abdulrahman] Secur Forces Hosp, Dept Lab & Blood Bank, Mecca 11481, Saudi Arabia; [Theyab, Abdulrahman; Hawsawi, Yousef M.] Al Faisal Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Med, POB 50927, Riyadh 50927, Saudi Arabia; [Alanati, Bayan H.] Univ Marburg, Ctr Synthet Microbiol, Bioinformat Core Facil, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Alsagaby, Suliman A.] Majmaah Univ, Coll Appl Med Sci, Dept Med Lab Sci, Al Majmaah 11952, Saudi Arabia; [Alenazi, Munifa K.; Khan, Mohammed I.; Hawsawi, Yousef M.] King Faisal Specialist Hosp & Res Ctr, Res Ctr, POB 40047, Jeddah 21499, Saudi Arabia",Hafr Albatin University; Taibah University; Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University; Security Forces Hospital - Saudi Arabia; Philipps University Marburg; Majmaah University; King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center,"Hawsawi, YM (corresponding author), Al Faisal Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Med, POB 50927, Riyadh 50927, Saudi Arabia.;Hawsawi, YM (corresponding author), King Faisal Specialist Hosp & Res Ctr, Res Ctr, POB 40047, Jeddah 21499, Saudi Arabia.",n.mahrous@yahoo.com; yjamous@kacst.edu.sa; a.m.almatrafi@gmail.com; n.fllatah@psau.edu.sa; hawsa33@hotmail.com; bsyan.alanati@icloud.com; s.alsaqaby@mu.eu.sa; munaifah29alenezi@gmail.com; imrankhanitr@gmail.com; hyousef@kfshrc.edu.sa,"Hawsawi, Yousef Mohammeabaa/K-8070-2019; fallatah, Deema/GRR-3597-2022; Theyab, Abdulrahman/GPT-3811-2022; Alsagaby, Suliman/AHD-8154-2022; Khan, Mohammad/JAX-4119-2023; Mahrous, Nahed/JXX-5117-2024; f, Deema/GRR-3597-2022; Jamous, Yahya/KBQ-7330-2024","Hawsawi, Yousef Mohammeabaa/0000-0003-1901-697X; Almatrafi, Ahmed/0000-0001-9027-5427; f, Deema/0000-0002-6901-3104; Jamous, Yahya/0000-0003-4809-9743",Y.M.H. would like to thank King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (Gen.

The Australian aquaculture industry relies heavily on wild-caught broodstock for seedstock production, introducing substantial and unprecedented biosecurity risks. This systematic review consolidates current knowledge on the viral pathogens affecting key Australian fish and prawn species, their economic impacts, and the biosecurity measures implemented for mitigation. Notably, viral outbreaks have led to losses exceeding AUD 100 million in some sectors, highlighting the urgent need for improved management. Existing biosecurity strategies, including surveillance systems, molecular diagnostics, and pathogen exclusion protocols, are critically assessed for their effectiveness. Emerging approaches such as genetic resistance breeding, advanced vaccination technologies, and integrated risk management frameworks are also explored. Key knowledge gaps, particularly in the context of emerging viral pathogens and their ecological interactions under changing environmental conditions, are identified as priority areas for future research. This review emphasises the necessity of adopting a multidisciplinary approach to enhance the resilience of Australian aquaculture, advocating for stronger biosecurity frameworks and innovative technologies to mitigate the escalating risks posed by viral diseases.","[Rahaman, Md.

Major focus areas were improving fertilizer NUE, use of livestock manures, soil health, and policy development and knowledge exchange. Improvements to fertilizer NUE included attention to application rate in the context of yield potential and economic considerations and the potential of improved practices including enhanced efficiency fertilizers, plastic film mulching and cropping design. Improved utilization of livestock manures requires knowledge of the available nutrient content, appropriate manure processing technologies and integrated nutrient management practices. Soil carbon, acidification and biodiversity were considered as important aspects of soil health. Both centers identified a range of potential actions that could be taken to improve N management, and the research conducted has highlighted the importance of developing a systems -level approach to assessing improvement in the overall efficiency of N management and avoiding unintended secondary effects from individual interventions. Within this context, the management of fertilizer emissions and livestock manure at the farm and regional scales appear to be particularly important targets for mitigation.","[Misselbrook, Tom; Carswell, Alison; Wu, Lianhai] Rothamsted Res, North Wyke, Okehampton EX20 2SB, Devon, England; [Bai, Zhaohai; Ma, Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Agr Resources Res, Shijiazhuang 050021, Peoples R China; [Cai, Zejiang] Qiyang Agroecosystem Natl Field Expt Stn, Yongzhou 426182, Peoples R China; [Cao, Weidong] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China; [Cowan, Nicholas; Skiba, Ute] UK Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bush Estate, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland; [Cui, Zhenling; Ju, Xiaotang; Xu, Wen; Zhang, Fusuo; Zhang, Junling; Liu, Xuejun] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Chadwick, David R.; Jones, Davey L.] Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Wales; [Emmett, Bridget] UK Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bangor LL57 2UW, Wales; [Goulding, Keith; Powlson, David] Rothamsted Res, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Hertfordshire, England; [Jiang, Rui; Zhou, Jianbin] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongbin; Xu, Minggang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yuelai] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, England; [Rees, Robert M.] Scotlands Rural Coll SRUC, West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Scotland; [Smith, Pete] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3FX, Scotland; [Sylvester-Bradley, Roger; Williams, John] ADAS Boxworth, Battlegate Rd, Boxworth CB23 4NN, Cambridge, England","UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Agricultural University; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); China Agricultural University; Bangor University; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research; Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; University of East Anglia; Scotland's Rural College; University of Aberdeen","Misselbrook, T (corresponding author), Rothamsted Res, North Wyke, Okehampton EX20 2SB, Devon, England.",tom.misselbrook@rothamsted.ac.uk,"Wu, Lianhai/B-1892-2016; Misselbrook, Tom/N-2385-2014; Liu, Hongbin/J-5043-2013; Chadwick, David/KBQ-6266-2024; Zhou, Jianbin/AFS-3130-2022; Skiba, Ute/I-6441-2012; Rees, Robert/L-8103-2013; Zhang, Fusuo/AAV-4517-2021; Emmett, Bridget/D-6199-2011; jones, davey/C-7411-2011; Carswell, Alison/AAC-9582-2019; Xu, Minggang/K-1220-2017; Smith, Pete/G-1041-2010; Goulding, Keith/B-2635-2012; Bai, Zhaohai/A-4959-2018","Zhou, Jianbin/0000-0002-8987-1982; Skiba, Ute/0000-0001-8659-6092; Emmett, Bridget/0000-0002-2713-4389; Carswell, Alison/0000-0003-0580-6698; Cowan, Nicholas/0000-0002-7473-7916; Xu, Minggang/0000-0002-7308-0633; Smith, Pete/0000-0002-3784-1124; Bai, Zhaohai/0000-0001-7685-5441","Newton Fund via UK BBSRC/NERC [BB/N013484/1, BB/N013468/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/N013484/1, BB/N013468/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Newton Fund via UK BBSRC/NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),Acknowledgements This work was supported through Newton Fund via UK BBSRC/NERC (BB/N013484/1 and BB/N013468/1) .,103,4,7,1,42,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-7505,2095-977X,FRONT AGRIC SCI ENG,Front.

A recent increase in molecular data accessibility and technological advances has allowed researchers to go beyond description and to make inferences about the mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution. In this systematic review, we discuss articles from 2016 to 2022 that investigated or reviewed the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution in vertebrates in response to environmental variation. Regulatory elements within the genome and regulatory proteins involved in either gene expression or cellular pathways have been shown to play key roles in adaptive evolution in response to most of the discussed environmental factors. Gene losses were suggested to be associated with an adaptive response in some contexts. Future adaptive evolution research could benefit from more investigations focused on noncoding regions of the genome, gene regulation mechanisms, and gene losses potentially yielding advantageous phenotypes. Investigating how novel advantageous genotypes are conserved could also contribute to our knowledge of adaptive evolution.","[Martinez Sosa, Francelly; Pilot, Malgorzata] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, PL-80680 Gdansk, Poland; [Pilot, Malgorzata] Univ Gdansk, Fac Biol, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Museum & Institute of Zoology of the Polish Academy of Sciences; Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Pilot, M (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, PL-80680 Gdansk, Poland.;Pilot, M (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Fac Biol, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland.",mpilot@miiz.waw.pl,,"Pilot, Malgorzata/0000-0002-6057-5768",,,,152,12,12,6,79,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4425,GENES-BASEL,Genes,FEB,2023,14.0,2,,,,,,416,10.3390/genes14020416,0.0,,32,Genetics & Heredity,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Genetics & Heredity,9Q6CT,36833343.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:000945050700001,0

However, current digital nutrition platforms often fail to reflect this diversity, relying instead on standardized models with limited cultural sensitivity. This paper aims to explore how traditional nutritional wisdom can be integrated into digital health platforms to promote more inclusive and effective approaches to personalized nutrition. Methods: This perspective paper employs a cultural adaptation framework to analyze the integration of traditional food knowledge into digital contexts. Drawing from interdisciplinary research across nutrition science, anthropology, digital health and implementation science, we utilize the Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) Framework and the PEN-3 Cultural Model to structure our analysis. A systematic scoping review of literature published between 2010 and 2025 was conducted to identify integration challenges and opportunities. Additionally, we analyzed case studies of three traditional dietary systems (Argentina, Italy and Japan) and evaluated five leading digital nutrition platforms for their degree of cultural inclusivity, using qualitative comparative methods. Results: The analysis highlights significant challenges in adapting traditional knowledge to digital formats, including standardization barriers, contextual loss and technological limitations. However, successful integration initiatives demonstrate that through participatory design, flexible data architectures and culturally-informed algorithms, traditional food systems can be meaningfully represented. Our proposed four-phase integration framework-documentation, digital adaptation, implementation and evaluation-provides a structured approach for developers and researchers. Conclusions: Bridging traditional nutrition with digital platforms represents a vital opportunity to enhance personalization and preserve food heritage while improving health outcomes for diverse populations. This integration requires interdisciplinary collaboration, user-centered design processes and ethical approaches that respect cultural ownership and context.","[Suarez, Camila] Univ Padua, Dept Food & Hlth, I-35122 Padua, Italy; [Adibi, Sasan] Monash Univ, Sch IT, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",University of Padua; Monash University,"Suarez, C (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Food & Hlth, I-35122 Padua, Italy.",camisuareztn@gmail.com; sasan.adibi@monash.edu,,,,,,76,2,2,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-6643,NUTRIENTS,Nutrients,JUN 11,2025,17.0,12,,,,,,1978,10.3390/nu17121978,0.0,,22,Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Nutrition & Dietetics,4CP7Z,40573089.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001514830400001,0

Promoting innovation through utility networking and peer-to-peer knowledge transfer offers policy leaders a promising pathway to improve urban water services and requires understanding of the importance of knowledge management in allocating financial resources for utility work.Abstract While digital transformation in e-commerce receives the most publicity, applications in energy and water utilities have been ongoing for decades. Using a methodology based on a systematic review, the paper offers a model of how it occurs in water utilities, reviews experiences from the field, and derives lessons learned to create a road map for future research and implementation. Innovation in water utilities occurs more in the field than through organized research, and utilities share their experiences globally through networks such as water associations, focus groups, and media outlets. Their digital transformation journeys are evident in business practices, operations, and asset management, including methods like decision support systems, SCADA systems, digital twins, and process optimization. Meanwhile, they operate traditional regulated services while being challenged by issues like aging infrastructure and workforce capacity. They operate complex and expensive distribution systems that require grafting of new controls onto older systems with vulnerable components. Digital transformation in utilities is driven by return on investment and regulatory and workforce constraints and leads to cautious adoption of innovative methods unless required by external pressures. Utility adoption occurs gradually as digital tools help utilities to leverage system data for maintenance management, system renewal, and water loss control. Digital twins offer the advantages of enterprise data, decision support, and simulation models and can support distribution system optimization by integrating advanced metering infrastructure devices and water loss control through more granular pressure control. Models to anticipate water main breaks can also be included. With such advances, concerns about cyber security will grow. The lessons learned from the review indicate that research and development for new digital tools will continue, but utility adoption will continue to evolve slowly, even as many utilities globally are too stressed with difficult issues to adopt them. Rather than rely on government and academics for research support, utilities will need help from their support community of regulators, consultants, vendors, and all researchers to navigate the pathways that lie ahead.","[Grigg, Neil S.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University System; Colorado State University Fort Collins,"Grigg, NS (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",neilg@engr.colostate.edu,,,,,,81,1,1,10,11,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2624-6511,SMART CITIES-BASEL,Smart Cities,JUN 15,2025,8.0,3,,,,,,99,10.3390/smartcities8030099,0.0,,19,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Urban Studies",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering; Urban Studies,4EX2U,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001516381000001,0

Oxygen vacancy (Vo), which is the most frequently observed intrinsic defect in HfO2-based films, determines the physical/electrical properties and device performance. Vo influences the polymorphism and the resulting ferroelectric properties of HfO2. Moreover, the switching speed and endurance of ferroelectric memories are strongly correlated to the Vo concentration and redistribution. They also strongly influence the device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variability of integrated circuits based on ferroelectric memories. The concentration, migration, and agglomeration of Vo form the main mechanism behind the RS behavior observed in HfO2, suggesting that the device performance and reliability in terms of the operating voltage, switching speed, on/off ratio, analog conductance modulation, endurance, and retention are sensitive to Vo. Therefore, the mechanism of Vo formation and its effects on the chemical, physical, and electrical properties in ferroelectric and RS HfO2 should be understood. This study comprehensively reviews the literature on Vo in HfO2 from the formation and influencing mechanism to material properties and device performance. This review contributes to the synergetic advances of current knowledge and technology in emerging HfO2-based semiconductor devices.","[Lee, Jaewook; Yang, Kun; Han, Dong In; Lee, Dong Hyun; Park, Min Hyuk] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Gwanak Ro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Lee, Jaewook; Yang, Kun; Han, Dong In; Lee, Dong Hyun; Park, Min Hyuk] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Engn, Interuniv Semicond Res Ctr, Gwanak Ro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Kwon, Ju Young; Kim, Ji Eun; Yoon, Jung Ho] Korea Inst Sci & Technol KIST, Elect Mat Res Ctr, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Park, Min Hyuk] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Adv Mat, Gwanak ro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Seoul National University (SNU),"Park, MH (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Gwanak Ro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Park, MH (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Engn, Interuniv Semicond Res Ctr, Gwanak Ro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Yoon, JH (corresponding author), Korea Inst Sci & Technol KIST, Elect Mat Res Ctr, Seoul 02792, South Korea.;Park, MH (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Adv Mat, Gwanak ro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",jhyoon@kist.re.kr; minhyuk.park@snu.ac.kr,"Lee, Dong-Hyun/U-9395-2017; Park, Min Hyuk/A-3810-2014","Park, Min Hyuk/0000-0001-6333-2668","National Research Foundation (NRF) - Korean Ministry of Science and ICT (MSICT) [2020R1C1C1008193, 2022M3F3A2A01073562, 2021M3F3A2A02037889, 2021M3F3A2A01037738, 2022R1C1C1004176]; Korea Institute of Science and Technology [2E32491, 2V09802]",National Research Foundation (NRF) - Korean Ministry of Science and ICT (MSICT); Korea Institute of Science and Technology(Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST)),"This work was supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF), funded by the Korean Ministry of Science and ICT (MSICT) (Grant Nos. 2020R1C1C1008193, 2022M3F3A2A01073562, 2021M3F3A2A02037889, 2021M3F3A2A01037738 and 2022R1C1C1004176), and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (2E32491 and 2V09802).",239,122,128,36,199,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2196-5404,,NANO CONVERG,Nano Converg.,DEC 1,2023,10.0,1,,,,,,55,10.1186/s40580-023-00403-4,0.0,,39,"Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,Z5UE6,38038784.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001112714800001,0

This article critically reviews and summarizes the research carried out to date on several approaches for integration of CW with other methods of treatment, exploring several novel modes of operation and factors, to improve the remediation capacity of the CW system. The study shows that the use of different modes of aeration, recirculation of the effluent, hydraulic retention time, and organic loading rate not only improves the removal efficiency of the treatment system but also helps in reducing the surface area required for the system in the treatment of emerging contaminants. The integrated approach analysis gives an insight into the different technologies, which can be coupled with CW for fast, sustainable, and eco-efficient treatment systems for different types of wastewater. Anaerobic technologies and microbial fuel cell (MFC) have the added advantage of energy generation apart from wastewater treatment, which helps in reducing carbon footprints.

Flavor property is a critical factor in the acceptability and marketability of fortified or reformulated food. Major food ingredients are able to interact with flavor compounds, leading to a significant change in flavor release from the food matrix and, ultimately, altering flavor perception. Although many efforts have been made to elucidate how food matrix components change flavor binding capacities, the influences on flavor perception and their implications for the innovation of fortified or reformulated novel food have not been systematically summarized up to now. Thus, this review provides detailed knowledge about the binding behaviors of flavors to major food ingredients, as well as their influences on flavor retention, release, and perception. Practical approaches for manipulating these interactions and the resulting flavor quality are also reviewed, from the scope of their intrinsic and extrinsic influencing factors with technologies available, which is helpful for future food innovation. Evaluation of food-ingredient interactions using real food matrices while considering multisensory flavor perception is also prospected, to well motivate food industries to investigate new strategies for tasteful and healthy food design in response to consumers' unwillingness to compromise on flavor for health.","[Chen, Xiao; Zhang, Wangang; Zhao, Liyan] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Food Sci & Technol, 1 Weigang, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiao; Quek, Siew Young] Univ Auckland, Sch Chem Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Quek, Siew Young] Riddet Inst, Ctr Res Excellence Food Res, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Quek, Siew Young] Univ Auckland, Sch Chem Sci, Food Sci Program, 23 Symonds ST, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",Nanjing Agricultural University; University of Auckland; University of Auckland,"Zhao, LY (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Food Sci & Technol, 1 Weigang, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Quek, SY (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Chem Sci, Food Sci Program, 23 Symonds ST, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",sy.quek@auckland.ac.nz; zhlychen@njau.edu.cn,,"Zhao, Liyan/0000-0003-2363-3815; Chen, Xiao/0000-0003-4231-6372",,,,116,42,43,29,222,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1541-4337,,COMPR REV FOOD SCI F,Compr.

However, the evidence base for their potential and efficacy in this regard is fragmented. We draw together this disparate knowledge base to offer a state of the art review of municipal wastewater treatment with AnMBRs and evaluate the technology's potential application for water reuse. Water quality regulations and standards from different regions of the world are used as performance metrics to compare and contrast the treatment performance of pilot and laboratory scale AnMBR systems reported in the literature (n = 50). Findings indicate that under stable operation, AnMBRs have the potential to produce water for agricultural reuse. However, without post-treatment, AnMBRs are incapable of delivering water that meets other non-potable reuse standards across a range of important parameters such as COD, BOD5, NH3-N and TP. Analysis of key operational parameters determine the operation of AnMBR for non-potable reuse purpose cover influent water matrix, pH, temperature, hydraulic retention time, system and membrane configuration. An assessment of candidate post-treatment technologies suggests a tradeoff between the cost and effluent quality based on the reuse application requirement. We conclude by discussing a number of challenges and limitations to the use of AnMBRs for reuse applications in order to outline a pathway to maturity for effective treatment trains.","[Huang, Yu; Jeffrey, Paul; Pidou, Marc] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Cranfield, England",Cranfield University,"Pidou, M (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Cranfield, England.",m.pidou@cranfield.ac.uk,"Jeffrey, Paul/A-1934-2010; Huang, Yu/LKM-8205-2024; PIDOU, MARC/L-7372-2014","Jeffrey, Paul/0000-0001-6618-0815; Huang, Yu/0000-0001-8833-8310; PIDOU, MARC/0000-0003-3031-9584",,,,122,10,12,8,42,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1064-3389,1547-6537,CRIT REV ENV SCI TEC,Crit.

Their documented functions include nutrient mobilization, carbon retention, stress mitigation and pathogen suppression, although measurable effects often depend on plant and soil conditions. In this review, we examine the current evidence for their ecological relevance and assess the molecular approaches most commonly used to characterize them. Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, endophytes and saprotrophic taxa indicate measurable gains in nutrient acquisition, disease resistance and soil aggregation, although long-term consistency is rarely evaluated. Each function appears to have an explicit mechanistic attribution, with direct links between fungal groups, enzymatic pathways and measurable ecosystem outcomes. Several sequencing-based techniques are available, yet none offer complete accuracy. Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) amplicon surveys provide rapid taxonomic coverage but suffer from primer bias; shotgun metagenomics offers functional insight but at significant financial cost; and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays remain useful for targeted quantification, whereas long-read technologies show promise but still lack widespread adoption. The field faces a number of unresolved constraints, including limited knowledge of host range, inconsistent performance under fluctuating environmental conditions and the absence of a standardized bioinformatic pipeline. Despite these limitations, we regard phytomycobiomes as viable candidates for replacing or reducing synthetic inputs, provided their application is guided by context-specific evidence rather than broad generalization.","[Ansari, Rizwan Ali; Egamberdievich, Kobilov Ergash; Raximovna, Madjidova Tanzila; Sa'dinovna, Yarmatova Dilbar; Enverovna, Belyalova Leylya; Kurbonovich, Tukhtaev Mustafa] Samarkand State Univ Sharof Rashidov, Fac Geog & Ecol, Dept Ecol & Life Safety, Samarkand 140104, Uzbekistan; [Abbasovich, Aminjonov Sharifkul] Samarkand State Univ Sharof Rashidov, Dept Physiol & Biochem Humans & Anim, Samarkand 140104, Uzbekistan; [Muqumovich, Abdullayev Davlat] Samarkand State Med Univ, Dept Dermatol & Venereol, 18 Amir Temur St, Samarkand 140104, Uzbekistan",Samarkand State Medical University,"Ansari, RA (corresponding author), Samarkand State Univ Sharof Rashidov, Fac Geog & Ecol, Dept Ecol & Life Safety, Samarkand 140104, Uzbekistan.",rizwans.ansari@gmail.com,,,,,,272,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2309-608X,J FUNGI,J.

This review synthesizes findings from over four decades of entomovectoring research, critically examining the mechanisms, vectors, dispenser devices, and microbial agents employed in the technology. Comparative analyses of dispenser devices depicted that two-way dispensers generally achieve greater efficiency in vector loading and has reduced inoculum loss in comparison with to one-way dispenser devices. Further key challenges in maintaining consistent inoculum transfer under field conditions, vector-agent compatibility, behavioral avoidance, and environmental variability were addressed in detail. Regulatory considerations and knowledge gap regarding long-term ecosystem impacts, vector health, and efficacy across diverse cropping systems are discussed in the aim of integrating entomovectoring with Integrated Pest Management frameworks.

Advances in clinical and translational research have deepened our understanding of NT1, particularly the loss of hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin-producing neurons, establishing hypocretin deficiency as a reliable disease specific biomarker, although the exact mechanisms of neuronal loss remain unknown. Conversely, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying NT2, IH, and KLS are still poorly understood, as well as their natural course. Standard diagnostic evaluation primarily relies on clinical symptoms, polysomnography and the multiple sleep latency test, with alternative neurophysiological markers (long term polysomnographic recordings), quantitative signal analysis, and wearables technologies being explored as potential innovative tools. Management remains symptomatic, combining pharmacological treatments such as stimulants, sodium oxybate, and emerging hypocretin/orexin receptor agonists, with nonpharmacological strategies tailored to improve patient quality of life. Notably, new therapies targeting orexin signalling offer promising avenues for transforming treatment approaches, particularly in NT1. Looking ahead, advancing precision medicine approaches and addressing unmet needs in CDH are essential to improve patient outcomes. This review summarises current knowledge and highlights future research directions in CDH pathophysiology, diagnostic approaches and pharmacological management.","[Biscarini, Francesco; Pizza, Fabio] Univ Bologna, Dept Biomed & Neuromotor Sci DIBINEM, Bologna, Italy; [Biscarini, Francesco; Pizza, Fabio; Plazzi, Giuseppe] IRCCS Ist Sci Neurolog Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Barateau, Lucie; Dauvilliers, Yves] CHU Montpellier, Gui De Chauliac Hosp, Dept Neurol, Sleep Wake Disorders Unit, Montpellier, France; [Barateau, Lucie; Dauvilliers, Yves] Natl Reference Ctr Orphan Dis Narcolepsy, Idiopath Hypersomnia & Kleine Levin Syndrome, Montpellier, France; [Barateau, Lucie; Dauvilliers, Yves] Univ Montpellier, INSERM, Inst Neurosci Montpellier, Montpellier, France; [Plazzi, Giuseppe] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Biomed Metab & Neural Sci, Modena, Italy",University of Bologna; IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna (ISNB); Universite de Montpellier; CHU de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Plazzi, G (corresponding author), IRCCS Ist Sci Neurolog Bologna, Bologna, Italy.;Dauvilliers, Y (corresponding author), CHU Montpellier, Gui De Chauliac Hosp, Dept Neurol, Sleep Wake Disorders Unit, Montpellier, France.;Dauvilliers, Y (corresponding author), Natl Reference Ctr Orphan Dis Narcolepsy, Idiopath Hypersomnia & Kleine Levin Syndrome, Montpellier, France.;Dauvilliers, Y (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, INSERM, Inst Neurosci Montpellier, Montpellier, France.;Plazzi, G (corresponding author), Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Biomed Metab & Neural Sci, Modena, Italy.",giuseppe.plazzi@unibo.it; ydauvilliers@yahoo.fr,"; Biscarini, Francesco/HCH-2377-2022; Plazzi, Giuseppe/AAB-9627-2020; Pizza, Fabio/AAC-1794-2020","Dauvilliers, yves/0000-0003-0683-6506; Biscarini, Francesco/0000-0001-9756-6470; Plazzi, Giuseppe/0000-0002-1051-0472;",,,,210,2,2,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1105,1365-2869,J SLEEP RES,J.

This review highlights the current literature regarding telemedicine in T1D care as well as the benefits and barriers to use in a postpandemic world. Recent findings Telemedicine has increased patient contact with healthcare providers, allowing for more frequent insulin dose adjustments and improvements in glycemic outcomes. In addition to routine clinical care, T1D device training and mental healthcare have been successful through telemedicine. Significant barriers to continued telemedicine care exist, including patient access and technology knowledge, language, and loss of face-to-face interaction. Healthcare providers additionally face unpredictable reimbursement and loss of continuity across state lines, and lack of resources and training for device downloads and telemedicine software. Telemedicine can be successfully used in T1D care and has the potential to significantly impact glycemic and long-term outcomes. Due to continued interest for in-person visits by people with T1D and providers, it is likely that long-term telemedicine use will include a hybrid format.","[Cobry, Erin C.; Wadwa, R.

This review consolidates existing knowledge on the drivers and impacts of nitrogen pollution in Chinese aquatic ecosystems, with a focus on environments such as lakes, rivers, and coastal waters. The primary sources of nitrogen enrichment are excessive fertilizer application, livestock manure discharge, industrial emissions, and untreated industrial and municipal wastewater. These inputs have led to severe ecological consequences, including harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, loss of biodiversity, and deteriorating water quality, threatening ecosystem health and human well-being. The review also examines mitigation strategies implemented in China, encompassing regulatory policies such as the Zero Growth fertilizer initiative, as well as technological advancements in wastewater treatment and sustainable farming practices. Case studies highlighting successful interventions, such as lake restoration projects and integrated watershed management, demonstrate the potential for effective nitrogen control. However, persistent challenges remain, including uneven policy enforcement, insufficient public awareness, and gaps in scientific understanding of nitrogen cycling dynamics.

The management of fungal diseases is mainly dependent on the application of fungicides, which are not suitable for sustainable agriculture, human health, and environmental safety. Thus, it is necessary to develop novel targets and green strategies to mitigate the losses caused by these pathogens. The target of rapamycin (TOR) complexes and key components of the TOR signalling pathway are evolutionally conserved in pathogens and closely related to the vegetative growth and pathogenicity. As indicated in recent systems, chemical, genetic, and genomic studies on the TOR signalling pathway, phytopathogens with TOR dysfunctions show severe growth defects and nonpathogenicity, which makes the TOR signalling pathway to be developed into an ideal candidate target for controlling plant disease. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the current knowledge on components of the TOR signalling pathway in microorganisms and the diverse roles of various plant TOR in response to plant pathogens. Furthermore, we analyse a range of disease management strategies that rely on the TOR signalling pathway, including genetic modification technologies and chemical controls. In the future, disease control strategies based on the TOR signalling network are expected to become a highly effective weapon for crop protection.","[Song, Yun; Wang, Yaru] Liaocheng Univ, Coll Agr & Biol, Liaocheng, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Huafang; Saddique, Muhammad Abu Bakar; Luo, Xiumei; Ren, Maozhi] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Urban Agr, Chengdu Agr Sci & Technol Ctr, Chengdu 610000, Peoples R China","Liaocheng University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Urban Agriculture, CAAS","Ren, MZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Urban Agr, Chengdu Agr Sci & Technol Ctr, Chengdu 610000, Peoples R China.",renmaozhi01@caas.cn,"Saddique, Muhammad/ABG-1590-2021; Luo, Xiumei/LUZ-3674-2024",,"Sichuan Science and Technology Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China [32300170]; Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation [ZR2021QC200]; Local Financial Funds of Chengdu National Agricultural Science and Technology Center [NASC2023TD08, NASC2021ST08, NASC2021PC04, NASC2022KR07]; Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund [Y2024QC33]; Science and Technology Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences [34-IUA-02]; [2023YFQ0100]; [2023ZYD0089]; [2022YFH0054]; [2023JDG0028]",Sichuan Science and Technology Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Local Financial Funds of Chengdu National Agricultural Science and Technology Center; Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund; Science and Technology Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; ; ; ;,"This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32300170) and Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (ZR2021QC200), Sichuan Science and Technology Program (2023YFQ0100; 2023ZYD0089; 2022YFH0054; 2023JDG0028), the Local Financial Funds of Chengdu National Agricultural Science and Technology Center (NASC2023TD08, NASC2021ST08, NASC2021PC04, NASC2022KR07), Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund (Y2024QC33), and the Science and Technology Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (34-IUA-02).",134,4,5,8,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1464-6722,1364-3703,MOL PLANT PATHOL,Mol.

Lung and skin are the first organs exposed to air pollution, and this is associated with carcinogenesis, inflammation and atopic disease. Proposed mechanisms of adverse health effects in lung and skin include oxidative stress, inflammation, and loss of epithelial barrier integrity. Most knowledge has been gained using simple 2D or more complex culture models, however these cultures have important limitations, such as a lack of perfusion and stretching and lack of cell-cell crosstalk. Organ-on-chip (OoC) technology may be used to overcome limitations of the in vitro models currently used in air pollution research and opens possibilities for studying the pathways underlying adverse health effects of air pollution on immune-mediated diseases of the lung and skin using more physiologically relevant exposure experiments. In this review we discuss currently used in vitro models to study the effect of air pollution on epithelial barrier integrity and development of immune-mediated diseases and identify gaps in current knowledge on adverse health effects of air pollution. We then focus on how OoC technology can enhance mechanistic studies of the skin and lung's response to air pollution.","[Koornneef, Sem; Thio, H.

Background: Educational escape rooms have emerged as an innovative and interactive teaching method in nursing education. They offer a dynamic approach that enhances critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and applying theoretical knowledge in a safe and engaging environment. Design: Systematic review. Method: A structured search was performed in Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Science Direct, and ULAKBIM. The databases were searched with the keywords nursing students, escape game, and escape room and were combined with Boolean connectors (and, or). In this systematic review, only studies conducted with nursing students or nurses with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) or quasi-experimental research design were published in English or Turkish, and whose full text was accessible were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute, MetaAnalysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instruments (JBIMAStARI), was used to assess the quality of studies. Two independent reviewers conducted selection and critical appraisal. Results: N = 14 interventional studies up to November 2024 were included (n = 2 Randomized Clinical Trials and n = 12 quasi-experimental designs). The samples of 12 of the reviewed studies consisted entirely of nursing students. The sample of 1 study consisted of nurses, and 1 study consisted of nursing and pharmacy students. In most of the reviewed studies, escape room interventions significantly improved nursing students' clinical decision-making, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. It was also found to positively affect students' motivation to learn, satisfaction, and retention of information. Conclusion: After implementing the escape rooms method, the students' average scores significantly increased. This method effectively improves students' knowledge, skills, critical thinking, motivation, satisfaction, selfefficacy, problem-solving, and clinical judgment skills. Integrating the escape room method with digital technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is suggested to extend interactive learning experiences.","[Kose, Asena; Ozcan, Serpil] Ataturk Univ, Dept Fundamental Nursing, Erzurum, Turkiye",Ataturk University,"Özcan, S (corresponding author), Ataturk Univ, Dept Fundamental Nursing, Erzurum, Turkiye.",serpilozcan85@hotmail.com,,"KÖSE, ASENA/0000-0003-2231-4783; Özcan, Serpil/0000-0001-9789-2700",,,,61,6,7,13,22,CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,EDINBURGH,"JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",0260-6917,1532-2793,NURS EDUC TODAY,Nurse Educ.

The domain knowledge consists of plasma-heating and sheath physics, plasma chemistry and plasma-material surface reaction kinetics, and plasma diagnostics. Based on this, a plasma information-based virtual metrology (PI-VM) algorithm was developed drastically enhanced process prediction performance by parameterizing plasma information (PI) which can trace the states of processing plasmas. PI-VM has superior process prediction accuracy compared to the classical statistics-based virtual metrologies. The developed PI-VM algorithms adopted for practical processing issues such as the control and management of the OLED-display mass production demonstrated savings of approximately 25% of the yield loss over the past 5 years. This improvement was achieved with the development of FDC (fault detection and classification) and APC (advanced process control) logic, which can be developed through the analysis of the physical characteristics of the feature parameters used in PI-VM with the evaluation of their contributions and their correlations to the processing results. PI-VM provides leverage that can be applied in the development of process equipment and factory automation technologies.","[Park, Seolhye; Seong, Jaegu; Noh, Yeongil; Park, Yoona; Jang, Yongsuk; Cho, Taeyoung; Yang, Jae-Ho] Samsung Display Co Ltd, Asan 31454, Chungcheongnam, South Korea; [Jang, Yunchang; Roh, Hyun-Joon; Kwon, Ji-Won; Ryu, Sangwon; Song, Jaemin; Roh, Ki-Baek; Kim, Gon-Ho] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Nucl Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Lee, Jinyoung] Korea Inst Machinery & Mat KIMM, Dept Plasma Engn, Daejeon 34103, South Korea",Samsung; Samsung Display; Seoul National University (SNU); Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials (KIMM),"Park, S (corresponding author), Samsung Display Co Ltd, Asan 31454, Chungcheongnam, South Korea.;Kim, GH (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Nucl Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",druyvesteyndf@gmail.com; ghkim@snu.ac.kr,,,"National Research Council of Science & Technology (NST) Grant from the Korea Government (MSIT) [CRC-20-01-NFRI]; Brain Korea 21 FOUR Program [4199990314119]; MOTIE (Ministry of Trade, Industry Energy) [20006499, 20006534]; KSRC (Korea Semiconductor Research Consortium)","National Research Council of Science & Technology (NST) Grant from the Korea Government (MSIT)(Ministry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council of Science & Technology (NST), Republic of Korea); Brain Korea 21 FOUR Program; MOTIE (Ministry of Trade, Industry Energy)(Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE), Republic of Korea); KSRC (Korea Semiconductor Research Consortium)","This work is technically supported by Vice Presidents Jaehyung Lee and Jeonggen Yoo and by Executive Vice President Insoo Cho of Samsung Display Co., Ltd, and is supported by a National Research Council of Science & Technology (NST) Grant from the Korea Government (MSIT) (No.CRC-20-01-NFRI), the Brain Korea 21 FOUR Program (No.4199990314119), the MOTIE (Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (20006499, 20006534), and the KSRC (Korea Semiconductor Research Consortium) support program for the development of future semiconductor devices.",58,13,15,3,22,KOREAN PHYSICAL SOC,SEOUL,"635-4, YUKSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-KU, SEOUL 135-703, SOUTH KOREA",0374-4884,1976-8524,J KOREAN PHYS SOC,J.

Human fasciolosis is an emerging zoonosis in Andean America, Asia, and Africa. The control of the disease, both in humans and animals, is based on using anthelmintic drugs, which has resulted in increased resistance to the most effective anthelmintics, such as triclabendazole, in many countries. This, together with the concerns about drug residues in food and the environment, has increased the interest in preventive measures such as a vaccine to help control the disease in endemic areas. Despite important efforts over the past two decades and the work carried out with numerous vaccine candidates, none of them has demonstrated consistent and reproducible protection in target species. This is at least in part due to the high immunomodulation capacity of the parasite, making ineffective the host response in susceptible species such as ruminants. It is widely accepted that a deeper knowledge of the host-parasite interactions is needed for a more rational design of vaccine candidates. In recent years, the use of emerging technologies has notably increased the amount of data about these interactions. In the present study, current knowledge of host-parasite interactions and their implication in Fasciola hepatica vaccine development is reviewed.","[Flores-Velazquez, Luis Miguel] Univ San Sebastian, Escuela Med Vet, Fac Ciencias Nat, Unidad Anat Histol & Patol Vet, Campus Puerto Montt, Puerto Montt, Chile; [Ruiz-Campillo, Maria Teresa; Herrera-Torres, Guillem; Molina-Hernandez, Veronica; Perez, Jose] Univ Cordoba, Dept Anat & Anat Patol Comparadas & Toxicol, UIC Zoonosis & Enfermedades Emergentes ENZOEM, Cordoba, Spain; [Martinez-Moreno, Alvaro; Martinez-Moreno, Francisco Javier; Zafra, Rafael; Buffoni, Leandro; Rufino-Moya, Pablo Jose] Univ Cordoba, Dept San Anim, Grp Invest GISAZ, UIC Zoonosis & Enfermedades Emergentes ENZOEM, Cordoba, Spain",Universidad San Sebastian; Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad de Cordoba,"Molina-Hernandez, V (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Anat & Anat Patol Comparadas & Toxicol, UIC Zoonosis & Enfermedades Emergentes ENZOEM, Cordoba, Spain.",vmolina@uco.es,"Rufino-Moya, Pablo/AAH-3998-2019; Leva, Rafael/D-7899-2018; Barrios, Jose/AFR-9186-2022; Buffoni Perazzo, Leandro/J-1996-2018; Flores Velazquez, Luis Miguel/MBG-5544-2025; Herrera-Torres, Guillem/MEK-9952-2025; Molina Hernández, Verónica María/A-6704-2018; Ruiz Campillo, M Teresa/B-6746-2019; MARTINEZ-MORENO, ALVARO/K-8877-2014; Martínez-Moreno, Francisco Javier/H-6703-2015","Flores Velazquez, Luis Miguel/0009-0003-3030-1007; Herrera-Torres, Guillem/0009-0009-2772-6833; Molina Hernández, Verónica María/0000-0002-8850-7388; Ruiz Campillo, M Teresa/0000-0002-1454-1866; MARTINEZ-MORENO, ALVARO/0000-0003-4298-6894; Buffoni Perazzo, Leano/0000-0003-2983-7288; Martínez-Moreno, Francisco Javier/0000-0001-8438-3077","Regional Government of Andalusia (Junta de Andalucia, Consejeria de Conocimiento, Investigacion y Universidad)-FEDER [PID2019-108782RB-C21]; [P18-RTJ-1956]","Regional Government of Andalusia (Junta de Andalucia, Consejeria de Conocimiento, Investigacion y Universidad)-FEDER;","The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Despite its widespread use, the most effective CHM approach for addressing hidden bleeding post-IFF remains unclear. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to identify a CHM that both effectively reduces hidden bleeding and stabilizes blood volume after IFF.MethodsComprehensive electronic searches were performed on databases in both Chinese and English, including the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (Wanfang), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) employing CHM to address hidden bleeding post-IFF, up to December 31, 2023, were thoroughly reviewed. The analysis utilized Stata17.0 and Review Manager 5.4 software, tailored to the frequentist framework.ResultsThirty-one articles were included, encompassing 17 interventions and 2076 patients. The systematic analysis revealed that: For improving postoperative haemoglobin (HB), the top three interventions were conventional treatment combined with Yiqi Buxue decoction, Yangxue Rougan decoction, and Sanqi powder; For reducing hidden bleeding post-surgery, the leading interventions were conventional treatment combined with Siwu decoction, Yangxue Rougan decoction, and Qitian Keli prescription; For enhancing the Harris score, the top interventions were conventional treatment combined with Bazhen decoction, Danggui Buxue decoction, and Sanqi powder; Descriptive analysis indicated minimal adverse reactions and enhanced safety overall.ConclusionCHM presents a viable method for treating hidden blood loss after IFF. Yangxue Rougan decoction notably excels in reducing hidden bleeding and stabilizing HB levels, making it a preferred option.

With the existing centralized traceability systems used in AFSCs, it is difficult to acquire full traceability information, and there are risks of information loss and data tampering. To address these challenges, research on the application of blockchain technology (BCT) for traceability systems in the agri-food sector is increasing, and startup companies have emerged in recent years. However, there have been only a limited number of reviews on the application of BCT in the agriculture sector, especially those that focus on the BCT-based traceability of agricultural goods. To bridge this knowledge gap, we reviewed 78 studies that integrated BCT into traceability systems in AFSCs and additional relevant papers, mapping out the main types of food traceability information. The findings indicated that the existing BCT-based traceability systems focus more on fruit and vegetables, meat, dairy, and milk. A BCT-based traceability system enables one to develop and implement a decentralized, immutable, transparent, and reliable system in which process automation facilitates the monitoring of real-time data and decision-making activities. We also mapped out the main traceability information, key information providers, and challenges and benefits of the BCT-based traceability systems in AFSCs. These helped to design, develop, and implement BCT-based traceability systems, which, in turn, will contribute to the transition to smart AFSC systems. This study comprehensively illustrated that implementing BCT-based traceability systems also has important, positive implications for improving AFSC management, e.g., reductions in food loss and food recall incidents and the achievement of the United Nations SDGs (1, 3, 5, 9, 12). This will contribute to existing knowledge and be useful for academicians, managers, and practitioners in AFSCs, as well as policymakers.","[Bosona, Techane; Gebresenbet, Girma] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Energy & Technol, POB 75651, Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Bosona, T (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Energy & Technol, POB 75651, Uppsala, Sweden.",techane.bosona@slu.se; girma.gebresenbet@slu.se,"Bosona, Techane/I-7761-2019","Bosona, Techane/0000-0003-2258-3430",,,,78,60,79,26,101,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JUN 5,2023,23.0,11,,,,,,5342,10.3390/s23115342,0.0,,20,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,I7QF0,37300069.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001004688200001,0

After independent literature screening, data extraction, and bias risk assessment were independently performed by two investigations according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. All data analyses were performed by RevMan 5.4 software.ResultsA total of 27 studies, including 22 randomized controlled trials and 5 non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSI), involving 1307 implants, were included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis demonstrated that SST significantly outperformed CIIP in reducing horizontal buccal bone loss (MD = -0.50, 95%CI [-0.60, -0.41], I2 = 97%) and vertical buccal bone loss (MD = -0.56, 95%CI [-0.64, -0.48], I = 78%), as well as improving the pink esthetic score (PES: MD = 1.25, 95%CI [0.93, 1.57], I = 90%) and implant stability quotient (ISQ: MD = 5.83, 95%CI [4.08, 7.57], I2 = 69%). No significant difference was observed in implant success rate (RR = 1.00, 95% CI [0.98, 1.02], I2 = 0%). Subgroup analyses (the height and thickness of buccal shield, bone grafting, and publication language) aligned with primary outcome (horizontal buccal bone loss), and sensitivity analysis confirmed stable results.ConclusionBased on the available evidence, SST demonstrated favorable outcomes in reducing buccal bone loss, enhancing esthetic outcomes and implant stability while maintaining comparable implant success rates to CIIP. Nevertheless, the technique exhibited technical sensitivity and a lack of standardized surgical protocols. Therefore, its clinical application should be approached with caution. Future high-quality studies with extended follow-up are required to validate long-term efficacy and establish standardized clinical guidelines.","[Lu, Wei; Du, Shanshan; Su, Jingtong; Wu, Yang; Yao, Xinyu; Yu, Hedong] Hubei Univ Med, Taihe Hosp, Dept Stomatol, Shiyan 442000, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chao] Hubei Univ Med, Taihe Hosp, Ctr Evidence Based Med & Clin Res, Shiyan 442000, Hubei, Peoples R China",Hubei University of Medicine; Hubei University of Medicine,"Yu, HD (corresponding author), Hubei Univ Med, Taihe Hosp, Dept Stomatol, Shiyan 442000, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Zhang, C (corresponding author), Hubei Univ Med, Taihe Hosp, Ctr Evidence Based Med & Clin Res, Shiyan 442000, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zhangchao0803@126.com; yuhedong85@163.com,"Lu, Wei/NTQ-7985-2025",,Scientific Research Program Guidance Project of the Department of Education of Hubei Province [NO.B2024101],Scientific Research Program Guidance Project of the Department of Education of Hubei Province,This study was supported by the Scientific Research Program Guidance Project of the Department of Education of Hubei Province (NO.

Membrane Bioreactors (MBRs), which integrate biological degradation with membrane-based separation, have emerged as a robust solution for advanced wastewater treatment. This review presents a comprehensive and critical synthesis of recent advancements in MBR technology, spanning membrane materials, module configurations, fouling mechanisms, energy demands, microbial community dynamics, integration with artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the circular economy. It highlights the strengths and limitations of aerobic, anaerobic, and hybrid MBR systems, with comparative insights into pollutant removal efficiencies, lifecycle costs, and energy footprints. Special emphasis is placed on state-of-the-art fouling mitigation strategies, integration with machine learning for real-time monitoring, and circular economy applications, including energy and resource recovery. The review underscores the evolving role of microbial genomics and their role in optimising MBR performance. A detailed comparison table and future research framework are presented to bridge existing knowledge gaps, such as scalability, operational resilience, and sustainable deployment in decentralised systems. The review aims to support researchers, engineers, and policymakers in advancing MBR applications toward achieving water reuse, sustainability goals, and United Nations SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation.

Status and challenges from Iceland and Norway,RESOURCES ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY,English,Review,Fisheries; Rest raw materials; Food loss and waste; Bioeconomy; Traceability; Sustainability,SHELF-LIFE; TRACEABILITY; COD,"Most of the harvested demersal fish from Norway and Iceland is from sustainable, but fully exploited fish stocks. Increasing the harvest is therefore not considered a feasible option to meet the future global demand of seafood. Simultaneously, there are significant amounts of under-utilized rest raw materials (RRM) during harvesting, such as heads, skins, viscera, as well as prevalent food loss and waste (FLW) in the demersal fish supply chains. In this work we reviewed literature and conducted interviews with industry representatives to identify drivers and causes for FLW, as well as information on data capturing and current regulations in Norway and Iceland governing demersal fisheries. Based on these findings we have created a conceptual model of the demersal fish supply chain based on material and information flows modelling technique (MIFMT). The findings of our review indicates that losses during harvest and retail are the highest while the processing stage has the least volume of losses. However, there is currently no national level data generated on a regular basis which is identified as an important knowledge gap in mapping amounts of FLW. Our findings show that regulatory interventions during catch and improved RRM traceability could enhance the utilization of RRM in demersal fish supply chains. Information sharing and collaboration between the fishing fleet, seafood processors and the marine ingredient sector would allow improved resource utilization through better management of supply and demand. Furthermore, development of technology for on -board processing and storage is identified as a potential area of improvement. Currently, Iceland has a higher rate of utilization in the demersal fish sector than Norway due to certain regulatory, economic, and institutional aspects.","[Strand, Andrea Viken; Mehta, Shraddha; Myhre, Magnus Stoud] SINTEF Ocean, Postboks 4762, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [Olafsdottir, Gudrun; Saviolidis, Nina Maria] Univ Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland",SINTEF; University of Iceland,"Strand, AV (corresponding author), SINTEF Ocean, Postboks 4762, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway.",andrea.v.strand@sintef.no,"; Olafsdottir, Guun/B-6057-2017","Myhre, Magnus Stoud/0000-0001-6128-7349; Saviolidis, Nína M/0000-0003-0895-619X; Olafsdottir, Guun/0000-0003-1111-7135",European Union [817992]; National Research Council [329679]; University of Iceland [2014137-0611],European Union(European Union (EU)); National Research Council; University of Iceland,We would like to thank our colleague Maitri Thakur (SINTEF Ocean) for her role as previous Project leader and Rita V. d'Oliviera Bouman (SINTEF Ocean) as the current Project leader.

Knowledge of host immune responses and pathogen virulence is enabling the formulation of increasingly sophisticated strategies for disease control. Traditional genetic modification, typically involving overexpression of genes involved in pathogen perception and defence responses, is beginning to be superseded by CRISPR-Cas9 manipulation of host susceptibility targets. Moreover, the refinement of RNA interference (RNAi) strategies, including spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS), is allowing more nuanced control options. These latter approaches have the advantage over earlier technologies in that either they do not result in the generation of genetically modified organisms (RNAi-based SIGS), or the genetic manipulation used leaves no trace of introduced genetic material (gene editing). Thus, these strategies may be more widely acceptable for deployment for future disease control.","[Bowen, Joanna K.; Gapper, Nigel E.] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Mt Albert Res Ctr, Private Bag 92169, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Brummell, David A.] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Food Ind Sci Ctr, Private Bag 11600, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand",New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research Ltd; New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research Ltd,"Gapper, NE (corresponding author), New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Mt Albert Res Ctr, Private Bag 92169, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",nigel.gapper@plantandfood.co.nz,"; Brummell, David/F-1498-2010; Bowen, Joanna/AAF-2319-2020","Gapper, Nigel/0000-0002-1084-0527; Brummell, David/0000-0002-2754-6340;",,,,42,6,6,0,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0958-1669,1879-0429,CURR OPIN BIOTECH,Curr.

In recent years, tax risk detection, driven by information technology such as data mining and artificial intelligence, has received extensive attention. To promote the high-quality development of tax risk detection methods, this paper provides the first comprehensive overview and summary of existing tax risk detection methods worldwide. More specifically, it first discusses the causes and negative impacts of tax risk behaviors, along with the development of tax risk detection. It then focuses on data-mining-based tax risk detection methods utilized around the world. Based on the different principles employed by the algorithms, existing risk detection methods can be divided into two categories: relationship-based and non-relationship-based. A total of 14 risk detection methods are identified, and each method is thoroughly explored and analyzed. Finally, four major technical bottlenecks of current data-driven tax risk detection methods are analyzed and discussed, including the difficulty of integrating and using fiscal and tax fragmented knowledge, unexplainable risk detection results, the high cost of risk detection algorithms, and the reliance of existing algorithms on labeled information. After investigating these issues, it is concluded that knowledge-guided and datadriven big data knowledge engineering will be the development trend in the field of tax risk in the future; that is, the gradual transition of tax risk detection from informatization to intelligence is the future development direction.

Since the 1990s, a global community of science and practice has organized around oyster restoration with the goal of restoring these valuable services. We highlight ES-based approaches throughout the restoration process, consider applications of emerging technologies, and review knowledge gaps about the life histories and ES provisioning of underrepresented species. Climate change will increasingly affect oyster populations, and we assess how restoration practices can adapt to these changes. Considering ES throughout the restoration process supports adaptive management. For a rapidly growing restoration practice, we highlight the importance of early community engagement, long-term monitoring, and adapting actions to local conditions to achieve desired outcomes.","[Smith, Rachel S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Pruett, Jessica L.] Univ Southern Mississippi, Mississippi Based RESTORE Act Ctr Excellence, Ocean Springs, MS USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Southern Mississippi,"Smith, RS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",rssmith@ucsb.edu,"Pruett, Jessica/MYS-6347-2025",,"US Department of the Treasury; Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality; Mississippi Based RESTORE Act Center of Excellence under the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States Act of 2012 (RESTORE Act)","US Department of the Treasury; Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality; Mississippi Based RESTORE Act Center of Excellence under the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States Act of 2012 (RESTORE Act)","This project was paid for (in part) with federal funding from the US Department of the Treasury, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, and the Mississippi Based RESTORE Act Center of Excellence under the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States Act of 2012 (RESTORE Act).

Despite nutrients, especially phosphorus and nitrogen, being essential for plant growth and thus food supplies, those present in wastewater are considered an environmental burden. While microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are receiving much interest, combining wastewater treatment with an MFC has emerged as an option for low-cost wastewater treatment. Among others, a constructed wetland (CW) coupled with an MFC (CW-MFC) has the potential to provide a low carbon footprint and low-energy wastewater treatment, as well as nutrient and energy recovery from wastewater. Findings from this review show that the organic and nutrient removal and power generation by the integrated CW-MFC systems are affected by a number of factors including the organic loading rate, hydraulic retention time, system design, plant species, dissolved oxygen, substrate/media type, influent feeding mode, electrode materials and spacing, and external resistance. This review aims to summarize the current state of the CW-MFC and related technologies with particular emphasis on organic and nutrient removal, as well as on the bioenergy recovery from different wastewaters. Despite the benefits that these technologies can offer, the interactive mechanisms between the CW and MFC in the integrated system are still unclear. Further research is needed to fully understand the CW-MFC and related systems. The results of this work provide not only an overview and insight into existing knowledge but also the future direction of the CW-MFC technologies.","[Paucar, N.

For profitability reasons, natural clays and clay minerals can be used as low-cost and harmless food-compatible materials for improving key processes such as fermentation and coagulation. Under chemical stability conditions, clay materials can act as adsorbents, since anionic clay minerals such as hydrotalcite already showed effectiveness in the continuous removal of lactic acid via in situ anion exchange during fermentation and ex situ regeneration by ozone. Raw and modified bentonites and smectites have also been used as adsorbents in aflatoxin retention and as acidic species in milk acidification and coagulation. Aflatoxins and organophilic milk components, particularly non-charged caseins around their isoelectric points, are expected to display high affinity towards high silica regions on the clay surface. Here, clay interactions with milk components are key factors that govern adsorption and surface physicochemical processes. Knowledge about these interactions and changes in clay behavior according to the pH and chemical composition of the liquid media and, more importantly, clay chemical stability is an essential requirement for understanding process improvements in dairy technology, both upstream and downstream of milk production. The present paper provides a comprehensive review with deep analysis and synthesis of the main findings of studies in this area.

The objective of the study is to understand customer acquisition and retention practices, the role of online and offline integrated communication, and the extent of customer preference for various marketing communication channels. As part of the study, the quantitative analysis of the publications included in the review was made using articles and reports published from 2014 to 2024. The review was conducted on the aspects of marketing using multiple channels in retail pharmacy and the healthcare-associated fields. The studies identified that comprehensive communication channel enhancement policies positively affect the generation of revenues, reduction in costs, and information delivery schedules in pharmaceuticals. Depending on the channel, consumers' needs and wants differ, and there is success in personalizing and presenting reasonably logical thoughts to people. Synchronicity of online and offline communication effectively increases the customers' power, trust, and satisfaction. E-marketing has always been significant in enhancing customers' touch points, which is why digital transformation is vital. This study further supports the fact that multichannel marketing is mandatory for the success of a retail pharmacy in the prevalent, highly competitive environment. The implementation also presupposes knowledge of consumer differences, the synergy of online and offline contacts, the emphasis on personalization, and fast adaptation to the changing technological environment, but often within the framework of severe legislation.","[Wick, Alexander] Taubengartenapotheke, Bocksborn 4, D-63571 Gelnhausen, Germany; [Koczian, Bernhard] Apotheke Pfersee Pk, Franz Kobinger Str 9a, D-86157 Augburg, Germany; [Kralikova, Kristina] Acad Police Force Bratislava, Dept Adm Law, Sklabinska 1, Bratislava 83517, Slovakia",,"Wick, A (corresponding author), Taubengartenapotheke, Bocksborn 4, D-63571 Gelnhausen, Germany.;Králiková, K (corresponding author), Acad Police Force Bratislava, Dept Adm Law, Sklabinska 1, Bratislava 83517, Slovakia.",al.wick@web.de,"Králiková, Kristína/HCI-6831-2022","Králiková, Kristína/0000-0002-5891-5217",,,,56,1,2,14,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3387,ADM SCI,Adm.

The dramatic increase of mental health difficulties makes psychotherapeutic assistance a vital need. Recent literature states that Acceptance Commitment Therapy is one of the effective methods to moderate psychological distress resulting from the uncertainties of a pandemic. In this study, we aim to identify literature on the effectiveness of ACT in treating anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, and by doing so observe its effectiveness and potential use in pandemic like situations that may arise in the future. The narrative review method is adopted in the study. By focusing on acceptance, mindfulness, and values-based action, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) efficiently alleviates anxiety, depression, and stress that are associated to the COVID-19 pandemic. Small sample sizes, inconsistent evidence quality, a shortage of knowledge of long-term impacts, and a lack of attention to the therapeutic process are some of the study gaps, though. Future research should examine ACT protocols, provide manuals tailored to the pandemic, and look into technology-assisted psychotherapy like cyberpsychotherapy.

Traditional models, primarily based on past seismicity and geomechanical data, struggle to capture the complexity of seismic patterns and often overlook valuable non-seismic precursors such as geophysical, geochemical, and atmospheric anomalies. The integration of such diverse data sources into forecasting models, combined with advancements in AI technologies, offers a promising path forward. AI methods, particularly deep learning, excel at processing complex, large-scale datasets, identifying subtle patterns, and handling multidimensional relationships, making them well-suited for overcoming the limitations of conventional approaches. This review highlights the importance of combining AI with geophysical knowledge to create robust, physicsinformed forecasting models. It explores current AI methods, input data types, loss functions, and practical considerations for model development, offering guidance to both geophysicists and AI researchers. Many AIbased studies on earthquake prediction tend to oversimplify the problem, often overlooking crucial aspects like data imbalance and spatio-temporal clustering. However, integrating specialized geophysical knowledge into AI models offers a promising path to overcome these limitations. We emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, urging geophysicists to experiment with AI architectures thoughtfully and encouraging AI experts to deepen their understanding of seismology. By bridging these disciplines, we can develop more accurate, reliable, and societally impactful earthquake forecasting tools.","[Zhang, Ying] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Automat & Elect Engn, 30 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ying] Beijing Engn Res Ctr Ind Spectrum Imaging, 30 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wen, Congcong] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Dept Comp Engn, Abu Dhabi 129188, U Arab Emirates; [Wen, Congcong] Harvard Univ, Harvard AI & Robot Lab, 20 Staniford St, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Zhan, Chengxiang] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Sci, 29 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Sornette, Didier] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Risk Anal Predict & Management, 1088 Xueyuan Ave, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University of Science & Technology Beijing; New York University; New York University Abu Dhabi; Harvard University; China University of Geosciences; Southern University of Science & Technology,"Sornette, D (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Risk Anal Predict & Management, 1088 Xueyuan Ave, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",dsornette@ethz.ch,"wen, congcong/ACD-3131-2022; Zhang, Ying/JWA-0560-2024","Zhang, Ying/0000-0002-0266-8296","National Natural Science Foundation of China [T2350710802, U2039202]; Center for Computational Science and Engineering at Southern Uni-versity of Science and Technology",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Center for Computational Science and Engineering at Southern Uni-versity of Science and Technology,"This work is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no.

This paper highlights the value of integrating GI within sustainable agricultural systems and the effectiveness of various GI techniques in improving soil microbial communities and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The transition to sustainable agricultural systems requires innovative strategies that balance productivity, environmental conservation, and resilience to climate change. Sustainable agriculture increasingly leverages technological innovations in GI to enhance productivity, biodiversity, and microclimate resilience. Green infrastructure has found direct application in agroforestry, conservation buffers, precision agriculture, soil health monitoring systems, and nature-based solutions such as regenerative soil management. These applications are crucial in enhancing soil health, water retention, and biodiversity, while mitigating microclimatic impacts. Precision agriculture tools, like IoT sensors, drones, and AI-driven analytics, allow farmers to optimize water, nutrient, and pesticide use, boosting yields and efficiency while minimizing environmental impact. Simultaneously, advanced soil health monitoring technologies track soil moisture, nutrients, and biological activity in real time, informing practices that maintain long-term soil fertility and carbon sequestration. This integrated approach yields practical on-farm benefits, such as higher crop stability during droughts and enhanced habitats for beneficial species. In conclusion, there is a need for supportive frameworks, like subsidies for GI adoption, application of precision tools, incentives for improving soil microclimate, development of innovative GI programs, and knowledge-sharing initiatives, to encourage farmer adoption.","[Ogwu, Matthew Chidozie] Appalachian State Univ, Goodnight Family Dept Sustainable Dev, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Kosoe, Enoch Akwasi] Simon Diedong Dombo Univ Business & Integrated Dev, Dept Environm & Resource Studies, XW-1147-8901, Wa, Ghana",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Ogwu, MC (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Goodnight Family Dept Sustainable Dev, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",ogwumc@appstate.edu; ekosoe@ubids.edu.gh,"Ogwu, Matthew Chidozie/M-9932-2016; Kosoe, Enoch A/W-7074-2019","Ogwu, Matthew Chidozie/0000-0001-6054-1667; Kosoe, Enoch A/0000-0002-1484-5755",,,,219,10,12,24,43,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR 24,2025,17.0,9,,,,,,3838,10.3390/su17093838,0.0,,31,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2NK2C,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001486787700001,0

However, it is highly perishable and has a short postharvest lifespan. This review aims to provide knowledge for preserving quality and improving postharvest storage by integrative strategies aimed at extending the shelf life of jujube. The literature was collected from recent peer-reviewed studies on postharvest physiology and handling technologies of jujube fruit. Key physiological factors, influencing postharvest deterioration such as water loss, softening, browning, and decay, are discussed, along with the underlying biochemical and enzymatic mechanisms driving quality decline. Conventional strategies such as cold storage, MAP, and CA effectively slow respiration, delay reddening, and extend storage up to 2-4 months, while emerging approaches such as ozone and cold plasma treatments reduce microbial decay and maintain antioxidant activity. Edible coatings like chitosan, aloe vera, and composites cut weight loss by 20-40%, and chemical regulators such as 1-MCP and calcium dips further delay ripening, preserve firmness, and enhance postharvest quality. Emphasis is placed on integrating innovative technologies with physiological insights to optimize storage conditions, control microbial contamination, and maintain nutritional integrity. The significance of this review lies in integrating physiological insights with innovative preservation methods, offering practical guidance for researchers, growers, and industry stakeholders to achieve sustainable, safe, and market-oriented solutions for jujube storage.","[Muqaddas; Mengaya, Li; Yanju, Xiang; Yunfeng, Pu] Tarim Univ, Coll Food Sci & Engn, Alar 843300, Peoples R China; [Ahmed, Mian Muhammad; Hamid, Syeda Maira] Tarim Univ, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Alar 843300, Peoples R China; [Yanju, Xiang; Yunfeng, Pu] Prod & Construct Grp, Key Lab Special Agr Prod Further Proc Southern Xin, Alar 843300, Peoples R China; [Asim, Muhammad] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry Sci, Natl Key Lab Germplasm Innovat & Utilizat Hort Cro, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Tarim University; Tarim University; Huazhong Agricultural University,"Yunfeng, P (corresponding author), Tarim Univ, Coll Food Sci & Engn, Alar 843300, Peoples R China.;Yunfeng, P (corresponding author), Prod & Construct Grp, Key Lab Special Agr Prod Further Proc Southern Xin, Alar 843300, Peoples R China.",muqaddas031@gmail.com; 5637081398@163.co; mian.ahmed1@outlook.com; smairahamid@gmail.com; xiangyanju@163.com; chasim691@gmail.com; yfpu@zju.edu.cn,,", Muqaddas/0009-0003-2484-7564; Hamid, Syeda Maira/0009-0005-2065-1999; Asim, Muhammad/0009-0009-2768-0687","Bingtuan science and technology program [2023AB063, 2021bB013]",Bingtuan science and technology program,"This work was supported by Bingtuan science and technology program (2023AB063, and 2021bB013).",87,1,1,12,12,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2304-8158,FOODS,Foods,SEP 29,2025,14.0,19,,,,,,3370,10.3390/foods14193370,0.0,,21,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food Science & Technology,8OX9X,41097538.0,"Green Accepted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001593847400001,0

Fresh fruit and vegetables are highly susceptible to biotic and abiotic stresses, such as fungal pathogens and suboptimal temperatures, which lead to substantial postharvest losses and reduced shelf life. Once detached, fruit and vegetables continue ripening and senescence, which weakens the tissues, making them vulnerable to pathogens. Physical, chemical, and biological treatments could trigger the innate immune response of fruit and vegetables, which could reduce postharvest loss. This review aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the induction of defense responses in fresh produce. Chemical, biological, or physical inducers activate the fresh produce defense pathways, synthesizing defense-related proteins and metabolites, thus stimulating the plant's natural defense against pathogens and environmental stresses. Those inducers often trigger signaling cascades involving phytohormones, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and signals, orchestrating a complex network of molecular defensive combat fields. While there is progress in the induced resistance field, future challenges remain. These challenges include acquiring more knowledge of the specific defense pathways in different agricultural produce and their potential impact on produce quality and tolerance. Moreover, the inducer should be effective, economical, and safe. Adapting advanced technologies, such as omics approaches and biotechnological tools, holds the potential for the precise modulation of defense responses, leading to the development of tailored strategies for different produce types and specific biotic and abiotic stress.","[Chowdhary, Pankaj; Alkan, Noam] Agr Res Org ARO, Volcani Ctr, Dept Postharvest Sci, IL-7505101 Rishon Leziyyon, Israel",Volcani Institute of Agricultural Research,"Alkan, N (corresponding author), Agr Res Org ARO, Volcani Ctr, Dept Postharvest Sci, IL-7505101 Rishon Leziyyon, Israel.",noamal@volcani.agri.gov.il,"Alkan, Noam/GRJ-3904-2022; Chowdhary, Pankaj/AAB-1981-2019","Chowdhary, Pankaj/0000-0002-1799-1539",,,,195,0,0,16,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-5214,1873-2356,POSTHARVEST BIOL TEC,Postharvest Biol.

Several treatment options are available to treat degenerative spinal diseases, such as laminectomies, posterior fusions, and interbody fusions, depending on their locations, correction necessities, and surgeon philosophy. With the advance in technology and surgical knowledge, minimally invasive techniques (MIS) arose as a solution to reduce surgical morbidity, while maintaining the same benefits as the traditionally/open surgeries. Several studies investigated the possible advantages of MIS techniques against the traditional open procedures. However, those articles are usually focused only on one technique or on one pathology. Methods The electronic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Ovid, and BVS, were systematically reviewed. Only original articles in English or Portuguese were added to the review, the revision was performed following the PRISMA guideline. Results Fifty-three studies were included in the meta-analysis. Of the studied outcomes the Length of Stay Odds of complications, Blood Loss, and Surgery costs presented significantly favored MIS approaches, while the Last FUP ODI score, and Surgery Time did not differ among the groups.

Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) have emerged as a promising solution for mitigating these stresses and enhancing plant resilience. This review explores the role of PGPR in alleviating abiotic stress with a special focus on drought. PGPR contribute to stress tolerance through various mechanisms, including the production of phytohormones, such as indole-3-acetic acid, enhancement of nutrient uptake, and modulation of plant stress responses. These bacteria can improve soil structure, increase water retention, and promote the synthesis of osmoprotectants, which helps plants withstand drought conditions. This review examines recent advancements in our understanding of the molecular and physiological interactions between PGPR and plants under drought stress. This highlights how genetic modifications and synthetic biology can be leveraged to enhance PGPR efficacy. Furthermore, the integration of PGPR with other technologies, such as nanotechnology and biostimulants, has been discussed as a means of improving drought resistance in crops. Challenges in deploying PGPR, including variability in strain effectiveness and field application strategies, were also addressed. By synthesizing the current knowledge and identifying future research directions, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how PGPR can be employed to combat drought stress and support sustainable agriculture. These findings emphasize the potential of PGPR as a key component of integrated stress management strategies, offering a pathway for enhancing crop resilience and ensuring food security in the face of climate change.","[Chattaraj, Sourav; Samantaray, Aurodeepa; Thatoi, Hrudayanath] Siksha O Anusandhan Deemed Be Univ, Ctr Ind Biotechnol Res, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Kalinga Nagar, Bhubaneswar 751003, Odisha, India; [Ganguly, Arindam] Bankura Sammilani Coll, Dept Microbiol, Bankura 722102, West Bengal, India",Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University,"Chattaraj, S; Thatoi, H (corresponding author), Siksha O Anusandhan Deemed Be Univ, Ctr Ind Biotechnol Res, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Kalinga Nagar, Bhubaneswar 751003, Odisha, India.",souravchattaraj@soa.ac.in; hn_thatoi@rediffmail.com,"GANGULY, ARINDAM/NVM-0054-2025; CHATTARAJ, SOURAV/JTU-2800-2023","GANGULY, ARINDAM/0000-0002-2215-847X;",,,,136,14,17,12,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,3004-9261,DISCOV APPL SCI,DISCOV.

African agriculture is particularly vulnerable due to its harsh environments and limited adaptation capacity. This systematic review analyzes 96 articles from Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, focusing on biophysical studies related to maize in Africa and worldwide. We investigated the observed and projected extreme weather events in Africa, their impacts on maize production, and the approaches used to assess these effects. Our analysis reveals that drought, heatwaves, and floods are major threats to African maize production, impacting yields, suitable cultivation areas, and farmers' livelihoods. While studies have employed various methods, including field experiments, statistical models, and process-based modeling, African research is often limited by data gaps and technological constraints. We identify three main gaps: (i) lack of reliable long-term experimental and empirical data, (ii) limited access to advanced climate change adaptation technologies, and (iii) insufficient knowledge about specific extreme weather patterns and their interactions with management regimes. This review highlights the urgent need for targeted research in Africa to improve understanding of extreme weather impacts and formulate effective adaptation strategies.

The postharvest losses of these commodities, primarily due to inadequate storage conditions, microbial spoilage, and oxidative stress, pose a significant challenge for global food security. Although various postharvest treatments, such as physical, gaseous, chemical, and other biological techniques, have been developed and widely used to mitigate postharvest losses, there are, however, some reported drawbacks associated with each treatment. Moreover, the postharvest losses continue to increase regardless of the available technologies for preserving quality. Consequently, nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as a promising tool for addressing these challenges by enhancing postharvest treatments, packaging, and coatings. For instance, diverse types of NPs, including carbon, polymeric, lipid, metal, and metal oxide-based nanoparticles, have been documented to have the potential to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables by enhancing barrier properties, reducing microbial spoilage, and delaying senescence. Their efficacy, however, depends on various factors, such as the nature of the nanoparticle, formulation, application concentration, specific produce involved, and packaging conditions. Accordingly, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of NPs of different origins on the preservation and shelf-life extension of horticultural produce. It explores the efficacy and mechanisms of various NPs, including metal, carbon-based, polymeric, and lipid-based NPs, in postharvest management. The antimicrobial properties of NPs, their role in oxidative stress regulation, ethylene modulation, and their ability to reinforce packaging materials are also discussed. In addition, the synergistic effects of nanocomposites and hybrid materials to enhance food packaging performance are highlighted, alongside challenges such as regulatory concerns, potential toxicity, and environmental impact in ensuring safe and sustainable application.

Recent advances in plant science have highlighted the role of epigenetic regulation in plant immunity. This review examines current insights into how plants utilize epigenetic modifications, focusing on histone modifications, DNA methylation changes, and chromatin remodelling, to modulate defence gene expression and adapt to biotic stress. We explore how histone modifications influence both basal and induced immune responses through key enzymes and we examine the dual roles of DNA methylation in transcriptional activation and repression. Additionally, the review discusses ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complexes and non-coding RNA to highlight their contribution in fine tuning plant immunity. Finally, we discuss emerging technologies involved in epigenome editing and identify the knowledge gaps that must be addressed before translating our findings into making resilient agricultural systems.","[Ampntelnour, Litsa; Burton, Amelia; Ntoukakis, Vardis] Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, England",University of Warwick,"Ntoukakis, V (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Sch Life Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, England.",v.ntoukakis@warwick.ac.uk,,,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),"LA was funded by the University of Warwick through the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Reasearch Council (BBSRC, https://www.ukri.org) Midlands Integrative Biosciences Training Partnership B/T00746X/1.

This study reviews emerging technologies in milk processing, such as freeze-drying, ultrasound, supercritical carbon dioxide, ohmic heating, pulsed electric fields, high pressure, ozonation, cold plasma, and pulsed light. These methods show potential for eliminating microorganisms with reduced nutritional loss and environmental impact. Despite advances, challenges remain for their large-scale application, especially in process standardization and economic viability. This analysis contributes to expanding knowledge about these technologies, offering pathways for innovation, sustainability, and greater alignment with today's consumer demands.","[Cunha, Juliane Marina Dingee; Prudencio, Elane Schwinden] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Food Sci & Technol, BR-88034001 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Prestes, Amanda Alves; Prudencio, Elane Schwinden] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Technol Ctr, Postgrad Program Food Engn, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Pimentel, Tatiana Colombo] Fed Inst Parana IFPR, Food Dept, BR-87703536 Paranavai, PR, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Instituto Federal do Parana,"Prudencio, ES (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Food Sci & Technol, BR-88034001 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;Prudencio, ES (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Technol Ctr, Postgrad Program Food Engn, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;Pimentel, TC (corresponding author), Fed Inst Parana IFPR, Food Dept, BR-87703536 Paranavai, PR, Brazil.",julianedingee@gmail.com; aprestes04@gmail.com; tatiana.pimentel@ifpr.edu.br; elane.prudencio@ufsc.br,"Prudencio, Elane/MXL-7588-2025; Pimentel, Tatiana Colombo/G-5025-2012","Pimentel, Tatiana Colombo/0000-0003-4600-8932",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development [303069/2022-8],National Council for Scientific and Technological Development(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"This research was funded by CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, Brazil) [CNPq, 303069/2022-8].

Food insecurity may result from rapid population growth, inappropriate use of limited resources, climate change, unsuitable technologies, and a lack of appreciation for local knowledge and resources. Thus, developing appropriate plans to sustainably intensify subsistence agriculture is essential. Accordingly, a proper balance should be maintained between ecosystem health and increased agricultural production and productivity. This work presents a narrative review and personal insights on the sustainable intensification of subsistence agriculture to ensure food security in an eco-friendly way. Depending on the local context, various sustainable intensification methods could be adopted. Intensification requires the integrated and efficient use of limited resources and good practices. It also necessitates socioeconomic transformation and the creation of an enabling environment. Therefore, in addition to the sustainable intensification of crop production, livestock production, and natural resource management, policy interventions should focus on family planning, maintaining social equity and peace, and changing consumption and work habits. Interventions related to crop production include soil fertility management, the adoption of backyard orchards, association cropping and polyculture, the widespread use of resilient root and tuber crops, agrobiologicals, manual cultivators, and the reduction of post-harvest losses. Livestock producers can adopt wet salting of dry roughages, establish resilient fodder like cacti in drylands, develop feed banks and nutrient-dense feeds, destock and restock livestock, rear resilient livestock species and breeds, expand the use of transhumance, ratify ethnoveterinary practices, and prevent circulating diseases. Interventions such as area enclosures, vegetative propagation, watershed management, and the use of renewable energy sources are recommended for natural resource management. It is also essential to properly utilize indigenous knowledge, revise training and teaching curricula, diversify livelihood forms, and create platforms for knowledge dissemination. Intensification must consider the local context and the need to maintain ecosystem health.","[Desta, Takele Taye] Kotebe Univ Educ, Coll Sci & Math Educ, Dept Biol, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",,"Desta, TT (corresponding author), Kotebe Univ Educ, Coll Sci & Math Educ, Dept Biol, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",takele_taye@yahoo.com,,"Desta, Takele Taye/0000-0002-3474-0731",,,,109,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2356-654X,2314-7539,ADV AGR,Adv.

HCMV infection also leads to a significant disease burden in immunocompromised individuals. Hence, an effective HCMV vaccine is urgently needed to prevent infection and HCMV-associated diseases. Unfortunately, despite more than five decades of vaccine development, no successful HCMV vaccine is available. This review summarizes what we have learned from acquired natural immunity, including innate and adaptive immunity; the successes and failures of HCMV vaccine human clinical trials; the progress in related animal models; and the analysis of protective immune responses during natural infection and vaccination settings. Finally, we propose novel vaccine strategies that will harness the knowledge of protective immunity and employ new technology and vaccine concepts to inform next generation HCMV vaccine development.","[Hu, Xintao; Wang, Hsuan-Yuan; Otero, Claire E.; Permar, Sallie R.] Weill Cornell Med, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Wang, Hsuan-Yuan; Otero, Claire E.; Jenks, Jennifer A.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Duke Human Vaccine Inst, Durham, NC USA",Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine; Duke University,"Permar, SR (corresponding author), Weill Cornell Med, Dept Pediat, New York, NY 10065 USA.",sallie.Permar@med.cornell.ed,,"Otero, Claire/0000-0001-7127-2327; Wang, Hsuan-Yuan/0000-0001-9248-4281",[P01 AI129859]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [P01AI129859] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)),"This work was funded by the P01 AI129859 to S.R.P.

Despite this improved understanding, no clinically relevant therapies are yet available to compensate for the loss of functional adult myocardium and the absence of mature cardiomyocyte renewal that underlies cardiomyopathies of multiple origins. It remains of great interest to understand which mechanisms are responsible for the decline in proliferation in adult hearts and to elucidate new strategies for the stimulation of cardiac regeneration. Multiple signaling pathways have been identified that regulate the proliferation of cardiomyocytes in the embryonic heart and appear to be upregulated in postnatal injured hearts. In this Review, we highlight the interaction of signaling pathways in heart development and discuss how this knowledge has been translated into current technologies for cardiomyocyte production.","[Maas, Renee G.

The extreme conditions of pressure at ~500 bar, local hotspots with ~5,000 K, and oxidation created by HC can help obtain characteristic products with high quality and special taste. Moreover, compared with other emerging non-thermal approaches, the feature of the HC phenomenon and its generation mechanism helps determine that HC is more suitable for industrial-scale processing. This mini-review summarizes the current knowledge of the recent advances in HC-based liquid food processing. The principle of HC is briefly introduced. The effectiveness of HC on the various physical (e.g., particle size, viscosity, temperature, and stability), chemical (nutrition loss), and biological characteristics (microorganism inactivation) of various liquid foods are evaluated.

The precooling is the process of lowering down of the post-harvest temperature of mangoes. The main aim of this study is to provide basics/fundamental knowledge, mechanism, and application of the precooling technique in one place and create interest among the readers about the technique. Natural air or room cooling, hydro-cooling, forced-air cooling, vacuum cooling, evaporative cooling, liquid nitrogen (LN2) or cryogenic cooling, etc. are some of the most important cooling/precooling techniques used for the removal of the field heat.MethodsThe effect of application and principle of precooling techniques was studied from the different research reports in the public domain. Data was collected, summarized, and compared based on their performance, as reported in previous research.ResultsThe precooled mangoes are less prone to microbial attack and postharvest loss. There is more chance of mangoes remain fit for the consumers' acceptability and provide better opportunities of good commercial value to growers and sellers even in distant markets.ConclusionMost of the studies are based on the engineering, modeling, market returns, and physiology of precooled products. In this review paper, the basic principles and their recent development in applications for the precooling of mangoes are discussed to encourage the wide use of this technology so that the post-harvest losses can be minimized, significantly.","[Patel, Krishna Kumar] Aligarh Muslim Univ, Dept Post Harvest Engn & Technol, Aligarh 202002, India; [Patel, Krishna Kumar] Post Grad Coll, Dept Agr Engn, Ghazipur 233001, India; [Patel, Krishna Kumar] VBS Purvanchal Univ, Jaunpur, India",Aligarh Muslim University,"Patel, KK (corresponding author), Aligarh Muslim Univ, Dept Post Harvest Engn & Technol, Aligarh 202002, India.;Patel, KK (corresponding author), Post Grad Coll, Dept Agr Engn, Ghazipur 233001, India.;Patel, KK (corresponding author), VBS Purvanchal Univ, Jaunpur, India.",k_krishna_374@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,74,4,5,1,8,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1738-1266,2234-1862,J BIOSYST ENG-KOR,J.

Because of its unexplored frequency bands, short wavelengths, and bandwidths that provide excellent spatial resolution, the terahertz (THz) frequency range (0.1 THz-10 THz) stands out as a potential enabler. In addition to helping to address the existing spectrum shortage, the enormous bandwidth accessible at THz frequencies can clear the path for the wireless terabit-per-second (Tbps) connectivity needed for 6G networks. This article in contrast to previous surveys concentrates on the difficulties and essential technologies in THz communication. The use of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) in THz communication systems is heavily emphasized. With its capacity to dynamically control electromagnetic waves, IRS technology offers a revolutionary means of addressing issues including excessive path loss and absorption losses related to THz frequencies. In the THz domain, the notion of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is also discussed, emphasizing its dual role in enabling data transfer and environmental sensing at the same time. This review attempts to provide a thorough knowledge of the revolutionary influence of these new technologies on future wireless networks by looking at the fundamentals, technological developments, and real-world applications of THz-IRS systems. THz communication integration with IRS and ISAC has the potential to completely transform wireless communication and open the door to incredibly fast, dependable, and intelligent network solutions.","[Langde, Pranali; Jain, Tapan Kumar; Parate, Mayur] Indian Inst Informat Technol, Nagpur, India; [Singh, Sandeep Kumar] Motilal Nehru Natl Inst Technol Allahabad, Allahabad, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology,"Langde, P (corresponding author), Indian Inst Informat Technol, Nagpur, India.",langdepranali@gmail.com; tapan.jain@iiitn.ac.in; mparate@iiitn.ac.in; sksingh@mnnit.ac.in,"JAIN, TAPAN/HGE-0667-2022; Parate, Mayur/AFO-0554-2022","JAIN, TAPAN/0000-0003-0255-0084;","Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) , Government of India","Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) , Government of India","This work was supported by Visvesvaraya Ph.D. scheme: Phase-II from Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) , Government of India.",208,3,3,7,27,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1874-4907,,PHYS COMMUN-AMST,Phys.

This comprehensive review article sums up current control strategies, worm-derived antigens and recent advances in anti-Haemonchus vaccine development. New insights into antigen engineering and general considerations for clinical trials are discussed here. The evolutionary success of parasitic worms causes significant economic losses and animal health problems, including in the small ruminant industry. The hematophagous nematode Haemonchus contortus is a common endoparasite that infects wild and domestic ruminants worldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. To date, the most commonly applied control strategy is the administration of anthelminthic drugs. The main disadvantages of these chemicals are their ecotoxic effects, the necessary withdrawal period (especially important in dairy animals) and the increasing development of resistance. Vaccines offer an attractive alternative control strategy against Haemonchus infections. In previous years, several potential vaccine antigens prepared from H. contortus using the latest technologies have been assessed in clinical trials using different methods and strategies. This review highlights the current state of knowledge on anti-H. contortus vaccines (covering native, recombinant and DNA-based vaccines), including an evaluation, as well a discussion of the challenges and achievements in developing protective, efficient, and long-lasting vaccines to control H. contortus infection and haemonchosis in small ruminants. This paper also addresses novel developments tackling the challenge of glycosylation of putative candidates in recombinant form.","[Adduci, Isabella; Hinney, Barbara; Joachim, Anja; Yan, Shi] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Inst Parasitol, Dept Pathobiol, Veterinar Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Sajovitz, Floriana; Lichtmannsperger, Katharina; Wittek, Thomas] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Univ Clin Ruminants, Dept Farm Anim & Vet Publ Hlth, Veterinar pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Yan, S (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med Vienna, Inst Parasitol, Dept Pathobiol, Veterinar Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",shi.yan@vetmeduni.ac.at,"; Yan, Shi/H-9091-2013; Joachim, Anja/PFJ-0819-2025","Lichtmannsperger, Katharina/0000-0002-5916-0610; Joachim, Anja/0000-0003-3082-6885; Yan, Shi/0000-0003-4949-9140; Adduci, Isabella/0000-0001-9322-0130",Program Top Vet Science - Vetmeduni Vienna,Program Top Vet Science - Vetmeduni Vienna,This work has been funded by the Program Top Vet Science financed by Vetmeduni Vienna.,128,49,61,6,39,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,SEP,2022,12.0,18,,,,,,2339,10.3390/ani12182339,0.0,,20,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,4T9JW,36139199.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:000858424700001,0

However, the e-bike platform lacks discussion as a viable option for people with different abilities. This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap, and in doing so, help realize the potential of e-bikes for all users. We reviewed the literature to understand people's e-bike perceptions and any concerns and barriers that may be delaying the adoption of e-bikes among marginalized populations in the United States. The findings suggested that disabilities and advanced age negatively affected the way people perceive e-bikes. Conversely, positive perceptions were shaped by various factors including e-bike experience, personal cycling history, and openness to innovative technology. Significant concerns about e-bikes included safety, security, social stigma imposed on electric assistance, and loss of disability benefits. Along with these concerns, lack of knowledge, misperceptions, limited access, high purchase costs, and inadequate infrastructure were identified as major deterrents to adopting e-bikes. The findings also highlighted the need for programs, policies, and education to promote the acceptance of e-bikes as mobility aids. Further research should prioritize people with disabilities and older adults who lack e-bike experience and explore the perceptions of key stakeholders whose perspectives directly influence the wider adoption of e-bikes, including transportation planners, health professionals, families, and caregivers.","[Lee, Kyuhyun; Sener, Ipek Nese] Texas A&M Transportat Inst, 505 East Huntland Dr,Suite 455, Austin, TX 78752 USA; [Lee, Kyuhyun] Univ Illinois, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, 611 E Lorado Taft Dr, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Sener, IN (corresponding author), Texas A&M Transportat Inst, 505 East Huntland Dr,Suite 455, Austin, TX 78752 USA.",k-lee@tti.tamu.edu; i-sener@tti.tamu.edu,,,U.S. Department of Transportation Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology University Transportation Centers Program [69A3551947136],U.S. Department of Transportation Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology University Transportation Centers Program,This work was supported by the National Institute for Congestion Reduction and funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology University Transportation Centers Program under Grant No. 69A3551947136.

The search covered literature from inception until October 17, 2024. The primary outcomes included intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, postoperative pain scores, and satisfaction with cosmetic outcomes. The secondary outcomes included operative time (min), estimated blood loss (ml), hemoglobin drop, blood transfusion, conversion, postoperative hospital stay, lymph nodes harvested, sentinel lymph node identification, recurrence, and mortality during follow-up. Data analysis was performed using random-effects or fixed-effects models, calculating combined risk ratios (RR), weighted mean difference (WMD), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsFive studies describing a total of 448 patients were retained and included for this meta-analysis. No significant differences were found between RSSH and RMPH regarding intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, and postoperative pain scores.

Its ability to efficiently store large quantities of hydrogen supports diverse applications across energy, industry, and transportation sectors. However, significant challenges persist, including hydrogen permeability, boil-off losses, embrittlement, and insulation inefficiencies, which impede the widespread adoption of this technology. While previous studies have provided valuable insights into specific aspects of cryogenic hydrogen storage, a holistic understanding of these issues remains fragmented, with limited focus on the interplay between materials, system design, and operational performance. This review aims to bridge this knowledge gap by critically analyzing recent advancements in cryogenic hydrogen storage and identifying unresolved challenges that require further exploration. Adopting an integrative approach, this study synthesizes findings from various disciplines to provide a holistic perspective. It emphasizes advanced computational modeling, the development of novel materials with improved thermal and mechanical properties, and integrated system designs that address the complex nature of cryogenic storage.

The direct discharge of this wastewater poses significant threats to ecosystems and leads to the loss of valuable salt resources, for example, triggering freshwater salinization syndrome and mobilizing heavy metals to form toxic chemical cocktails, leading to the loss of valuable salt resources. Desalination of high-salinity wastewater primarily involves two key processes: concentration and crystallization, whereby a concentrated brine is first obtained through membrane-based or thermal methods, followed by salt recovery via crystallization. This review begins by employing a bibliometric analysis to map the knowledge structure and trace the evolution of research trends, revealing that membrane-thermal integration has become a dominant research hotspot since 2020. It then provides a systematic examination of advanced treatment technologies, chronicling the progression from early biological methods to contemporary membrane-based and thermal desalination approaches. A specific analysis of the influence of salinity on membrane scaling is also included. Consequently, this paper critically assesses the prospects and challenges of several alternative desalination technologies and proposes that integrated processes, combining membrane-based and thermal desalination, represent a highly promising pathway for achieving zero liquid discharge (ZLD). Finally, we suggest that future research should prioritize the development of key functional materials, explore efficient hybrid physiochemical-biochemical processes, and advance emerging technologies, aimed at enhancing treatment efficiency and reducing operational costs.","[Wang, Xiao; Cheng, Xinyi; Shuai, Ao; Xu, Xiyu; Guo, Xinran; Liu, Caihong] Chongqing Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Key Lab Ecoenvironm Three Gorges Reservoir Reg, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Song, Dan] Harbin Inst Technol, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150090, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wenjuan] Tianjin Chengjian Univ, Sch Environm & Municipal Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Aquat Sci & Technol, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China",Chongqing University; Harbin Institute of Technology; Tianjin Chengjian University,"Liu, CH (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Key Lab Ecoenvironm Three Gorges Reservoir Reg, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.;Zhang, WJ (corresponding author), Tianjin Chengjian Univ, Sch Environm & Municipal Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Aquat Sci & Technol, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China.",13284606099@163.com; 18716241890@163.com; shuaiao001@gmail.com; 15090492612@163.com; 17823374028@126.com; songd@hit.edu.cn; caihong.liu@cqu.edu.cn; wenjuanvivian@126.com,,,"Open Project of State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology [ES202416]; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing [CSTB2023NSCQ-MSX1090]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [52570067]","Open Project of State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing(Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We appreciate the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52570067), Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (CSTB2023NSCQ-MSX1090), and Open Project of State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology (ES202416).",112,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0375,MEMBRANES-BASEL,Membranes,JAN 3,2026,16.0,1,,,,,,27,10.3390/membranes16010027,0.0,,21,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Physical; Engineering, Chemical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Polymer Science",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Engineering; Materials Science; Polymer Science,CO8TZ,41590579.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001670913700001,0

However, little attention has been paid to the knowledge dimensions reflecting the potential macro-social implications of generative technologies. This study utilizes a two-fold methodology, consisting of a bibliometric analysis of articles published in the last decade (N = 484) and a subsequent qualitative thematic review of the most influential articles in each research area (N = 246). The objective is to investigate the main conceptual dimensions associated with generative AI in the social sciences. Applying a thematic analysis framework, we notice that the most popular dimensions are technological, ethical, and social. These dimensions primarily focus on investigating the implications of the generative use of AI on employees in professional sectors as well as on students and teachers in the educational environment.

Because urethral function declines by 15% each decade, 7 even in the absence of childbirth, understanding the role of urethral failure in the aging population is important. Neurovascular, smooth muscle, striated muscle, and connective tissue changes collectively influence urethral function, leading to a greater susceptibility to UI as women age. Striated muscle loss and a higher connective -tissue proportion are evident among the older female urethras compared to younger female urethras. Aging decreases the quantity and overall distribution of intramuscular nerves within the striated urethral sphincter, decreasing the number of striated muscle cells over time. Understanding these age -related alterations is essential for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies to improve the quality of life for aging women. Imaging technologies, including MRI and ultrasound, have been crucial in advancing our understanding of age -related changes in the female urethra. MRI offers detailed structural insights, such as the decrease in striated muscle signal intensity, while ultrasound provides real-time dynamic observations, such as age related changes in urethral mobility and vascularity factors, both contributing to our knowledge of UI in aging women. In summary, while we have made significant strides in understanding the female urethra's changes with aging, substantial gaps in knowledge persist. Addressing these gaps will enhance our understanding of age -related alterations and pave the way for more effective prevention and treatment strategies, ultimately improving the quality of life for aging women.","[Afyouni, Andrew S.; Wu, Yi Xi; Sadeghi, Zhina] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Urol, Div Neurourol & Reconstruct Pelv Surg, 3800 W Chapman Ave,Suite 7200, Orange, CA 92868 USA; [Balis, Ulysses G.

Consequently, quantifying and managing fish escapement constitute a critical component of sustainable reservoir fish management. We reviewed existing literature to assess the state of knowledge of reservoir fish escapement and found 57 unique papers published from 1942 through 2021. Early studies sought to evaluate escapement by directly capturing fish below release structures. More recently, advances in technology have enabled more detailed studies on factors influencing escapement and the influence it has on regulating reservoir fisheries. Evaluations have occurred throughout North America, assessing escapement of 49 species through a number of different outlet structures. Annual escapement estimates ranged from 0% to 100%, and escapement tended to be higher from spillways and surface release outlets compared to other outlets. Further, smaller-bodied individuals tended to escape at higher rates than larger fish and escapement was generally positively related to reservoir discharge metrics. Sixteen papers assessed benefits of physical and nonphysical barriers for reducing reservoir fish escapement and determined that the barriers were effective for retaining fish in reservoirs. We conclude by describing management options to address escapement as well as three pressing research needs that will broaden the existing knowledge base regarding fish escapement. In light of predicted changes in precipitation events and subsequent adaptations to reservoir management, quantifying and mitigating fish escapement will be a critical component of sustainable reservoir fish management in the future.","[Lewis, Madeline C.; Cope, W.

But its sustainability is heavily constrained by a range of destructive pathogens, among which, clubroot disease, caused by a biotrophic protist Plasmodiophora brassicae, has caused significant yield and economic losses worldwide, thereby threatening global food security. To counter the pathogen attack, it demands a better understanding of the complex phenomenon of Brassica-P. brassicae pathosystem at the physiological, biochemical, molecular, and cellular levels. In recent years, multiple omics technologies with high-throughput techniques have emerged as successful in elucidating the responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In Brassica spp., omics technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics, ncRNAomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are well documented, allowing us to gain insights into the dynamic changes that transpired during host-pathogen interactions at a deeper level. So, it is critical that we must review the recent advances in omics approaches and discuss how the current knowledge in multi-omics technologies has been able to breed high-quality clubroot-resistant B. oleracea. This review highlights the recent advances made in utilizing various omics approaches to understand the host resistance mechanisms adopted by Brassica crops in response to the P. brassicae attack. Finally, we have discussed the bottlenecks and the way forward to overcome the persisting knowledge gaps in delivering solutions to breed clubroot-resistant Brassica crops in a holistic, targeted, and precise way.","[Shaw, Ranjan K.; Shen, Yusen; Yu, Huifang; Sheng, Xiaoguang; Wang, Jiansheng; Gu, Honghui] Zhejiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Vegetables, Hangzhou 310021, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences,"Gu, HH (corresponding author), Zhejiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Vegetables, Hangzhou 310021, Peoples R China.",guhh@zaas.ac.cn,"; Wang, Jiansheng/AAS-8482-2021; Shaw, Ranjan/ACS-4939-2022","Gu, Honghui/0000-0001-5816-7530;","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LD22C150002, LQ20C150001]; Science and Technology Department of Zhejiang Province [2021C02065-4, 2022C02051, 2021C02042]; Zhejiang Province Public Welfare Project [LGN20C150005]",Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Science and Technology Department of Zhejiang Province; Zhejiang Province Public Welfare Project,"Funding was provided by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LD22C150002, LQ20C150001), the Science and Technology Department of Zhejiang Province (2021C02065-4, 2022C02051, 2021C02042), Zhejiang Province Public Welfare Project (LGN20C150005).",391,8,8,3,36,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1661-6596,1422-0067,INT J MOL SCI,Int.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature on battery degradation prediction methods for eVTOL aircraft, providing a brief overview on early modeling approaches and placing primary emphasis on recent advances in their applicability and limitations under unique operational scenarios of eVTOL, such as frequent takeoffs and landings, high power loads, and complex environmental conditions. Current prediction efforts primarily target key indicators including battery lifespan, health status, and capacity retention, employing a range of technical approaches such as electrochemical modeling, equivalent circuit modeling, data-driven algorithms like machine learning and deep learning, and hybrid physics-informed models that integrate domain knowledge with data analysis. The review systematically summarizes the main prediction methods and their evolution in different phases of the development of eVTOL technology. On this basis, we highlight existing technical bottlenecks and unresolved challenges, including the high demand for data and computational resources limiting real-time performance, poor accuracy of traditional models under high discharge rates and extreme conditions, challenges in accurately modeling complex multi-physics interactions and achieving a stable balance among prediction accuracy, interpretability, and real-time computational efficiency, as well as the scarcity of historical flight data affecting model reliability and generalization.

Aim To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) simulation in endodontic education among undergraduate dental students, with a specific focus on four key outcomes: procedural accuracy, enhancement of student confidence, reduction in procedural errors, and overall learner satisfaction. Methods An exhaustive literature search was carried out in December 2024 in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, and cross-sectional studies published between 2010 and 2024 were included in the review. Risk of bias was appraised as follows: Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB2) tool for RCTs; Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale adapted for cross-sectional studies; National Institute of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool for before-and-after studies; and the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) tool for non-randomized studies without a comparator group. Results Fifteen studies were included in the final analysis.VR-based training showed statistically significant differences between the pre and post-test scores regarding procedural accuracy and efficiency for tasks at the end of endodontics. These results showed that VR training leads to greater confidence and skill levels in students than traditional approaches, improved retention of knowledge, and a reduction in errors. Advantages notwithstanding, limitations around cost and accessibility were observed. Conclusion VR simulation is an effective, valuable tool in the endodontic education toolbox. Further studies should assess cost-effectiveness and long-term clinical performance effects.","[Javed, Muhammad Qasim] Qassim Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Conservat Dent Sci, Buraydah 51452, Qassim, Saudi Arabia; [Arjumand, Bilal] Qassim Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Conservat Dent Sci, Buraydah 52571, Qassim, Saudi Arabia; [Klarkodi, Shaul Hameed] Qassim Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Diagnost Sci, Qasim 52571, Saudi Arabia; [Atique, Sundus] Qatar Univ, Coll Dent Med, Doha 2713, Qatar; [Abulhamael, Ayman M.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Dent, Endodont Dept, POB 80209, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Zafar, Muhammad Sohail] Ajman Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Clin Sci, Ajman 346, U Arab Emirates; [Zafar, Muhammad Sohail] Ajman Univ, Ctr Med & Bioallied Hlth Sci Res, Ajman 346, U Arab Emirates; [Zafar, Muhammad Sohail] Univ Jordan, Sch Dent, Amman 11942, Jordan",Qassim University; Qassim University; Qassim University; Qatar University; King Abdulaziz University; Ajman University; Ajman University; University of Jordan,"Javed, MQ (corresponding author), Qassim Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Conservat Dent Sci, Buraydah 51452, Qassim, Saudi Arabia.;Zafar, MS (corresponding author), Ajman Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Clin Sci, Ajman 346, U Arab Emirates.;Zafar, MS (corresponding author), Ajman Univ, Ctr Med & Bioallied Hlth Sci Res, Ajman 346, U Arab Emirates.;Zafar, MS (corresponding author), Univ Jordan, Sch Dent, Amman 11942, Jordan.",m.anayat@qu.edu.sa; sundusatique@qu.edu.qa; amahmad4@kau.edu.sa; muhammad.zafar@ajman.ac.ae,"ARJUMAND, BILAL/OVZ-2158-2025; Javed, Muhammad Qasim/ABE-3169-2020; KOLARKODI, SHAUL/ACO-9292-2022; Abulhamael, Ayman/AAS-6622-2021; Zafar, Muhammad Sohail/N-2800-2014","ARJUMAND, BILAL/0000-0003-3090-3668; Javed, Muhammad Qasim/0000-0002-7586-4319; Kolarkodi, Shaul Hameed/0000-0003-1735-8351; Abulhamael, Ayman/0000-0001-7214-0967; Zafar, Muhammad Sohail/0000-0002-5157-7067","Ajman University; Ajman University, UAE","Ajman University(Ajman University); Ajman University, UAE","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by Ajman University, UAE, for covering the article's APC.",45,2,2,4,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1472-6920,BMC MED EDUC,BMC Med.

This research offers a thorough comparative analysis of foam geopolymer synthesis, material properties, and performance trends, derived from the assessment of over 150 + published publications, with 85 pivotal experimental studies meticulously examined. The research delineates the correlations among binder type, activator chemical, foaming technique, and curing procedure, while quantitatively assessing attributes such as density (600-1300 kg/m3), compressive strength (2-15 MPa), pore size (100-600 mu m), and thermal conductivity (0.18-0.35 W/mK). The academic significance of this paper is rooted in its comprehensive analysis of experimental data, including performance correlations that elucidate the effects of activator-to-binder ratios (0.40-0.55) and foaming agent concentrations (0.5-4%) on pore stability and strength retention. This article analyzes recent advancements in geopolymer composites, focusing on the inclusion of nano-silica and hybrid fiber reinforcement, along with their prospective integration with foam matrices to create multifunctional materials that reduce carbon emissions. The study focuses on curing methods at ambient and elevated temperatures, long-term durability, and sustainability efforts aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study enhances academic knowledge by pinpointing deficiencies in understanding, specifically in the areas of microstructural regulation, curing optimization, and composite-foam interaction.

Stormwater management engineered porous media systems (SWMEPMS) have emerged as promising solutions, leveraging filtration processes to capture and retain MNPs while supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 6, 11, and 14). Despite their potential, research on the fate of MNPs within SWMEPMS remains limited. Most importantly, no prior study has systematically and comprehensively reviewed how SWMEPMS remove MNPs from stormwater, particularly in relation to removal mechanisms, porous media and MNP characteristics, and water chemistry, despite their growing application and relevance. To bridge this gap, the standardized PRISMA methodology was employed to review the sources, transport, retention, and removal characteristics of MNPs in SWMEPMS. Key findings of the review highlight that MNPs in stormwater runoff are predominantly composed of polymers, including polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and tire wear particles (TWPs). SWMEPMS demonstrate up to 100% removal efficiency through mechanisms like sedimentation, straining, entrapment, entanglement, accumulation, agglomeration, electrostatic interactions, and surface complexation. Engineered porous media characteristics, such as surface properties, particle size distribution, and porosity, play crucial roles in enhancing removal efficiency, with porous media like limestone and biochar demonstrating greater performance than sand. The presence of functional groups, such as carbonyl, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups, on either the media or MNPs enhanced the removal efficiency of SWMEPMS. This review synthesizes existing knowledge, identifies gaps, and offers recommendations for future research to enhance this technology.","[Essien, Aniekan E.; Dickson-Anderson, Sarah E.; Guo, Yiping] McMaster Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L7, Canada",McMaster University,"Essien, AE; Dickson-Anderson, SE (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L7, Canada.",essiena@mcmaster.ca; sdickso@mcmaster.ca,"Essien, Aniekan/ABH-2329-2020","Essien, Aniekan/0000-0001-9653-1903; Dickson-Anderson, Sarah/0000-0002-0647-9214; Guo, Yiping/0000-0001-6840-1298",,,,107,0,0,1,1,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",,2754-7000,ENVIRON SCI-ADV,Environ.

The aim was to give an overview of the existing literature on the effectiveness and safety of intrapartum or postpartum catheterization in the prevention of PUR.MethodsThis scoping review followed a methodological framework. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, the China Science and Technology Journal Database, and the China Biomedical Literature Database were searched from the inception of each database to 21 May 2023.ResultsThe search revealed 16 studies examining three different catheterization methodologies, including 12 intrapartum studies. Ten studies concluded that intrapartum or postpartum catheterization prevented PUR, two of which were only for overt or covert PUR. In 4 out of 13 experimental studies, no significant difference was found: one for intrapartum catheterization versus routine nursing, the other for intrapartum or postpartum intermittent versus indwelling catheterization. However, one found that postpartum disposable catheterization after ineffective targeted care reduced the incidence of PUR compared with indwelling catheterization. One out of the 3 case-control studies concluded that prenatal catheterization >= 2 times was a risk factor for PUR.ConclusionsBased on the findings in this scoping review, catheterization prior to the diagnosis of PUR appears to play a role in preventing PUR and is safe. Preliminary evidence is accumulating on the effectiveness of three types of catheterization methods in preventing PUR, but more comprehensive studies are needed to establish these findings.","[Chen, Hua-ting; Peng, Jia-yi] Guangzhou Med Univ, Nursing Coll, Clin Coll 3, 195 West Dongfeng Rd, Guangzhou 510182, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xue-ling] Guangzhou Med Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol Obstet, Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Greater Bay Area Higher, Affiliated Hosp 3, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Li-ping; Luo, Tai-zhen] Guangzhou Med Univ, Guangdong Prov Clin Res Ctr Obstet & Gynecol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Major Obstet Dis, Dept Nursing,Affiliated Hosp 3, 63 Duobao Rd,Liwan Dist, Guangzhou 510150, Peoples R China",Guangzhou Medical University; Guangzhou Medical University; Guangzhou Medical University,"Chen, LP; Luo, TZ (corresponding author), Guangzhou Med Univ, Guangdong Prov Clin Res Ctr Obstet & Gynecol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Major Obstet Dis, Dept Nursing,Affiliated Hosp 3, 63 Duobao Rd,Liwan Dist, Guangzhou 510150, Peoples R China.",clp202306@163.com; ltz751007@163.com,"Chen, Hua-ting/IUO-0422-2023","Luo, Tai-zhen/0000-0002-3429-0873",Soft Science Research Project of Guangdong Province; Third Clinical College of Guangzhou Medical University,Soft Science Research Project of Guangdong Province; Third Clinical College of Guangzhou Medical University,We acknowledge the Guangzhou Medical University Library for providing the database and the Third Clinical College of Guangzhou Medical University for offering learning opportunities.,40,2,3,2,6,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0937-3462,1433-3023,INT UROGYNECOL J,Int.

It begins by exploring clean energy alternatives, focusing on waste-to-energy solutions, and introduces the concept, applications, and advantages of MFCs. The biochemical processes within MFCs are explained, highlighting how microorganisms metabolize substrates through glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain to generate electrons. These electrons flow through an external circuit and combine with protons and oxygen at the cathode to produce water or reduced forms of nitrogen and sulfur. This paper also analyzes 10 key parameters affecting MFC performance: coulombic efficiency, pH, temperature, substrates, organic loading rate, electrode potential, open circuit voltage, treatment efficiency, organic removal rate, and hydraulic retention time. Recent advancements in MFC technology are also discussed, including innovations in reactor configuration and scaling, the development of new membrane materials like earthen and ceramic, and improvements in wastewater treatment methods. The advancements also extend to genetic engineering techniques to enhance microbial efficiency and component modifications, such as the use of carbon-based nanomaterials and metal catalysts for improved performance, innovations in proton transfer membranes, and mediator-less MFCs utilizing metal-reducing bacteria. Challenges facing MFC technology, such as cost, scalability, and environmental sensitivity, are mentioned. The paper concludes with future directions, including the use of advanced materials, integration with wastewater treatment infrastructure, and the potential for nutrient recovery and chemical synthesis. This comprehensive review aims to provide knowledge into optimizing MFCs for sustainable energy generation and environmental benefits.","[Kwofie, Matthew] Univ Mines & Technol, Dept Renewable Energy Engn, Tarkwa, Ghana; [Amanful, Bright] Univ Edinburgh, Dept Global Environm Challenges, Edinburgh, Scotland; [Gamor, Samuel] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Kumasi, Ghana; [Kaku, Foster] Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Dept Chem Sci, Sunyani, Ghana",University of Edinburgh; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Kwofie, M (corresponding author), Univ Mines & Technol, Dept Renewable Energy Engn, Tarkwa, Ghana.",matthew.kwofie@ndus.edu; s2553610@ed.ac.uk; 27808777@sun.ac.za; fosterkaku2000@gmail.com,"Kwofie, Matthew/LNR-7347-2024; AMANFUL, BRIGHT/ODL-6882-2025","Kwofie, Matthew/0009-0000-9689-5248; AMANFUL, BRIGHT/0000-0002-5363-0642",,,,190,9,10,5,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0363-907X,1099-114X,INT J ENERG RES,Int.

The use of natural and synthetic polymers for drug delivery has become increasingly popular. Polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) can be loaded with chemotherapeutics, small chemicals, and/or biological therapeutics. Major problems in delivering such therapeutics to the desired targets are associated with the lack of specificity and the low capacity of PNPs to cross cell membranes, which seems to be even more difficult to overcome in multidrug-resistant cancer cells with rigid lipid bilayers. Despite the progress of these nanocarrier delivery systems (NDSs), active targeting approaches to complement the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect are necessary to improve their therapeutic efficiency and reduce systemic toxicity. For this, a targeting moiety is required to deliver the nanocarrier systems to a specific location. A strategy to overcome these limitations and raise the uptake of PNPs is the conjugation with RNA aptamers (RNApt) with specificity for cancer cells. The site-directed delivery of drugs is made by the functionalization of these specific ligands on the NDSs surface, thereby creating specificity for features of cancer cell membranes or an overexpressed target/receptor exposed to those cells. Despite the advances in the field, NDSs development and functionalization are still in their early stages and numerous challenges are expected to impact the technology. Thus, RNApt supplies a promising reply to the common problem related to drug delivery by NDSs. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the use of RNApt to generate functionalized PNPs for cancer therapy, discussing the most relevant studies in the area.","[Marangoni, Karina; Menezes, Regina] iBET Inst Biol Expt & Tecnol, Apartado 12, P-2781901 Oeiras, Portugal; [Marangoni, Karina; Menezes, Regina] CBIOS Univ Lusofonas Res Ctr Biosci & Hlth Technol, Campo Grande 376, P-1749024 Lisbon, Portugal; [Menezes, Regina] Univ NOVA Lisboa, Fac Ciencias Med, NOVA Med Sch, Campo Martires da Patria 130, P-1169056 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Marangoni, K (corresponding author), iBET Inst Biol Expt & Tecnol, Apartado 12, P-2781901 Oeiras, Portugal.;Marangoni, K (corresponding author), CBIOS Univ Lusofonas Res Ctr Biosci & Hlth Technol, Campo Grande 376, P-1749024 Lisbon, Portugal.",dra.karinamarangoni@gmail.com,"Menezes Echaniz, Regina/L-3792-2014; Marangoni, Karina/K-3582-2012","Menezes Echaniz, Regina/0000-0003-0552-8480; Marangoni, Karina/0000-0002-9761-3668","FCT [UIDB/04567/2020, UIDP/04567/2020, PTDC/BIA-MOL/31104/2017, CEEC/04567/CBIOS/2020]",FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),This work was supported by FCT grants UIDB/04567/2020 and UIDP/04567/2020 to CBIOS and PTDC/BIA-MOL/31104/2017.

This systematic literature review aims to examine the application of XR technologies across various scientific and educational domains, evaluate their impact on learning outcomes, and identify the challenges hindering their broader integration. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a literature search was conducted using Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and IEEE Xplore, focusing on empirical studies published between 1 January 2010 and 1 November 2024, resulting in the inclusion of 56 studies. Among these, 32 studies (53%) employed VR, 25 studies (42%) utilized AR, and 3 studies (5%) adopted MR, with 4 studies exploring the combined application of VR and AR. The findings indicate that VR is primarily applied in higher education settings, such as universities and graduate programs, whereas AR is more prevalent in primary and secondary education; although MR is less frequently used, it exhibits distinct advantages in disciplines requiring high interactivity and realism. Overall, each XR modality can enhance learning motivation, efficiency, and immediate knowledge acquisition in short-term interventions, while long-term implementation may contribute to improved memory retention, increased learner confidence, and sustained engagement. Despite persistent challenges-including high equipment costs, spatial and temporal constraints, small sample sizes, and insufficient longitudinal evidence-these findings underscore the transformative potential of XR technologies in applied sciences education.","[Huang, Tien-Chi] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Management, Taichung 404, Taiwan; [Tseng, Hsin-Ping] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Doctoral Program Intelligent Engn, Taichung 404, Taiwan",National Taichung University of Science & Technology; National Taichung University of Science & Technology,"Huang, TC (corresponding author), Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Management, Taichung 404, Taiwan.",tchuang@nutc.edu.tw; s1f11336002@nutc.edu.tw,"Huang, Tien-Chi/AFA-7105-2022; Tseng, Hsin-Ping/GXF-5388-2022","Huang, Tien-Chi/0000-0001-6469-0344;","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; [NSTC 112-2410-H-025-027-MY3]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan);","This research was funded by Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, grant number [NSTC 112-2410-H-025-027-MY3].",71,10,14,31,41,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

In parallel, an alternative ecosystem has emerged in which non-commercial societal actors (patients, advocacy groups, and philanthropic entities) contribute to the design, evaluation, and dissemination of therapies for rare diseases. This systematic review provides the first structured synthesis of empirical evidence on societal participation in OD development, with a specific focus on neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders. Twenty-one peer-reviewed studies were included, spanning a range of designs from case reports to stakeholder surveys. A functional typology of societal roles was developed, identifying four primary modalities: Initiator, Accelerator, Translator, and Monitor. Societal actors contributed to early-stage funding, trial co-design, regulatory engagement, dissemination, and patient preference studies. Their involvement was associated with accelerated development timelines, improved recruitment and retention, enhanced endpoint relevance, increased public literacy, and the emergence of new ethical standards. However, critical tensions remain. The review identifies persistent gaps in representation, risks of tokenism and instrumentalization, blurred governance boundaries, and a lack of longitudinal evaluation frameworks. Although initiatives like EUPATI and IMI PREFER have begun addressing these challenges, further work is required to ensure inclusive, evidence-based, and structurally supported societal engagement. As the European Union Health Technology Assessment Regulation (EU HTAR) reshapes decision-making frameworks, societal participation is no longer peripheral but integral to regulatory legitimacy and therapeutic relevance. Realizing its full potential requires moving beyond anecdotal engagement toward durable, transparent, and evaluable participatory models.","[Akodad, Sanae; Stevens, Hilde] Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, Inst Interdisciplinary Innovat Healthcare I3h, Fac Med, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Brussels, Belgium; [De Smedt, Delphine] Univ Ghent, Dept Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Ghent, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Solvay SA; Ghent University; Ghent University Hospital,"Akodad, S (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, Inst Interdisciplinary Innovat Healthcare I3h, Fac Med, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Brussels, Belgium.",sanae.akodad@ulb.be,"Stevens, Hilde/AAP-1097-2020","Stevens, Hilde/0000-0002-7096-0467",AFM-Tlthon10.13039/100013465; Belgian Kids' Fund for Pediatric Research,AFM-Tlthon10.13039/100013465; Belgian Kids' Fund for Pediatric Research,The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on the valorization of agri-food waste, with a particular focus on volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and subsequent bioplastics production. To this end, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using specialist bibliographic databases. The study primarily focuses on reviewing the biological production of PHBV (poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)), a type of PHA, due to its relevance as a substitute for fossil-based plastics. Significant attention has been directed toward exploring the potential of agri-food wastes, such as whey, potato peelings, and brewery bagasse, as raw materials for their transformation into a tailor-made VFA solution, rich in valeric and propionic acids. Additionally, existing operational strategies and waste co-treatments have been reviewed. The produced VFAs present multiple applications, including single-cell oils, Omega-3-rich oils, and different types of PHA. Factors influencing the bio-polymerization of VFAs to PHBV, such as the type of substrate, operating conditions (pH and retention time), and the presence of specific microorganisms, have also been reviewed. Due to its physicochemical properties, PHBV has applications in sectors such as agriculture and packaging. This review concludes that transforming agri-food waste into PHBV has the potential to integrate environmental and economic benefits within a circular bioeconomy model, fostering technological innovation and the sustainable use of waste resources.","[Arriaga, Marta; Pinar, Francisco Javier; Izarra, Irene; del Amo, Jesus; Vicente, Javier; Mena, Javier] CLAMBER R&D Biorefinery, Pol Aragonesas Ctra Calzada CR-503, Puertollano 13500, Spain; [Fernandez-Morales, Francisco Jesus] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Chem Engn Dept, ITQUIMA, Ave Camilo Jose Cela, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Fernández-Morales, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Chem Engn Dept, ITQUIMA, Ave Camilo Jose Cela, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain.",marta.arriagavalderas@geacam.com; franciscoj.pinar@geacam.com; irene.izarraperez@geacam.com; jesus.delamoleon@geacam.com; javier.vicentehernandez@geacam.com; fcojesus.fmorales@uclm.es; javier.mena@geacam.com,"; Pinar Pérez, Francisco Javier/M-7154-2015; Fernandez Morales, Francisco Jesus/I-7053-2015","Mena Sanz, Javier/0000-0003-3194-1287; Arriaga Valderas, Marta/0009-0008-0744-0320; Izarra, Irene/0000-0002-9166-2522; Vicente Hernández, Javier/0009-0001-9925-6860; Pinar Pérez, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-1555-6920; del Amo, Jesus/0000-0002-1960-9014; Fernandez Morales, Francisco Jesus/0000-0003-0389-6247",European Commission; [101157239],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre);,The authors would like to thank the European Commission for supporting this work by the Circular Bio-based Joint Undertaking through the project PROMOFER (Grant Agreement Number 101157239).,253,10,12,14,33,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Background: Simulation-based learning is widely used in nursing education to enhance clinical decision-making. Mannequin-based simulation has been the standard, as emerging virtual simulation technologies offer new opportunities for experiential learning. However, the comparative effectiveness of these approaches in preparing students for clinical deterioration remains unclear. Design: Systematic review and narrative synthesis on the outcomes of using mannequin-based and virtual simulation among undergraduate nursing students in the context of clinical deterioration were conducted. Methods: A comprehensive search was performed following PRISMA guidelines across multiple databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Series and ProQuest. The focus included quantitative studies, such as randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental trials from 2013 to 2023, that compared virtual simulation to other simulation methods. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool and a narrative synthesis was conducted. Results: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The notable advantages of using virtual simulation include improved clinical performance, enhanced assessment, increased adaptability for larger group practice and knowledge retention. However, limitations included the absence of immediate debriefing, reduced realism and technological challenges that impacted virtual simulation. Conclusion: This review highlights the strengths of mannequin-based and virtual simulation methods in clinical deterioration management, with marked differential outcomes in realism and anxiety among undergraduate nursing students.","[Rajasekaran, Rajarajeswari; Zhao, Lin; Cleary, Sonja; Harland, James] RMIT Univ, 124 La Trobe St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Rajasekaran, Rajarajeswari] Swinburne Univ Technol, Melbourne, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Swinburne University of Technology,"Rajasekaran, R (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, 124 La Trobe St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",rrajasekaran@swin.edu.au,"; Harland, James/G-5924-2015; Cleary, Sonja/Q-8546-2019","Rajasekaran, Raje/0009-0007-0981-0252; Harland, James/0000-0001-8640-5137;",,,,64,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",1471-5953,1873-5223,NURSE EDUC PRACT,Nurse Educ.

However, despite initial market enthusiasm, PBMAs struggle with declining consumer acceptance due to their inability to fully replicate the texture, juiciness, and sensory experience of animal-derived meat. Key limitations include insufficient fibrous structure, reduced tenderness, poor moisture retention during cooking, inadequate lipid distribution mimicking marbling, and unsatisfactory mouthfeel. Addressing these challenges is critical for advancing PBMA development and securing long-term market success. Unlike most reviews that broadly examine PBMA, this review specifically explores the role of processing technologies and equipment designs in enhancing meat-like properties. In this review, we have analyzed the commonly used technique for creating PBMA, the high-moisture extrusion (HME), detailing its mechanisms, equipment configurations, and processing parameters. It also briefly covers some other techniques for creating fibrous structures. Furthermore, the critical interplay between equipment parameters, ingredient properties, and final product characteristics, considering factors such as die design, shear force, moisture content, temperature control, and gas incorporation, is also covered. Moreover, we highlight major technical challenges, including scalability, cost-effective production, molecular interactions during processing, and consumer-perceived authenticity. Finally, we propose future directions for refining processing techniques, innovating equipment designs, and overcoming commercialization barriers.

Conventional wastewater treatment processes remove microplastics at various levels from physical removal (primary), biological degradation (secondary), and contaminant-specific removal (tertiary treatment). Nature-based solutions (NbSs) offer an ecologically friendly alternative that utilizes nature to remove microplastics from wastewater. Recent reviews either focus broadly on NBSs for wastewater, technological solutions for microplastics, or NbSs for microplastics, but rarely connect them systematically. This review presents an integrated review of the sources and impacts of microplastic pollution, NbS technologies for the removal of microplastics, challenges and prospects in utilizing NbSs, and the knowledge gaps. Primary sources of microplastics are intentionally produced at microscopic sizes, while secondary sources originate from the disintegration of larger plastic debris. Among the NbS technologies are constructed wetlands (horizontal subsurface flow, vertical flow, surface flow, microbial fuel cells, multistage) with up to 100% efficiency; green infrastructures (bioretention systems, green walls, permeable pavements, retention ponds) with up to 99% efficiency; macrophytes and microphytes with up to 94% microplastic removal rate. Despite the ecosystem services provided by NbSs, they are challenged by the decrease in efficiency in removing other contaminants, detection and evaluation of NbS performance, and non-technical factors (operations and maintenance, public acceptance, climate risks, and financing). The findings present insights on further research and policy recommendations aimed at facilitating the integration of NbSs into existing frameworks for the removal of microplastics from wastewater, promoting research and innovation, and ensuring sustainable practices for sustainable management of water resources.","[Agaton, Casper Boongaling] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Human Ecol, Dept Community & Environm Resource Planning, Los Banos 4031, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Agaton, CB (corresponding author), Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Human Ecol, Dept Community & Environm Resource Planning, Los Banos 4031, Philippines.",cbagaton@up.edu.ph,"Agaton, Casper Boongaling/V-6741-2017","Agaton, Casper Boongaling/0000-0003-1153-262X",TULIP project; Planetary Health Cluster; European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program [101136659],TULIP project; Planetary Health Cluster; European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program,"This study was funded by the TULIP project (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101136659, accessed on 12 November 2025), which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program under Grant Agreement No. 101136659 and is part of the Planetary Health Cluster (https://planetaryhealthcluster.eu/, accessed on 12 November 2025).",124,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2673-8929,MICROPLASTICS-BASEL,Microplastics,DEC 16,2025,4.0,4,,,,,,107,10.3390/microplastics4040107,0.0,,23,Environmental Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AF6PN,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001647004300001,0

Beyond their novelty as alternatives to grape-based wines, these products are attracting increasing attention due to their compositional diversity and potential contributions to health-promoting diets. This review provides a comprehensive and critical synthesis of current knowledge on red berry wines, covering the chemical composition of major berry species, fermentation dynamics, and technological advances aimed at improving phenolic stability, color retention, and aroma complexity. Special emphasis is placed on vinification strategies such as cold maceration, enzyme-assisted extraction, non-Saccharomyces yeasts, immobilized-cell systems, and nonthermal processing methods, as well as on the integration of advanced analytical tools (e.g., FTIR, gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry [GC-IMS], proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight MS [PTR-ToF-MS], and electronic noses) with multivariate modeling for real-time monitoring and quality assurance. In addition to technological progress, the review critically examines challenges related to microbiological stability, food safety, and regulatory frameworks, which are crucial for consumer protection and market positioning. Sustainability aspects, including efficient use of raw materials and valorization of by-products, are also addressed as central issues for the future of berry wine production. By integrating compositional, technological, safety, and sustainability dimensions, this review outlines opportunities, identifies research gaps, and provides a holistic perspective on the potential of red berry wines within the global food and beverage sector.","[Alvarez-Suarez, Jose M.] Univ San Francisco Quito USFQ, Colegio Ciencias & Ingn, Dept Ingn Alimentos, Lab Invest Ingn Alimentos LabInAli, Quito, Ecuador; [Alvarez-Suarez, Jose M.] Univ San Francisco Quito USFQ, Colegio Ciencias Biol & Ambientales, Lab Bioexplorac, Quito, Ecuador; [Tejera, Eduardo] Univ Amer UDLA, Grp Bioquimioinformat, Quito, Ecuador; [Tejera, Eduardo] Univ Amer UDLA, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Quito, Ecuador; [Gonzalez-Paramas, Ana M.; Santos-Buelga, Celestino] Univ Salamanca, Grp Invest Polifenoles, Campus Miguel De Unamuno, Salamanca, Spain; [Gonzalez-Paramas, Ana M.; Santos-Buelga, Celestino] Univ Salamanca, Res Unit Excellence Agr Prod & Environm Agrienviro, Salamanca, Spain",Universidad San Francisco de Quito; Universidad San Francisco de Quito; Universidad de Las Americas - Ecuador; Universidad de Las Americas - Ecuador; University of Salamanca; University of Salamanca,"Alvarez-Suárez, JM (corresponding author), Univ San Francisco Quito USFQ, Colegio Ciencias & Ingn, Dept Ingn Alimentos, Lab Invest Ingn Alimentos LabInAli, Quito, Ecuador.;Alvarez-Suárez, JM (corresponding author), Univ San Francisco Quito USFQ, Colegio Ciencias Biol & Ambientales, Lab Bioexplorac, Quito, Ecuador.;Santos-Buelga, C (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Grp Invest Polifenoles, Campus Miguel De Unamuno, Salamanca, Spain.;Santos-Buelga, C (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Res Unit Excellence Agr Prod & Environm Agrienviro, Salamanca, Spain.",jalvarez@usfq.edu.ec; csb@usal.es,"Santos-Buelga, Celestino/A-1071-2008; González-Paramás, Ana/D-2229-2011; Alvarez-Suarez, Jose/M-7160-2014",,"Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ) through a community engagement project [12484]; Escalera de Excelencia [CLU-2025-2-04]; Castilla y Leon 2021-2027 Operational Program (FEDER), Spain","Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ) through a community engagement project; Escalera de Excelencia; Castilla y Leon 2021-2027 Operational Program (FEDER), Spain","This work was supported by the Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ) through a community engagement project (Project ID: 12484) awarded to Jose Miguel Alvarez-Suarez.

For the development of sustainable food systems and climate-resilient crops, seed biopriming with beneficial microbes is gaining increased recognition, attributed to their favorable impact on plant growth, nutrient acquisition, and defense against pathogens. 'Seed primeomics' is a key concept in seed priming, and emphasizes the retention of stress memories, transgenerational microbial interactions, and plant stress resilience, as demonstrated by Trichoderma harzianum modulation of epigenetics in Lycopersicum esculentum roots. With an expanding scope, next-generation breakthroughs in nano-enabled seed biopriming can potentially address concerns associated with the performance and efficacy of the bio-inoculants in field conditions, as evident by ZnO nanopriming in fragrant rice, resulting in micro-nutrient fortified crops. Furthermore, encapsulation of microbial inoculants with nano-based polymers promotes plant development, while the nanoencapsulation procedure safeguards microbial strains and promotes shelf-life and controlled release, addressing key limitations with commercial applications. While the prospects of seed biopriming are immense and define novel avenues in sustainable agricultural practices, further research is essential to bridge the knowledge gaps. Herein, the article provides insights into how endophyte-mediated seed biopriming, as a potent and cost-effective green technology, is defining new avenues in ecosystem restoration, plant stress tolerance and adaptation, and the creation of climate-resilient crops capable of tolerating fluctuating climates, marking a new era in climate-smart agriculture.","[Tiwari, Pragya; Park, Kyeung-Il] Yeungnam Univ, Dept Hort & Life Sci, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea; [Adil, Muhammad] Univ Vet & Anim Sci, Pharmacol & Toxicol Sect, Jhang Campus, Lahore 35200, Jhang, Pakistan",Yeungnam University; University of Veterinary & Animal Science - Pakistan,"Tiwari, P (corresponding author), Yeungnam Univ, Dept Hort & Life Sci, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea.",pragyatiwari@ynu.ac.kr,"; Tiwari, Pragya/ADK-6021-2022","Adil, Muhammad/0000-0002-3772-0269; Tiwari, Pragya/0000-0001-7602-2562",,,,153,1,2,15,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0959-3993,1573-0972,WORLD J MICROB BIOT,World J.

This affords the possibility of implementing vision restoration techniques, where light signaling is restored to spared retinal circuitry to recreate vision. There are far more AMD patients (Wong et al., 2014), yet more resources have been put towards researching and developing vision restoration strategies for RP despite it rarity, because of the tractability of RP disease models. The hope is that these therapies will extend to the AMD population, however, many questions remain about how the implementation of prosthetic or optogenetic vision restoration technologies will translate between RP and AMD patients.

We first introduce background knowledge about image shadow removal, providing detailed explanations of both physics-based and learning-based shadow removal methods. We analyze and compare these algorithms from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives, reassessing all models that provided open-source result sets according to uniform criteria. Additionally, we introduce commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics in the field.

To date, among many solutions, the circular economy is the one prevailing. A successful transition toward a circular economy (CE) requires the food sector to overcome the challenges of today's complex food supply chains such as information asymmetry, poor cooperation among stakeholders, and concerns about food safety. Blockchain, a form of distributed ledger technology, has been progressively gaining traction in supply chains in areas like data management, certifying product provenance and tracking products. Despite its importance, knowledge around the potential of the blockchain technology in facilitating the transition towards a circular economy in the agri-food sector is fragmented. This review provides evidence-based insights into the blockchain implementations in the food supply chains and the implications for CE.

This paper addresses this gap by conducting a systematic literature review to investigate FFH risk factors and the use of technologies to prevent falls from heights on construction sites. The review analyzed 94 research articles published between 2002 and 2022 and identified the most common FFH hazards, including missing guardrails, lack of personal protective equipment, lack of knowledge and training, loss of balance and unsafe behavior, violation of safety rules, and poor site management.

This momentum stems from the increasing knowledge regarding the epigenetic factors and networks underlying cell physiology and disease etiology and from the growing realization that genome editing principles involving chromosomal breaks generated by programmable nucleases are prone to unpredictable genetic changes and outcomes. Hence, engineered CRISPR systems are serving as versatile DNA-targeting scaffolds for heterologous and synthetic effector domains that, via locally recruiting transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes, seek interfering with loss-of-function and gain-of-function processes underlying recessive and dominant disorders, respectively. Here, after providing an overview about epigenetic drugs and CRISPRCas-based activation and interference platforms, we cover the testing of these platforms in the context of molecular therapies for muscular dystrophies.

This paper presents a systematic review of recent advances in addressing these challenges, with a focus on three core aspects: environmental robustness, data efficiency, and model deployment. The study identifies that attention mechanisms, Transformers, multi-scale feature fusion, and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness under complex conditions. Self-supervised learning, transfer learning, GAN-based data augmentation, SMOTE improvements, and Focal loss optimization effectively alleviate data limitations. Furthermore, model compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation facilitate efficient deployment. Future research should emphasize multi-modal fusion, causal reasoning, edge-cloud collaboration, and dedicated hardware acceleration. Integrating agricultural expertise with AI is essential for promoting large-scale adoption, as well as achieving intelligent, sustainable agricultural systems.","[Song, Xuehua; Yan, Letian; Liu, Sihan; Gao, Tong; Han, Li; Jiang, Xiaoming; Jin, Hua; Zhu, Yi] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Comp Sci & Commun Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China",Jiangsu University,"Zhu, Y (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Comp Sci & Commun Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China.",yufeng1526138@163.com; 18678396526@163.com; jinhua@ujs.edu.cn; zhuyi@ujs.edu.cn,,,Jiangsu University; [JSU-JSJ-2025010],Jiangsu University;,This research was funded by Jiangsu University grant number JSU-JSJ-2025010.,132,4,4,9,9,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Additive manufacturing processes hold immense potential for fabricating intricate and complex geometries across diverse applications and material classes. From a quality assurance standpoint, appropriate modeling of process-structure-property relationships of additive manufacturing processes using either physics-based or machine learning (ML)-based approaches has been a topic of intensive research. As an example, ML of data acquired from in-situ sensors is related to flaw formation, e.g., porosity, cracking, or deformation. In recent years, the computational burden of pure physicsbased models, the large data set requirement, and their black-box nature, i.e., the lack of interpretability of ML models, have prompted researchers to turn to PIML models. In PIML models, physical insights of the additive manufacturing process gained from various means are integrated with ML models, resulting in a more robust and interpretable framework for both process and microstructure evolution. A key delineator is the source of physical knowledge to be fused into PIML models, which can be obtained either from governing physical equations, datacentric feature extraction without implementing any physical equations, or a hybrid of the two foregoing. Within this review, we stratify PIML models based on the method used for the fusion of physical knowledge to ML models, into three categories, namely: (i) physics-based feature engineering, (ii) physics-based architecture shaping of ML models, and (iii) physics-based modification of the loss function of the ML models. For each of these categories, we further delineate the source of physical knowledge, ML models, integration approach, and data-set requirement, among others. A comparative analysis of the reviewed studies is presented and critically discussed, while the potential research gaps, along with future research directions on developing PIML models for different AM technologies are outlined.","[Faegh, Meysam; Ghungrad, Suyog; Haghighi, Azadeh] Univ Illinois, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Oliveira, Joao Pedro] Univ NOVA Lisboa, NOVA Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci, CENIMAT I3N, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Rao, Prahalada] Virginia Tech, Grad Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Haghighi, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",ahaghi3@uic.edu,"; Faegh, Meysam/AAD-8628-2021; Oliveira, Joao/KTI-4498-2024","Rao, Prahalada/0000-0002-9642-622X; Haghighi, Azadeh/0000-0001-5382-5944;","National Science Foundation (NSF) [OIA-1929172, PFI-TT 2322322/2044710, CMMI-1920245, ECCS-2020246, CMMI-1739696, CMMI-1719388]; FCT- Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P.

USH is the most common cause of deaf blindness. USH is divided clinically into three subtypes-USH1, USH2, and USH3-based on symptom severity, progression, and age of onset. The underlying genetics of these USH forms are, however, significantly more complex, with over a dozen genes linked to the three primary clinical subtypes and other atypical USH phenotypes. Several of these genes are associated with other deaf-blindness syndromes that share significant clinical overlap with USH, pointing to the limits of a clinically based classification system. The genotype-phenotype relationships among USH forms also may vary significantly based on the location and type of mutation in the gene of interest. Understanding these genotype-phenotype relationships and associated natural disease histories is necessary for the successful development and application of gene-based therapies and precision medicine approaches to USH. Currently, the state of knowledge varies widely depending on the gene of interest. Recent studies utilizing next-generation sequencing technology have expanded the list of known pathogenic mutations in USH genes, identified new genes associated with USH-like phenotypes, and proposed algorithms to predict the phenotypic effects of specific categories of allelic variants. Further work is required to validate USH gene causality, and better define USH genotype-phenotype relationships and disease natural histories-particularly for rare mutations-to lay the groundwork for the future of USH treatment.","[Nisenbaum, Eric; Thielhelm, Torin P.; Nourbakhsh, Aida; Yan, Denise; Blanton, Susan H.; Liu, Xuezhong] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Blanton, Susan H.; Liu, Xuezhong] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Dr John T Macdonald Fdn, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Blanton, Susan H.; Liu, Xuezhong] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, John P Hussman Inst Human Genom, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Shu, Yilai] Fudan Univ, ENT Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Shu, Yilai] Fudan Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Otorhinolaryngol Dept, Affiliated Eye & ENT Hosp,State Key Lab Med Neuro, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Koehler, Karl R.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston Childrens Hosp, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [El-Amraoui, Aziz] Sorbonne Univ, Inst Pasteur, Inst Audit, Unit Progress Sensory Disorders,INSERM UMRS1120, Paris, France; [Chen, Zhengyi] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Otolaryngol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chen, Zhengyi] Harvard Med Sch, Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chen, Zhengyi] Eaton Peabody Lab, Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirm, Boston, MA USA; [Nisenbaum, Eric; Thielhelm, Torin P.; Nourbakhsh, Aida; Yan, Denise; Blanton, Susan H.; Lam, Byron L.; Liu, Xuezhong] Univ Miami, Sch Med, Bascom Palmer Eye Inst, Miami, FL USA",University of Miami; University of Miami; University of Miami; Fudan University; Fudan University; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Boston Children's Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Pasteur Network; Universite Paris Cite; Institut Pasteur Paris; Sorbonne Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirmary; University of Miami; Bascom Palmer Eye Institute,"Liu, XZ (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Otolaryngol, Miller Sch Med, 1120 NW 14th St,5th Floor, Miami, FL 33136 USA.",x.liu1@med.miami.edu,"; Blanton, Susan/ABF-1323-2021","EL-AMRAOUI, Aziz/0000-0003-2692-4984; Shu, Yilai/0000-0001-8893-434X","NIH [R01DC005575, R01DC012115, T32 DC015995]; National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01DC005575, R01DC012115, T32DC015995] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)),"X.L.'s laboratory was supported by NIH grants of R01DC005575, R01DC012115.

The development of medical science and technology has led to the intro-duction of new, increasingly sophisticated methods for early diagnosis of these diseases - the electrophysiological studies have become more complex and informative. Together with computer automated perimetry, optical coherence tomography (OCT), angio-OCT, fluorescein angiography (FA), fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and adaptive optics, they allow very accurate topographical localization of the defect. And along with the advances in genetics, optogenetics, molecular biology, retinal biochemistry and regenerative medicine, they provide a better understanding of the mechanism of these diseases and increase the therapeutic opportunities. The treatment of many of these diseases is still problematic, but because most of them are severely disabling the individual, the scientists' efforts are focused on finding an appropriate therapy. For many of these diseases, there are clinical trials worldwide, the results of some of them are quite encouraging, and many effective therapies for these currently incurable diseases are expected to be introduced in the near future. The purpose of this study is to analyze the scientific knowledge, as well as the therapeutic opportunities that are being experimented to date.","[Mermeklieva, Elena] Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Med Fac, Lozenetz Univ Hosp, Clin Ophthalmol, 1 Kozyak St, Sofia 1407, Bulgaria",University of Sofia; Medical University Sofia,"Mermeklieva, E (corresponding author), Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Med Fac, Lozenetz Univ Hosp, Clin Ophthalmol, 1 Kozyak St, Sofia 1407, Bulgaria.",elenamermeklieva@yahoo.com,"Mermeklieva, Elena/AAN-1113-2021",,,,,57,0,0,0,4,PUBL HOUSE BULGARIAN ACAD SCI,SOFIA,"ACADEMICIAN G BONCEV ST, 1113 SOFIA, BULGARIA",1310-1331,,CR ACAD BULG SCI,C.

Smartphones play a crucial role in addressing various accessibility challenges, including voice recognition, sign language detection and interpretation, navigation systems, speech-to-text conversion, and vice versa, among others. They are computationally powerful enough to handle and run numerous machine and deep learning applications. Among various accessibility challenges, speech disorders represent a disability where individuals struggle to communicate verbally. Similarly, hearing loss is a disability that impairs an individual's ability to hear, necessitating reliance on gestures for communication. A significant challenge encountered by people with speech disorders, hearing loss, or both is their inability to effectively convey or receive messages from others. Hence, these individuals heavily depend on the sign language (a gesture-based communication) method, typically involving hand movements and expressions. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no comprehensive review and/or survey articles available that cover the literature on speech disabilities and sign language detection and interpretation via smartphones utilizing machine learning and/or deep learning approaches. This study fills the gap in the literature by analyzing research publications on speech disabilities, published from 2012 to July 2023. A rigorous search and standard strategy for formulating the literature along with a well-defined theoretical framework for results and findings have been used.

The main neuropathological changes in AD mainly include amyloid plaque deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, synapse loss, and neuron reduction. However, the current anti-AD drugs do not demonstrate a favorable effect in altering the pathological course of AD. Moreover, long-term use of these drugs is usually accompanied with various side effects. Ginsenosides are the major active constituents of ginseng and have protective effects on AD through various mechanisms in both in vivo and in vitro studies. In this review, we focused on discussing the therapeutic potential effects and the mechanisms of pharmacological activities of ginsenosides in AD, to provide new insight for further research and clinical application of ginsenosides in the future. Recent studies on the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of ginsenosides were retrieved from Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, National Science and Technology Library, Wanfang Data, Elsevier, ScienceDirect, PubMed, SpringerLink, and the Web of Science database up to April 2023 using relevant keywords. Network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis were used to predict the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of ginsenosides against AD. Ginsenosides presented a wide range of therapeutic and biological activities, including alleviating A beta deposition, decreasing tau hyperphosphorylation, regulating the cholinergic system, resisting oxidative stress, modulating Ca2+ homeostasis, as well as anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis in neurons, respectively. For further developing the therapeutic potential as well as clinical applications, the network pharmacology approach was combined with a summary of published studies.","[He, Shan; Zhang, Ping; Li, Hao] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Wangjing Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shi, Junhe; Ma, Lina; Pei, Hui; Shi, Dazhuo] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Xiyuan Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chai, Hua] Hepingli Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shi, Dazhuo] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Xiyuan Hosp, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China","Wang Jing Hospital, CACMS; China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences; China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences; Xiyuan Hospital, CACMS; Xiyuan Hospital, CACMS; China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences","Li, H (corresponding author), China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Wangjing Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Shi, DZ (corresponding author), China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Xiyuan Hosp, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",shidztcm@163.com; xyhplihao1965@126.com,"He, Shan/KMA-0748-2024","He, Shan/0000-0002-0321-8975","National Key R & D Program of China [2022YFC3501400]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [82205233]; China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences [CI2021A01401, CI2021A01403, CI2021A01404]",National Key R & D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"Acknowledgements This work was supported by the National Key R & D Program of China (2022YFC3501400) ; National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 82205233) , and China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (no.

This planned update reconsiders the GLIM framework based on published knowledge and experience over the past 5 years.MethodsA working group (n = 43 members) conducted a literature search spanning 2019-2024 using the keywords Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition or GLIM. Prior GLIM guidance activities for using the criteria on muscle mass and inflammation were reviewed. Successive rounds of revision and review were used to achieve consensus.ResultsMore than 400 scientific reports were published in peer-reviewed journals, forming the basis of 10 systematic reviews, some including meta-analyses of GLIM validity that indicate strong construct and predictive validity. Limitations and future priorities are discussed. Working group findings suggest that assessment of low muscle mass should be guided by experience and available technological resources. Clinical judgment may suffice to evaluate the inflammation/disease burden etiologic criterion. No revisions of the weight loss, low BMI, or reduced food intake/assimilation criteria are suggested. After two rounds of review and revision, the working group secured 100% agreement with the conclusions reported in the 5-year update.ConclusionOngoing initiatives target priorities that include malnutrition risk screening procedures, GLIM adaptation to the intensive care setting, assessment in support of the reduced food intake/assimilation criterion, and determination of malnutrition in obesity.","[Jensen, Gordon L.] Univ Vermont, Larner Coll Med, Deans Off, 89 Beaumont Ave, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Jensen, Gordon L.] Univ Vermont, Larner Coll Med, Dept Med, 89 Beaumont Ave, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Cederholm, Tommy] Uppsala Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Caring Sci Clin Nutr & Metab, Uppsala, Sweden; [Cederholm, Tommy] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Theme Inflammat & Aging, Stockholm, Sweden; [Correia, M.

Across the globe and specifically in India, with the advent of the green revolution, the need for synthetic N fertilizers increased exponentially with the crop production trends. But, applying an enormous volume of N fertilizers has boundless pessimistic impacts, and cutting-edge technologies such as enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizers (EENFs) are an upstanding approach. The EENFs (limited release and balanced urea-based N fertilizers) have synchronized release of N as per crop need leading to enhanced efficacy and lessening the losses in contrast to conventional urea. EENFs with substantiating enhanced efficiency is emerging as intelligent formulations compared to an appropriate reference in reducing the probable nutrient losses to the surroundings by regulating the momentum of release or soil fertilizer transformation dynamics. The augmented expenditure of more frequently used soluble N fertilizers improved crop performance; the speed of environmental impairment related to N application prompted us for EENFs. This manuscript has outlined EENFs with a particular emphasis on constituent, its classification schemes and the mode of action implicated in N release, soil factors affecting its efficient use, and delineation of the performance of EENFs on crop productivity under varied agroecosystems in greater detail. In a nutshell, it can be said that EENFs could be an effective strategy to mitigate environmental degradation while sustaining crop yield. Still, their judicious use warrants exclusion of any fertilizer mismanagement, addiction, and implementing knowledge-based N management practices.","[Suman, Jarupula; Rakshit, Amitava; Patra, Abhik] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Patra, Abhik] Krishi Vigyan Kendra, West Champaran 845455, India; [Dutta, Asik] ICAR Indian Inst Pulse Res, Crop Prod Div, Kanpur 208024, India; [Tripathi, Vinod Kumar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Farm Engn, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mohapatra, Kiran Kumar] Odisha Univ Agr & Technol, Coll Agr, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Chem, Bhubaneswar 751003, Odisha, India; [Tiwari, Rudramani; Krishnamoorthi, S.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Institute of Pulses Research; Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Orissa University of Agriculture & Technology; Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Suman, J; Rakshit, A (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Agr Sci, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Chem, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",jarupulajnkvv@gmail.com; amitavar@bhu.ac.in; abhik.patra1@bhu.ac.in; asikdutta975@gmail.com; vktripathi@bhu.ac.in; Kiran90mohapatra@gmail.com; tiwarirudramani9@gmail.com; skmoorthi@gmail.com,"Tripathi, Vinod/AAB-1388-2019; PATRA, ABHIK/ABE-2139-2021; Rakshit, Amitava/E-3080-2015","Suman, Jarupula/0000-0003-1039-566X; MOHAPATRA, KIRAN KUMAR/0000-0002-4129-0396; TIWARI, RUAMANI/0000-0002-4718-2126",,,,121,19,21,8,69,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0718-9508,0718-9516,J SOIL SCI PLANT NUT,J.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by inflammation and destruction of bone and cartilage in affected joints. Autoimmune responses lead to increased osteoclastic bone resorption and impaired osteoblastic bone formation, the imbalance of which underlies bone loss in RA, which includes bone erosion, periarticular bone loss and systemic osteoporosis. The crucial role of osteoclasts in bone erosion has been demonstrated in basic studies as well as by the clinical efficacy of antibodies targeting RANKL, an important mediator of osteoclastogenesis. Synovial fibroblasts contribute to joint damage by stimulating both pro-inflammatory and tissue-destructive pathways. New technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, have revealed the heterogeneity of synovial fibroblasts and of immune cells including T cells and macrophages. To understand the mechanisms of bone damage in RA, it is important to clarify how the immune system promotes the tissue-destructive properties of synovial fibroblasts and influences bone cells. The interaction between immune cells and fibroblasts underlies the imbalance between regulatory T cells and T helper 17 cells, which in turn exacerbates not only inflammation but also bone destruction, mainly by promoting RANKL expression on synovial fibroblasts. An improved understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying joint damage and the interplay between the immune system, synovial fibroblasts and bone will contribute to the identification of novel therapeutic targets in RA.","[Takayanagi, Hiroshi] Univ Tokyo, Dept Immunol, Grad Sch Med, Tokyo, Japan; Univ Tokyo, Fac Med, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Takayanagi, H (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Immunol, Grad Sch Med, Tokyo, Japan.",takayana@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22H02844, 22F22108, 23K24106, 21H05046, 21K18254] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,155,387,416,31,301,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1759-4790,1759-4804,NAT REV RHEUMATOL,Nat.

Asian elephants face significant survival threats including habitat loss and captivity-based exploitation, with approximately 15,000 individuals in captivity across their range countries. Effective conservation strategies require a deep understanding of captive elephant management and welfare issues. Through a systematic review of 63 peer-reviewed articles from 2014-2024, spanning disciplines including animal welfare science, conservation biology, and veterinary medicine, this study identifies critical trends and knowledge gaps. Bibliometric analysis revealed two distinct research clusters with minimal overlap: elephant welfare/management studies and computational approaches. Thailand, particularly Chiang Mai University, emerged as a key research hub with strong international collaborations. Research output has increased significantly since 2016, with a notable acceleration around 2020. Thematic analysis identified concerning shifts in mahout demographics, with younger, less experienced individuals replacing traditional mahouts, compromising vital knowledge transmission. Tourism significantly impacts elephant welfare, with 82% of surveyed Thai camps chaining elephants for extended periods. Health concerns include tuberculosis, with seroprevalence reaching 36% in some populations. Research gaps include limited studies on long-term training effects, elephant psychology, rewilding outcomes, and technological applications in welfare assessment. This review highlights the need for interdisciplinary approaches targeting both elephant and human welfare, emphasizing collaborative efforts among mahouts, local communities, researchers, and conservation agencies to ensure sustainable Asian elephant conservation. The findings and recommendations provide a framework for evidence-based management strategies at the Theppakadu Elephant Camp in the Nilgiris and other similar facilities.","[Palanivelan, Jaisridhar] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Indian Council Agr Res ICAR Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Dept Agr Extens, Nilgiris, India; [Nagarajan, Hariraj] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Dept Agr Extens & Rural Sociol, Coimbatore, India; [Fernandaz, Cinthia; Manivasagam, Senthilkumar] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Directorate Extens Educ, Coimbatore, India; [Jasimudeen, S.] St Stephens Coll, Kollam, Kerala, India; [Rajagopal, Shanmugam; Raja, P.; Bhojan, Vinothkumar; Manivasakan, S.] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Expt Stn, ICAR Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Nilgiris, India",Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; Saint Stephens College Pathanapuram; Tamil Nadu Agricultural University,"Palanivelan, J (corresponding author), Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Indian Council Agr Res ICAR Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Dept Agr Extens, Nilgiris, India.",jaisridhar@tnau.ac.in,"Jasimudeen, S/D-1205-2014",,,,,44,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2673-6225,FRONT ANIM SCI,Front.

Historically, paediatric surgery has been an overlooked sector, especially in low-and-middle-income countries in Africa. However, recent years have seen considerable progress. Collaborative efforts such as the Global Initiative for Children's Surgery, and the formation of the Pan African Paediatric Surgery Association, the College of Surgeons of East, Central and Southern Africa and the West African College of Surgeons have facilitated knowledge sharing, collaboration, and advocacy for enhancing surgical standards. Local training programmes, including Master of Medicine programmes and fellowships, have been instrumental in building a skilled workforce. These initiatives have been complemented by infrastructural developments through non-governmental organisations like Kids Operating Room, which have expanded access to paediatric surgical care. Technological advancements, particularly in telemedicine, have further enhanced accessibility. Task-sharing strategies, where non-specialist physicians are trained in paediatric surgical skills, have also been utilised to address the shortage of specialised surgeons. Research in paediatric surgery has experienced an upswing, with local health professionals taking the lead. Research has been crucial for understanding the epidemiology of paediatric surgical conditions, and developing prevention strategies, and is increasingly leading to the inclusion of paediatric surgery in national health plans. Despite the progress, challenges remain, including the need for sustainable funding, continued investment in infrastructure, and training and retention of healthcare professionals. The review emphasises the importance of ongoing efforts in community engagement, innovative technologies, and health systems strengthening for the sustainable development of paediatric surgical services in Africa.","[Bandyopadhyay, Soham; Lakhoo, Kokila] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Surg Sci, Med Sci Div, Global Surg Grp, Oxford, England; [Philipo, Godfrey Sama] Coll Surg East Cent & Southern Africa, Arusha, Tanzania; [Philipo, Godfrey Sama] Univ British Columbia, Branch Global Surg Care, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Bokhary, Zaitun Mohamed; Lakhoo, Kokila] Muhimbili Natl Hosp, Dept Surg, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Bokhary, Zaitun Mohamed; Lakhoo, Kokila] Muhimbili Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, Dept Surg, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",University of Oxford; University of British Columbia; Muhimbili University of Health & Allied Sciences,"Bandyopadhyay, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Surg Sci, Med Sci Div, Global Surg Grp, Oxford, England.",Soham.bandyopadhyay@yahoo.co.uk; godfreysama2@yahoo.com; zaitunsanya2005@gmail.com; kokila.lakhoo@nds.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,81,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0179-0358,1437-9813,PEDIATR SURG INT,Pediatr.

Thanks to the development of modern materials engineering, solid supports for catalytic phases having a highly developed surface are available. Recently, continuous-flow synthesis started to be a key technology in the synthesis of high added value chemicals. These processes are more efficient, sustainable, safer and cheaper to operate. The most promising is the use of heterogeneous catalyst with column-type fixed-bed reactors. The advantages of the use of heterogeneous catalyst in continuous flow reactors are the physical separation of product and catalyst, as well as the reduction in inactivation and loss of the catalyst. However, the state-of-the-art use of heterogeneous catalysts in flow systems compared to homogenous ones remains still open. The lifetime of heterogeneous catalysts remains a significant hurdle to realise sustainable flow synthesis.

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, the Web of Science Core Collection, Chinese Biomedical Literature, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Digital Periodicals, and Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals were searched from their inception to February 2021. Randomized controlled trials and retrospective or prospective cohort studies (CSs) comparing OLIF and TLIF for DLS were included. A meta-analysis was conducted, if possible. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in the statistical analysis. The pooled results of the CSs showed no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) in pain relief at 3 or 6 months of follow-up and functional improvement at 1 or 3 months of follow-up in DLS patients between those who had undergone OLIF versus TLIF. The pooled results of the CSs showed that OLIF could significantly improve the degree of lumbar lordosis, foraminal height, and disc height and decrease the intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage volume, operative duration, bed rest time, and hospital length of stay (P < 0.05) compared with TLIF. The incidence of adverse events was not significantly different statistically between OLIF and TLIF. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the present study suggest that pain relief and functional improvement were not significantly different between OLIF and TLIF. Nevertheless, the use of OLIF might improve radiological outcomes and reduce intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage volume, operative duration, bed rest duration, and hospital length of stay compared with TLIF. Additional high-quality randomized controlled trials are still required to confirm these findings.","[Liu, Ai-Feng; Guo, Tian-Ci; Chen, Ji-Xin; Yu, Wei-Jie; Feng, Hui-Chuan; Niu, Pu-Yu] Tianjin Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Teaching Hosp 1, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ai-Feng; Guo, Tian-Ci; Chen, Ji-Xin; Yu, Wei-Jie; Feng, Hui-Chuan; Niu, Pu-Yu] Tianjin Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Natl Clin Res Ctr Chinese Med Acupuncture & Adoxi, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Zhai, Jing-Bo] Tianjin Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Inst Tradit Chinese Med, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,"Zhai, JB (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Inst Tradit Chinese Med, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",zhaijingbo@foxmail.com,"; 汇川, 冯/JVN-1334-2024","陈, 继鑫/0000-0003-3309-1685; 冯, 汇川/0000-0003-0378-4819;",,,,29,12,13,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1878-8750,1878-8769,WORLD NEUROSURG,World Neurosurg.,FEB,2022,158.0,,,,,E964,E974,,10.1016/j.wneu.2021.11.127,0.0,FEB 2022,11,Clinical Neurology; Surgery,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery,0B0XP,34871803.0,,2026-02-03,WOS:000774367300101,0

Ginsenoside may be an ideal agent for UC treatment. However, its efficacy and safety are unknown. We aim to conduct a systematic evaluation to assess the effects and potential mechanisms of ginsenosides in animal models of UC.MethodsSix electronic databases will be searched (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China Knowledge Network (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (CQVIP), and Wanfang Data Knowledge). SYRCLE list will be used to assess the quality of literature, and STATA 15.1 for data analysis. Time-dose effects analysis will be used to reveal the time-dosage response relations between ginsenosides and UC.ResultsUltimately, fifteen studies involving 300 animals were included. Preliminary evidence was shown that ginsenosides could reduce Disease Activity Index (DAI) scores, weight loss, histological colitis score (HCS), spleen weight, Malondialdehyde (MDA), Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and increase colon length (CL), myeloperoxidase (GSH), interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 10 (IL-10), Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin. Results of time-dose interval analysis indicated that ginsenosides at a dosage of 5-200 mg/kg with an intervention time of 7-28 days were relatively effective.ConclusionsPreclinical evidence suggests that ginsenoside is a novel treatment for UC. And the mechanisms of ginsenosides in treating UC may involve anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, barrier protection, intestinal flora regulation, and immune regulation. Although, due to the high heterogeneity, further large-scale and high-quality preclinical studies are needed to examine the protection of ginsenosides against UC.","[Yuan, Lingling; Li, Wei; Hu, Shuangyuan; Wang, Yingyi; Wang, Shaofeng; Tian, Huai'e; Sun, Xuhui; Yang, Xuli; Hu, Mengyun; Zhang, Yi] Hosp Chengdu Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,"Zhang, Y (corresponding author), Hosp Chengdu Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",zhangyi2288@163.com,,"Yuan, L/0009-0009-3493-5756",National Natural Science Foundation of China,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),No Statement Available,79,2,3,2,11,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",0925-4692,1568-5608,INFLAMMOPHARMACOLOGY,Inflammopharmacology,OCT,2024,32.0,5,,,,3079,3098,,10.1007/s10787-024-01516-w,0.0,JUL 2024,20,Immunology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Toxicology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Immunology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Toxicology,G6S3X,38977646.0,,2026-02-03,WOS:001264569600001,0

Besides, using unwarranted amounts of agrochemicals to increase crop productivity often has the downside of unpreventable adverse environmental outcomes. Developed countries have acknowledged this issue and taken constructive steps to minimize ecological nightmares, but developing and underdeveloped economies have yet to address this challenge. More often, farmers' lack of knowledge and awareness about these hazardous chemicals has resulted in their overuse to tackle pre- and post-harvest losses. The use of agrochemicals has increased apparently due to their lower efficacy and loss related to degradation, leaching, pest resistance, etc. Thus, traditional pest-management practices must be reworked to ensure resilience and sustainability. The recent technological innovations in agronomy in terms of sustainable intensification (SI), integrated pest management (IPM), and the emergence of agro-nanotechnology offer plausible solutions providing viable alternatives without net environmental cost. The bulk of data available on the impact nanotechnology on agriculture holds promise for its future as a potential approach that could bring about paradigm shift in conventional crop production. In this framework, control release formulations (CRF) technology can emerge as one of the most valued innovations in modern agriculture. Existing pest management strategies could be improved with a better understanding of the pros and cons of the impact of CRFs on plant responses, including their uptake, localization, and activity. The primary goal of this review is to review the benefits and constraints of extant pest management systems and how CRF could be a possible alternative for wise pesticide usage to minimize health issues and the environment.","[Singh, Amrita; Shraogi, Nikita; Verma, Rahul; Saji, Joel; Kar, Aditya Kumar; Patnaik, Satyakam] CSIR Indian Inst Toxicol Res IITR, Nano Lab, FEST Div, Drug & Chem Toxicol Grp, 31 Mahatma Gandhi Marg, Lucknow 226001, UP, India; [Ghosh, Debabrata] CSIR Indian Inst Toxicol Res CSIR IITR, Immunotoxicol Lab, FEST Div, Syst Toxicol Grp, 31 Mahatma Gandhi Marg, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Amrita; Shraogi, Nikita; Verma, Rahul; Kar, Aditya Kumar; Ghosh, Debabrata; Patnaik, Satyakam] Acad Sci & Innovat Res AcSIR, Ghaziabad 201002, India; [Tehlan, Sarita] Univ Delhi, Motilal Nehru Coll, Dept Chem, Benito Juarez Marg, New Delhi 110021, India; [Kar, Aditya Kumar] Karolinska Inst, Care Sci & Soc, Div Clin Geriatr, Ctr Alzheimer Res,Dept Neurobiol, Huddinge, Sweden",Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR); Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR); Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR); University of Delhi; Karolinska Institutet,"Patnaik, S (corresponding author), CSIR Indian Inst Toxicol Res IITR, Nano Lab, FEST Div, Drug & Chem Toxicol Grp, 31 Mahatma Gandhi Marg, Lucknow 226001, UP, India.",satyakampatnaik@iitr.res.in,"Kar, Aditya/GLU-5509-2022; Saji, Joel/LTE-7077-2024; Verma, Rahul/AAA-6748-2022","Shraogi, Nikita/0000-0001-9319-9394; Saji, Joel/0000-0002-9566-0655; Singh, Amrita/0000-0002-8381-4741; Verma, Rahul/0000-0003-0242-8820; Ghosh, Debabrata/0000-0002-6571-304X",,,,293,29,30,10,32,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",1385-8947,1873-3212,CHEM ENG J,Chem.

Luminophores containing 4d or 5d metals are efficient in electro-luminescent devices due to their phosphorescent properties but are scarce and expensive. Alternatives take advantage of temperature-activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), e.g. in Cu(I) complexes. We show modern X-ray spectroscopy methods exemplified on Ru, Ir and Cu-based luminophores offering insight into the capabilities of such techniques to researchers from various fields. Knowledge of structural rearrangements in the excited state is crucial to understand non-radiative energy losses and to develop efficient luminophores. Pump-probe X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) gives information about the molecular structure in the excited state and the electronic structure. We show how this information can be complemented with X-ray emission spectroscopy at X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL) and discuss the potential of time-resolved X-ray excited optical luminescence (TR-XEOL) to provide additional selectivity of XAS to luminescent sites.","[Smolentsev, Grigory] Paul Scherrer Inst, Energy & Environm Res Div, Forschungsstr 111, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Vogt, Matthias] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Fak Nat Wissensch 2, Inst Chem, Kurt Mothes Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Smolentsev, G (corresponding author), Paul Scherrer Inst, Energy & Environm Res Div, Forschungsstr 111, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland.",grigory.smolentsev@psi.ch,"Smolentsev, Grigory/M-7845-2017; Vogt, Matthias/AAL-3602-2021","Smolentsev, Grigory/0000-0001-7348-7276; Vogt, Matthias/0000-0002-2636-2531",ETH-Bereich Forschungsanstalten,ETH-Bereich Forschungsanstalten,Open access funding provided by ETH-Bereich Forschungsanstalten.,117,4,4,3,49,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",2367-0932,,CHEMPHOTOCHEM,ChemPhotoChem,MAY,2022,6.0,5,,,,,,e202100180,10.1002/cptc.202100180,0.0,JAN 2022,12,"Chemistry, Physical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry,1I1XZ,,hybrid,2026-02-03,WOS:000741482800001,0

This paper presents an updated review of the literature on mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the context of gonadal tissue cryopreservation and transplantation.Abstract Advances in tissue preservation techniques have allowed reproductive medicine and assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) to flourish in recent years. Because radio- and chemotherapy procedures are often gonadotoxic, irreversible damage can preclude future gamete production and endocrine support. Accordingly, in recent years, the freezing and storage of gonadal tissue fragments prior to the first oncological treatment appointment and autologous transplantation post-recovery have been considered improved solutions for fertility recovery in cancer survivors. Nevertheless, the cryopreservation and transplantation of thawed tissues is still very limited, and positive outcomes are relatively low. This review aims to discuss the limitations of oncofertility protocols with a focus on the impacts of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and the loss of antioxidant defense in graft integrity.","[Moniz, Ines; Soares, Maria] Univ Coimbra, Inst Interdisciplinary Res, Doctoral Programme Expt Biol & Biomed PDBEB, P-3030789 Coimbra, Portugal; [Moniz, Ines; Soares, Maria; Sousa, Ana Paula; Ramalho-Santos, Joao; Branco, Ana] Univ Coimbra, CNC Ctr Neurosci & Cell Biol, CIBB Ctr Innovat Biomed & Biotechnol, Polo 3, P-3000548 Coimbra, Portugal; [Sousa, Ana Paula] Unidade Local Saude Coimbra, Reprod Med Unit, P-3000075 Coimbra, Portugal; [Sousa, Ana Paula] Eugin Coimbra, Rua Filipe Hodart, P-3000185 Coimbra, Portugal; [Ramalho-Santos, Joao] Univ Coimbra, Dept Sci L, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Branco, A (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, CNC Ctr Neurosci & Cell Biol, CIBB Ctr Innovat Biomed & Biotechnol, Polo 3, P-3000548 Coimbra, Portugal.",inescmoniz@hotmail.com; abranco@fmed.uc.pt,"Branco, Ana/AGP-5286-2022; Ramalho-Santos, João/F-8641-2012; Moniz, Inês/HNJ-5092-2023","Moniz, Inês/0000-0002-0381-4101; Sousa, Ana Paula/0000-0002-4190-6138; Soares, Maria/0000-0002-7507-4843","Portuguese national funds via FCT-Fundacaopara a Ciencia e a Tecnologia and Fundo Social Europeu (FSE) [UIDB/04539/2020, UIDP/04539/2020, LA/P/0058/2020]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); FCT Portugal under a PhD fellowship [2022.10535.BD, 2020.06180.BD]; CEEC contract [CEECIND/00860/2018]",Portuguese national funds via FCT-Fundacaopara a Ciencia e a Tecnologia and Fundo Social Europeu (FSE); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)); FCT Portugal under a PhD fellowship; CEEC contract,"This work was financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Centro 2020 Regional Operational Programme and through the COMPETE 2020-Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation and Portuguese national funds via FCT-Fundacaopara a Ciencia e a Tecnologia and Fundo Social Europeu (FSE) under projects UIDB/04539/2020, UIDP/04539/2020, and LA/P/0058/2020.

Currently, there is no treatment to prevent and reverse age-related skeletal muscle ageing frailty. Existing interventions mainly slow down and control the signs and symptoms. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicle (MSC-EV) therapy is a promising approach to attenuate age-related skeletal muscle ageing frailty.

This review article adopts an integrative approach grounded in ecological economics, social-ecological systems theory, and sustainability science to examine the dynamic interactions between economic growth, resource use, environmental degradation, and social well-being. The findings underscore that technological innovation and efficiency improvements alone are insufficient to achieve sustainable production and consumption. Instead, the transition requires systemic change, including shifts in production and consumption patterns, institutional reform, and redefined notions of prosperity. It identifies key steps in the coproduction of the transition pathway and five key shifts in provision systems that, taken together, can achieve science-based policy reform through interdisciplinary collaboration, co-production of knowledge, and adaptive governance, thereby navigating complexity and uncertainty in policymaking. By focusing on these critical aspects, this research provides a comprehensive framework for navigating the transition to a sustainable future within planetary boundaries.","[Schandl, Heinz; Barnett, Guy; Whitten, Stuart] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO, Canberra, Australia; [Schandl, Heinz] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Japan; [Walton, Andrea; Oliver, Sandra] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO, Brisbane, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Nagoya University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Schandl, H (corresponding author), Black Mt Sci & Innovat Pk,Clunies Ross St,Bldg 101, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",heinz.schandl@csiro.au,"Walton, Andrea/H-1985-2013; Schandl, Heinz/C-5055-2008; Barnett, Guy/A-7034-2011; Whitten, Stuart/G-5872-2010",,,,,125,3,3,10,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-5509,,SUSTAIN PROD CONSUMP,Sustain.

Dysfunction of the CFTR protein leads to progressive pulmonary disease, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and nutritional deficiencies. Survival has significantly increased over the last several decades due to improved pulmonary and nutritional management, including CFTR modulator therapy. The adult CF population now faces new challenges of aging, such as menopause-related symptoms and age-related osteoporosis superimposed on underlying CF-related bone disease. The menopausal transition and early postmenopause are characterized by rapid bone loss and represent a window of opportunity to preserve bone mass. Menopausal hormone therapy may alleviate vasomotor symptoms and improve bone density in appropriately selected people.

A main opportunity now is aggregating new technologies to conventional phosphate fertilizers so they may become even more efficient in supplying P to plants, which involves research related to the technologies for reduction in soil P losses. Thus, some innovations and technologies have begun to be developed and marketed and continue in continual refinement and adoption in agriculture worldwide to reduce conversion of soluble P applied through conventional phosphate fertilizers into unavailable forms in the soil. This is the case of enhanced efficiency fertilizers, which includes groups of phosphate fertilizers with fixation inhibitors and the chemically modified, controlled-release, blends, multifunctional, and synergistic phosphate fertilizers. The technologies presented in detail in this paper were developed to improve the agronomic efficiency of phosphate fertilization in comparison with conventional fertilizers, with costs varying according to raw materials, production technologies, and distance from the consumer market. This synthesis expands knowledge regarding technologies in use, stimulating the development and application of technologies that increase nutrient efficiency, based on results obtained through suitable methods and equipment along with laboratory, greenhouse, and field results. Increased fertilization efficiency should always be linked with greater economic profitability and the lowest environmental impact, following the principles of sustainability and circular economy. The great challenge for innovation is transforming the knowledge generated regarding fertilizers present in patents and scientific publications into technologies appropriate for the fertilizer market and for adoption in agriculture.","[Guelfi, Douglas; Pereira Nunes, Ana Paula; Sarkis, Leonardo Fernandes; Oliveira, Damiany Padua] Fed Univ Lavras UFLA, Dept Soil Sci, Lab Fertilizers Technol INNOVA FERT, POB 3037, BR-37203202 Lavras, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Lavras,"Guelfi, D (corresponding author), Fed Univ Lavras UFLA, Dept Soil Sci, Lab Fertilizers Technol INNOVA FERT, POB 3037, BR-37203202 Lavras, MG, Brazil.",douglasguelfi@ufla.br,,"Pádua Oliveira, Dâmiany/0000-0002-1817-4020",National Council for Scientific Development and Technology [310572/2020-7]; Agency for Improvement of Higher-Level Personnel; Minas Gerais Research Foundation,National Council for Scientific Development and Technology; Agency for Improvement of Higher-Level Personnel; Minas Gerais Research Foundation(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)),"This work was supported by the National Council for Scientific Development and Technology (Process: 310572/2020-7), the Agency for Improvement of Higher-Level Personnel, and the Minas Gerais Research Foundation.",80,38,45,15,179,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2022,14.0,21,,,,,,14266,10.3390/su142114266,0.0,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6F3OI,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:000883974300001,0

Conventional agriculture (CA) methods with high reliance on chemical and mechanical inputs often exacerbate this issue through soil degradation and water loss. This review aims to examine how different organic practices, such as mulching, cover cropping, composting, crop rotation, and no-till (NT) in combination with precision technologies, can contribute to water optimization, and it discusses the opportunities and challenges for the adoption and implementation of those practices. Previous findings show that organic agriculture (OA) may outperform CA in drought conditions. However, the problems of weed management in organic NT, trade-offs in cover crop biomass and moisture conservation, limited access to irrigation technologies, lack of awareness, and certification barriers challenge agricultural resilience and sustainability. Since the outcomes of OA practices depend on the crop type, local environment, and accessibility of knowledge and inputs, further context-specific research is needed to refine a scalable solution that maintains both productivity and resilience.","[Sharma, Shikha; Yost, Matt A.; Reeve, Jennifer R.] Utah State Univ, Plants Soils & Climate Dept, Logan, UT 84321 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Sharma, S (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Plants Soils & Climate Dept, Logan, UT 84321 USA.",s.sharma@usu.edu; matt.yost@usu.edu; jennifer.reeve@usu.edu,"; Sharma, Shikha/KBD-2129-2024; Reeve, Jennifer/G-7148-2011","Sharma, Shikha/0000-0002-0709-7234; Yost, Matt/0000-0001-5012-8481",,,,112,2,2,11,14,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN 13,2025,17.0,12,,,,,,5452,10.3390/su17125452,0.0,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4GR6K,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001517593900001,0

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to RGM infestation is critical for developing sustainable pest management strategies. Resistance in rice is governed by Gm genes, which encode proteins that recognise specific RGM effectors and activate downstream defense pathways. Key molecular mechanisms include the hypersensitive response, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signalling, reactive oxygen species production and the activation of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. Additionally, RGMs deploy effectors to manipulate host physiology and suppress plant defenses, leading to a dynamic coevolutionary arms race between the pest and its host. Advances in omics technologies, including transcriptomics and CRISPR-based gene editing, have provided insights into resistance pathways and facilitated the development of resistant rice varieties through gene pyramiding and marker-assisted selection. This review synthesises current knowledge on the molecular interactions between rice and RGM, highlighting strategies to increase resistance and ensure long-term agricultural sustainability.","[Nandana, S.

As the terrestrial sources of these materials face mounting geopolitical, environmental, and ethical constraints, undersea deposits are increasingly being viewed as alternatives. However, the extraction technologies remain unproven at large scales, posing risks related to biodiversity loss, sediment disruption, and altered oceanic carbon cycles. This paper explores how deep-sea mining might be reconciled with sustainable development, arguing that its viability hinges on addressing five interdependent challenges-technological readiness, environmental protection, economic feasibility, robust governance, and social acceptability. Progress requires parallel advancements across all domains. This paper reviews the current knowledge of deep-sea resources and extraction methods, analyzes the ecological and sociopolitical risks, and proposes systemic solutions, including the implementation of stringent regulatory frameworks, technological innovation, responsible terrestrial sourcing, and circular economy strategies. A precautionary and integrated approach is emphasized to ensure that the securing of critical minerals does not compromise marine ecosystem health or long-term sustainability objectives.","[Szabo, Lorand] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Elect Machines & Drives Dept, Cluj Napoca 400114, Romania",Technical University of Cluj Napoca,"Szabó, L (corresponding author), Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Elect Machines & Drives Dept, Cluj Napoca 400114, Romania.",lorand.szabo@emd.utcluj.ro,"Szabo, Lorand/B-7996-2011","Szabo, Lorand/0000-0002-1096-4802",,,,146,1,1,20,20,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL 18,2025,17.0,14,,,,,,6580,10.3390/su17146580,0.0,,34,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6HH0Q,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001553334000001,0

However, most fruit and vegetables are vulnerable to quality loss and spoilage during processing, transportation, and storage. Among the recently introduced emerging technologies, supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) has been extensively utilized to treat and maintain fruit and vegetables mainly due to its nontoxicity, safety, and environmentally friendly. SCCO2 technology generates low processing costs and mild processing conditions (temperature and pressure) that allow for the application of CO2 at a supercritical state. This review aimed to summarize the current knowledge on the influence of SCCO2 technology on the quality attributes of fruit and vegetable products, such as physicochemical properties (pH, color, cloud, particle size distribution, texture), sensory quality, and nutritional composition (ascorbic acid, phenolic compounds, anthocyanins, carotenoids, and betalains). In addition, the effects and mechanisms of the SCCO2 technique on endogenous enzyme inactivation (polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, and pectin methylesterase) were also elucidated. Finally, the prospects of the SCCO2 technique for industrial application was discussed from the economic and regulatory aspect.","[Chen, Zhe; Khaneghah, Amin Mousavi; Marszalek, Krystian] Prof Waclaw Dabrowski Inst Agr & Food Biotechnol, State Res Inst, Dept Fruit & Vegetable Prod Technol, Warsaw, Poland; [Spilimbergo, Sara] Univ Padua, Dept Ind Engn, Padua, Italy; [Zhu, Zhenzhou] Wuhan Polytech Univ, Sch Modern Ind Selenium Sci & Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Waclaw Dabrowski Institute of Biotechnology of Agricultural & Food; University of Padua; Wuhan Polytechnic University,"Marszalek, K (corresponding author), Prof Waclaw Dabrowski Inst Agr & Food Biotechnol, State Res Inst, Dept Fruit & Vegetable Prod Technol, Warsaw, Poland.",krystian.marszalek@ibprs.pl,"Zhu, Zhenzhou/E-4913-2016; Mousavi Khaneghah, Amin/A-5925-2012; Marszałek, Krystian/AAA-7741-2019","Mousavi Khaneghah, Amin/0000-0001-5769-0004; Marszałek, Krystian/0000-0003-2121-0704; chen, zhe/0000-0002-9826-3620",Narodowe Centrum Badan i Rozwoju,"Narodowe Centrum Badan i Rozwoju(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland)",This work was supported by Narodowe Centrum Badan i Rozwoju.,95,11,11,5,68,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1040-8398,1549-7852,CRIT REV FOOD SCI,Crit.

Valorizing these substantial secondary streams through the efficient extraction of high-biological-value proteins could translate into significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. Protein extraction from meat secondary streams offers a promising approach to enhance their nutritional and commercial value while supporting global food security initiatives. This approach could also help to distant these by-products from their original source, making them more appealing to consumers. The current review evaluates the protein content and valorization potential of meat secondary streams from various animal sources. It further provides a critical assessment of both traditional and emerging protein extraction techniques, highlighting their advantages, limitations, and applications. Existing knowledge gaps are also identified to guide future research.

The effectiveness of post-harvest management options now available for Ethiopia's staple and export crop pests was reviewed. However, based on the information that is currently available, it is challenging to rank the various storage pest management techniques. Cultural practices, the use of various locally accessible botanicals, varietal tolerance, various storage structures, and several significant entomopathogenic fungi are among the most frequently utilized management techniques. Although the majority of the research findings covered in this study are basic knowledge rather than ready-made technologies, current technologies can still be used with a few minor alterations. To regulate mold growth and lower the risk of grain storage pests, traditional subterranean pits can be slightly modified to avoid dampness. A further key factor in preventing field infestation and lowering insect loads in storage environments is the direct use of insect resistant varieties. Several botanical remedies have also been found to be successful, allowing farmers to use them with ease. Finally, it is critical to highlight the integrated pest management system's sustainability and effectiveness of approaches for long-term storage of seeds and grains in a variety of situations. Ethiopian subsistence farmers traditionally store their grain harvests, leaving them open to storage pests and fungi that can cause contamination of major staple crops. Applying the most effective strategy requires a precise understanding of the insect species, infestation rates, storage losses, and storage conditions in the various types of farmers' grain stores. This study did a complete literature analysis on post-harvest pest and management measures with a focus on Ethiopia. The most frequent insect pests of stored cereals in this study were weevils (Sitophilus spp.), the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica), rust-red flour beetle (Tribolium sp.), sawtoothed grain beetle (Oryzaephilus sp.), grain beetle (Cryptolestes spp.), Indian meal moth (Plodia interpunctella), and Angoumois grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella). Flour beetles (Tribolium spp.), sawtoothed beetles (Oryzaephilus sp.), flat grain beetles (Cryptolestes pusillus), and some moths have been identified as common stored product pests of stored oil seed, while bruchid beetles (Callosobruchus chinensis) and the moths were reported for pulses. Additionally, the storage pests in Ethiopia under varied conditions caused storage losses of 9-64.5%, 13-95%, 36.9-51.9%, and 2-94.7% in maize, sorghum, chickpeas, and sesame, respectively. To reduce the losses incurred, preventative measures can be taken before infestations or as soon as infestations are discovered. A variety of pest population monitoring systems for harvested products and retailers have been developed and recommended. In this context, reducing post-harvest grain losses is an urgent concern for improving food accessibility and availability for many smallholder farmers in Ethiopia and ensuring the nation's long-term food security.","[Berhe, Muez] Tigray Agr Res Inst, POB 62, Mekelle 5637, Ethiopia; [Subramanyam, Bhadriraju] Kansas State Univ, Dept Grain Sci & Ind, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Chichaybelu, Mekasha] Ethiopian Agr Res Inst, Debre Zeyt Agr Res Ctr, POB 2003, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Demissie, Girma] Ethiopian Agr Res Inst, Bako Agr Res Ctr, Addis Ababa 2003, Ethiopia; [Abay, Fetien] Mekelle Univ, Dept Dryland Crop & Hort Sci, Mekelle 231, Ethiopia; [Harvey, Jagger] Kansas State Univ, Feed Future Innovat Lab Reduct Postharvest Loss, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University; Mekelle University; Kansas State University,"Berhe, M (corresponding author), Tigray Agr Res Inst, POB 62, Mekelle 5637, Ethiopia.",muez.sbn@gmail.com,"berhe, muez/KJC-8408-2024","berhe, muez/0000-0002-9989-9102; Bhairaju, Subramanyam/0000-0003-4481-6020",American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative [AID-OAA-L-14-00002],American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This research was funded by the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Feed the Future initiative (www.feedthefuture.gov, accessed on 18 October 2022), grant number AID-OAA-L-14-00002.

We performed a systematic review of the literature with a narrative synthesis, to examine the current evidence for VR in simulation-based emergency skills training. We broadly define emergency skills as any clinical skill used in the emergency care of patients across all clinical settings.Methods: This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Cochrane's Rob 2 and ROBVIS tools were used during study quality assessment. No ethical review was required for this work. Results: Thirty-four articles published between 14th March 1998 and 1st March 2022 were included in this review. Studies were predominantly conducted in the USA and Europe and focussed on a variety of healthcare disciplines including medical, nursing, and allied health. VR education was delivered using head-mounted displays, Cave Automatic Virtual Environment systems, and bespoke setups. These systems delivered education in a variety of areas (emergency medicine, equipment training, obstetrics, and basic/advanced life support). Subjective potential advantages of this technology included realism, replayability, and time-effectiveness. Reports of adverse events were low in frequency across the included studies. Whilst clear educational benefit was generally noted, this was not reflected in changes to patient-based outcomes.Conclusion: There may be educational benefit to using VR in the context of simulation-based emergency skills training including knowledge gain and retention, skill performance, acceptability, usability, and validity. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate clear cost-effectiveness, or direct improvement of patient or institutional outcomes, at this stage.","[Abbas, Jonathan R.] Manchester Univ Fdn Trust, Royal Manchester Childrens Hosp, Dept Paediat ENT, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9WL, England; [Abbas, Jonathan R.; Payton, Antony; Bruce, Iain] Univ Manchester, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, England; [Abbas, Jonathan R.; Chu, Michael M.

Background Programming anxiety impairs educational outcomes by reducing student engagement, performance, and retention. Prior studies have typically focused on its correlations with performance, programming language selection, and gender; a more comprehensive investigation of this topic is demanded. Methodology Following PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review analyzed 21 empirical studies from databases including ScienceDirect, Springer, Scopus, WOS, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore, based on predefined inclusion criteria. Contribution This review summarizes existing knowledge about programming anxiety, identifies key gaps, establishes its causes and effects, evaluates measurement tools, and proposes interventions that have not previously been systematically reviewed. Findings Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to programming anxiety. It harms learning outcomes and may lead to lower course completion rates. The current approaches for evaluating programming anxiety lack standardization and validity. In addition, findings suggest that effective interventions require a supportive learning environment combined with pedagogy to alleviate programming anxiety. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers Practitioners are advised to use instructional strategies that reduce programming anxiety, such as collaborative learning, supportive interactions, appropriate IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), and anxiety-specific assessment tools to tailor educational approaches. Researchers are encouraged to develop validated, reliable instruments for evaluating programming anxiety and investigating the efficacy of specific solutions in a variety of educational settings. Impact on Society Mitigating programming anxiety has significant implications for educational practices, as it can improve the quality and accessibility of computer science education, potentially enhancing diversity and inclusion in technology-related disciplines. Future Research Future research should investigate the long-term impacts of programming anxiety, design interventions that target both psychological and pedagogical components of anxiety and evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions across different demographic groups.","[Pan, Ying; Harun, Jamalludin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Educ Sci & Technol, Johor Baharu, Johor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Pan, Y (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Educ Sci & Technol, Johor Baharu, Johor, Malaysia.",panying@graduate.utm.my; p-jamal@utm.my,"Harun, Jamalludin/O-3630-2019",,UTM-NGA Research Grant [R.J130000.7353.4B763],UTM-NGA Research Grant,This work was supported by the UTM-NGA Research Grant under Grant No. R.J130000.7353.4B763.,57,0,0,9,9,INFORMING SCIENCE INST,SANTA ROSA,"131 BROOKHILL CT, SANTA ROSA, CA 95409 USA",1547-9714,1539-3585,J INF TECHNOL EDUC-R,J.

This study aims to critically examine the impact of technology-enhanced pedagogy in PE by reviewing the latest research on digital tools used in teaching and learning. Specifically, it explores how these technologies affect student engagement, knowledge retention, motor skill development, and self-regulated learning. Additionally, it seeks to identify potential barriers and strategies for optimizing their implementation in PE curricula. This study conducts a literature review, applying thematic analysis to categorize findings into key areas such as wearable technology, gamification, virtual and augmented reality, and artificial intelligence in physical education. Focused on the literature published between 2010 and 2025, it was conducted using academic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Finally, 151 articles were selected involving data extraction and qualitative synthesis of findings. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed empirical studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that investigated the application of technology in PE. The findings suggest that integrating technology into PE enhances motivation, engagement, motor skills, tactical understanding, and cognitive learning. However, issues such as digital inequality, lack of teacher training, and ethical concerns regarding student data collection pose significant challenges to widespread adoption. Also, this review identifies critical gaps and ethical considerations in the use of technology in PE, offering practical recommendations for its effective integration. Technology-enhanced pedagogy in PE offers numerous advantages, but its success depends on proper implementation, adequate teacher training, and equitable access to resources. However, this study is limited by the variability of methodologies across the reviewed studies, which may impact the generalizability of the findings.","[Martin-Rodriguez, Alexandra; Madrigal-Cerezo, Ruben] Int Business Univ UNIE, Fac Educ Sci, Madrid 28015, Spain; [Martin-Rodriguez, Alexandra] Univ Europea Madrid, Fac Med Hlth & Sports, Madrid 28670, Spain",European University of Madrid,"Martín-Rodríguez, A (corresponding author), Int Business Univ UNIE, Fac Educ Sci, Madrid 28015, Spain.;Martín-Rodríguez, A (corresponding author), Univ Europea Madrid, Fac Med Hlth & Sports, Madrid 28670, Spain.",alexandra.martin@universidadunie.com; ruben.madrigal@universidadunie.com,"MARTIN-ROIGUEZ, ALEXANA/ISV-0813-2023","MARTIN-ROIGUEZ, ALEXANA/0000-0002-0087-4379; Maigal Cerezo, Rubén/0009-0000-5994-0564",,,,148,6,10,23,32,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7102,EDUC SCI,Educ.

Stress can arise from difficulties in performing selfcare activities. Peers play an important role in diabetes management and peer-based interventions have shown promise in improving health outcomes. This systematic review (SR) was conducted to assess the effectiveness of peer-based interventions (PBIs) in improving health outcomes among adolescents with T1D and identify future research areas. Methods: Joanna Briggs Institute and the PRISMA 2020 checklist for SRs were used as guides to search seven databases, screen, critically appraise, analyze, and synthesize articles. Results: The primary result was the lack of evidence on the effectiveness of PBIs in adolescents who have T1D. Of the three studies in this SR, two described PBIs that included effective peer interaction and education activities that enhanced learning and retention about diabetes management. These two PBIs resulted in positive clinical (HbA1c control), behavioural (self-care habits), and psychosocial (self-esteem, social support, and knowledge) outcomes. Additionally, a web-based, interactive treatment setting, Sugarsquare, was the only intervention that improved quality of life outcomes. Sugarsquare allowed adolescents with T1D to chat with one another and contact their nurses about everyday T1D management. Implications and conclusion: Through completion of this SR we investigated a complex topic area and provided a synthesis of data indicated that PBIs are effective in supporting management of T1D and positive health outcomes. These results can be used by pediatric nurses for enhanced clinical practice and as a foundation to continue research to develop PBIs for adolescents living with T1D and their families.

Thus, PE teachers require the knowledge and skills to carry out this crucial task. In the crowded curricula of Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE) programs, there are limited opportunities for pre-service PE teachers to learn how to analyze and perform a large list of motor skills. Our purposes in this study were to determine whether a single session peer-teaching intervention could improve pre-service PE teachers' short-term non-dominant hand overarm throwing performances and to examine these students' perceptions of the interventions. We allocated 47 pre-service PE teaching students (24 males; 23 females) to one of three experimental groups: a Video Analysis Group (VAG; n = 17), a Verbal Group (VG; n = 19), and a Control Group (CG; n = 11), based on the class in which they were enrolled. VAG and VG participants worked with a partner of their choice in reciprocal peer-teaching to improve each other's non-dominant hand throwing technique. VAG and VG interventions were identical except that VAG participants accessed video analysis technology. CG participants completed unrelated course work that involved no overarm throwing activities. A single 20-minute session of peer teaching with video analysis feedback during practice led to rapid enhancements in non-dominant hand overarm throwing skills. While all three groups improved their performance by retention testing, participants in the VAG group improved most quickly. Participants in both the VAG and VG groups reported that their respective interventions improved their throwing and Qualitative Movement Diagnosis (QMD) skills. Based on these results, we suggest that PETE programs integrate peer-teaching and video analysis sessions into fundamental movement courses to accelerate students' motor skill acquisitions.","[Beseler, Bradley; Harvey, Jack T.; Mesagno, Christopher] Federat Univ Australia, Inst Educ Arts & Community, Univ Dr Mt Helen, Ballarat, Vic 3353, Australia; [Plumb, Mandy S.] Cent Queensland Univ, Sch Hlth Med & Appl Sci, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Spittle, Michael; Harvey, Jack T.; Mesagno, Christopher] Victoria Univ, Inst Hlth & Sport, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Johnson, Nicola F.] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Educ, Joondalup, WA, Australia",Federation University Australia; Central Queensland University; Victoria University; Edith Cowan University,"Beseler, B (corresponding author), Federat Univ Australia, Inst Educ Arts & Community, Univ Dr Mt Helen, Ballarat, Vic 3353, Australia.",b.beseler@federation.edu.au,"Johnson, Nicola/S-9415-2019; Spittle, Michael/D-4219-2011; Mesagno, Christopher/AAX-5247-2020; Beseler, Bradley/KXQ-8260-2024","Beseler, Bradley/0000-0001-5867-5164; Plumb, Mandy/0000-0002-3129-7383",,,,57,6,8,1,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0031-5125,1558-688X,PERCEPT MOTOR SKILL,Percept.

Furthermore, once antibiotic agents are excreted in urine and feces, these substances often can reach wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), in which improper treatments have been highlighted as the main reason for stronger dissemination of antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs to the receiving bodies. Hence, achieving better antibiotic removal capacities in WWTPs is proposed as an adequate approach to limit the spread of antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs into the environment. In this review, we highlight hospital wastewater (WW) as a critical hotspot for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance due to its high level of antibiotics and pathogens. Hence, monitoring the composition and structure of the bacterial communities related to hospital WW is a key factor in controlling the spread of ARGs. In addition, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the current biological WW treatments regarding the antibiotic-resistance phenomenon. Widely used conventional activated sludge technology has proved to be ineffective in mitigating the dissemination of ARB and ARGs to the environment. However, aerobic granular sludge (AGS) technology is a promising technology-with broad adaptability and excellent performance-that could successfully reduce antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs in the generated effluents. We also outline the main operational parameters involved in mitigating antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs in WWTPs. In this regard, WW operation under long hydraulic and solid retention times allows better removal of antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs independently of the WW technology employed. Finally, we address the current knowledge of the adsorption and degradation of antibiotics and their importance in removing ARB and ARGs. Notably, AGS can enhance the removal of antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs due to the complex microbial metabolism within the granular biomass.","[Perez-Bou, Lizandra; Gonzalez-Martinez, Alejandro; Gonzalez-Lopez, Jesus; Correa-Galeote, David] Univ Granada, Fac Pharm, Microbiol Dept, Granada, Andalucia, Spain; [Perez-Bou, Lizandra; Gonzalez-Martinez, Alejandro; Gonzalez-Lopez, Jesus; Correa-Galeote, David] Univ Granada, Inst Water Res, Microbiol & Environm Technol Sect, Granada, Andalucia, Spain; [Perez-Bou, Lizandra] Univ Habana, Microbiol & Virol Dept, Microbial Biotechnol Grp, Fac Biol, Havana, Cuba",University of Granada; University of Granada; Universidad de la Habana,"Correa-Galeote, D (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Fac Pharm, Microbiol Dept, Granada, Andalucia, Spain.",dcorrea@ugr.es,"Correa-Galeote, David/I-8336-2017; Gonzalez-Martinez, Alejano/A-5545-2018","Correa-Galeote, David/0000-0002-9776-8424; Gonzalez-Martinez, Alejano/0000-0002-4438-6430","ECORESISTOME project - Consejeria de Universidad, Investigacion e Innovacion of Andalusian Government [A-RNM-62-UGR20]; ERDF A way of making Europe; Hiring of Doctoral Research Personnel Program of the Andalusian Government; Universidad de Granada/CBUA","ECORESISTOME project - Consejeria de Universidad, Investigacion e Innovacion of Andalusian Government; ERDF A way of making Europe; Hiring of Doctoral Research Personnel Program of the Andalusian Government; Universidad de Granada/CBUA","This research was supported by ECORESISTOME project (A-RNM-62-UGR20) funded by Consejeria de Universidad, Investigacion e Innovacion of Andalusian Government and by ERDF A way of making Europe.

The documents were separated into the following three categories, (i) Theoretical and Review studies, (ii) Proposal and Showcase studies, and (iii) Experimental and Case studies and were examined from different dimensions through an in-depth content analysis using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The documents were further analyzed using scientometric tools, such as Bibliometrix and VOSviewer and topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The most prominent topics, areas, and themes were revealed and the outcomes regarding the influence of this combination on learning and teaching were summarized. Based on the results, this combination can effectively enrich education, positively affect learning and teaching, offer deep and meaningful learning, and support both students and teachers. Additionally, it can support different educational approaches and strategies, various learning styles, and special education and be utilized in both formal and informal learning environments. The real-time identification, tracking, monitoring, analysis, and visualization of multimodal learning data of students' behavior, emotions, cognitive and affective states and the overall learning and teaching processes emerged as a significant benefit that contributes greatly to the realization of adaptive and personalized learning. Finally, it was revealed that the combination of extended reality technologies with learning analytics and educational data mining can support collaborative learning and social learning, improve students' self-efficacy and self-regulated learning, and increase students' learning gains, academic achievements, knowledge retention, motivation, and engagement.","[Lampropoulos, Georgios; Evangelidis, Georgios] Univ Macedonia, Sch Informat Sci, Dept Appl Informat, Software & Data Engn Lab, Thessaloniki 54636, Greece; [Lampropoulos, Georgios] Univ Nicosia, Sch Educ, Dept Educ, CY-2417 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Macedonia; University of Nicosia,"Lampropoulos, G (corresponding author), Univ Macedonia, Sch Informat Sci, Dept Appl Informat, Software & Data Engn Lab, Thessaloniki 54636, Greece.;Lampropoulos, G (corresponding author), Univ Nicosia, Sch Educ, Dept Educ, CY-2417 Nicosia, Cyprus.",glampropoulos@uom.edu.gr; gevan@uom.edu.gr,"Evangelidis, Georgios/JYP-5711-2024","Evangelidis, Georgios/0000-0003-1639-2152; Lampropoulos, Georgios/0000-0002-5719-2125",,,,147,7,10,30,74,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

In this review, we examined current knowledge on the specific molecular mechanisms of doxorubicin resistance in HCC, including overexpression of drug efflux (ABC family) transporters, aberrations of the drug target topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A), impairments in apoptosis (p53, FOXO3, Bcl-2 family members), oncogenic activation of pro-survival signaling pathways (NF- kappa B, PI3K/Akt, and MAPKs), instances of tumor heterogeneity with sirtuins, and cancer stem cells. Additionally, we investigate the role of non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, in modulating sensitivity to and resistance to doxorubicin in HCC. In conclusion, nanomedicine will become crucial in overcoming the limitations of significant doxorubicin resistance in HCC, utilizing advanced mechanisms to modulate treatment with doxorubicin in this context. This review details various nanotechnology-based approaches to the delivery of doxorubicin, including passive targeting using the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, active targeting with specific ligands, and stimulus-responsive drug release in the tumor microenvironment (e.g., pH, redox potential). We focus on preclinical studies that utilized a variety of nanoparticle formulations for palliative care to patients with HCC, have investigated the use of liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles (e.g., PCL, chitosan), metallic particles (e.g., gold, silver, iron oxide), dendrimers, and metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), which have been loaded with doxorubicin or combined with other agents (e.g., cantharidin, berberine, isoginkgetin, ginger extract). The nanoparticle formulations enhanced drug delivery, increased drug accumulation per cell, reduced systemic toxicity, and overcame drug resistance mechanisms in HCC models. (c) 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Articles were included if they addressed triage by lay or professional bystanders (e.g. police, fire and rescue) in prehospital trauma settings. Data were extracted and synthesised using a descriptive analytical approach.ResultsTwenty-three studies were included. Bystanders demonstrated the ability to apply basic triage tools with moderate accuracy, although over-triage was common and under-triage rates often exceeded accepted thresholds. Several trauma training programmes in low-resource settings included triage components, leading to improvements in knowledge and confidence. Long-term retention and real-world clinical utility remain uncertain. Only one study directly evaluated bystander assessment of crash parameters; lay performance approached that of health professionals in some domains. Technological innovations such as video live-streaming from bystanders to emergency call handlers showed potential to enhance triage and situational awareness, though operational and ethical barriers remain.ConclusionsBystanders may have an expanded role in the triage and early assessment of trauma casualties, particularly in settings where formal EMS is limited or delayed. Within the Road Injury Chain of Survival, empowering bystanders through structured training and technology-enabled support could strengthen early links in the chain. Future research should focus on validating simplified triage approaches, evaluating training impact, and assessing outcomes related to both patient care and system efficiency.","[Russam, George Stephen] Darlington Mem Hosp, Anaesthet Dept, Darlington, England; [Gluyas-Harris, Jake] Derriford Hosp, Emergency Dept, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Aveyard, Nicholas] Royal Devon Univ Healthcare NHS Fdn Trust, Exeter, England; [Aveyard, Nicholas] Univ Exeter, Fac Hlth & Life Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Nutbeam, Tim] Ctr Postcollis Res Innovat & Translat, IMPACT, Exeter, England; [Nutbeam, Tim] Univ Plymouth, Plymouth, Devon, England",Derriford Hospital; University of Exeter; University of Plymouth,"Russam, GS (corresponding author), Darlington Mem Hosp, Anaesthet Dept, Darlington, England.",george.russam@nhs.net; timnutbeam@nhs.net,"Nutbeam, Tim/NTQ-6612-2025","Nutbeam, Tim/0000-0003-0814-9240; Gluyas-Harris, Jake/0009-0001-6780-6952; Aveyard, Nicholas/0000-0002-3519-7582; Russam, George Stephen/0009-0009-7008-7061",Road Safety Trust,Road Safety Trust,"IMPACT's Bystander workstream is supported by the Road Safety Trust.

In nursing education, these AI-driven chatbots present substantial potential for enhancing student learning, engagement, and educational processes. Aim: This scoping review aimed to synthesize existing literature on the use of AI-powered chatbots as teaching tools in nursing education, evaluating their effectiveness. Method: This is a scoping review guided by the five-stage scoping review protocol of Arksey and O'Malley (2005). A systematic search and retrieval of relevant articles was conducted across CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Eric databases. Deductive content analysis based on the methodology of Elo and Kyngas (2008) was used for a narrative synthesis of the findings. Results: A total of 14 studies were included in this review. ChatGPT emerged as the predominant platform for deploying chatbots within nursing education. The primary applications of chatbots were identified as follows: (a) enhancing learning and skill development, (b) supporting simulations, (c) providing educational assistance and tutoring, and (d) facilitating evaluation and assessment. Significant outcomes reported included increased knowledge retention, heightened engagement, and improved skill development among nursing students. Conclusion: The integration of chatbots in nursing education has proven to be a valuable tool for improving student learning outcomes, engagement, and skill development, while also offering effective feedback and evaluation mechanisms. Nurse faculty might consider integrating chatbots to complement traditional teaching methods, but it is essential to continue rigorous research and refinement of the technology, alongside comprehensive educator training, to effectively address existing limitations and challenges.

Design: Seven electronic databases were searched: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang Database, Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Cochrane Library, PubMed, and EMBASE. All studies on acupuncture for patients after PCI were included. The search period was from the database establishment to June 13th, 2024. Setting: Using full-text and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) searches, two personnel independently screened and checked articles strictly according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and they reached an agreement through discussion on articles with different opinions. Interventions: Post-PCI acupuncture. Main outcome measures: Creating descriptive charts to visually express the research features. Results: 38 eligible studies were included. Their main topic was the use of acupuncture in patients after PCI. The primary focus of these studies was the application of acupuncture in patients post-PCI. The majority of the included articles originated from China, with the majority published in the year 2023. The types of studies encompassed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (25, 65.8 %), protocols (6, 15.8 %), review articles (6, 15.8 %), and case report (1, 2.6 %). The acupuncture methods utilized varied, with filiform needle therapy being the most common (14, 36.8 %), followed by auricular plaster therapy (7, 18.4 %), thumbtack needle therapy (7, 18.4 %), and eye acupuncture (1, 2.6 %). The acupoints most frequently used were Shenmen (TF4) in the auricular region and Neiguan (PC6). The needle retention time was predominantly 30 min, as reported in nine studies involving filiform needles. In the control groups of the included studies, secondary prevention measures were most commonly employed, appearing in thirteen studies. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was the most frequently measured outcome, featured in nine studies. Psychological issues were identified as the most prevalent condition following PCI, mentioned in seventeen studies. Conclusion: The main focus of this scoping review was on psychological issues, cardiovascular problems, and exercise capacity or quality of life of patients after PCI. The majority of research has concentrated on psychological and cardiovascular issues. However, the outcomes related to varieties of acupuncture therapy methods, acupoints selection, retention time, treatment frequency, and other aspects of acupuncture practice were interconnected and complex within the clinical application of acupuncture. These interconnected elements collectively impacted the treatment of acupuncture in the post-PCI context, making it challenging to reach definitive conclusions. The heterogeneity in acupuncture practices highlighted the need for future research. It is recommended that future studies employ more rigorous designs, standardized methodologies, larger sample sizes, and higher quality to enhance our understanding of acupuncture's role in post-PCI care. This is particularly important for elucidating its potential in addressing psychological and cardiovascular problems, which are critical areas of concern for patients post-PCI.","[Mi, Aoyue; Zhou, Ziyang; Zhou, Jiazheng; Xu, Luyao; Zhang, Zhenzhen; Xie, Wanqing; Dou, Zhiqiang; Li, Zhaofeng] Shandong Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Hao, Mingyao] Shandong Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhenzhen] Linyi Cty Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Dezhou, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yingying] Shandong Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp 2, Jinan, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,"Li, ZF (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Jinan, Peoples R China.;Hao, MY (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp, Jinan, Peoples R China.",haomingyao@yeah.net; qdlzfcmd@126.com,,,"National Key R&D & D Program of China [2022YFC3500705]; Acupoint-Viscera Correlation Study Youth Scientific Research Innovation Team, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine [22202110]; Education and Teaching Project of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Experimental Teaching Special Project) [SYJX2022008]; Meridian (Acupoint) -Viscera Regulation and Application Scientific Research Innovation Team, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine [220315]","National Key R&D & D Program of China; Acupoint-Viscera Correlation Study Youth Scientific Research Innovation Team, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Education and Teaching Project of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Experimental Teaching Special Project); Meridian (Acupoint) -Viscera Regulation and Application Scientific Research Innovation Team, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine","This work was supported by National Key R&D & D Program of China (No. 2022YFC3500705); Acupoint-Viscera Correlation Study Youth Scientific Research Innovation Team, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (22202110); Meridian (Acupoint) -Viscera Regulation and Application Scientific Research Innovation Team, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (220315); Education and Teaching Project of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Experimental Teaching Special Project) (SYJX2022008).",79,3,3,1,14,CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,EDINBURGH,"JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",0965-2299,1873-6963,COMPLEMENT THER MED,Complement.

In many current and future photonic devices, surfaces of a semiconductor crystal are a weak part causing significant photo-electric losses and malfunctions in applications. These surface challenges, many of which arise from material defects at semiconductor surfaces, include signal attenuation in waveguides, light absorption in light emitting diodes, non-radiative recombination of carriers in solar cells, leakage (dark) current of photodiodes, and light reflection at solar cell interfaces for instance. To reduce harmful surface effects, the optical and electrical passivation of devices has been developed for several decades, especially with the methods of semiconductor technology. Because atomic scale control and knowledge of surface-related phenomena have become relevant to increase the performance of different devices, it might be useful to enhance the bridging of surface physics to photonics. Toward that target, we review some evolving research subjects with open questions and possible solutions, which hopefully provide example connecting points between photonic device passivation and surface physics. One question is related to the properties of the wet chemically cleaned semiconductor surfaces which are typically utilized in device manufacturing processes, but which appear to be different from crystalline surfaces studied in ultrahigh vacuum by physicists. In devices, a defective semiconductor surface often lies at an embedded interface formed by a thin metal or insulator film grown on the semiconductor crystal, which makes the measurements of its atomic and electronic structures difficult. To understand these interface properties, it is essential to combine quantum mechanical simulation methods. This review also covers metal-semiconductor interfaces which are included in most photonic devices to transmit electric carriers to the semiconductor structure. Low-resistive and passivated contacts with an ultrathin tunneling barrier are an emergent solution to control electrical losses in photonic devices.","[Laukkanen, Pekka; Punkkinen, Marko; Kuzmin, Mikhail; Kokko, Kalevi] Univ Turku, Dept Phys & Astron, Turku, Finland; [Liu, Xiaolong; Radfar, Behrad; Vahanissi, Ville; Savin, Hele] Aalto Univ, Dept Elect & Nanoengn, Espoo, Finland; [Tukiainen, Antti; Hakkarainen, Teemu; Viheriala, Jukka; Guina, Mircea] Tampere Univ, Optoelect Res Ctr, Tampere, Finland",University of Turku; Aalto University; Tampere University,"Laukkanen, P (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Phys & Astron, Turku, Finland.",pekka.laukkanen@utu.fi,"Savin, Hele/E-5155-2012; Liu, Xiao-Long/ITT-1281-2023; Radfar, Behrad/T-6493-2017; Hakkarainen, Teemu/R-5977-2016; Vähänissi, Ville/AAT-8113-2021; Guina, Mircea/F-4183-2014","Savin, Hele/0000-0003-3946-7727; Liu, Xiao-Long/0000-0002-1976-492X; Radfar, Behrad/0000-0002-4261-3580; Hakkarainen, Teemu/0000-0001-6758-2496; Vähänissi, Ville/0000-0002-2681-5609; Laukkanen, Pekka/0000-0003-4220-985X; Guina, Mircea/0000-0002-9317-8187","Business Finlandhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014438 [338973, 338974, 354199, 331313]; Research Council of Finland [7479/31/2019, 1671/31/2018]; Academy of Finland",Business Finlandhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014438; Research Council of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland),"This work has been supported by the following Research Council of Finland projects: COLO #338973, COLO #338974, HyperGer #354199, and NIR #331313 and via to the Flagship on Photonics Research and Innovation 'PREIN' funded by Academy of Finland.

In addition to economic, social, technological and environmental limitations, this study examines the triumphs and challenges of incorporating solar-energy-powered cold storage into developing communities. The availability of on-farm storage and processing is a critical challenge facing small farmers, which hinders agricultural productivity. Thirty per cent of the food produced globally is lost after harvest, with the proportion being exceptionally high in low- and middle-income countries due to a lack of on-farm handling and storage facilities. Conventional cold-storage solutions have not taken off at the smallholder level, mainly due to a lack of availability and access to reliable grid electricity. Therefore, off-grid decentralized solar-powered cold-storage units can play a vital role in preserving the produce at production sites and enhancing livelihood and rural development with a minimal carbon footprint. To maintain low temperatures at every step of the agricultural value chain, known as the 'cold chain', several technology vendors aim to improve the shelf life and user benefit. Small-scale farmers, which account for two-thirds of all food losses, are another group they focus on. This study examines the existing situation, importance and potential opportunities of decentralized cold-storage systems for fresh fruit and vegetables. In addition to economic, social, technological and environmental limitations, this study examines the triumphs and challenges of incorporating solar-energy-powered cold storage into developing communities. Although the private sector, NGOs and some government agencies are working to promote decentralized cold-storage facilities, relatively little has been done so far to have a significant influence on post-harvest losses and food security. There are still knowledge gaps on decentralized cold-storage facilities. The primary operational constraint is the economic situation of end users and the lack of financing alternatives for smallholder farmers.","[Amjad, Waseem; Munir, Anjum; Akram, Fatima; Asghar, Furqan; Mahmood, Faisal] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Energy Syst Engn, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Amjad, Waseem] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, W Lafayette, IN USA; [Parmar, Aditya; Precoppe, Marcelo] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham Maritime, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England",University of Agriculture Faisalabad; Purdue University System; Purdue University; University of Greenwich,"Parmar, A (corresponding author), Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham Maritime, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England.",a.parmar@gre.ac.uk,"Mahmood, Faisal/GNH-1776-2022; Akram, Fatima/HJY-8419-2023; Precoppe, Marcelo/NXX-8168-2025; Asghar, Furqan/M-4558-2019; Amajd, Dr. Waseem/IAO-7905-2023","Mahmood, Faisal/0000-0003-4833-9225; Asghar, Furqan/0000-0002-6159-2236;",,,,93,22,27,4,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2515-4230,2515-396X,CLEAN ENERGY-CHINA,Clean Energy,JUN 1,2023,7.0,3,,,,635,653,,10.1093/ce/zkad015,0.0,,19,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Environmental",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Engineering,H0MA7,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:000992978600006,0

Human reliability analysis (HRA) methods can be used to evaluate the likelihood of human error in manufacturing tasks and identify potential sources of error. Performance shaping factors (PSFs) are internal and external factors that influence human performance and can affect the likelihood of human reliability estimates in HRA methods. Understanding the impact of PSFs on human performance in manufacturing is essential for developing effective strategies to minimize the likelihood of human error and improve the safety and efficiency of manufacturing processes. This systematic review scrutinizes the literature on PSFs within manufacturing, highlighting HRA applications. Using the PRISMA protocol, studies from 2000 to 2024 across engineering and psychology were examined, culminating in the analysis of 35 pertinent works. The review identifies and contrasts various PSF taxonomies from established HRA methods like SPAR-H, HEART, CREAM, and THERP, revealing their diverse applications in different manufacturing settings. The review also uncovers a tendency to devise taxonomies through the lens of experts' domain knowledge, particularly tailored to discrete manufacturing contexts. A critical gap is observed in the lack of a uniform PSF framework, with the current literature reflecting a disparate understanding of PSFs' roles, definitions, and interrelations. This absence is further pronounced by the inadequate integration of human factors in the dialogue surrounding Industry 4.0. The analysis points to the necessity of harmonizing PSFs to better assess human reliability amid technological integration. The findings emphasize the need for an industry-specific PSF framework that aligns with the intricacies of manufacturing operations, thus enabling more accurate HRA outcomes and informing strategies for error reduction and process optimization.","[Jha, Prameet Ranjan; Saleem, Jason J.; Wang, Xiaomei] Univ Louisville, Dept Ind Engn, 132 Eastern Pkwy, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Di Pasquale, Valentina] Univ Salerno, Dept Ind Engn, Fisciano, Campania, Italy",University of Louisville; University of Salerno,"Wang, XM (corresponding author), Univ Louisville, Dept Ind Engn, 132 Eastern Pkwy, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",Xiaomei.wang@louisville.edu,,"Jha, Prameet/0009-0009-7211-8677",,,,75,4,6,3,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1090-8471,1520-6564,HUM FACTOR ERGON MAN,Hum.

Advances in genetic diagnostic tools have facilitated the identification of several monogenic chromatin remodeling diseases that cause Neurodevelopmental disorders. Chromatin remodelers play a key role in the neuro-epigenetic landscape and regulation of brain development; it is therefore not surprising that mutations, leading to loss of protein function, result in aberrant neurodevelopment. Heterozygous, usually de novo mutations in histone lysine methyltransferases have been described in patients leading to haploinsufficiency, dysregulated protein levels and impaired protein function. Studies in animal models and patient-derived cell lines, have highlighted the role of histone lysine methyltransferases in the regulation of cell self-renewal, cell fate specification and apoptosis. To date, in depth studies of histone lysine methyltransferases in oncology have provided strong evidence of histone lysine methyltransferase dysregulation as a determinant of cancer progression and drug resistance. As a result, histone lysine methyltransferases have become an important therapeutic target for the treatment of different cancer forms. Despite recent advances, we still lack knowledge about the role of histone lysine methyltransferases in neuronal development. This has hampered both the study and development of precision therapies for histone lysine methyltransferases-related Neurodevelopmental disorders. In this review, we will discuss the current knowledge of the role of histone lysine methyltransferases in neuronal development and disease progression. We will also discuss how RNA-based technologies using small-activating RNAs could potentially provide a novel therapeutic approach for the future treatment of histone lysine methyltransferase haploinsufficiency in these Neurodevelopmental disorders, and how they could be first tested in state-of-the-art patient-derived neuronal models.","[Roth, Charlotte; Kurian, Manju A.; Barral, Serena] UCL, Great Ormond St Inst Child Hlth, Zayed Ctr Res Rare Dis Children, Dev Neurosci Programme,Mol Neurosci, London, England; [Kilpinen, Helena] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Life Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Kilpinen, Helena] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Kurian, Manju A.] Great Ormond St Hosp Sick Children, Dept Neurol, London, England",University of London; University College London; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; University of London; University College London; Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust,"Barral, S (corresponding author), UCL, Great Ormond St Inst Child Hlth, Zayed Ctr Res Rare Dis Children, Dev Neurosci Programme,Mol Neurosci, London, England.",s.barral@ucl.ac.uk,,"Kilpinen, Helena/0000-0001-6692-6154; Kurian, Manju Ann/0000-0003-3529-5075; Roth, Charlotte Jennifer Moea/0000-0003-0227-3339","NIHR GOSH BRC; Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity [VS0218]; NIHR Professorship [NIHR-RP-2016-07-019]; Rosetrees Trust [CF2\100018]; Jules Thorn Award for Biomedical Research [JTA-017]; Helsinki Institute of Life Science (HiLIFE), University of Helsinki, Finland; Wellcome Trust [207797/Z/17/Z]; Wellcome Trust [207797/Z/17/Z] Funding Source: Wellcome Trust","NIHR GOSH BRC; Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity; NIHR Professorship; Rosetrees Trust(Rosetrees Trust); Jules Thorn Award for Biomedical Research; Helsinki Institute of Life Science (HiLIFE), University of Helsinki, Finland(University of Helsinki); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust)","This work was partly funded by the NIHR GOSH BRC (the views expressed are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR, or the Department of Health).

Three main factors influence energy security: (1) the efficiency of resource use in energy production, (2) the extent of energy losses, and (3) the use of new energy sources. Novel food products can impact these factors, and this paper explores whether they are being studied in the context of reducing energy consumption. Specifically, we investigate the role of technical progress and know-how in the creation and development of novel food products and whether novel methods of food production using artificial intelligence aim to reduce energy expenditures while improving product quality, variety, and the use of new energy sources. This paper seeks to examine the impact determinants of novel foods on energy security, considering economic, technological, social, and environmental aspects of knowledge about new food. To implement the study, the relevant international literature published in the past ten years have been reviewed and methods of modeling, visualization, and descriptive statistics applied. The review is structured into three sections: the first section presents ways to save energy and other resources in the food production chain through the intensive use of artificial intelligence tools; the second section presents the development of novel food products; and the last section presents marketing challenges for novel foods. The findings show that the topic addressed by this paper is currently critical, with many authorities, research centers, food producers, and energy producers interested. However, the research problem remains open, as a systematic review of secondary sources revealed little knowledge of the topic under study, and each author's study presents a new solution. The conclusion is that utilizing new foods and innovative production techniques that require less energy not only enhances production diversity but also improves its quality.","[Skawinska, Eulalia] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, PL-65417 Zielona Gora, Poland; [Zalewski, Romuald I.] Polish Acad Sci, Commiss Commod Sci, PL-61772 Poznan, Poland",University of Zielona Gora; Polish Academy of Sciences,"Skawinska, E (corresponding author), Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, PL-65417 Zielona Gora, Poland.",e.skawinska@wez.uz.zgora.pl; r.zalewski@wez.uz.zgora.pl,"SKAWINSKA, EULALIA/KHE-0204-2024","SKAWINSKA, EULALIA/0000-0002-4532-6835; ZALEWSKI, ROMUALD/0000-0002-4219-6115",,,,112,2,2,1,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,ENERGIES,Energies,JAN,2024,17.0,1,,,,,,192,10.3390/en17010192,0.0,,19,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,EM1I2,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001139247900001,0

Therefore, it is essential to explore alternative, sustainable agricultural practices to meet the growing population's food needs. Sustainable agriculture is foundational to farm management, rural development, and water conservation. This includes sustainable practices such as crop rotation, intercropping, and planting crops with varying rooting depths to maximize soil moisture absorption, as well as mulching to improve nutrient recycling and enhance productivity in smallholder cropping systems. The adoption of sustainable agricultural practices has become a priority for smallholder farmers, policymakers, extension agents, and agricultural experts to improve agricultural productivity, contribute to food security, and generate income. However, adoption rates have been slow, especially in Southern Africa, due to a lack of access to technology, financial constraints, limited information, and limited knowledge. This review was conducted using a comprehensive literature search on the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices by legume smallholders, examining various factors that contribute to the failure of legume smallholder farmers to adopt new agricultural practices. The timeframe of the reviewed literature was from 2010 to 2024. The results showed that smallholder farmers face numerous challenges, including limited access to technology, inadequate knowledge, and insufficient financial resources. Research conducted by the Water Research Commission (WRC) indicates that commercial farmers have access to technology, and this group of farmers possesses more substantial financial resources compared to smallholder farmers. In the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices. It is essential to strengthen the linkage between researchers, agricultural extension, and legume smallholder farmers to promote sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs). Smallholder farmers must be informed about such interventions and sustainable agricultural practices to improve rural livelihoods and enhance resilience, adaptation, and responsiveness.","[Thobane, Jonathan; Ndoro, Jorine; Mokgehle, Salmina] Univ Mpumalanga, Sch Agr & Nat Sci, Private Bag X11283, ZA-1200 Mbombela, South Africa; [Molepo, Solly] Natl Agr Mkt Council NAMC, Markets & Econ Res Ctr, Private Bag X935, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Molepo, Solly] North West Univ, Indigenous Knowledge Syst Ctr, Mahikeng Campus,Private Bag X2046, ZA-2745 Mmabatho, South Africa; [Serote, Batizi] Tshwane Univ Technol, Dept Crop Sci, Private Bag X680, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Hlophe-Ginindza, Samkelisiwe; Mpandeli, Sylvester; Nhamo, Luxon] Water Res Commiss WRC, Water Utilisat Agr, ZA-0081 Pretoria, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; Tshwane University of Technology,"Mokgehle, S (corresponding author), Univ Mpumalanga, Sch Agr & Nat Sci, Private Bag X11283, ZA-1200 Mbombela, South Africa.",nonkie.molepo@gmail.com; batiziserote@gmail.com; salmina.mokgehle@ump.ac.za,"Mpandeli, Sylvester/KDP-0391-2024; Nhamo, Luxon/H-4000-2019","Nhamo, Luxon/0000-0003-2944-1769; Hlophe, Samkelisiwe/0000-0003-3084-4549; Mokgehle, Salmina Ngoakoana/0000-0001-6053-4408",Water Research Commission [C2023/2024-01368],Water Research Commission,This research was funded by the Water Research Commission (Project number: C2023/2024-01368).,124,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,OCT 13,2025,15.0,20,,,,,,2125,10.3390/agriculture15202125,0.0,,19,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,9CR0P,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001603185100001,0

Digital technology serves as a promising platform for supporting CPD for health care workers by providing educational content virtually and enabling virtual peer-to-peer and mentor interaction for enhanced learning. Digital strategies for CPD that foster virtual interaction can increase workforce retention and bolster the health workforce in LMICs. Objective: The objective of this integrative review was to evaluate the evidence on which digital platforms were used to provide CPD to health care workers and clinical students in LMICs, which was complemented with virtual peer-to-peer or mentor interaction. We phrased this intersection of virtual learning and virtual interaction as mobile-social learning. Methods: A comprehensive database and gray literature search was conducted to identify qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies, along with empirical evidence, that used digital technology to provide CPD and virtual interaction with peers or mentors. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed. Eligible articles were written in English, conducted in an LMIC, and used a mobile device to provide CPD and facilitate virtual peer-to-peer or mentor interaction. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened, followed by an assessment of the quality of evidence and an appraisal of the articles. A content analysis was then used to deductively code the data into emerging themes. Results: A total of 750 articles were identified, and 31 (4.1%) were included in the review. SMS text messaging and mobile instant messaging were the most common methods used to provide continuing education and virtual interaction between peers and mentors (25/31, 81%). Across the included articles, participants had high acceptability for using digital platforms for learning and interaction. Virtual peer interaction and mentorship were found to contribute to positive learning outcomes in most studies (27/31, 87%) through increased knowledge sharing, knowledge gains, improved clinical skills, and improved service delivery. Peer-to-peer and mentor interaction were found to improve social support and reduce feelings of isolation (9/31, 29%). There were several challenges in the implementation and use of digital technology for mobile-social learning, including limited access to resources (eg, internet coverage and stable electricity), flexibility in scheduling to participate in CPD, and sociobehavioral challenges among students. Conclusions: The summary suggests that mobile-social learning is a useful modality for curriculum dissemination and skill training and that the interface of mobile and social learning serves as a catalyst for improved learning outcomes coupled with increased social capital.","[Guillaume, Dominique; Troncoso, Erica; Bluestone, Julia; Fullerton, Judith] Jhpiego, 1615 Thames St 200, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA; [Guillaume, Dominique; Duroseau, Brenice] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Nursing, Baltimore, MD USA",Jhpiego; Johns Hopkins University,"Guillaume, D (corresponding author), Jhpiego, 1615 Thames St 200, Baltimore, MD 21231 USA.",dominique.guillaume@jhpiego.org,,"Troncoso, Erica/0000-0001-6295-3665; Guillaume-Rolland, Dominique/0000-0003-3963-4986; Duroseau, Brenice/0000-0003-2443-2070; Bluestone, Julia/0000-0002-4074-3445","Jhpiego, a Johns Hopkins University affiliate","Jhpiego, a Johns Hopkins University affiliate","This study was supported by Jhpiego, a Johns Hopkins University affiliate.",78,15,22,0,12,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",2369-3762,,JMIR MED EDUC,JMIR Med.

This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the behavioural determinants of European farmers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding sustainable pesticide use and evaluates the role of digital tools in facilitating Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we analysed 65 peer-reviewed articles published between 2011 and 2025, which were identified through Scopus and Web of Science. The synthesis reveals that while pro-environmental attitudes drive the intention to change, actual behaviour is frequently inhibited by loss aversion, 'clean field' social norms, and perceived economic risks. Digital tools-specifically Decision Support Systems (DSSs) and precision technologies-demonstrate technical potential to reduce pesticide loads but are constrained by the same behavioural barriers: a lack of trust in models, perceived complexity, and costs. Consequently, we propose a Psycho-Digital Integration Framework which posits that digital innovation acts as a catalyst only when embedded in systemic enablers-specifically green insurance schemes and independent advisory networks.

Sperm are the highly specialized motile cells prone to cryodamage during freezing. Moreover, buffalo, pig and sheep sperm are more susceptible to cryoinjury leading to increased semen rejection rates and substantial economic losses due to reduced fertility. Advances in freezing protocols and modulation in composition of semen diluents protect sperm from cryodamage; however, inconsistency and inter-individual variability in semen freezability exist due to multifactorial etiology. The use of molecular technologies, particularly genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics led to identification of potential biomarkers associated with cryotolerance. These omics-driven insights have not only enlightened our understanding of the molecular basis of cryoinjury but also has the potential in selecting bulls with good semen freezability. A multidisciplinary approach toward the development of targeted strategies such as supplementing extenders with novel cryotolerant biomolecules to mitigate the sperm damage. This review consolidates current knowledge on the molecular and physiological underpinnings of sperm cryodamage offering a holistic perspective that may guide refinement of existing cryopreservation protocols and extenders for improving sperm cryo-survivability in breeding males.","[Krishnappa, Balaganur; Binsila, Bala Krishnan; Arangasamy, Arunachalam; Archana, Santhanahalli Siddalingappa; Swathi, Divakar; Tomcy, Anjilikal Tomy; Ramya, Laxman; Selvaraju, Sellappan] ICAR Natl Inst Anim Nutr & Physiol, Anim Physiol Div, Reprod Physiol Lab, Bengaluru 560030, India; [Gopi, Marappan] ICAR Natl Inst Anim Nutr & Physiol, Anim Nutr Div, Bengaluru, India; [Ramachandran, Natesan] ICAR Natl Inst Anim Nutr & Physiol, Bioenerget & Environm Sci Div, Bengaluru, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Institute of Animal Nutrition & Physiology; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Institute of Animal Nutrition & Physiology; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Institute of Animal Nutrition & Physiology,"Krishnappa, B (corresponding author), ICAR Natl Inst Anim Nutr & Physiol, Anim Physiol Div, Reprod Physiol Lab, Bengaluru 560030, India.",drkittyb@rediffmail.com,"Divakar, Swathi/GNM-5928-2022; Balakrishnan, Binsila/OHV-2380-2025; Sellappan, Selvaraju/P-2412-2016",,,,,212,0,0,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1939-6368,1939-6376,SYST BIOL REPROD MED,Syst.

This unlimited developmental potential becomes quickly restricted as embryonic cells transition into a pluripotent state. The loss of totipotency seems a consequence of the zygotic genome activation (ZGA), a process that determines the switch from maternal to embryonic transcription, which in mice takes place following the first cleavage. ZGA confers to the totipotent cell a transient transcriptional profile characterized by the expression of stage -specific genes and a set of transposable elements that prepares the embryo for subsequent development. The timely silencing of this transcriptional program during the exit from totipotency is required to ensure proper development. Importantly, the molecular mechanisms regulating the transition from totipotency to pluripotency have remained elusive due to the scarcity of embryonic material. However, the development of new in vitro totipotent-like models together with advances in low -input genome-wide technologies, are providing a better mechanistic understanding of how this important transition is achieved. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the molecular determinants that regulate the exit from totipotency.","[Vega-Sendino, Maria; Ruiz, Sergio] NCI, Lab Genome Integr, CCR, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA",National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH Center for Cancer Research (CCR); NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI),"Ruiz, S (corresponding author), NCI, Lab Genome Integr, CCR, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",sergio.ruizmacias@nih.gov,"Ruiz, Sergio/G-1561-2016","Ruiz, Sergio/0000-0002-0177-6965",Intramural Research Program of the NIH,Intramural Research Program of the NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),Research in the S.R. laboratory is supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH.,81,2,2,1,23,PORTLAND PRESS LTD,LONDON,"1ST FLR, 10 QUEEN STREET PLACE, LONDON, ENGLAND",0300-5127,1470-8752,BIOCHEM SOC T,Biochem.

Over the last decade, the knowledge and awareness around meniscus injuries has increased and there is better understanding on the consequences of different treatment of meniscus injuries. These were historically often treated with nonoperative treatment or partial or subtotal meniscectomy, but developments in diagnosis, surgical techniques and outcomes have changed this paradigm. Horizontal cleavage tears are often located in the medial meniscus and benefit from meniscus repair as this decreases the peak stresses on the cartilage. Radial tears are most often located in the lateral meniscus excluding posterior horn medial meniscus tears - and lead to complete loss of meniscus function and should also be treated with meniscus repair.

As technological progress fuels demand, the reevaluation of end-of-life devices and electronic waste presents a sustainable approach to ensuring metal supplies. However, the extraction of critical metals from electronic waste necessitates careful management to mitigate material loss and address environmental concerns. Conventional large-scale hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical methods lack targeted selectivity for critical metals like Ga, In, and REEs. These metals are often lost in pyrometallurgical processes or require extensive purification following chemical leaching. Consequently, attention has shifted to emerging bioleaching and phytomining technologies as alternative selective recovery methods that adhere to sustainability criteria without excessive capital investment. Nevertheless, knowledge of these recovery mechanisms remains limited, and their application faces challenges such as longer processing times and slower yields. This review article seeks to provide insights into these novel technologies for recycling critical metals from endof-life materials by examining their mechanisms and key parameters, exploring potential optimization strategies, and assessing trade-offs to evaluate their feasibility and sustainability in large-scale operations.","[Erkmen, Aylin Nur; Juestel, Thomas; Altendorfner, Mirjam] FH Munster Univ Appl Sci, D-48565 Munster, Germany; [Ulber, Roland] Rheinland Pfalzische Tech Univ Kaiserslautern Land, Kaiserslautern, Germany","University of Applied Sciences, Muenster","Erkmen, AN (corresponding author), FH Munster Univ Appl Sci, D-48565 Munster, Germany.",aylin.erkmen@fh-muenster.de,"Jüstel, Thomas/T-1283-2017","Jüstel, Thomas/0000-0002-9455-5044; Erkmen, Aylin/0000-0001-5984-3836",,,,258,22,23,18,58,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

The detection of spatial and temporal landslide deformation, together with the acquisition of precursor information, is crucial for hazard prediction and landslide risk management. Advanced landslide monitoring systems based on remote sensing techniques (RSTs) play a crucial role in risk management and provide important support for early warning systems (EWSs) at local and regional scales. The purpose of this article is to present a review of the current state of knowledge in the development of RSTs used for identifying landslide precursors, as well as detecting, monitoring, and predicting landslides. Almost 200 articles from 2010 to 2024 were analyzed, in which the authors utilized RSTs to detect potential precursors for early warning of hazards. The applications, challenges, and trends of RSTs, largely dependent on the type of landslide, deformation pattern, hazards posed by the landslide, and the size of the area of interest, were also discussed. Although the article indicates some limitations of the RSTs used so far, integrating different techniques and technological developments offers the opportunity to create reliable EWSs and improve existing ones.","[Strzabala, Katarzyna; Cwiakala, Pawel; Puniach, Edyta] AGH Univ Krakow, Fac Geodata Sci Geodesy & Environm Engn, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland",AGH University of Krakow,"Cwiakala, P (corresponding author), AGH Univ Krakow, Fac Geodata Sci Geodesy & Environm Engn, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland.",strzabal@agh.edu.pl; pawelcwi@agh.edu.pl; epuniach@agh.edu.pl,"Puniach, Edyta/C-6946-2017; Ćwiąkała, Paweł/U-5830-2017","Puniach, Edyta/0000-0003-0607-0432; Ćwiąkała, Paweł/0000-0001-5526-0908",Program Excellence Initiative-Research University at the AGH University of Krakow,Program Excellence Initiative-Research University at the AGH University of Krakow,This research project was supported by the program Excellence Initiative-Research University at the AGH University of Krakow.,165,15,16,35,105,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,AUG,2024,16.0,15,,,,,,2781,10.3390/rs16152781,0.0,,39,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,C1G2D,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001286908200001,0

However, conventional processing methods such as microwave heating, burning charcoal treatment, boiling, and frying are energy-inefficient and often lead to inferior product quality. Superheated steam (SHS) is an innovative technology that offers many potential benefits to industry and is increasingly used in food industry. Compared to conventional processing methods, SHS holds higher heat transfer coefficients, which can reduce microorganisms on surface of foodstuffs efficiently. Additionally, SHS generates a low oxygen environment, which prevents lipid oxidation and harmful compounds generation. Furthermore, SHS can facilitate development of desired product quality, such as protein denaturation with functional characteristics, proper starch gelatinization, and can also reduce nutrient loss, and improve the physicochemical properties of foodstuffs. The current work provides a comprehensive review of the impact of SHS on the nutritional, physicochemical, and safety properties of various foodstuffs including meat, fruits, and vegetables, cereals, etc. Additionally, it also provides food manufacturers and researchers with basic knowledge and practical techniques for SHS processing of foodstuffs, which may improve the current scope of SHS and transfer current food systems to a healthy and sustainable one.","[Fang, Jiajia; Liu, Chongxin; Zhang, Chunjiang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci CAAS, Inst Food Sci & Technol, Key Lab Agroprod Proc, Minist Agr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Law, Chung-Lim] Univ Nottingham, Fac Engn, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Malaysia Campus, Semenyih, Selangor, Malaysia; [Mujumdar, Arun S.] McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Xiao, Hong-Wei] China Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Food Science & Technology, CAAS; University of Nottingham Malaysia; McGill University; China Agricultural University","Zhang, CJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci CAAS, Inst Food Sci & Technol, Key Lab Agroprod Proc, Minist Agr, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Xiao, HW (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xhwcaugxy@163.com; chjiang1976@126.com,"Law, Chung Lim/F-6582-2013; Liu, Chongxin/HGU-8324-2022","Law, Chung Lim/0000-0003-1305-4537; Liu, Chongxin/0000-0002-8171-152X; Xiao, Hong-Wei/0000-0001-6035-4677",National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFD0400505]; Science and Technology Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences [CAAS-ASTIP-2020-IFST-05]; Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund [S2020JBKY-21],National Key R&D Program of China; Science and Technology Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund,"This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFD0400505), the Science and Technology Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS-ASTIP-2020-IFST-05), and Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund (No. S2020JBKY-21).",102,53,59,9,213,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1040-8398,1549-7852,CRIT REV FOOD SCI,Crit.

A current challenge in the agricultural industry is the development of reliable methods for detecting plant diseases and plant stress. Existing disease detection methods mainly involve manually and visually assessing crops for visible disease indicators. The rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and hyperspectral imaging technology has created a vast potential for plant disease detection. UAV-borne hyperspectral remote sensing (HRS) systems with high spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions have replaced conventional manual inspection methods because they allow for more accurate cost-effective crop analyses and vegetation characteristics. This paper aims to provide an overview of the literature on HRS for disease detection based on deep learning algorithms. Prior articles were collected using the keywords hyperspectral, deep learning, UAV, and plant disease. This paper presents basic knowledge of hyperspectral imaging, using UAVs for aerial surveys, and deep learning-based classifiers. Generalizations about workflow and methods were derived from existing studies to explore the feasibility of conducting such research. Results from existing studies demonstrate that deep learning models are more accurate than traditional machine learning algorithms. Finally, further challenges and limitations regarding this topic are addressed.","[Kuswidiyanto, Lukas Wiku; Han, Xiongzhe] Kangwon Natl Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Dept Biosyst Engn, Chunchon 24341, South Korea; [Kuswidiyanto, Lukas Wiku; Han, Xiongzhe] Kangwon Natl Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Interdisciplinary Program Smart Agr, Chunchon 24341, South Korea; [Noh, Hyun-Ho] Natl Inst Agr Sci Rural Dev Adm, Dept Agrofood Safety & Crop Protect, Residual Agrochem Assessment Div, Wanju Gun 55365, South Korea",Kangwon National University; Kangwon National University,"Han, XZ (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Dept Biosyst Engn, Chunchon 24341, South Korea.;Han, XZ (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Interdisciplinary Program Smart Agr, Chunchon 24341, South Korea.",hanxiongzhe@kangwon.ac.kr,,"Noh, Hyun Ho/0000-0002-7568-8490; Han, Xiongzhe/0000-0001-8748-2265","Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development (Project) Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea [PJ017000]","Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development (Project) Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea","This study was carried out with the support of Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development (Project No. PJ017000) Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.",137,55,58,17,196,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,DEC,2022,14.0,23,,,,,,6031,10.3390/rs14236031,0.0,,24,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,6Z0FX,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:000897460700001,0

Performance degradation can result from either flooding due to excessive water accumulation or dehydration caused by insufficient membrane hydration. This review provides the first comprehensive and systematic analysis of water management strategies specifically tailored for dead-ended PEMFCs, integrating water transport mechanisms, dominant failure pathways, and their impacts on key components-including the gas diffusion layer (GDL), catalyst layer (CL), proton exchange membrane (PEM), and flow field channels-under both anode- and cathode-dead-ended conditions. A critical evaluation of both active and passive water management techniques is presented, covering approaches such as periodic purging, pressure modulation, flow field optimization, and passive drainage. Furthermore, this work identifies current technological limitations-such as low gas utilization and high reactant loss-and highlights emerging strategies aimed at achieving high-efficiency, zero-emission operation in constrained environments, including underwater and portable applications.

Anti-hail nets have been increasingly adopted to mitigate this risk, but the scientific literature on their effectiveness and future applications remains scattered, especially considering advances in digital agriculture. This study synthesizes current knowledge on the use of anti-hail nets in apple orchards through a systematic review and explores future perspectives involving digital technologies. A PRISMA-based review was conducted using three databases, revealing information regarding the studied countries, netting colors, and apple varieties, among others. A clear research gap was identified in integrating anti-hail nets with remote sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This paper also analyzes studies from Vacaria, Brazil, a key apple-producing region and part of the Semear Digital project, highlighting local efforts to use hail netting in commercial orchards. Potential applications of AI algorithms and remote sensing are proposed for hail netting assessment, orchard monitoring, and decision-making support.

This systematic review examines how microbiome engineering, bioinformatics, and precision agriculture might improve soil and sustainability. The reviews investigate how microbiome engineering, bioinformatics, and precision farming influence soil fertility, food production, and resilience. This review aims to uncover knowledge gaps and use existing data to create long-term agricultural development strategies. A thorough literature search was conducted on microbial inoculants, plant-microbe interactions, and soil microbiome. The research investigated 67 peer-reviewed publications published over the last decade to determine how technology affects agricultural ecosystems. Microbiome engineering, bioinformatics, and precision agriculture theories help to increase microbial diversity, simulate soil, and improve farming methods. Despite their optimism, cost, complexity, and ethics remain significant challenges. Research needs to advance in order to scale up soil health solutions that biotechnology provides while addressing cost issues. The review investigates how traditional farming methods can synergize with modern technology to develop sustainable agricultural systems as shown in graphical abstract.","[Nyamboga, Tom Ongesa] Kampala Int Univ, Sch Business & Management, Kampala, Uganda; [Ugwu, Okechukwu Paul-Chima; Ugwu, Jovita Nnenna; Alum, Esther Ugo; Eze, Val Hyginus Udoka; Ugwu, Chinyere N.; Ogenyi, Fabian C.; Okon, Michael Ben] Kampala Int Univ, Dept Publicat & Extens, Kampala, Uganda; [Ejemot-Nwadiaro, Regina Idu] Kampala Int Univ, Sch Allied Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, Kampala, Uganda",,"Ugwu, OPC (corresponding author), Kampala Int Univ Uganda, Dept Publicat & Extens, Kampala, Uganda.",okechukwup.cugwu@gmail.com,"EZE, UDOKA/ADW-9904-2022; Okon, Michael/HCH-7176-2022; Ejemot-Nwadiaro, Regina/L-7370-2019; Alum, Esther/IYT-3005-2023; Okechukwu Paul-Chima, Ugwu/AFL-2350-2022; UGWU, CHINYERE/JGC-9160-2023","NYAMBOGA, TOM ONGESA/0009-0004-7073-8219; Okon, Michael/0000-0001-5585-1134; Okechukwu Paul-Chima, Ugwu/0000-0003-3563-3521;",,,,70,1,2,15,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2331-1932,,COGENT FOOD AGR,Cogent Food Agr.,DEC 31,2025,11.0,1,,,,,,2519811,10.1080/23311932.2025.2519811,0.0,,28,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,3ZM4U,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001512707000001,0

This review synthesizes current knowledge of P. infestans and highlights its unique biology, sophisticated pathogenicity mechanisms, dynamic virulence factors, and management strategies. The pathogen employs a diverse arsenal of virulence factors such as effectors to suppress host immunity and manipulate cellular processes, while its genetic plasticity enables rapid adaptation to control measures. Environmental cues and host-pathogen co-evolution further complicate disease management, with climate change exacerbating these challenges. Despite advances in fungicides, resistant cultivars, and cultural practices, its ability to overcome control measures and evolve new virulence and functional traits underscores the need for innovative solutions. Emerging technologies including CRISPR-Cas9, RNA interference, and predictive modeling offer promising avenues for sustainable management of the pathogen. This review also calls for multidisciplinary approaches integrating genomics, ecology, and agronomy to develop durable strategies against P. infestans and ensure resilient agricultural systems in the face of evolving threats. Ultimately, this review provides a forward-looking perspective on how integrating these novel technologies ca with evolutionary-ecological principles can build sustainable and resilient management systems.","[Wang, Wen-Jing; Li, Jun; Zhao, Ge] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Agr Sci, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yan-Ping] Chengdu Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Life Sci, Sichuan Prov Key Lab Dev & Utilizat Characterist H, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Fan, Shaobin; Yang, Li-Na] Minjiang Univ, Fuzhou Inst Oceanog, Key Lab Conservat & Sustainable Utilizat Marine Bi, Fuzhou, Peoples R China; [Dong, Yu-Qing; Zhan, Jiasui] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Plant Pathol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Dong, Yu-Qing] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Zhengzhou University; Chengdu Normal University; Minjiang University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Sichuan Agricultural University,"Yang, LN (corresponding author), Minjiang Univ, Fuzhou Inst Oceanog, Key Lab Conservat & Sustainable Utilizat Marine Bi, Fuzhou, Peoples R China.;Zhan, JS (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Plant Pathol, Uppsala, Sweden.",yikeshu1114@126.com; Jiasui.zhan@slu.se,"Dong, Yuqing/NES-8230-2025",,Formas [2023-00616]; Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation High-level Talent Project [324RC536]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation General Project [2023M733257]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2024J09058]; Key R&D Project of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region [2024B02005]; Key Science and Technology Research and Development Program of Henan Province [252102320254]; Formas [2023-00616] Funding Source: Formas,Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation High-level Talent Project; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation General Project; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Key R&D Project of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; Key Science and Technology Research and Development Program of Henan Province; Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),This project is supported by Formas [Grant No. 2023-00616] and Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [Grant No. 2024J09058 and 2023J011414]; Key R&D Project of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region [2024B02005]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation General Project [2023M733257]; Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation High-level Talent Project [324RC536]; Key Science and Technology Research and Development Program of Henan Province [252102320254].,179,0,0,21,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2150-5594,2150-5608,VIRULENCE,Virulence,DEC 31,2025,16.0,1,,,,,,2586882,10.1080/21505594.2025.2586882,0.0,,22,Immunology; Infectious Diseases; Microbiology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Immunology; Infectious Diseases; Microbiology,9RN3X,41207691.0,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001613312000001,0

The current paper provides an overview of the existing knowledge on DAD of green waste or kitchen waste collected selectively. Key substrates characteristics (chemical composition, methane potential), novel reactor design and process conditions relevant to effective digestion at elevated dry matter content are considered. Of special interest is the process intensification techniques, impact of contamination and co-fermentation opportunity with other biodegradable wastes. This article also discusses energy and economic performance of DAD plants and puts their environmental burden in perspective versus other bio-waste treatment processes. The current legislation and DAD's role in the circular economy are also considered. Selectively collected biowaste has significant energy potential and dry anaerobic digestion is an effective technology, especially in areas with limited water availability, offering both waste volume reduction and minimized energy losses. The aim of this work is to introduce the potential of this technology as a sustainable option within the context of renewable energy and modern waste management.","[Bien, Beata; Grobelak, Anna; Bien, Jurand; Slawczyk, Daria] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Infrastruct & Environm, PL-42201 Czestochowa, Poland; [Kozlowski, Kamil; Wysokowska, Klaudia] Biogas Technol, Jana Wozniaka St 18, PL-62330 Nekla, Poland; [Rak, Mateusz] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Elect Engn, PL-42201 Czestochowa, Poland",Technical University Czestochowa; Technical University Czestochowa,"Grobelak, A (corresponding author), Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Infrastruct & Environm, PL-42201 Czestochowa, Poland.",beata.bien@pcz.pl; anna.grobelak@pcz.pl; jurand.bien@pcz.pl; daria.slawczyk@pcz.pl; kozlowski@biogastechnology.pl; k.wysokowska@biogastechnology.pl; mateusz.rak@pcz.pl,,"Grobelak, Anna/0000-0003-1972-9734; Sławczyk, Daria/0009-0003-4001-0342; Rak, Mateusz/0009-0001-1508-8530; Bień, Beata/0000-0003-3288-9804; Bień, Jurand/0000-0002-8544-7463","Czestochowa University of Technology, Faculty of Infrastructure and Environment","Czestochowa University of Technology, Faculty of Infrastructure and Environment","This research was funded by the statute subvention of Czestochowa University of Technology, Faculty of Infrastructure and Environment, subvention for 2025.",175,0,0,12,12,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,ENERGIES,Energies,AUG 22,2025,18.0,17,,,,,,4475,10.3390/en18174475,0.0,,35,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,7FH6Q,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001569661000001,0

However, this practice poses significant risks, including human loss and property damage, due to the high flow rate and velocity carried by roads. Moreover, urban roads with low flood-resilience may significantly hamper the transportation function during severe storms, leading to dysfunction of the city. Therefore, there is an urgent need to transform risk-oriented flood passages into resilient urban road-based flood passages. This paper presents a systematic review of existing methodologies in designing a road network-based flood passage system, along with the discussion of new technologies to enhance system resilience. The study also addresses current knowledge gaps and future directions. The results indicate that flood management measures based on the urban road network should integrate accessibility assessment, lifeline and emergency planning to ensure human well-being outcomes. Furthermore, the special needs and features of vulnerable groups must be taken into serious consideration during the planning stage. In addition, a data-driven approach is recommended to facilitate real-time management and evaluate future works.","[Shao, Zhiyu; Li, Yuexin; Chai, Hongxiang] Chongqing Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China; [Shao, Zhiyu; Li, Yuexin; Chai, Hongxiang] Chongqing Univ, Key Lab Ecol Environm, Minist Educ Three Gorges Reservoir Area, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China; [Gong, Huafeng] TY Lin Int Engn Consulting China Co Ltd, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China",Chongqing University; Chongqing University,"Shao, ZY (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China.;Shao, ZY (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Key Lab Ecol Environm, Minist Educ Three Gorges Reservoir Area, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China.",shaozhiyu@cqu.edu.cn,"chai, hongxiang/AAF-7240-2019; Roy, Abhijit/KCK-3889-2024","Roy, Abhijit/0009-0002-9603-8144",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) General Program [52270087],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) General Program(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) General Program (Grant No. 52270087).,113,12,16,16,135,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-2201,2095-221X,FRONT ENV SCI ENG,Front.

However, the current delay of childbearing leads to ovarian aging and the need of assisted reproduction technologies (ART). Telomere biology is one of the main pathways involved in organismal aging. Thus, this review will focus on the knowledge acquired during the last 2 years about the telomere pathway and its influence on female fertility and the consequences for the newborn. Recent findings New research on telomere biology reaffirms the relationship of telomere attrition and female infertility. Shorter maternal telomeres, which could be aggravated by external factors, underly premature ovarian aging and other complications including preeclampsia, preterm birth and idiopathic pregnancy loss. Finally, the telomere length of the fetus or the newborn is also affected by external factors, such as stress and nutrition. Recent evidence shows that telomeres are implicated in most processes related to female fertility, embryo development and the newborn's health. Thus, telomere length and telomerase activity may be good biomarkers for early detection of ovarian and pregnancy failures, opening the possibility to use telomere therapies to try to solve the infertility situation.","[Cordova-Oriz, Isabel; Chico-Sordo, Lucia; Varela, Elisa] Inst Invest Sanitaria Fe IIS Fe, IVI Fdn, Valencia, Spain; [Varela, Elisa] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Varela, E (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Edificio Dept 2, Av Atenas,S-N, Madrid 28922, Spain.",Mariaelisa.Varela@ivirma.com,,"Córdova-Oriz, Isabel/0000-0003-3272-2406; Varela, Elisa/0000-0002-5361-3877","Instituto de Salud Carlos III (Spanish Government) [PI20/00252]; FEDER [IDI-20190160, IDI20181240]; FINOX [FORWARD 2018_6]; IVIRMA [1711-FIVI-111-MV, 1707-FIVI-084-MV, 1711-FIVI112-MV, 2006-FIVI-047-MV]",Instituto de Salud Carlos III (Spanish Government)(Instituto de Salud Carlos III); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); FINOX; IVIRMA,The Laboratory of Telomeres and Reproduction is supported by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (Spanish Government) through PI20/00252 to E.V.; by CDTI and FEDER through IDI-20190160 and IDI20181240 to J.A.G.V.; by FINOX through FORWARD 2018_6 to E.V. and J.A.G.V. and by IVIRMA (1711-FIVI-111-MV; 1707-FIVI-084-MV; 1711-FIVI112-MV; 2006-FIVI-047-MV).,110,17,18,0,23,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1040-872X,1473-656X,CURR OPIN OBSTET GYN,Curr.

It focuses on their design, operation, and the incorporation of advanced technologies like phase change materials. Solar drying is advocated as an effective approach for fruit preservation, reducing post-harvest losses and maintaining nutritional quality. The categorization encompasses various solar dryer concepts classified by air flow (natural, forced, and combined systems), operational modes (direct, indirect, and mixed), and building structures (cabinet, tunnel, greenhouse, etc.). The role of PCMs in enhancing dryer efficiency is significant, as they regulate temperature, reduce energy fluctuations, and facilitate continuous operation during periods of low solar radiation. This review critically examines the key properties of PCMs. It focuses on their thermophysical characteristics, classifications, and strategic applications in solar dryers. Recent innovations demonstrate the significant potential of PCMs to improve efficiency, optimize energy consumption, and enhance product quality. The review identifies research gaps in previous studies. It highlights the potential for further investigation into the application of PCM in solar dryer systems.

Despite decades of research, we are still lacking in ALS disease-modifying treatments. In this review, we document the current research from patient studies, rodent models, and human stem cell models in understanding the mechanisms of corticomotor circuit dysfunction and its implication in ALS.

This study critically analyses these challenges, identifying opportunities and risks in various academic disciplines and practices. A systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA method of publications from January 2024 to January 2025. Based on the selected works (n = 60), through a systematic and rigorous examination, this study identifies ethical challenges in teaching and research; opportunities and risks of its integration into academic practice; specific artificial intelligence tools categorised according to study approach; and a contribution to the current debate, providing criteria and practical guidelines for academics. In conclusion, it can be stated that the integration of AI offers significant opportunities, such as the optimisation of research and personalised learning, as well as notable human and ethical risks, including the loss of critical thinking, technological dependence, and the homogenisation of ideas. It is essential to adopt a conscious approach, with clear guidelines that promote human supervision, ensuring that AI acts as a tool for improvement rather than for the replacement of intelligent human performance, and that it supports human action and discernment in the creation of knowledge.","[Llerena-Izquierdo, Joe; Ayala-Carabajo, Raquel] Univ Politecn Salesiana, Guayaquil 090901, Ecuador",Universidad Politecnica Salesiana,"Llerena-Izquierdo, J; Ayala-Carabajo, R (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Salesiana, Guayaquil 090901, Ecuador.",jllerena@ups.edu.ec; rayala@ups.edu.ec,"Ayala Carabajo, Raquel/LTZ-1987-2024; Llerena-Izquierdo, Joe/B-5941-2014",,,,,60,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9709,INFORMATICS-BASEL,Informatics-Basel,OCT 13,2025,12.0,4,,,,,,111,10.3390/informatics12040111,0.0,,26,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,AF2FZ,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001646709100001,0

The intense cultivation of crops has resulted in the depletion of available nutrients from soil, thereby demanding the application of excess nutrients to soil to improve yield. Thus, mineral fertilizer discovery and application have, in many ways, contributed greatly to meeting global food demands. However, aside from the positive effects of mineral fertilizers, their excessive application to soil produces large amounts of pollutants that affect environmental sustainability. This necessitates the study of the major mineral fertilizer elements (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)), the forms in which they are applied to soil, and their chemistry/reactions in soil. Here, we reviewed the forms of different N, P, and K mineral fertilizers to provide current knowledge on their constituents, the chemistry of N, P, and K in soil to understand the reactions they undertake in soil, the efficient methods of fertilizer application for environmental sustainability, the effects of mineral fertilizer loss to the environment, and improved fertilization technologies for environmental sustainability.

Today, while global interest in traditional medicine is growing, TAIM ancestral knowledge remains unknown and unexplored. The purpose of this study is to provide baseline information on the status of TAIM research to guide future research and contribute to the growth of the sector. The focus of the study is the Fertile Crescent, a region of the Arab World endowed with a rich and diverse eco-geography. The method adopted was a scoping review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The databases used included the Arab World Research Source: Al Masdar, CAB Direct, Iraqi Academic Scientific Journals, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. The timeline of the search spanned from the database inception date to June 2024. The search led to 10,171 records which were subsequently reduced to 1,990 publications after deleting duplicates and performing a two-stage screening. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology was used to analyze the data focusing on reported plant species, treatment applications, study types and countries. The Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) Turbo, a large language model, was used to extract the key features and the results were validated by the researchers. The findings revealed that the types of studies were mostly laboratory-based (86%), while few studies (14%) were field based. The top five treatment applications include cancer (29%), bacterial infections (22%), inflammation (12%), fungal infections (9%), and diabetes (8%). The most notable plant species that were under investigation in the various studies were Nigella sativa L. (Ranunculaceae), Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Lamiaceae), Salvia fruticosa Mill (Lamiaceae), Teucrium polium L. (Lamiaceae), and Thymus vulgaris L. (Lamiaceae). In this review we discuss our findings which suggest potential avenues for further developing TAIM research and exploring the development of botanical drugs. Our findings also revealed that the number of ethnobotanical studies was limited suggesting an urgent need to prevent the loss of ancestral knowledge by formalizing it through evidence-based research and policy guidelines. Addressing these gaps through interdisciplinary collaboration and improved data-sharing mechanisms will be crucial for advancing TAIM research and medicinal plants.","[Al-Sammarraie, Rawan Nihad; Zurayk, Rami; Talhouk, Salma N.] Amer Univ Beirut, Maroun Semaan Fac Engn & Architecture, Sch Architecture & Design, Landscape Design & Ecosyst Management, Beirut, Lebanon; [Al Mubasher, Hadi; Awad, Mariette] Amer Univ Beirut, Maroun Semaan Fac Engn & Architecture, Sch Architecture & Design, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Beirut, Lebanon; [Naalbandian, Sally] Univ Lib, Amer Univ Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon; [Darwiche, Nadine] Amer Univ Beirut, Fac Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Beirut, Lebanon; [Romani, Maya] Amer Univ Beirut, Fac Med, Dept Family Med, Beirut, Lebanon; [Al-Sammarraie, Rawan Nihad] Al Naji Univ, Coll Pharm, Al Naji, Baghdad, Iraq",American University of Beirut; American University of Beirut; American University of Beirut; American University of Beirut; American University of Beirut,"Talhouk, SN (corresponding author), Amer Univ Beirut, Maroun Semaan Fac Engn & Architecture, Sch Architecture & Design, Landscape Design & Ecosyst Management, Beirut, Lebanon.",ntsalma@aub.edu.lb,"Al-Sammarraie, Rawan/NHQ-7419-2025; Zurayk, Rami/CAG-6387-2022; Darwiche, Nadine/AGT-2743-2022; Nalbandian, Salpy/I-8206-2016","Al-Sammarraie, Rawan/0009-0000-1147-0946;",Middle East Partnership Initiative - Tomorrow's Leaders Graduate program at the American University of Beirut [SNEAAC19CA0037]; University Research Board (URB) of the American University of Beirut,Middle East Partnership Initiative - Tomorrow's Leaders Graduate program at the American University of Beirut; University Research Board (URB) of the American University of Beirut,The authors are appreciative of the support and resources provided by the Science and Agriculture Library at the American University of Beirut to complete this analysis.r The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

The objectives of this review were to describe and analyse the methods utilised for creating 3DPAMs used in teaching human anatomy and for evaluating its pedagogical contribution.Methods An electronic search was conducted on PubMed using the following terms: education, school, learning, teaching, learn, teach, educational, three-dimensional, 3D, 3-dimensional, printing, printed, print, anatomy, anatomical, anatomically, and anatomic. Data retrieved included study characteristics, model design, morphological evaluation, educational performance, advantages, and disadvantages.Results Of the 68 articles selected, the cephalic region was the most studied (33 articles); 51 articles mentioned bone printing. In 47 articles, the 3DPAM was designed from CT scans. Five printing processes were listed. Plastic and its derivatives were used in 48 studies. The cost per design ranged from 1.25 USD to 2800 USD. Thirty-seven studies compared 3DPAM to a reference model. Thirty-three articles investigated educational performance. The main advantages were visual and haptic qualities, effectiveness for teaching, reproducibility, customizability and manipulability, time savings, integration of functional anatomy, better mental rotation ability, knowledge retention, and educator/student satisfaction. The main disadvantages were related to the design: consistency, lack of detail or transparency, overly bright colours, long printing time, and high cost.Conclusion This systematic review demonstrates that 3DPAMs are feasible at a low cost and effective for teaching anatomy. More realistic models require access to more expensive 3D printing technologies and substantially longer design time, which would greatly increase the overall cost. Choosing an appropriate image acquisition modality is key. From a pedagogical viewpoint, 3DPAMs are effective tools for teaching anatomy, positively impacting the learning outcomes and satisfaction level. The pedagogical effectiveness of 3DPAMs seems to be best when they reproduce complex anatomical areas, and they are used by students early in their medical studies.","[Brumpt, Eleonore; Bertin, Eugenie; Tatu, Laurent; Louvrier, Aurelien] Univ Franche Comte, 19 Rue Ambroise Pare, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Brumpt, Eleonore] CHU Besancon, Radiol, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Brumpt, Eleonore] Univ Franche Comte, Lab Nano Med Imagerie Therapeut, EA 4662, 16 Route Gray, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Brumpt, Eleonore] UFR Sante, Anat Dept, 19 Rue Ambroise Pare,CS 71806, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Bertin, Eugenie; Louvrier, Aurelien] CHU Besancon, Chirurg Maxillofaciale Stomatol & Odontol Hosp, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Tatu, Laurent] CHU Besancon, Dept Psychiat, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Tatu, Laurent] Univ Franche Comte, Lab Neurosci Integrat & Clin, EA 481, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Louvrier, Aurelien] CHU Besancon, Plateforme I3DM Impress 3D Med, F-25000 Besancon, France",Universite Marie et Louis Pasteur; Universite Marie et Louis Pasteur; CHU Besancon; Universite Marie et Louis Pasteur; Universite Marie et Louis Pasteur; Universite Marie et Louis Pasteur; CHU Besancon; Universite Marie et Louis Pasteur; CHU Besancon; Universite Marie et Louis Pasteur; Universite Marie et Louis Pasteur; CHU Besancon,"Brumpt, E (corresponding author), Univ Franche Comte, 19 Rue Ambroise Pare, F-25000 Besancon, France.;Brumpt, E (corresponding author), CHU Besancon, Radiol, F-25000 Besancon, France.;Brumpt, E (corresponding author), Univ Franche Comte, Lab Nano Med Imagerie Therapeut, EA 4662, 16 Route Gray, F-25000 Besancon, France.;Brumpt, E (corresponding author), UFR Sante, Anat Dept, 19 Rue Ambroise Pare,CS 71806, F-25030 Besancon, France.",eleonore.brumpt@univ-fcomte.fr,,", Bertin Eugénie/0009-0008-1932-276X",RITM-BFC program [ANR-17-NCUN-0003]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-17-NCUN-0003] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),RITM-BFC program; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This project has been performed thanks to the RITM-BFC program (contract ANR-17-NCUN-0003).,89,34,42,7,19,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1472-6920,BMC MED EDUC,BMC Med.

These simulations offer immersive environments and technologies, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence that have the potential to revolutionize medical training by providing realistic, hands-on experiences in diagnosing and treating patients, practicing surgical procedures, and enhancing clinical decision-making skills. This scoping review aimed to examine the evolution of simulation technology and the emergence of metaverse applications in medical professionals' training, guided by Friedman's three dimensions in medical education: physical space, time, and content, along with an additional dimension of assessment.MethodsIn this scoping review, we examined the related literature in six major databases including PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and ERIC. A total of 173 publications were selected for the final review and analysis. We thematically analyzed these studies by combining Friedman's three-dimensional framework with assessment.ResultsOur scoping review showed that Metaverse technologies, such as virtual reality simulation and online learning modules have enabled medical education to extend beyond physical classrooms and clinical sites by facilitating remote training. In terms of the Time dimension, simulation technologies have made partial but meaningful progress in supplementing traditional time-dependent curricula, helping to shorten learning curves, and improve knowledge retention. As for the Content dimension, high-quality simulation and metaverse content require alignment with learning objectives, interactivity, and deliberate practice that should be developmentally integrated from basic to advanced skills. With respect to the Assessment dimension, learning analytics and automated metrics from metaverse-enabled simulation systems have enhanced competency evaluation and formative feedback mechanisms. However, their integration into high-stakes testing is limited, and qualitative feedback and human observation remain crucial.ConclusionOur study provides an updated perspective on the achievements and limitations of using simulation to transform medical education, offering insights that can inform development priorities and research directions for human-centered, ethical metaverse applications that enhance healthcare professional training.","[Popov, Vitaliy; Mateju, Natalie; Jeske, Caris] Univ Michigan, Med Sch, Dept Learning Hlth Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lewis, Kadriye O.] UMKC Sch Med, Childrens Mercy Kansas City, Dept Pediat, Kansas City, MO USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City; Children's Mercy Hospital,"Popov, V (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Med Sch, Sch informat, Dept Learning Hlth Sci, Victor Vaughan 217,1111 Catherine St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",vipopov@umich.edu,"; Popov, Vitaliy/HLQ-7140-2023","Lewis, Kaiye/0000-0001-5947-409X; Popov, Vitaliy/0000-0003-2348-5285",National Science Foundation [2202451],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant number 2202451.,153,19,22,10,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0785-3890,1365-2060,ANN MED,Ann.

While conventional WWTPs achieve moderate removal efficiencies (60%-99%), their performance is highly variable for larger, denser particles (e.g., polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate) due to complex interactions between particle characteristics (e.g., size distribution, shape anisotropy, and biofilm colonization), fluid dynamics (e.g., turbulent kinetic energy, and shear stresses), and process design parameters (e.g., retention times, and tank geometries). This review systematically evaluates the fate and transport dynamics of HDMPs in WWTPs, highlighting the underexplored role of dimensionless parameters (e.g., Shields parameter theta, particle Reynolds number Rep, Stokes number St, Densimetric Froude number Fr', particle shape factors psi, Rouse number Z, and biofilm buoyancy number Bf) in predicting their behavior across treatment stages and post-discharge environments. The study critically assesses knowledge gaps in existing removal technologies, ranging from membrane bioreactors (fouling risks) to emerging techniques such as electrocoagulation (energy costs), and identifies methodological shortcomings in sampling, analysis, and reporting that hinder global comparability. Key findings reveal that particle-fluid interactions (e.g., resuspension thresholds, and turbulent mixing) are poorly quantified for HDMPs, necessitating the development of revised hydrodynamic models that incorporate shape factors and biofilm effects. Additionally, synergistic stressors (e.g., temperature, and co-pollutants) are found to exacerbate ecological risks but remain understudied. Meanwhile, standardised protocols for HDMP characterisation and dimensionless parameter frameworks are urgently needed to unify research and policy efforts. The study proposes three priority research directions: (i) development of cost-effective, scalable hybrid systems (e.g., coagulation-membrane bioreactors); (ii) integration of dimensionless parameters into WWTP design and outfall modelling; and (iii) long-term studies on HDMPs' ecological impacts under realistic exposure scenarios. By bridging fundamental hydrodynamics with applied engineering, this review provides a roadmap to mitigate HDMP pollution through science-informed policy and innovation.","[Otoo, Ebenezer; Mohammadian, Abdolmajid] Univ Ottawa, Dept Civil Engn, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Otoo, E (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Civil Engn, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",eotoo102@uottawa.ca,"Mohammadian, Abdolmajid/A-2995-2015; Otoo, Ebenezer/KEI-4426-2024","Otoo, Ebenezer/0000-0003-1956-8002",,,,158,0,0,3,3,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"123 Slater Street, Suite 610, OTTAWA, ON K1P 5H2, CANADA",1208-6053,1181-8700,ENVIRON REV,Environ.

Neurologists have concerns about potential neurological side effects, profits, and timing of COVID-19 vaccines. This study aimed to review systematically research for the COVID-19 vaccine and neurological complications. Data was searched in Scopus, ISI web of knowledge, Medline, PubMed, Wiley, Embase, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and Clinical Trials, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Two reviewer authors individually searched and assessed the titles and abstracts of all articles. The third reviewer resolved disagreement between them. Data were documented regarding study location, study design, type of complications, number of patients, various types of COVID-19 vaccine, and type of neurological complications. Six studies in COVID-19 vaccine and neurological complications include two studies about neurological manifestations after the mRNA vaccines, four records about side effects of vector-based vaccine were included in the study. The main neurological complication associated mRNA vaccines were body aches, paresthesia, and difficulty walking, erythema migrans lesion, fatigue, myalgia, and pain in the left lateral deltoid region. The major neurological complication related to vector-based vaccines were urinary retention difficulty, feeding and ambulating, arm soreness, mild fatigue, chills, left-sided facial droop, headaches, a generalized epileptic seizure, hemianopia, and mild aphasia, acute somnolence and right-hand hemiparesis, acute transverse myelitis, deep vein thrombosis in her left leg, a vigilance disorder and a twitching, a severe immobilizing opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, and encephalitis. A large spectrum of severe neurological unfavorable has been reported. These complications could occur as a result of molecular stimulation and later neuronal damage. Generally, the advantages of COVID-19 vaccination are dominant on the risks of a neurological complication at both individual and population levels. Future investigations will be required to find any relationship between neurological complications and COVID-19 vaccines principally as new strains of the virus and new vaccines are technologically advanced against them.","[Molaee, Hamideh] Baqiyatallah Univ Med Sci, Trauma Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Allahyari, Fakhri; Nejad, Javad Hosseini] Baqiyatallah Univ Med Sci, Neurosci Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran",Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences (BMSU); Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences (BMSU),"Molaee, H (corresponding author), Baqiyatallah Univ Med Sci, Trauma Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran.",dr.f.allahyari@gmail.com; hmolaei2021@gmail.com; javadhoseini1360@gmail.com,,,,,,65,14,14,0,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0939-5075,1865-7125,Z NATURFORSCH C,Z.Naturforsch.(C),JAN 27,2023,78.0,1-2,,,,1,8,,10.1515/znc-2022-0092,0.0,SEP 2022,8,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,8A5AJ,36087300.0,Bronze,2026-02-03,WOS:000852305800001,0

Synthesized evidence on current interventions and their efficacy are emerging. This scoping review is an effort to aggregate Canadian and Australian digital health initiatives used to prevent opioid-related deaths and minimize harm, prior to and particularly during the pandemic of SARs-COVID-19, when the crisis escalated. Methods: The Joanna Briggs Institute's methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews was used. Peer reviewed and gray literature published between January 2016 to October 2021 were included. Search translation was performed across CINAHL, Cochrane, SCOPUS, MEDLINE Complete, and ProQuest Public Health with consistent use of key search terms. Citation checks were also conducted. Studies included were written in English and reported on digital technologies to prevent opioid-related harm and/or mortality in participants aged 18 years or older in Australia and Canada. Results: A total of 16 publications were included in the final analysis (Australia = 5; Canada = 11). The most frequently reported digital technologies were telehealth to support access to treatment (n = 3) and mobile applications for overdose monitoring and prevention (n = 3). Telehealth-delivered opioid replacement therapy demonstrated equal outcomes and treatment retention rates compared to in-person and mobile applications for overdose monitoring demonstrated lifesaving capability through direct linkages with emergency response services. Conclusions: Digital interventions to minimize opioid crisis related harm and overdose prevention are fast emerging in Australia and Canada. During the pandemic, the crisis escalated in both countries as a public health emergency, and different initiatives were trialed. Digital harm reduction solutions via mobile apps (or SaaS solutions) were found to have the potential to prevent accidental overdose deaths and save lives, if rendered through privacy preserved, secure and trust enabled methods that empower users. Knowledge sharing between the two countries, relating to suitable interventions, may add significant value in combatting the escalating opioid crisis in the post pandemic era.","[Donnell, Andrea; Unnithan, Chandana; Hanna, Fahad] Torrens Univ Australia, Dept Hlth, Program Publ Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Tyndall, Jessica] Torrens Univ Australia, Lib & Learning Serv, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Torrens University Australia; Torrens University Australia,"Donnell, A (corresponding author), Torrens Univ Australia, Dept Hlth, Program Publ Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",andrea_donnell@outlook.com,"; Hanna, Fahad/J-2602-2019","Unnithan, Chandana/0000-0002-1832-8499; Tyndall, Jess/0000-0002-4632-8621; Hanna, Fahad/0000-0002-0494-9585",,,,59,13,13,0,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-2565,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

Many educators within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) related degree programs see student benefits that could be derived from bringing these modalities into classrooms, which include but are not limited to: a better understanding of each of the subdisciplines and the coordination necessary between them, visualizing oneself as a professional in AEC, and visualization of difficult concepts to increase engagement, self-efficacy, and learning. These benefits, in turn, help recruitment and retention efforts for these degree programs. However, given the number of technologies available and the fact that they quickly become outdated, there is confusion about the definitions of the different XR modalities and their unique capabilities. This lack of knowledge, combined with limited faculty time and lack of financial resources, can make it overwhelming for educators to choose the right XR modality to accomplish particular educational objectives. There is a lack of guidance in the literature for AEC educators to consider various factors that affect the success of an XR intervention. Grounded in a comprehensive literature review and the educational framework of the Model of Domain Learning, this paper proposes a decision-making framework to help AEC educators select the appropriate technologies, platforms, and devices to use for various educational outcomes (e.g., learning, interest generation, engagement) considering factors such as budget, scalability, space/equipment needs, and the potential benefits and limitations of each XR modality. To this end, a comprehensive review of the literature was performed to decipher various definitions of XR modalities and how they have been previously utilized in AEC Education. The framework was then successfully validated at a summer camp in the School of Building Construction at Georgia Institute of Technology, highlighting the importance of using appropriate XR technologies depending on the educational context.","[Spitzer, Barbara Oliveira; Ma, Jae Hoon; Erdogmus, Ece] Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Design, Sch Bldg Construct, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Kreimer, Ben] Emerging Media Consulting LLC, Lincoln, NE 68510 USA; [Ryherd, Erica] Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Coll Engn, Durham Sch Architectural Engn & Construct, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Diefes-Dux, Heidi] Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Coll Engn, Biol Syst Engn, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Erdogmus, E (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Design, Sch Bldg Construct, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",ece.erdogmus@design.gatech.edu,"Diefes-Dux, Heidi/JLM-8372-2023; Erdogmus, Ece/A-8491-2009","Diefes-Dux, Heidi/0000-0003-3635-1825; Erdogmus, Ece/0000-0002-6447-1157; Ma, JaeHoon/0000-0002-6279-1608",National Science Foundation (NSF); [2202290],National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF));,"This work was made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF #2202290).

Results of database searches were uploaded to Rayyan for screening of titles, abstracts and full texts. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, twelve studies published across seventeen articles between 2002 and 2021 were included in this review. These studies were assessed for bias using the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.ResultsCultural tailoring was an element of 91.7% of the studies. More than one-third of the studies utilized community health workers to build relationships with the communities being studied. Overall, lifestyle interventions targeted for Asian American populations led to improvements in both physical and psychosocial outcomes such as mental health, self-efficacy, disease knowledge, behavior change and/or quality of life.ConclusionThis systematic review of interventions targeting cardiometabolic outcomes among Asian American populations reveals many gaps in the existing literature. For one, there is limited research on the association of various sociodemographic variables with participants' success and/or retention in health intervention studies among Asian American populations. Interventions utilizing technology have also been lacking with this population and are a potential tool for improving health outcomes.Impact and ImplicationsDiabetes and cardiovascular disease are both ranked in the top five causes of Asian American deaths. The reviewed articles' findings were mixed but suggest that culturally tailored interventions aimed to improve the cardiometabolic health of Asian Americans are generally effective. As we move forward, this body of research serves as a crucial foundation for shaping the future of culturally tailored interventions, guiding nurse researchers to develop more effective strategies for treating and preventing these prevalent and cardiometabolic conditions.Reporting MethodCompleted PRISMA checklist is available upon request.No Patient or Public ContributionThis systematic review better informs future directions for person-centred, community-based and participatory research.","[Nguyen, Angelina P.] Baylor Univ, Louise Herrington Sch Nursing, Dallas 76706, TX USA; [Tadano, Mamie; Im, Brianna Y.; Nguyen, Tam H.] Boston Coll, Connell Sch Nursing, Boston, MA USA; [Kim, Miyong T.] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Nursing, Austin, TX USA",Baylor University; Boston College; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Nguyen, AP (corresponding author), Baylor Univ, Louise Herrington Sch Nursing, Dallas 76706, TX USA.",angelina_nguyen@baylor.edu,,"Nguyen, Angelina/0000-0001-9410-0560",Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation,Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation),"The authors would like to thank Ms. Wanda Anderson, Librarian, at Boston College, for database search assistance and John E.

However, agricultural yields in Africa are far below their potential. One of the challenges leading to low productivity is Africa's poor soil quality. Effective soil fertility management is an essential key factor for optimizing agricultural productivity while ensuring environmental sustainability. Key soil fertility properties-such as soil organic carbon (SOC), nutrient levels (i.e., nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), moisture retention (MR) or moisture content (MC), and soil texture (clay, sand, and loam fractions)-are critical factors influencing crop yield. In this context, this study conducts an extensive literature review on the use of hyperspectral remote sensing technologies, with a particular focus on freely accessible hyperspectral remote sensing data (e.g., PRISMA, EnMAP), as well as an evaluation of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for analyzing and processing spectral data to map soil attributes. More specifically, the study examined progress in applying hyperspectral remote sensing technologies for monitoring and mapping soil properties in Africa over the last 15 years (2008-2024). Our results demonstrated that (i) only very few studies have explored high-resolution remote sensing sensors (i.e., hyperspectral satellite sensors) for soil property mapping in Africa; (ii) there is a considerable value in AI approaches for estimating and mapping soil attributes, with a strong recommendation to further explore the potential of deep learning techniques; (iii) despite advancements in AI-based methodologies and the availability of hyperspectral sensors, their combined application remains underexplored in the African context. To our knowledge, no studies have yet integrated these technologies for soil property mapping in Africa. This review also highlights the potential of adopting hyperspectral data (i.e., encompassing both imaging and spectroscopy) integrated with advanced AI models to enhance the accurate mapping of soil fertility properties in Africa, thereby constituting a base for addressing the question of yield gap.","[El Bouanani, Nadir; Laamrani, Ahmed; Bourriz, Mohamed; El-Battay, Ali; Amazirh, Abdelhakim; Chehbouni, Abdelghani] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, Ctr Remote Sensing Applicat CRSA, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco; [El Bouanani, Nadir; Bourriz, Mohamed; Bourzeix, Francois; Abdelali, Hamd Ait] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, Analyt Lab ALAB, Rabat 11103, Morocco; [Laamrani, Ahmed] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Hajji, Hicham] Hassan II Agron & Vet Inst, Dept Geomat Sci & Surveying Engn, Rabat 10101, Morocco",Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; University of Guelph,"El Bouanani, N (corresponding author), Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, Ctr Remote Sensing Applicat CRSA, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco.;El Bouanani, N (corresponding author), Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, Analyt Lab ALAB, Rabat 11103, Morocco.",nadir.elbouanani@um6p.ma; ahmed.laamrani@um6p.ma; h.hajji@iav.ac.ma; mohamed.bourriz@um6p.ma; francois.bourzeix@um6p.ma; hamd.aitabdelali@um6p.ma; ali.elbattay@um6p.ma; abdelhakim.amazirh@um6p.ma; abdelghani.chehbouni@um6p.ma,"; chehbouni, abdelghani/ACN-8375-2022","Amazirh, Abdelhakim/0000-0002-6665-3843; Laamrani, Ahmed/0000-0002-6603-5025; EL BOUANANI, Nadir/0009-0006-6190-6131; Bourriz, Mohamed/0009-0001-9779-2926; chehbouni, abdelghani/0000-0002-0270-1690",OCP Foundation; Yield Gap project; UM6P through the Yield Gap Project,OCP Foundation; Yield Gap project; UM6P through the Yield Gap Project,This project was financially supported by The Yield Gap project (agreement between OCP Foundation and UM6P).

Parasitic weeds, Striga spp., are major constraints to cereal and legume crop production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Yield losses reaching 100% are reported in maize under severe Striga infestation. Breeding for Striga resistance has been shown to be the most economical, feasible, and sustainable approach for resource-poor farmers and for being environmentally friendly. Knowledge of the genetic and genomic resources and components of Striga resistance is vital to guide genetic analysis and precision breeding of maize varieties with desirable product profiles under Striga infestation. This review aims to present the genetic and genomic resources, research progress, and opportunities in the genetic analysis of Striga resistance and yield components in maize for breeding. The paper outlines the vital genetic resources of maize for Striga resistance, including landraces, wild relatives, mutants, and synthetic varieties, followed by breeding technologies and genomic resources. Integrating conventional breeding, mutation breeding, and genomic-assisted breeding [i.e., marker-assisted selection, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, next-generation sequencing, and genome editing] will enhance genetic gains in Striga resistance breeding programs.

However, the complete regeneration of teeth and periodontal tissue, an ultimate aspiration of humanity, remains unachieved. Recent advancements in fundamental scientific technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, have significantly advanced our molecular understanding of tooth development, paving the way toward achieving this goal. This review summarizes the fundamental processes of tooth development in humans and mice, recent findings from basic research, and current clinical applications in dental regenerative medicine, including periodontal, alveolar bone, and dental pulp regeneration using cellular approaches. Building on accumulated scientific knowledge, the complete regeneration of teeth and periodontal tissues may be achievable in the near future. We discuss the potential of emerging approaches, such as organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells and xenotransplantation using genetically modified animals, to transform dental medicine. These innovative concepts and integrated technologies hold the promise of enabling the regeneration of fully functional teeth and periodontal tissues. (c) 2025 The Author(s).

The success of pathogenic oomycetes lies in their ability to adapt and overcome host resistance, occasionally transitioning to new hosts. During plant infection, these organisms secrete effector proteins and other compounds during plant infection, as a molecular arsenal that contributes to their pathogenic success. Genomic sequencing, transcriptomic analysis, and proteomic studies have revealed highly diverse effector repertoires among different oomycete pathogens, highlighting their adaptability and evolution potential. The obligate biotrophic oomycete Plasmopara viticola affects grapevine plants (Vitis vinifera L.) causing the downy mildew disease, with significant economic impact. This disease is devastating in Europe, leading to substantial production losses. Even though Plasmopara viticola is a well-known pathogen, to date there are scarce reviews summarising pathogenicity, virulence, the genetics and molecular mechanisms of interaction with grapevine. This review aims to explore the current knowledge of the infection strategy, lifecycle, effector molecules, and pathogenicity of Plasmopara viticola. The recent sequencing of the Plasmopara viticola genome has provided new insights into understanding the infection strategies employed by this pathogen. Additionally, we will highlight the contributions of omics technologies in unravelling the ongoing evolution of this oomycete, including the first in-plant proteome analysis of the pathogen.","[Gouveia, Catarina; Santos, Rita B.; Paiva-Silva, Catarina; Malho, Rui; Figueiredo, Andreia] Univ Lisbon, Biosyst & Integrat Sci Inst BioISI, Fac Sci, Lisbon, Portugal; [Buchholz, Guenther] AlPlanta Inst Plant Res, RLP Agrosci, Neustadt, Germany",Universidade de Lisboa; BIOISI,"Figueiredo, A (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Biosyst & Integrat Sci Inst BioISI, Fac Sci, Lisbon, Portugal.",aafigueiredo@fc.ul.pt,"B Santos, Rita/A-5133-2019; Malhó, Rui/I-4503-2012; Figueiredo, Aneia/G-2887-2014; Paiva-Silva, Catarina/JKI-0453-2023; Gouveia, Catarina/L-1957-2019","B Santos, Rita/0000-0001-7809-6813; Malhó, Rui/0000-0001-5287-869X; Figueiredo, Aneia/0000-0001-8156-7700; dos Santos Paiva Marques da Silva, Catarina Maria/0000-0003-3611-0116;","FCT, Portugal [UIDB/04046/2020, UIDP/04046/2020, SFRH/BD/142859/2018]","FCT, Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","Work supported by UIDB/04046/2020 (DOI: 10.54499/UIDB/04046/2020 ) and UIDP/04046/2020 (DOI: 10.54499/UIDP/04046/2020) Centre grants from FCT, Portugal (to BioISI).

Still, this value is far away from the Shockley-Queisser limit of 33.15% for single-junction devices. A prominent way to surpass this limit and boost the device performance is to combine different bandgap materials in a tandem configuration. The rapid emergence of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as one of the most exciting research fields with over 25% efficiency has attracted the focus of the scientific community. The solution-processability, bandgap tunability, and outstanding optoelectronic properties of perovskites mark them a potential pair with silicon to develop tandem solar cells (TSCs). In nearly seven to eight years of development, Si/perovskite TSCs have achieved record certified efficiencies of over 29%. This review emphasizes on two and four-terminal Si/perovskite TSCs. Initially, the advancement of efficiencies to date is discussed, including a comparison of numerous perovskite and silicon material choices. Then, the evolution of PSCs with Si (homojunction and heterojunction) bottom devices and their impact on the performance of TSCs is summarized. The suitable candidates for the perovskite and Si cells are proposed for Si/perovskite TSCs. Next, factors influencing the performance of tandems, such as fabrication issues on textured surfaces, parasitic absorption, reflection losses, nonideal perovskite absorber layer bandgap, device instability, and large-area fabrication, are highlighted. To reduce the electrical and optical losses for highly efficient tandems, an investigation of anti-reflecting coatings, current matching mechanisms, transparent electrodes, and recombination layers is discussed. Finally, based on these findings, future guidelines are proposed to boost the efficiencies beyond 30%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed study on two and four-terminal Si/perovskite TSCs. These findings would open new avenues for the research community with detailed information on Si/perovskite tandem cells. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Over the past two to three decades, several animal studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that high-dose intravenous vitamin C may reduce fluid requirements, body weight gain, and wound edema, improving gas exchange and renal function in the acute phase after burn injury. Vitamin C is a scavenger of oxygen free radicals in the endothelium, which can limit the inflammatory response and ischemia-reperfusion injury, promoting wound healing. Nonetheless, current knowledge is not entirely conclusive. Research that leads to a better understanding of the vitamin's pharmacokinetics/dynamics is a first requirement before embarking on well-powered, well-designed clinical trials that still need to be conducted. This review aims to summarize vitamin C status in burn patients and its biological properties, in order to evaluate the rationale and most current evidence for routine supplementation, as recommended by current clinical guidelines, and the potential for high-dose vitamin C as a pharmaconutrient in critically ill burn patients.

The results show that work carried out to date has mainly focused on a few well known traditional bakery products such as bread, cakes, and biscuits. There has been relatively little research on transforming plantain pulp into flour as part of the preparation of traditional African dishes such as foutou or amala. This work has often been carried out in the laboratory, without any link to local artisanal processes or knowledge of consumer preferences. There is a need to standardize local culinary practices for processing plantain into flour or semolina.

This vital role requires the adaptation of new tools and technologies to improve the modeling of such complex systems and achieve the highest levels of resilience. One of the trending tools in many research fields to model complex systems is machine learning (ML). In this article, a systematic review of the literature on ML applications in ICISs resilience is conducted, considering the protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), to address the lack of knowledge and scattered research articles on the topic. The main objective of this systematic review is to determine the state of the art of ML applications in the area of ICISs resilience engineering by exploring the current literature.

Fuzzy-ball fluid has been discovered to bolster a formation's pressure-bearing capabilities and systematically augment resistance against oil, gas, and water flow. These attributes have been instrumental in the phased integration of fuzzy-ball fluid into procedures aiming to enhance production in oil and gas wells. This paper bridges the knowledge gap in the industry regarding the application of fuzzy-ball fluid, thereby circumventing the challenges of inadequate understanding and suboptimal designs. However, the study acknowledges the potential limitation of information loss despite the extensive data collection from diverse sources, such as articles, patents, and reports.

Its physicochemical properties, including high water-holding capacity, viscosity, thermal stability, and film-forming ability, also support potential uses in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, biomedicine, and environmental remediation. Despite this promise, large-scale adoption is limited by variability in composition, lack of standardized processing, functional inconsistencies, and competition with synthetic polymers. However, the sustainable cultivation of OFI, its resilience under drought, and the possibility of valorizing cladode waste strengthen its profile within circular economy frameworks. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the extraction, properties, and applications of OFI mucilage, while identifying key research gaps and technological challenges. It emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary research and industrial collaboration to overcome barriers and unlock the full potential of OFI mucilage as a high-performance, eco-friendly biopolymer for future applications.","[Mukaila, Yusuf O.; Adeyemi, Jerry O.; Fawole, Olaniyi A.] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Sci, South African Res Chairs Initiat Sustainable Prese, POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Mukaila, Yusuf O.; Adeyemi, Jerry O.; Fawole, Olaniyi A.] Univ Johannesburg, Postharvest & Agroproc Res Ctr, Dept Bot & Plant Biotechnol, POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg; University of Johannesburg,"Fawole, OA (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Fac Sci, South African Res Chairs Initiat Sustainable Prese, POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.;Fawole, OA (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Postharvest & Agroproc Res Ctr, Dept Bot & Plant Biotechnol, POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",abiduct2020@gmail.com; jerryadeyemi1st@gmail.com; olaniyif@uj.ac.za,"Mukaila, Yusuf/MDS-7594-2025; ADEYEMI, JERRY/N-6381-2019; Fawole, Olaniyi/AAD-8908-2022","Mukaila, Yusuf/0000-0001-8535-5908; ADEYEMI, JERRY/0000-0002-7769-5264;","University Research Committee at the University of Johannesburg (UJ); National Research Foundation of South Africa [SPAR231013155231, CPRR23033088376]; South African National Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD)","University Research Committee at the University of Johannesburg (UJ)(University of Johannesburg); National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa); South African National Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD)","This work is based on research supported by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (SPAR231013155231; CPRR23033088376), the University Research Committee at the University of Johannesburg (UJ), and funding provided by the South African National Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD).

Blight, a fungal disease caused by several Diaporthe species, affects eggplant production. The Diaporthe-eggplant pathosystem has been documented in 32 countries, with D. vexans as the most widely reported species. Environmental factors, including high humidity, elevated temperatures, rain splashes, and using susceptible eggplant cultivars, create favorable conditions for disease development. Blight can lead to significant yield losses, with reductions exceeding 50%. Diaporthe vexans has entered the 'omics era' with groundbreaking research on its genome and identifying effector proteins, providing new insights into its pathogenicity. Accurate Diaporthe species identification is now possible by combining traditional morphological methods and molecular techniques, including DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Effective management of eggplant blight requires an integrated approach that combines multiple control practices to prevent pathogen entry, reduce inoculum sources, and protect plants through resistant cultivars or resistance-inducing strategies. Integrating insights from genomics, plant breeding, the discovery of other alternative control methods, and addressing gaps in current knowledge - especially concerning newly identified species, co-infection dynamics, seedborne transmission, and emerging technologies - will provide researchers with the expertise necessary to develop durable and effective disease management strategies for Diaporthe blight.","[Balendres, Mark Angelo O.] De La Salle Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biol, Manila 1004, Philippines; [Balendres, Mark Angelo O.] De La Salle Univ, Ctr Nat Sci & Environm Res, Plant & Soil Hlth Res Unit, Manila, Philippines",De La Salle University; De La Salle University,"Balendres, MAO (corresponding author), De La Salle Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biol, Manila 1004, Philippines.",mark.angelo.balendres@dlsu.edu.ph,"Balendres, Mark Angelo/K-5970-2019",,De La Salle University; De La Salle University,De La Salle University; De La Salle University,The author thanks Herbert Dustin Aumentado for providing images of the Diaporthe species and diseased eggplant.

Prolonged exposure to these adverse environmental conditions leads to stunted plant growth and development with significant yield loss in crops. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing tool is being frequently employed to understand abiotic stress-responsive genes. Noteworthy improvements in CRISPR-Cas technology have been made over the years, including upgradation of Cas proteins fidelity and efficiency, optimization of transformation protocols for different crop species, base and prime editing, multiplex gene-targeting, transgene-free editing, and graft-based heritable CRISPR-Cas9 approaches. These developments helped to improve the knowledge of abiotic stress tolerance in crops that could potentially be utilized to develop knock-out varieties and over-expressed lines to tackle the adverse effects of altered climatic patterns. This review summarizes the mechanistic understanding of heat, drought, salinity, and metal stress-responsive genes characterized so far using CRISPR-Cas9 and provides data on potential candidate genes that can be exploited by modern-day biotechnological tools to develop transgene-free genome-edited crops with better climate adaptability.

To improve the emergency response capability of civil infrastructure under extreme circumstances such as natural disasters and human-caused hazards, intelligent technology for infrastructure emergency management has been extensively studied. As an emerging paradigm of interdisciplinary convergence, digital twins (DTs) can integrate intelligent technology into different stages of emergency management and provide a new solution for the emergency management of civil infrastructure (EMCI). However, applications of DT in EMCI have several limitations and are mostly case by case. However, the sector needs more generalisable lessons to address the greater value of DT in the context of EMCI. To address this gap, we first carry out a systematic literature review and analyse the latest progress and previous research deficiencies of DT by taking the scientometrical approach. Next, a framework is proposed to explain how DT can be applied to the mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery stages of EMCI. Lastly, the trends and prospects of DT applications in EMCI are discussed. Overall, the knowledge gained from this study will promote the research and development of more-viable DTs to address the sector's demand for emergency management.","[Cheng, Ruijie; Xu, Sheng] Changan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710064, Peoples R China; [Hou, Lei] RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Xu, Sheng] Changan Univ, Xian Key Lab Green Infrastruct Construct & Manage, Xian 710064, Peoples R China; [Xu, Sheng] Shaanxi Prov Ctr Int Res Digital Construct & Mana, Xian 710064, Peoples R China",Chang'an University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Chang'an University,"Xu, S (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710064, Peoples R China.;Hou, L (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.;Xu, S (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Xian Key Lab Green Infrastruct Construct & Manage, Xian 710064, Peoples R China.;Xu, S (corresponding author), Shaanxi Prov Ctr Int Res Digital Construct & Mana, Xian 710064, Peoples R China.",lei.hou@rmit.edu.au; sheng.xu@chd.edu.cn,"hou, lei/G-7267-2016","hou, lei/0000-0002-5503-414X",Shaanxi Province Natural Science Foundation [2021KWZ-28]; Science and Technology Project of the Sichuan Transportation Department [2022-ZL-04],Shaanxi Province Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province); Science and Technology Project of the Sichuan Transportation Department,"This research was funded by the Shaanxi Province Natural Science Foundation, grant number 2021KWZ-28, and by the Science and Technology Project of the Sichuan Transportation Department (2022-ZL-04).

Methods and ResultsThe knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes of the parents of the baby boomers toward dental hygiene and oral healthcare, are reviewed. The introduction of dental health screenings occurred from 1910 to early 1970s, the creation of the first dental hygiene school and the introduction of water fluoridation influenced oral healthcare. Technology introduced in the dental offices in the 1960s included the high-speed handpiece, followed by intraoral suction in 1979. Baby boomers are keeping their teeth at higher rates than preceding generations due to improved prevention and advances in the treatment of periodontal disease, and overall lower rates of smoking in older adults, when compared to younger adults. However, access to dental care remains an issue for many. Advances in prevention and treatment of periodontal disease, early detection of root caries, new restorative techniques, and improved technologies to replace teeth are also discussed. ConclusionsEarly detection of periodontal disease, oral, and oropharyngeal cancer, risk factors for tooth loss and untreated caries are needed to improve the oral health for baby boomers.

The main phases of this technology include the feeding of solid filament into a molten chamber, capillary flow of a non-Newtonian fluid through a nozzle, layer deposition on the support base, and layer-to-layer adhesion. The viscoelastic properties of processed materials are essential in each of the FDM steps: (i) predicting the printability of the melted material during FDM extrusion and ensuring a continuous flow across the nozzle; (ii) controlling the deposition process of the molten filament on the print bed and avoiding fast material leakage and loss of precision in the molded part; and (iii) ensuring layer adhesion in the subsequent consolidation phase.

Due to its rapid propagation, Xanthomonas poses an enormous challenge to farmers, because it is usually controlled using huge quantities of copper-based chemicals, adversely impacting the environment. Thus, developing new ways of preventing colonization by these bacteria has become essential. Advances in genomic and transcriptomic technologies have significantly elucidated at molecular level interactions between various crops and Xanthomonas species. Understanding how these hosts respond to the infection is crucial if we are to exploit potential approaches for improving crop breeding and cutting productivity losses. This review focuses on our current knowledge of the defense response mechanisms in agricultural crops after Xanthomonas infection. We describe the molecular basis of host-bacterium interactions over a broad spectrum with the aim of improving our fundamental understanding of which genes are involved and how they work in this interaction, providing information that can help to speed up plant breeding programs, namely using gene editing approaches.","[Cardoso, Jessica L.

However, fresh produce is susceptible to large losses during production and preservation. In the postharvest preservation stage, fruits undergo various technical treatments for maintaining their quality. A widely adopted technology is the application of edible coatings, which can be applied to a diverse range of fruits to regulate the exchange of moisture and gases between the fruit and its environment. In addition, edible coatings provide a significant benefit by allowing the integration of different active ingredients into the coating's matrix, meaning that these substances will associate with and possibly be eaten together with the fruit. This would help improve the organoleptic and nutritional qualities of the fruit as well as the shelf life. This paper provides an overview of the available data on the typical components used in coating matrix, focusing on the effect of the material combinations and application techniques to fruit properties.

However, this search involves sampling in natural reefs, and this is currently hampered by multiple ethical and technological constraints. Living coral displays, research laboratories, and biobanks currently offer an opportunity to continue to unravel coral chemodiversity, acting as Noah's Arks that may continue to support the bioprospecting of molecules of interest. This issue is even more relevant if one considers that tropical coral reefs currently face unprecedent threats and irreversible losses that may impair the biodiscovery of molecules with potential for new products, processes, and services. Living coral displays provide controlled environments for studying corals and producing both known and new metabolites under varied conditions, and they are not prone to common bottlenecks associated with bioprospecting in natural coral reefs, such as loss of the source and replicability. Research laboratories may focus on a particular coral species or bioactive compound using corals that were cultured ex situ, although they may differ from wild conspecifics in metabolite production both in quantitative and qualitative terms. Biobanks collect and preserve coral specimens, tissues, cells, and/or information (e.g., genes, associated microorganisms), which offers a plethora of data to support the study of bioactive compounds' mode of action without having to cope with issues related to access, standardization, and regulatory compliance. Bioprospecting in these settings faces several challenges and opportunities. On one hand, it is difficult to ensure the complexity of highly biodiverse ecosystems that shape the production and chemodiversity of corals.

This review summarizes related data for existing cases and presents a meta-analysis of the outcomes of dental implants in SOT recipients and non-organ transplant patients. Material and methods: An electronic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases covering articles published from inception to December 2024. This study was performed in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and was designed based on the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Study design (PICOS) framework. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist or the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The certainty of findings was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effects model to estimate the combined performance measures and 95 % confidence intervals for the implant survival rate, marginal bone loss (MBL), and probing depth (PD). Results: A total of 12 articles were included in the systematic review. The implant survival rate of 290 implants in 110 SOT recipients was 99.3 %. The meta-analysis of four case-control studies revealed no significant differences in the implant survival rate and PD between SOT recipients and non-organ transplant patients (P = 0.45 and P = 0.49, respectively), while there was slightly less MBL in SOT recipients (P = 0.02), possibly caused by confounding factors and bias. Conclusions: Organ transplantation does not impair implant survival in the short and mid-long term. Dental implantation can serve as a treatment option for tooth loss in SOT recipients.

Conventional approaches, such as best management practices for fertilizer application and runoff collection, can mitigate nutrient losses, yet their effectiveness is limited and often insufficient to address large-scale nutrient pollution. More advanced technologies, including reverse osmosis and activated carbon adsorption, provide high removal efficiency but remain costly and energy-intensive, restricting their widespread adoption. As a sustainable alternative, waste valorization has gained attention for utilizing nonhazardous industrial byproducts (e.g., fly ash, casting sands) and agricultural residues (e.g., rice husk, sugarcane bagasse) as low-cost biosorbents to capture nutrients directly at the source. This review evaluates the performance of recycled byproducts tested for nitrate and phosphate removal, analyzes the chemical and microbial mechanisms underlying nutrient adsorption and denitrification, and assesses the economic feasibility and scalability of these materials. Furthermore, research trends, innovations, and knowledge gaps are identified, with emphasis on field-scale validation to optimize longevity and minimize unintended environmental consequences. By advancing waste-derived biosorbents as viable nutrient management tools, this review highlights their potential to enhance water quality, promote circular economy practices, and inform future research and policy development in sustainable agriculture.","[Ahmed, Mysha; Hayes, Michael] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Plant Environm & Soil Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Hayes, Michael] Louisiana State Univ, Louisiana Sea Grant, Baton Rouge, LA USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Hayes, M (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Sch Plant Environm & Soil Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",mhayes@agcenter.lsu.edu,,"Hayes, Michael/0009-0002-1329-0978",,,,113,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2666-1543,,J AGR FOOD RES,J.

In recent years, this technology has been considered a promising novel tool in several fields of application, but several issues still hamper its widespread use. This review paper describes how some physical confounding factors, such as temperature, humidity, and gas flow, in terms of flow direction and flow rate, can drastically influence gas sensors' responses and, consequently, e-nose results. Among the software and hardware approaches adopted to address such issues, different hardware compensation strategies proposed in the literature were critically analyzed. Solutions related to e-nose sensors' modification, design and readout, sampling system and/or chamber geometry design were investigated. A trade-off between the loss of volatile compounds of interest, the decrease of sensors' sensitivity, and the lack of fast responses need to be pointed out. The existing body of knowledge suggests that the e-nose design needs to be highly tailored to the target application to exploit the technology potentialities fully and highlights the need for further studies comparing the several solutions proposed as a starting point for the application-driven design of e-nose-based systems.","[Robbiani, Stefano; Dellaca, Raffaele L.] Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn DEIB, TechRes Lab, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Lotesoriere, Beatrice Julia; Capelli, Laura] Politecn Milan, Dept Chem Mat & Chem Engn Giulio Natta DCMC, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Dellacà, RL (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn DEIB, TechRes Lab, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",stefano.robbiani@polimi.it; beatricejulia.lotesoriere@polimi.it; raffaele.dellaca@polimi.it; laura.capelli@polimi.it,"; CAPELLI, Laura/ABE-7222-2020; Dellaca', Raffaele/AAF-7078-2019","Lotesoriere, Beatrice Julia/0000-0003-0308-1371; Robbiani, Stefano/0000-0002-0728-1613; CAPELLI, Laura/0000-0003-0002-3619; Dellaca', Raffaele/0000-0002-3672-4591",The authors want to thank Aurora Pierantozzi for her contribution to literature review of chamber geometries.,The authors want to thank Aurora Pierantozzi for her contribution to literature review of chamber geometries.,The authors want to thank Aurora Pierantozzi for her contribution to literature review of chamber geometries.,226,50,50,12,75,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9040,CHEMOSENSORS,Chemosensors,OCT,2023,11.0,10,,,,,,514,10.3390/chemosensors11100514,0.0,,37,"Chemistry, Analytical; Electrochemistry; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Electrochemistry; Instruments & Instrumentation,W6CU7,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001092493100001,0

Therefore, the restoration of functional beta-cells by the induction of beta-cell differentiation from embryonic stem (ES) and induced-pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, or from somatic non-beta-cells, may be a promising curative therapy. To establish an efficient and feasible method for generating functional insulin-producing cells, comprehensive knowledge of pancreas development and beta-cell differentiation, including the mechanisms driving cell fate decisions and endocrine cell maturation is crucial. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have opened a new era in pancreas development and diabetes research, leading to clarification of the detailed transcriptomes of individual insulin-producing cells. Such extensive high-resolution data enables the inference of developmental trajectories during cell transitions and gene regulatory networks. Additionally, advancements in stem cell research have not only enabled their immediate clinical application, but also has made it possible to observe the genetic dynamics of human cell development and maturation in a dish.

Among these pathogens, aquatic circoviruses-small, single-stranded DNA viruses initially detected in barbel (Barbus barbus)-have now been identified in multiple aquaculture species. These viruses have been associated with various clinical manifestations in economically important fish, crustacean, and mollusk species, including acute hemorrhage syndrome, which has shown mortality rates up to 95% in controlled laboratory infections of turbot. This review consolidates current knowledge on aquatic circoviruses, focusing on their genetic diversity, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management strategies. The analysis encompasses observed host range patterns, documented instances of cross-species transmission, and evolutionary characteristics, such as host-specific clustering and recombination events. Research gaps are highlighted, particularly in understanding viral pathogenic mechanisms, host-pathogen interactions, and their ecological roles within aquatic ecosystems. We evaluate recent advances in diagnostic methods, including targeted vaccine design and RNA interference technology. The review outlines future research priorities, including elucidating cross-species transmission potential, developing effective treatments, and assessing the full economic impact of these viruses on aquaculture.

This review provides an overview of the latest knowledge, and in the last three years, on using PEF processing in meat to enhance its functionality, nutrition, texture, colour and sensory quality. PEF treatment could improve meat's protein digestibility and solubility while having no negative impact on its nutritional value. However, controversial indications regarding PEF's effect on meat cooking loss are reported. Colour changes of meat after PEF treatment are directly proportional to the extent of total specific energy inputs used in the processing, while the effect of PEF on meat sensory properties is yet to be discovered. Since the ability of PEF to achieve its desired goals is dependent on many different factors, including the type of meat, electric field strength, number and duration of electric pulses, and others, more studies are needed to fully understand specific conditions that can be dependably applied in the meat industry.","[Tomasevic, Igor; Heinz, Volker; Terjung, Nino] German Inst Food Technol DIL, Quakenbruck, Germany; [Tomasevic, Igor; Djekic, Ilija] Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Tomasevic, I (corresponding author), German Inst Food Technol DIL, Quakenbruck, Germany.;Tomasevic, I (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Belgrade, Serbia.",I.Tomasevic@dil-ev.de,"Djekic, Ilija/G-3649-2015; Tomasevic, Igor/A-6521-2013","Djekic, Ilija/0000-0002-8132-8299; Tomasevic, Igor/0000-0002-1611-2264",,,,54,12,13,16,67,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1594-4077,1828-051X,ITAL J ANIM SCI,Ital.

Nevertheless, the matching diversity between solid-state electrolytes (SEs) and the paired high-voltage cathodes complicate to understand the formation and failure mechanisms of cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI). Furthermore, the structural degradation of cathodes and the electrochemical decomposition of SEs during cycling continuously reconfigure the CEI and alter the CEI composition and structure, adding further complexity to its analysis. The limited understanding of these processes hinders the development of effective strategies to address persistent cathode-electrolyte interfacial issues (e.g., high interfacial impedance and contact loss) that shorten SSLB lifetime. A prerequisite for overcoming these challenges is to establish a comprehensive knowledge of CEI properties, which remains elusive and is often underestimated. Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms governing CEI formation and failure, elucidating the complex nature of the interphase. Key challenges related to interfacial stability are discussed in detail, along with corresponding strategies for CEI regulation. Innovatively, an expanded conceptual CEI framework is proposed based on recent advances, facilitating a deeper understanding of CEI properties. Finally, forward-looking perspectives are provided for designing stable CEIs and further advancing SSLB technology.","[Hu, Xinchao; Zheng, Hongfei; Zhang, Shiyu; Jin, Yuming; Peng, Dong-Liang; Xie, Qingshui] Xiamen Univ, Coll Mat, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surface, Fujian Key Lab Surface & Interface Engn High Perfo, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chengkun] Xiamen Univ Technol, Inst Adv Energy Mat, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Fujian Prov Key Lab Funct Mat & Applicat, Xiamen 361024, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University of Technology,"Zheng, HF; Peng, D-; Xie, QS (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Mat, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surface, Fujian Key Lab Surface & Interface Engn High Perfo, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",hfzheng@xmu.edu.cn; dlpeng@xmu.edu.cn; xieqsh@xmu.edu.cn,"Jin, Yuming/HGE-5156-2022",,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [20720220074, 20720240053]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [52272240, 52431009, U22A20118]; Science and Technology Planning Projects of Fujian Province of China [2023H0003]; Double-First Class Foundation of Materials Intelligent Manufacturing Discipline of Xiamen University",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Planning Projects of Fujian Province of China; Double-First Class Foundation of Materials Intelligent Manufacturing Discipline of Xiamen University,"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 52272240, 52431009 and U22A20118), Science and Technology Planning Projects of Fujian Province of China (Grant No. 2023H0003), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (Xiamen University: Nos. 20720220074 and 20720240053), the Double-First Class Foundation of Materials Intelligent Manufacturing Discipline of Xiamen University.",163,1,1,18,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2198-3844,ADV SCI,Adv.

They are crucial for photosynthesis, water use efficiency (WUE), and the plant's ability to adapt to environmental changes. Stomatal movement is vital for understanding how plants adapt to environmental stress and optimize resource utilization. Changes in environmental conditions, especially the quality and intensity of light throughout the day, affect stomatal dynamics and diurnal behavior, which in turn impact photosynthetic efficiency and water-use efficiency. In this review, we summarize the biophysical principles and mechanisms of stomatal movement regulated by ion transport at the plasma membrane, vacuolar membrane and metabolic activity through persulfidation or S-nitrosylation modifications. Specifically, we focus on recent progress in the regulation of stomatal movement by different light qualities, and summarize the photochemical and biochemical events underlying photoreceptors as well as the knowledge of novel regulatory functions and signaling in the multilayer control of stomatal movement and environmental adaptation. Furthermore, as rising global temperatures and increased water needs of farming methods are expected to escalate future crop losses, we explore the potential of smart LED lighting and gene editing technology in enhancing photosynthetic efficiency and water-use efficiency, leading to increased crop biomass and higher crop yields.","[Zhu, Kangyou; Guo, Qianru; Chen, Yulin; Bu, Xin; Yan, Jiarong; Zhang, Ying; Wang, Xiujie; Liu, Yufeng; Qi, Mingfang; Li, Tianlai; Wang, Feng] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Hort, Shenyang 110866, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Kangyou; Qi, Mingfang; Li, Tianlai; Wang, Feng] Minist Educ, Key Lab Protected Hort, Shenyang 110866, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xin] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Land & Environm, Shenyang 110866, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xuefeng] Ulanqab Civilizat Practice Guidance Ctr New Era, Ulanqab 012000, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China; [Ahammed, Golam Jalal] Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Hort & Plant Protect, Luoyang 471023, Henan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Zhiming] Hebei Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Inst Cash Crops, Shijiazhuang 050051, Hebei, Peoples R China",Shenyang Agricultural University; Shenyang Agricultural University; Henan University of Science & Technology; Hebei Academy of Agricultural & Forestry Sciences,"Wang, F (corresponding author), Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Hort, Shenyang 110866, Liaoning, Peoples R China.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Protected Hort, Shenyang 110866, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",fengwang@syau.edu.cn,"Q, M/JBS-0628-2023; Ahammed, Golam Jalal/B-7548-2012",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [32272698, 32441072, 32122081]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2023YFF1002000]; Liaoning Province Youth Science Foundation A -Class Project [2025-JQ-05]; Liaoning Province's Future Industry Frontier Technology Project [2025JH2/101330184, 2025JH2/101330185]; National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents [BX20250016]; Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas of China [SKLCSRHPKF2025017]; HAAFS Science and Technology Innovation Special Project [2023KJCXZX-JZS-10]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); Liaoning Province Youth Science Foundation A -Class Project; Liaoning Province's Future Industry Frontier Technology Project; National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents; Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas of China; HAAFS Science and Technology Innovation Special Project,"This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 32272698, 32441072, 32122081) , National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2023YFF1002000) , Liaoning Province Youth Science Foundation A -Class Project (formerly Liaoning Natural Science Foundation Outstanding Youth Project, Grant No. 2025-JQ-05) , Liaoning Province's Future Industry Frontier Technology Project (Grant Nos. 2025JH2/101330184 and 2025JH2/101330185) , National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents (Grant No. BX20250016) , Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas of China (Grant No. SKLCSRHPKF2025017) and HAAFS Science and Technology Innovation Special Project (Grant No. 2023KJCXZX-JZS-10) .",152,0,0,10,10,KEAI PUBLISHING LTD,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, Building 5, Room 411, BEIJING, DONGCHENG DISTRICT 100009, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-9885,2468-0141,HORTIC PLANT J,Hortic.

Accordingly, reducing earthquakes' social, economic and environmental losses requires significant effort. Indoor seismic damage, which refers to damage caused by earthquakes inside buildings, such as falling objects, broken furniture and collapsed walls, is especially important for assessment and mitigation because it directly affects building occupants. Therefore, understanding and mitigating indoor seismic damage have become necessary. Many damage assessment tools have been introduced and adopted to assess the impact of earthquakes on buildings. Digital technologies can be essential in simulating and visualising earthquake damage, providing realistic, interactive and immersive experiences for different purposes and stakeholders. This systematic literature review critically aims to investigate existing approaches and methods for simulating and visualising indoor seismic damage to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research, identify knowledge gaps and offer insights into the future. Thus, a conceptual framework was developed, which integrates essential aspects, including methods and tools, to develop seismic damage simulation and visualisation.

Modern-day corrective solutions for these deformities include spinal osteotomies, pedicle screw instrumentation, and dual/multirod constructs. These solutions are efficacious and are currently considered standard practice for spinal surgeons, but they lack individualization. Patient-specific rods (PSRs) are a novel technology that attempts to offer a personalized approach to spinal deformity correction based on preoperative computerized tomography scans. Moreover, PSRs may offer several advantages to conventional rods, which include achievement of desired rod contour angles according to surgical planning alignment goals, reduced operative time, and reduced blood loss. In adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, those instrumented with PSR have observed coronal Cobb reductions up to 74%. In adult spinal deformity, PSRs have offered superior correction in radiographic parameters such as sagittal vertical axis and pelvic incidence minus lumbar lordosis. However, there still remains a paucity of research in this area, mainly in health care expenditure, cost-effectiveness, and longitudinal clinical outcomes. The purpose of this article is to survey the current body of knowledge of PSR instrumentation in both adolescent and adult spinal deformity populations.

A detailed literature review and empirical evidence identify four main barriers: economic, knowledge and information, institutional and policy, and social and cultural aspects. Farmers face economic problems investing in adaptable technologies and recovering from climate-related losses due to restricted financial resources, financial institution availability, and insurance coverage. Limited access to reliable climate data and scientific research hinders informed decision-making and adaptive strategy prioritization. Institutional and policy challenges including limited institutional capacity for climate change adaptation planning and implementation and policy gaps and inconsistencies hinder farmers' climate adaptation efforts. Social and cultural variables including traditional attitudes and traditions also resist change and impede climate-resilient actions.

Effectively managing these disorders requires early detection and a focus on maintaining healthy nutritional habits. Dietary adjustments serve as a cornerstone, but supplementation of essential minerals like calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D is often necessary to support bone reabsorption and regeneration, and reduce fracture risk. Despite the effectiveness of these measures in many cases, hereditary bone diseases pose distinctive challenges due to genetic factors. Emerging technologies that provide higher-resolution insights into bone architecture and quality are now complementing traditional diagnostic tools like dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Moreover, the therapeutic landscape has transformed with the introduction of newer agents that not only halt bone loss but also stimulate bone formation. These agents promise better outcomes with reduced side effects, catering to a wider patient population. However, the management of MBDs remains multifaceted, necessitating individualized approaches based on the patient's clinical profile. As the global prevalence of MBDs, especially osteoporosis, continues to soar, it becomes imperative for clinicians to stay abreast with the evolving paradigms. This review serves as a bridge between historical knowledge and recent discoveries, offering a holistic perspective on the challenges and opportunities in the domain of MBDs.","[Ansari, Mohd.

Therefore, it summarizes the technological advancements, the diagnostic capacity, and the operational and analytical challenges of the method when applied under real-world conditions as a diagnostic tool for mastitis, while factors associated with the performance of the method are critically described and discussed to justify recognized strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and challenges of the method.Abstract Among the health issues of major concern in dairy ruminants, mastitis stands out as being associated with considerable losses in productivity and compromised animal health and welfare. Currently, the available methods for the early detection of mastitis are either inaccurate, requiring further validation, or expensive and labor intensive. Moreover, most of them cannot be applied at the point of care. Infrared thermography (IRT) is a rapid, non-invasive technology that can be used in situ to measure udder temperature and identify variations and inconsistencies thereof, serving as a benchmarking tool for the assessment of udders' physiological and/or health status. Despite the numerous applications in livestock farming, IRT is still underexploited due to the lack of standardized operation procedures and significant gaps regarding the optimum settings of the thermal cameras, which are currently exploited on a case-specific basis. Therefore, the objective of this review paper was twofold: first, to provide the state of knowledge on the applications of IRT for the assessment of udder health status in dairy ruminants, and second, to summarize and discuss the major strengths and weaknesses of IRT application at the point of care, as well as future challenges and opportunities of its extensive adoption for the diagnosis of udder health status and control of mastitis at the animal and herd levels.","[Korelidou, Vera; Gelasakis, Athanasios I.] Agr Univ Athens AUA, Sch Anim Biosci, Dept Anim Sci, Lab Anat & Physiol Farm Anim, Iera Odos 75 Str, Athens 11855, Greece; [Simitzis, Panagiotis] Agr Univ Athens AUA, Sch Anim Biosci, Dept Anim Sci, Lab Anim Breeding & Husb, Iera Odos 75 Str, Athens 11855, Greece; [Massouras, Theofilos] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Food Sci & Human Nutr, Lab Dairy Sci & Technol, Iera Odos 75 Str, Athens 11855, Greece",Agricultural University of Athens,"Gelasakis, AI (corresponding author), Agr Univ Athens AUA, Sch Anim Biosci, Dept Anim Sci, Lab Anat & Physiol Farm Anim, Iera Odos 75 Str, Athens 11855, Greece.",vkorelidou@aua.gr; pansimitzis@aua.gr; theomas@aua.gr; gelasakis@aua.gr,"Massouras, Theofilos/AAT-9266-2020; Simitzis, Panagiotis/AAE-6133-2019","Korelidou, Vera/0009-0008-4795-1141; Simitzis, Panagiotis/0000-0002-1450-4037; Gelasakis, Athanasios/0000-0003-1144-3918",,,,132,10,12,3,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,SEP,2024,14.0,18,,,,,,2691,10.3390/ani14182691,0.0,,28,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,H5K2K,39335280.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001323822100001,0

The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which accounts for up to 80% of all dementia cases. Despite that extensive studies regarding the etiology and risk factors have been performed in recent decades, and how the current knowledge about AD pathophysiology significantly improved with the recent advances in science and technology, little is still known about its treatment options. In this controverted context, a nutritional approach could be a promising way to formulate improved AD management strategies and to further analyse possible treatment strategy options based on personalised diets, as Nutritional Psychiatry is currently gaining relevance in neuropsychiatric disease treatment. Based on the current knowledge of AD pathophysiology, as well as based on the repeatedly documented anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential of different functional foods, we aimed to find, describe, and correlate several dietary compounds that could be useful in formulating a nutritional approach in AD management. We performed a screening for relevant studies on the main scientific databases using keywords such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, treatment, medication, treatment alternatives, vitamin E, nutrition, selenium, Ginkgo biloba, antioxidants, medicinal plants, and traditional medicine in combinations. Results: nutrients could be a key component in the physiologic and anatomic development of the brain. Several nutrients have been studied in the pursuit of the mechanism triggered by the pathology of AD: vitamin D, fatty acids, selenium, as well as neuroprotective plant extracts (i.e., Ginkgo biloba, Panax ginseng, Curcuma longa), suggesting that the nutritional patterns could modulate the cognitive status and provide neuroprotection. The multifactorial origin of AD development and progression could suggest that nutrition could greatly contribute to the complex pathological picture. The identification of adequate nutritional interventions and the not yet fully understood nutrient activity in AD could be the next steps in finding several innovative treatment options for neurodegenerative disorders.","[Palimariciuc, Matei; Gireada, Bogdan; Dobrin, Romeo Petru] Grigore T Popa Univ Med & Pharm Iasi, Fac Med, Dept Med 3, 16 Univ St, Iasi 700115, Romania; [Palimariciuc, Matei; Gireada, Bogdan; Dobrin, Romeo Petru] Inst Psychiat Socola, 36 Bucium St, Iasi 700282, Romania; [Balmus, Ioana-Miruna] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Res, Dept Exact Sci & Nat Sci, Alexandru Lapusneanu St,26, Iasi 700057, Romania; [Ciobica, Alin] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Biol, B dul Carol 1,11, Iasi 700506, Romania; [Ciobica, Alin] Acad Romanian Scientists, Splaiul Independentei 54,Sect 5, Bucharest 050094, Romania; [Ciobica, Alin] Romanian Acad, Ctr Biomed Res, B dul Carol 1,8, Iasi 700506, Romania; [Iordache, Alin-Constantin] Grigore T Popa Univ Med & Pharm Iasi, Fac Med, 16 Univ Str, Iasi 700115, Romania; [Apostu, Mihai] Grigore T Popa Univ Med & Pharm Iasi, Fac Pharm, 16 Univ St, Iasi 700115, Romania",Grigore T Popa University of Medicine & Pharmacy; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Academy of Romanian Scientists (AOSR); Romanian Academy; Grigore T Popa University of Medicine & Pharmacy; Grigore T Popa University of Medicine & Pharmacy,"Gireada, B (corresponding author), Grigore T Popa Univ Med & Pharm Iasi, Fac Med, Dept Med 3, 16 Univ St, Iasi 700115, Romania.;Ciobica, A (corresponding author), Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Biol, B dul Carol 1,11, Iasi 700506, Romania.;Ciobica, A (corresponding author), Acad Romanian Scientists, Splaiul Independentei 54,Sect 5, Bucharest 050094, Romania.;Ciobica, A (corresponding author), Romanian Acad, Ctr Biomed Res, B dul Carol 1,8, Iasi 700506, Romania.",gireada_bogdan@d.umfiasi.ro; alin.ciobica@uaic.ro,"iordache, alin constantin/IAO-4411-2023; dobrin, romeo/MSY-4876-2025; Apostu, Mihai/AAD-6982-2019; Ciobica, Alin/B-6073-2012; Balmus, Ioana Miruna/AIC-7910-2022","Apostu, Mihai/0000-0002-4107-9566; dobrin, petru romeo/0000-0003-3023-0205;",,,,126,5,6,1,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1467-3037,1467-3045,CURR ISSUES MOL BIOL,Curr.

It set out to establish to what extent digital preservation policies have been implemented in South Africa's public sector, to determine the related skills and competency of public sector staff, and to make any necessary recommendations of the basis of the results. Design/methodology/approach A content review of Southern Africa literature dealing with the preservation of digital records, its importance and related factors over the past 20 years was conducted. Findings The current state of preservation of South African digital records suggests serious consequences of existing knowledge and training gaps. Addressing those gaps may provide the knowledge needed to support new ways of working. Records management professionals in the South African public sector at the national department level are currently ill-equipped to adequately preserve digital records. This complicates the application of tools offered by the information and communication technologies that have resulted in increased creation of digital records. Research limitations/implications The study was limited to only the public sector of South Africa. Practical implications The study makes practical implications concerning the policy framework for improving the state of digital preservation in South Africa so as to ensure long-term preservation of digital records. For instance, government departments are recommended to formulate and implement in-house policy frameworks, guidelines and plans that address digital preservation of records. Social implications Sufficient funding and resource allocation ought to be provided to advance electronic records management programmes. In addition, the formulation of proper strategies needed to preserve digital records should incorporate technological tools and media software in the existing operations for the creation, capturing, appraising and preserving of digital records.

It is widely used to improve the efficiency of maritime emergency rescue and reduce the loss of maritime accidents. However, it requires a scientific and effective method of the demand analysis of maritime emergency resources. This paper aims to analyze the underlying modeling paradigms and to assess the extent to which the demand analysis methods of maritime emergency resources can meet the requirements. Focusing on the demand analysis methods, this paper provides a broad overview of the current literature on maritime emergency resources of the last decades, by considering the models' purposes, theoretical frameworks, factors, and outputs. The results indicate that the existing methods can be classified into three concepts: the linear regression theory, Back Propagation (BP) Neural Network, and Case-based Reasoning (CBR) technology. Combined with the characteristics of China's maritime emergency management field, the interaction between theoretical framework and applications is not sufficiently understood and thus needs to be further studied. Being familiar with knowledge gaps acts as a catalyst for further research on scientific and efficient demand analysis methods of maritime emergency resources in various navigation conditions.","[Ma, Quandang; Zhou, Yang] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Nav, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Ma, Quandang] Wuhan Univ Technol, Intelligent Transportat Syst Ctr, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Ma, Quandang] Wuhan Univ Technol, Natl Engn Res Ctr Water Transport Safety, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Ma, Quandang] Hubei Key Lab Inland Shipping Technol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lei] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology; Wuhan University of Technology; Wuhan University of Technology; National Engineering Research Center for Water Transport Safety; Southeast University - China,"Liu, L (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",lei1992@seu.edu.cn,,,"National Key Technology Research & Development Program [2017YFC0804900, 2017YFC0804904]; Technical Innovation Project of Jiangsu Province [2020Z02]",National Key Technology Research & Development Program; Technical Innovation Project of Jiangsu Province,"Funding: The research is financially supported by National Key Technology Research & Development Program (2017YFC0804900, 2017YFC0804904) , Technical Innovation Project of Jiangsu Province (2020Z02) .",52,8,9,18,91,UNIV ZAGREB FAC MECHANICAL ENGINEERING & NAVAL ARCHITECTURE,ZAGREB,"IVANA LUCICA 5, ZAGREB, 10002, CROATIA",0007-215X,1845-5859,BRODOGRADNJA,Brodogradnja,MAR,2022,73.0,1,,,,141,162,,10.21278/brod73108,0.0,,22,"Engineering, Marine",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,ZZ5JK,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:000773304700008,0

Based on that, this paper aims to expand the body of knowledge on the connection between Industry 4.0 technologies and food chain traceability and how they have been integrated. Design/methodology/approach-Before conducting a systematic literature review (SLR), we consulted academic experts in traceability and Industry 4.0 technologies to define the leading 4.0 technologies adopted. We then developed protocols and criteria for article selection. Based on the developed codebook, we performed a content analysis, refining it through discussions with experienced researchers. Findings-This paper identified seven Industry 4.0 technologies applied in conjunction with support and device systems. These combinations hold promise for generating value for food chain traceability systems. Value for the food supply chain originates from five sources: trust, process improvement, data processing, security, sustainability and regulation. Besides, three barriers to implementing such traceability technologies were identified: resources, lack of structure, stakeholders and values. Research limitations/implications-While this study focused specifically on the food chain, the technology combinations, values, barriers and categories identified herein can inform analyses for other chains, e.g. the pharmaceutical chain. Moreover, due to the recent growth of this topic, some existing values and barriers may not have been fully explored and the technology combinations may vary slightly. Practical implications-The results of this study provide food chain professionals with a comprehensive understanding of the values and corresponding barriers associated with employing Industry 4.0 traceability technologies. This knowledge can be leveraged to develop effective strategies and implement improvements in traceability, thereby benefiting society and addressing identified barriers. Originality/value-This study expands the literature on using Industry 4.0 technologies for traceability in food chains, providing valuable directions to build safer, more efficient, transparent and potentially more sustainable food chains. Additionally, we provide promising avenues for future research.","[Falcetti, Izabela Postingel; da Silva, Andrea Lago] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Ind Engn, Sao Carlos, Brazil; [Queiroz, Maciel M.] FGV EAESP, Sao Carlos, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Getulio Vargas Foundation,"da Silva, AL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Ind Engn, Sao Carlos, Brazil.",izapostingel@gmail.com; deialago@ufscar.br; maciel.queiroz@fgv.br,"Lago da Silva, Anea/F-6074-2012; M Queiroz, Maciel/F-1274-2014","Lago da Silva, Anea/0000-0003-3849-9698; M Queiroz, Maciel/0000-0002-6025-9191","Sao Paulo Research Foundation [2022/04315-5, 2020/04329-0]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [304241/2019-9]; Vinnova [2020-04329] Funding Source: Vinnova; Swedish Research Council [2020-04329] Funding Source: Swedish Research Council",Sao Paulo Research Foundation(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Vinnova(Vinnova); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"This research was supported by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation [Grant #2022/04315-5, Grant #2020/04329-0] and from National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), [code 304241/2019-9].",100,0,0,2,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-5771,1758-4094,BENCHMARKING,Benchmarking,2025 FEB 11,2025,,,,,,,,,10.1108/BIJ-08-2024-0641,0.0,FEB 2025,29,Management,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,W1Q2Y,,,2026-02-03,WOS:001416400300001,0

The research looks at 86 studies published between 2018 and 2022.Findings- There has been a steady but noticeable increase in the study of blockchain's potential in many application domains over the past few of years. This rising tendency illustrates the newness and potential of blockchain technology, as well as the increasing attention from academics. According to the findings, blockchain is an appropriate solution for processing transactions using cryptocurrencies; nevertheless, it still has significant technical issues and limits that require to be exploring and solving before it can be considered a viable option. It is therefore, necessary to have a high level of reliability for payments and confidentiality, in addition to maintaining the anonymity of nodes, to stop assaults and efforts to disrupt transactions in the blockchain.Practical implications- This study has several important theoretical and practical implications. First, it adds to the body of knowledge on blockchain and Fintech, focusing on the transaction side. While much blockchain research has focused on how the technology may affect strategic choices, this study has shed light on its potential from the perspective of financial reporting. Second, by highlighting the importance of the demand for the prompt identification of losses, this work adds to the body of knowledge on the factors that influence transaction frauds involving paper money. Additionally, by establishing the link between transparency and virtual transactions, the author backs up the asymmetric responses of investors to different investment possibilities. It looks at the evolution of financial technology (Fintech) and shows how it can be used to take the advantage of unique opportunities.Originality/value -The study is different and novel from the previously published literature on this topic mainly because of its comprehensiveness, as it revolves around all industrial and commercial areas.

This review explores the coordination chemistry and the concepts of 2D layered materials, particularly graphene, in enhancing corrosion resistance and delves into next-generation emerging nanostructures such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MXenes, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The present review is focused on the corrosion inhibition mechanisms, scalability, environmental impact, and industrial feasibility. The review unveils that while graphene exhibits exceptional barrier properties, its long-term performance is hindered by defect-induced localized corrosion. TMDs demonstrate superior chemical stability and passivation effects, whereas MXenes provide high electrical conductivity and self-healing capabilities, making them promising candidates for active corrosion protection. Meanwhile, h-BN offers excellent thermal and chemical resistance, and MOFs introduce a novel approach to corrosion inhibition through controlled release mechanisms. However, oxidation susceptibility, production scalability, and long-term stability remain critical obstacles for industrial implementation. These findings highlight the need for further research into hybrid material systems, functionalization strategies, and eco-friendly synthesis methods to optimize the effectiveness of 2D materials in corrosion mitigation.

They are featured by the wide varieties in fresh and processed forms, richness in nutrition, flavor, health benefits and diversity in origins, but are usually misunderstood or underrepresented in the modern food systems. Conventional processing and cooking methods are sometimes labor-intensive, less efficient and lack science-based guidelines to prevent unseen safety risks and food loss. Global and regional climate change have caused additional challenges to conventional cooking/processing, and increased native communities' reliance on externally produced foods, which have resulted in increasing nutritional unbalance and prevalence of diet-related health issues. Current and emerging technologies, such as storage and packaging, drying, safety processing, canning, pickling, and fermentation, which treat foods under optimized conditions to improve the safety and extend the shelf-life, are increasingly used in current food systems. Therefore, exploring these technologies for indigenous foods offers opportunities to better preserve their nutrition, safety, and accessibility, and is critical for the sovereignty and independence of indigenous food systems, and sustainability of indigenous food culture. This mini-review focuses on identifying adoptable processing and preservation technologies for selected traditional indigenous foods in North America, summarizing education, extension, and outreach resources and discussing the current challenges and future needs critical to expanding knowledge about indigenous foods and improving food sovereignty, nutrition security, and health equity.","[Heaney, Danielle; Padilla-Zakour, Olga I.; Chen, Chang] Cornell Univ, Dept Food Sci, Cornell AgriTech, Geneva, NY 14456 USA",Cornell University,"Padilla-Zakour, OI; Chen, C (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Food Sci, Cornell AgriTech, Geneva, NY 14456 USA.",oip1@cornell.edu; cc2774@cornell.edu,"Padilla-Zakour, Olga/I-5671-2015",,"USDA NIFA Multistate NC1023 project [NYG-623810, 7001076]",USDA NIFA Multistate NC1023 project,"The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

HRD diagnostics have undergone several stages of transformations: from detection of point mutations in HR-related genes and large regions with loss of heterozygosity detected using single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to whole-genome signatures of single-nucleotide variants, large genomic rearrangements (LGRs), and copy number alterations. All these methods have their own advantages and limitations. HRD tests, based on signatures of LGRs and copy number alterations, show in hindsight that some progenitor cells have possessed HRD status but not the current state of the genome. The aim of this review was to compare different methods of HRD detection and mechanisms of formation of HRD-specific LGRs. In the last several years, new data appeared implying a crucial role of proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the resolution of stalled replication forks that may be associated with at least some of LGRs observed in HRD-positive tumors. Reviewing current knowledge on these mechanisms, distributions of different LGR types, and limitations of sequencing technologies and algorithms of data analysis, we offer some new perspectives on HRD diagnostics. We hope that this review will help to accelerate the development of new diagnostic approaches in this important field of molecular oncology.","[Kechin, Andrey; Koryukov, Maksim; Mikheeva, Regina; Filipenko, Maksim] Inst Chem Biol & Fundamental Med, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Kechin, Andrey; Koryukov, Maksim; Mikheeva, Regina] Novosibirsk State Univ, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia","Institute of Chemical Biology & Fundamental Medicine, Siberian Branch of the RAS; Novosibirsk State University","Kechin, A (corresponding author), Inst Chem Biol & Fundamental Med, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.;Kechin, A (corresponding author), Novosibirsk State Univ, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.",aa_kechin@niboch.nsc.ru,"Filipenko, Maksim/AAU-9552-2020; Kechin, Andrey/K-2411-2017; Koryukov, Maksim/JBJ-0119-2023",,Russian Science Foundation [23-74-01138],Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),The work was supported by Russian Science Foundation grant No. 23-74-01138 New algorithms for detecting large genomic rearrangements to diagnose homologous recombination deficiency.,113,2,3,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-7659,1573-7233,CANCER METAST REV,Cancer Metastasis Rev.,MAR,2025,44.0,1,,,,,,19,10.1007/s10555-024-10238-y,0.0,,17,Oncology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Oncology,Q3C5H,39724448.0,,2026-02-03,WOS:001383506200001,0

Although chemical herbicides remain the predominant weed control strategy, their toxicity poses significant risks to human health and the environment. In response, organic agriculture has gained prominence as a more sustainable production system, with an increasing interest in alternative weed management approaches. Plants that produce allelopathic compounds capable of inhibiting the growth of unwanted species have emerged as promising sources of natural bioherbicides. While recent reviews have primarily focused on bioherbicides derived from microorganisms, a notable gap remains regarding the production and application of bioherbicides based on plant extracts. This review addresses this gap by summarizing current knowledge on the use of plant extracts for weed control in corn and bean cultivation. It discusses extraction methods, key plant species and active compounds, target weed species, herbicidal effects, modes of action, and patented technologies. Promising plants include Cuscuta campestris, Cymbopogon citratus, Mentha spp., Eucalyptus spp., and Pinus spp., which are rich in bioactive compounds such as phenolics (i.e., flavonoids), quinones, aldehydes and ketones, lactones, terpenoids (i.e., 8-cineole), and steroids. Plant extract-based bioherbicides show promising potential as sustainable and effective alternatives for weed management in organic agriculture, contributing to reducing the synthetic chemical herbicides, avoiding more resistances of weeds resistance of control, and promoting more environmentally friendly agricultural practices.","[Dolianitis, Bianca Motta; Tres, Marcus Vinicius; Zabot, Giovani Leone] Fed Univ Santa Maria UFSM, Lab Agroind Proc Engn LAPE, 3013 Taufik Germano Rd, BR-96503205 Cachoeira Do Sul, Brazil; [Frescura, Viviane Dal Souto] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Nat & Exact Sci Ctr, Roraima Ave 1000, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, Brazil; [Furtado, Guilherme de Figueiredo] Fed Univ Sao Carlos UFSCar, Ctr Nat Sci, Lauri Simoes Barros Rd,Km 12,Km 12-SP 189, BR-18290000 Buri, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos,"Zabot, GL (corresponding author), Fed Univ Santa Maria UFSM, Lab Agroind Proc Engn LAPE, 3013 Taufik Germano Rd, BR-96503205 Cachoeira Do Sul, Brazil.",biancadolianitis@hotmail.com; viviane.frescura@ufsm.br; gfurtado@ufscar.br; marcus.tres@ufsm.br; giovani.zabot@ufsm.br,"Tres, Marcus Vinícius/L-1255-2015; de Figueiredo Furtado, Guilherme/E-8985-2017; Zabot, Giovani Leone/G-8213-2012; Furtado, Guilherme/E-8985-2017","Tres, Marcus Vinícius/0000-0001-5252-0735; de Figueiredo Furtado, Guilherme/0000-0003-2280-0159; Zabot, Giovani Leone/0000-0001-7933-6161; Dal Souto Frescura, Viviane/0000-0003-1520-6979;","Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) [001]; National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) [404308/2023-6, 308067/2021-5]; Research Support Foundation of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS) [24/2551-0001977-4]; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2024/09837-5]",Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Research Support Foundation of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS)(Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS)); Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"This research was funded by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES; number 001), National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq; project numbers 404308/2023-6 and 308067/2021-5), Research Support Foundation of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS; project number 24/2551-0001977-4), and the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) (process 2024/09837-5).",113,2,2,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2624-7402,AGRIENGINEERING,AgriEngineering,SEP 4,2025,7.0,9,,,,,,288,10.3390/agriengineering7090288,0.0,,25,Agricultural Engineering,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Agriculture,7TP1W,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001579353700001,0

However, the current literature lacks a systematic review of specific typologies and methods regarding the application of remote sensing technology to CA monitoring. To address this knowledge gap, we systematically reviewed remote sensing-based methods for monitoring CA, its causes, and ecological effects. Our results show that the methods for monitoring abandoned cropland can be classified into 2 major categories: those based on image spectral features and those based on land cover temporal trajectories and vegetation phenology dynamics. Among the 8 subcategories, vegetation phenology and dynamic methods exhibit the highest average overall accuracy at 89.33% +/- 3.37%. Remote sensing plays a crucial role in assessing the causes of CA, such as road density, spatial information of agricultural infrastructure, and the ecological effects resulting from abandonment, including food loss risks, carbon sequestration, wildfire risk, evapotranspiration, wilderness quality, biodiversity, and climate change. Further advancements are needed in classifying abandoned cropland types, observing fragmented and temporally unstable parcels, and assessing ecological effects across different scenarios. More importantly, we presented a trinity CA monitoring framework based on the cause-pattern-effect pillars, which offers a novel perspective for comprehensive research on CA. Overall, our work provided a systematic and insightful perspective for advancing remote sensing research on CA.","[Liu, Tao; Yu, Le; Wu, Hui; Zhao, Qiang] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Global Change Studies, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ ,Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yu, Le] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ Ecol Field Stn East Asian Migratory Bi, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yu, Le] Tsinghua Univ, Xian Inst Surveying & Mapping, Joint Res Ctr Next Generat Smart Mapping, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaoxuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Peng, Dailiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xin] Shanxi Univ, Inst Loess Plateau, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China; [Du, Zhenrong] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Tu, Ying] Cornell Univ, Dept Global Dev, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Aerospace Information Research Institute, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Aerospace Information Research Institute, CAS; Shanxi University; Dalian University of Technology; Cornell University","Yu, L (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Inst Global Change Studies, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ ,Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Yu, L (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ Ecol Field Stn East Asian Migratory Bi, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Yu, L (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Xian Inst Surveying & Mapping, Joint Res Ctr Next Generat Smart Mapping, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",leyu@tsinghua.edu.cn,"TAO, LIU/GRS-2752-2022; Yu, Le/C-3701-2008; Liu, Xiaoxuan/Y-2976-2019; Du, Zhenrong/GRN-9594-2022; Zhao, Qiang/PBU-9283-2025","Yu, Le/0000-0003-3115-2042;",National Key R&D Program of China [2022YFE0195900],National Key R&D Program of China,This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (grant number: 2022YFE0195900).,145,13,13,41,51,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",,2694-1589,J REMOTE SENS-PRC,J.

Elevated SDF is associated with male infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, and failure of assisted reproductive technologies (ART). In 2021, the sixth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Manual for the Laboratory Examination and Processing of Human Semen has listed SDF as an extended test of semen that can be ordered under certain circumstances. However, the manual neither explained the indications for testing nor provided clear guidance on diagnostic thresholds.MethodsThis article summarizes the current body of knowledge regarding clinical applications of SDF, including the appropriate population to test, methods of testing, and management strategies.ResultsSeveral etiologic factors and pathophysiologic mechanisms for SDF have been described including poor lifestyle habits, noxious exposures, and varicocele. Four SDF assays are included in the WHO manual and may be utilized based on resources and expertise. Strategies to lower SDF levels in infertile men include addressing underlying causes, supplementation with antioxidants, shorter abstinence periods, and use of testicular sperm for intracytoplasmic sperm injection.ConclusionSDF testing can be implemented in the evaluation of infertile men and couples experiencing ART failure and appropriate management strategies can be offered to improve reproductive outcomes. There is vast potential for future research regarding the clinical utility of SDF in the evaluation and treatment of infertile couples.","[Farkouh, Ala'a; Saleh, Ramadan; Shah, Rupin; Agarwal, Ashok] Global Androl Forum, Chagrin Falls, OH USA; [Saleh, Ramadan] Sohag Univ, Fac Med, Dept Dermatol Venereol & Androl, Sohag, Egypt; [Saleh, Ramadan] Ajyal Hosp, Ajyal IVF Ctr, Sohag, Egypt; [Shah, Rupin] Lilavati Hosp & Res Ctr, Dept Urol, Div Androl, Mumbai, India; [Agarwal, Ashok] Cleveland Clin Fdn, Cleveland, OH USA; [Agarwal, Ashok] Global Androl Forum, Moreland Hills, OH 44022 USA",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Sohag University; Cleveland Clinic Foundation,"Agarwal, A (corresponding author), Global Androl Forum, Moreland Hills, OH 44022 USA.",agarwaa32099@outlook.com,"Saleh, Ramadan/L-2922-2018","Saleh, Ramadan/0000-0003-0503-3533; Shah, Rupin/0000-0002-7868-5949; Farkouh, Ala'a/0000-0002-0362-9109",,,,25,5,6,0,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2090-598X,2090-5998,ARAB J UROL,Arab J.

However, organic crops depend on various factors, such as the occurrence of pathogens in the fields, which cause losses in productivity and lead to economic damage. As a management strategy, farmers are still using synthetic pesticides during cultivation. Nevertheless, the indiscriminate application of these pesticides has resulted in negative effects and serious disruptions to the environment and humans. Thus, the use of chemical products as the sole solution is an idea that no longer holds because there are more sustainable management options available as alternatives for the farmers. Furthermore, the global scenario presents opportunities for the valorization of natural resources and the development of innovative research and solutions related to biological control and the formulation of biological-based products. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive review of biological and biochemical pesticides with a biotechnological approach aimed at organic agriculture. Biological pesticides consist of a microorganism as the active ingredient, while biochemical pesticides are natural-derived substances, such as plant extracts and sexual pheromones. Challenges and sustainable perspectives are presented within the context of biotechnology. Overall, the biological inputs sector has the potential to overcome the drawbacks of organic agriculture with the knowledge and disclosure of technological innovations from the scientific community and the agri-food sector.","[Ody, Lissara P.; dos Santos, Maicon S.

The growing demand for potato, coupled with severe environmental losses caused by extensive farming activities, implies the need for better crop protection and management practices. Precision agriculture is being well recognized as the solution as it deals with the management of spatial and temporal variability to improve agricultural returns and reduce environmental impact. As the initial step in precision agriculture, the traditional methods of crop and field characterization require a large input in labor, time, and cost. Recent developments in remote sensing technologies have facilitated the process of monitoring crops and quantifying field variations. Successful applications have been witnessed in the area of precision potato farming. Thus, this review reports the current knowledge on the applications of remote sensing technologies in precision potato trait characterization. We reviewed the commonly used imaging sensors and remote sensing platforms with the comparisons of their strengths and limitations and summarized the main applications of the remote sensing technologies in potato. As a result, this review could update potato agronomists and farmers with the latest approaches and research outcomes, as well as provide a selective list for those who have the intentions to apply remote sensing technologies to characterize potato traits for precision agriculture.","[Sun, Chen; Zhou, Jing; Ma, Yuchi; Xu, Yijia; Zhang, Zhou] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Biol Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Sun, Chen] Xian Inst Opt & Precis Mech, Key Lab Spectral Imaging Technol, Xian, Peoples R China; [Pan, Bin] Nankai Univ, Sch Stat & Data Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xi'an Institute of Optics & Precision Mechanics, CAS; Nankai University","Zhang, Z (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Biol Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",zzhang347@wisc.edu,"Zhou, Jing/AFD-7430-2022; Zhang, Zhou/F-7310-2017","Zhou, Jing/0000-0001-8384-0192; Xu, Yijia/0009-0008-2841-4359; Ma, Yuchi/0000-0002-0412-9851;","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [WIS03081]; University of Wisconsin-Madison, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research, and Graduate Education; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project; University of Wisconsin-Madison, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research, and Graduate Education(University of Wisconsin Madison); Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation(University of Wisconsin Madison)","This work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project WIS03081, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research, and Graduate Education with funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.",171,23,27,5,123,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Possible consequences of bypass diode failures are for example power loss, glass breakage or hot spot burns in PV modules. To avoid such situations, the key-role-playing bypass diode must be in good condition and the knowledge of the condition status is of high interest. For this reason, 36 Schottky diodes were randomly selected from the junction boxes of taken-back PV modules and examined using a variety of characterisation methods. These included electrical characterisation and imaging techniques. The investigation identified all three possible bypass diode states: (i) bypass diode functional and conducting in one direction and blocking in the other direction, (ii) bypass diode defective and conducting in both directions and (iii) bypass diode defective and no longer conducting in any direction. Defective bypass diodes that changed from failure state (ii) to failure state (iii) were found in different aged conditions. Conversely, only an abrupt transition was found for the state (i) to failure state (ii). The main objective of having a fast and suitable method for characterising Schottky bypass diodes in PV systems in the field, which is also in simple agreement with results from laboratory measurement technology, was found with the electrician's multimeter.","[Muehleisen, Wolfgang; Neumaier, Lukas] Silicon Austria Labs GmbH, Europastr 12, A-9524 Villach, Austria; [Brueckner, Martin] Hamamatsu Photon Deutschland GmbH, Arzbergerstr 10, D-82211 Herrsching, Germany",,"Mühleisen, W (corresponding author), Silicon Austria Labs GmbH, Europastr 12, A-9524 Villach, Austria.",wolfgang.muehleisen@silicon-austria.com,,,sterreichische Forschungsfrderungsgesellschafthttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004955; Austrian Climate and Energy Fund [897767]; Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG),sterreichische Forschungsfrderungsgesellschafthttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004955; Austrian Climate and Energy Fund; Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG),"As part of the Circular Economy 2nd Call for Proposals program, this project was conducted within the framework of the Austrian initiative 'PVReValue - Holistic Recycling of Photovoltaic Modules,' with co-financing provided by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) under Grant Number 897767.",18,2,3,0,7,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",,2804-7699,SCI TECHNOL ENERG TR,Sci.

Cannulated screws (CS) and femoral neck system (FNS) are well-accepted methods for femoral neck fracture treatment; however, these methods are associated with complications. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the relative safety and effective-ness of CS and FNS for treating young patients with femoral neck fractures. Methods: We searched the follow-ing sources for studies that compared CS and FNS fixation: Cochrane library, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Wanfang data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biology Medicine disc, and Chinese Science and Technology Journals. The outcomes were surgical and prognostic results and complications. Results: This meta -analysis included eight studies. The pooled results revealed that the two fixation methods were similar in terms of the operation time, length of hospital stay, healing time, intraoperative blood loss, non-union, femoral head necro-sis, and internal fixation cut-out. Compared with CS fixation, FNS fixation required fewer intraoperative fluoroscopies and had better Harris Hip Score, earlier weight-bearing, lower number of total complications, lesser femoral neck shortening, and lesser extent of nail retreat. Conclusion: FNS fixation outperforms CS fixation in terms of intraopera-tive fluoroscopies, Harris Hip Score, and morbidity in young patients with femoral neck fractures. Clinicians should consider FNS as a first choice in treating femoral neck fracture in young adults, except where this approach is contraindicated.","[Lu, Yao; Xu, Yibo; Huang, Qiang; Ren, Cheng; Li, Ming; Li, Zhong; Sun, Liang; Xue, Hanzhong; Zhang, Kun; Wang, Qian; Ma, Teng] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Honghui Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Xian 710054, Shaanxi Provinc, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhilong] Nucl Ind 417 Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Xian 710600, Shaanxi Provinc, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qian; Ma, Teng] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Hong Hui Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 555 Youyi East Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi Provinc, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Wang, Q; Ma, T (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Hong Hui Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 555 Youyi East Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi Provinc, Peoples R China.",tianyunqilai@163.com; gukemt@163.com,"Li, Ming/LXV-2628-2024",,,,,33,7,11,0,11,E-CENTURY PUBLISHING CORP,MADISON,"40 WHITE OAKS LN, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",1943-8141,,AM J TRANSL RES,Am.

The distinct physical and electrochemical characteristics of ruthenates and related materials have made them potential candidates for diverse uses and device grade applications. The extensive utilization of ruthenates in metal-ion batteries has been witnessed in the recent past due to their unique structural features, electronic structure, stability, and transport properties. The current technology related to batteries suffers from inadequate storage capacity, cyclic stability, and ionic conductivity, leading to a loss in electrochemical performance, battery longevity and efficiency. The challenges related to stability, cost effectiveness, synthesis complications, and technological aspects are the key difficulties that should be considered by the community while developing the batteries for the future. To address these issues, more consistent efforts are required to ensure scalable, reproducible and controlled synthesis of these materials to fully utilize their potential for applications in rechargeable metal-ion batteries. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge, opportunities, challenges and future prospects on the utilization of ruthenates and related materials as next-generation materials for high-performance metal-ion batteries.

Therefore, pre-lithiation is an indispensable procedure for LICs. At present, commercial LICs mostly use lithium metal as the lithium source to compensate for the irreversible capacity loss, which has the demerits of operational complexity and danger. However, the pre-lithiation strategy based on cathode sacrificial lithium salts (CSLSs) has been proposed, which has the advantages of low cost, simple operation, environmental protection, and safety. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a timely and comprehensive summary of the application of CSLSs to LICs. In this review, the important roles of pre-lithiation in LICs are detailed, and different pre-lithiation methods are reviewed and compared systematically and comprehensively. After that, we systematically discuss the pre-lithiation strategies based on CSLSs and mainly introduce the lithium extraction mechanism of CSLSs and the influence of intrinsic characteristics and doping amount of CSLSs on LICs performance. In addition, a summary and outlook are conducted, aiming to provide the essential basic knowledge and guidance for developing a new pre-lithiation technology.","[Su, Kailimai; Wang, Yan; Yang, Bao; Zhang, Xu; Wu, Wei; Lang, Junwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Lanzhou Inst Chem Phys, Lab Clean Energy Chem & Mat, State Key Lab Solid Lubricat, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Su, Kailimai] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Mat Sci & Optoelect Engn, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yan; Wu, Wei; Lang, Junwei] Qingdao Ctr Resource Chem & New Mat, Qingdao 266000, Peoples R China; [Yan, Xingbin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Optoelect Mat & Technol, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Sun Yat Sen University","Lang, JW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Lanzhou Inst Chem Phys, Lab Clean Energy Chem & Mat, State Key Lab Solid Lubricat, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.;Lang, JW (corresponding author), Qingdao Ctr Resource Chem & New Mat, Qingdao 266000, Peoples R China.;Yan, XB (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Optoelect Mat & Technol, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.",jwlang@licp.cas.cn; yanxb3@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"lang, jun/MYK-1507-2025; Yan, Xingbin/AAX-9096-2021","Yan, Xingbin/0000-0002-9976-8815","National Natural Science Foundation of China [22005318, 22075303]; Western Young Scholars Foundations of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Science Fund of Shandong Laboratory of Yantai Advanced Materials and Green Manufacturing [AMGM2022A02]; Provincial Youth Science and Technology Fund Program of Gansu Province [21JR7RA092]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Western Young Scholars Foundations of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Science Fund of Shandong Laboratory of Yantai Advanced Materials and Green Manufacturing; Provincial Youth Science and Technology Fund Program of Gansu Province,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 22005318, 22075303]; the Western Young Scholars Foundations of Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Science Fund of Shandong Laboratory of Yantai Advanced Materials and Green Manufacturing (AMGM2022A02) and the Provincial Youth Science and Technology Fund Program of Gansu Province [Project No. 21JR7RA092].",203,31,34,17,240,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2575-0356,ENERGY ENVIRON MATER,Energy Environ.

It affects crops by inducing both osmotic stresses, reducing water uptake, and ionic stress, causing harmful ion influx into the transpiration stream, leading to cellular damage. Salinity-induced stress results in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing oxidative harm to cellular components and membranes and, in severe cases, plant and cell death. Plants defend against salt-induced oxidative damage by eliminating ROS and regulating ROS production through the antioxidant defense system. Recent studies have shown that various bioactive nanoparticles (NPs), with specific shapes, sizes, and concentrations, can effectively mitigate salt stress in various agricultural plants. These NPs also enhance growth parameters, seed germination, root morphology, productivity, and physio-biochemical composition. However, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding the molecular processes governing NP transport and plant absorption. To harness NPs for sustainable agriculture, gaining a comprehensive understanding of biological processes across multiple levels is essential. Furthermore, as the demand for detailed information on complex agricultural traits and crop responses to NP exposure increases, omics technologies have advanced in precision agriculture and nanotoxicity research. In this review article, we leverage significant advancements in multi-omics to introduce the Nano-omics approach for mitigating the effects of salt stress on plants and enhancing their productivity.","[Singh, Abhishek; Ghazaryan, Karen] Yerevan State Univ, Fac Biol, Yerevan 0025, Armenia; [Rajput, Vishnu D.; Minkina, Tatiana; Mandzhieva, Saglara S.] Southern Fed Univ, Acad Biol & Biotechnol, Rostov Na Donu 344090, Russia; [Agrawal, Shreni] Parul Univ, Parul Inst Appl Sci, Dept Biotechnol, Vadodara 391760, Gujarat, India; [Al Tawaha, Abdel Rahman Mohammad] Al Hussein Bin Talal Univ, Dept Biol Sci, POB 20, Maan, Jordan; [Chauhan, Avnish] Graph Era Hill Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Bharu Wala Grant, Uttarakhand, India; [Singh, Rupesh Kumar] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci, CITAB, UTAD, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal; [Papadakis, Marios] Univ Witten Herdecke, Univ Hosp Witten Herdecke, Dept Surg 2, Heusnerstr 40, D-42283 Wuppertal, Germany; [Alexiou, Athanasios] Funogen, Dept Res & Dev, Athens, Greece; [Alexiou, Athanasios] AFNP Med, Dept Res & Dev, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Alexiou, Athanasios] Novel Global Community Educ Fdn, Dept Sci & Engn, Hebersham, NSW 2770, Australia; [Alexiou, Athanasios] Chandigarh Univ, Univ Ctr Res & Dev, Chandigarh Ludhiana Highway, Mohali, Punjab, India",Yerevan State University; Southern Federal University; Parul University; Parul Institute of Applied Sciences; Al-Hussein Bin Talal University; University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; Witten Herdecke University; Chandigarh University,"Rajput, VD (corresponding author), Southern Fed Univ, Acad Biol & Biotechnol, Rostov Na Donu 344090, Russia.;Papadakis, M (corresponding author), Univ Witten Herdecke, Univ Hosp Witten Herdecke, Dept Surg 2, Heusnerstr 40, D-42283 Wuppertal, Germany.",intmsc.abhi@gmail.com; rajput.vishnu@gmail.com; shreniagrawal01@gmail.com; kghazaryan@ysu.am; tminkina@mail.ru; Abdeltawaha74@gmail.com; avnishchauhan_in@yahoo.com; msaglara@mail.ru; rupeshbio702@gmail.com; drmariospapadakis@gmail.com; athanasios.th.alexiou@gmail.com,"Al Tawaha, Abdel Rahman/KPB-6660-2024; Minkina, Tatiana/A-1683-2014; Mandzhieva, Saglara/A-1681-2014; Rajput, Vishnu/I-7824-2017; Papadakis, Marios/AAI-6622-2020; Singh, Rupesh/AFO-6901-2022; singh, Abhishek/GZM-2369-2022; chauhan, avnish/AAU-3899-2021; Alexiou, Athanasios/AAT-8491-2021","Singh, Rupesh/0000-0002-2536-1967; singh, Abhishek/0000-0002-0049-6910; chauhan, avnish/0000-0003-0421-8173; Alexiou, Athanasios/0000-0002-2206-7236","Projekt DEAL; University of Witten-Herdecke Germany; Higher education and science committee MESCS Republic of Armenia [23PostDoc-4D007, 21AG-4C075]; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation [FENW-2023-0008]; Strategic Academic Leadership Program of Southern Federal University",Projekt DEAL; University of Witten-Herdecke Germany; Higher education and science committee MESCS Republic of Armenia; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation; Strategic Academic Leadership Program of Southern Federal University,"Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Emerging electronic and mobile health (e-& mHealth) technology may provide new ways to offer interventions in order to reduce modifiable lifestyle risk factors in this vulnerable population. This scoping review aimed to assess the state of knowledge about the use of e-& mHealth technology-based interventions to address modifiable lifestyle risk factors amongst individuals with SMI. Method EMBASE, Medline (Ovid) and PsycINFO were searched to identify papers published up to July 2021. Extended PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews were followed to report the results. Results A total of 85 papers were identified, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria. These interventions were effective in bringing about positive and clinically significant impacts in weight loss, diet, smoking cessation, and physical activity for some participants. However, many participants did not experience these benefits. Overall, participants indicated that they were satisfied with, and receptive to e-& mHealth interventions. Conclusion The evidence base for the use of technology-based interventions to improve modifiable lifestyle risk factors for people with SMI is very limited. More rigorous research on the use of technological tools is needed to determine how more users could benefit from them.

In recent years, CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) gene-editing technology has emerged as a promising tool for developing resistance against various plant pathogens. Its application in combating parasitic plants, however, remains largely unexplored. This review aims to summarise current knowledge and research gaps in utilising CRISPR to develop resistance against parasitic plants. First, we outline recent improvements in CRISPR gene editing tools, and what has been used to combat various plant pathogens. To realise the immense potential of CRISPR, a greater understanding of the genetic basis underlying parasitic plant-host interactions is critical to identify suitable target genes for modification. Therefore, we discuss the intricate interactions between parasitic plants and their hosts, highlighting essential genes and molecular mechanisms involved in defence response and multilayer resistance. These include host resistance responses directly repressing parasitic plant germination or growth and indirectly influencing parasitic plant development via manipulating environmental factors. Finally, we evaluate CRISPR-mediated effectiveness and long-term implications for host resistance and crop improvement, including inducible resistance response and tissue-specific activity. In conclusion, this review highlights the challenges and opportunities CRISPR technology provides to combat parasitic plants and provides insights for future research directions to safeguard global agricultural productivity.","[Jhu, Min-Yao; Ellison, Evan E.] Univ Cambridge, Crop Sci Ctr, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge, England; [Sinha, Neelima R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Cambridge; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Jhu, MY (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Crop Sci Ctr, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge, England.;Sinha, NR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",myj23@cam.ac.uk; nrsinha@ucdavis.edu,,"Jhu, Min-Yao/0000-0002-8654-0977","The authors declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Selfing species tend to share similar reproductive traits in morphology and function, and such a set of traits is called the 'selfing syndrome'. Although the genetic basis of the selfing syndrome has been of great interest to evolutionary biologists, knowledge of the causative genes or mutations was limited until recently. Thanks to advances in population genomic methodologies combined with high-throughput sequencing technologies, several studies have successfully unravelled the molecular and genetic basis for evolution of the selfing syndrome in Capsella, Arabidopsis, Solanum and other genera. Here we first introduce recent research examples that have explored the loci, genes and mutations responsible for the selfing syndrome traits, such as reductions in petal size or in pollen production, that are mainly relevant to pre-pollination processes. Second, we review the relationship between the evolution of selfing and interspecific pollen transfer, highlighting the findings of post-pollination reproductive barriers at the molecular level. We then discuss the emerging view of patterns in evolution of the selfing syndrome, such as the pervasive involvement of loss-of-function mutations and the relative importance of selection versus neutral degradation.This article is part of the theme issue 'Genetic basis of adaptation and speciation: from loci to causative mutations'.","[Tsuchimatsu, Takashi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, 7-3-1 Hongo,Bunkyo ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Fujii, Sota] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, 1-1-1 Yayoi,Bunkyo ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Fujii, Sota] Suntory Rising Stars Encouragement Program Life Sc, Bunkyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Tsuchimatsu, T (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, 7-3-1 Hongo,Bunkyo ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.;Fujii, S (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, 1-1-1 Yayoi,Bunkyo ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.;Fujii, S (corresponding author), Suntory Rising Stars Encouragement Program Life Sc, Bunkyo, Japan.",tsuchimatsu@bs.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp; a-fujii@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Tsuchimatsu, Takashi/A-9218-2017","Tsuchimatsu, Takashi/0000-0003-1241-9338; Fujii, Sota/0000-0002-4814-5116",,,,125,27,27,6,73,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8436,1471-2970,PHILOS T R SOC B,Philos.

Weeds cause huge economic yield losses that range from US$100 million to US$26 billion globally. The knowledge of weed science has offered success in the past through effective, reasonably priced, and secure technologies; specifically, synthetic herbicides to effectively control weeds in agroecosystems. Weed science is accepted and adopted by many universities with teaching, research, and/or extension programs in agriculture. Globally, approximately 7% of all the universities offering agricultural education have dedicated weed science departments focusing on weed biology, ecology, and management. Some universities also offer weed science degree programs or at least certain courses in their degrees related to associated disciplines, such as plant protection, agronomy, and ecology. Although substantial advances have been made in weed science, such as a separate weed science discipline, specialized journals, and specific weed science societies and conferences worldwide, many constraints (e.g., lack of trained weed scientists) and barriers to adoption of new weed science technologies remain. Slow modernization in weed science research and low funding has slowed the progress of this discipline. New curricula in the weed science discipline should focus on the role of biochemistry, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, and genetics in weed science research.","[Ahmad, Taseer] Nigde Omer Halisdemir Univ, Dept Plant Prod & Technol, Nigde, Turkiye; [Jabran, Khawar] Nigde Omer Halisdemir Univ, Dept Plant Prod & Technol, Nigde, Turkiye; [Cheema, Zahid Ata] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Agron, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Bajwa, Ali Ahsan] La Trobe Univ, Ctr AgriBiosciences AgriBio, Dept Anim Plant & Soil Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Farooq, Muhammad] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Agr & Marine Sci, Dept Plant Sci, Al Khoud, Oman",Nigde Omer Halisdemir University; Nigde Omer Halisdemir University; University of Agriculture Faisalabad; La Trobe University; Sultan Qaboos University,"Farooq, M (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Agr & Marine Sci, Dept Plant Sci, Al Khoud, Oman.",farooqcp@squ.edu.om,"Bajwa, Ali/B-9948-2016; Jabran, Khawar/B-4679-2012","Bajwa, Ali/0000-0002-7171-3118; Jabran, Khawar/0000-0001-8512-3330",This research received no specific grant from any funding agency or the commercial or not-for-profit sectors.

Ocular manifestations range from fluctuations in vision, to microstructural changes in the retina and choroid, to dry eye disease. This narrative review highlights the range of pregnancy-related effects on the eye and vision that are likely to present in the context of routine eyecare. Specifically, physiological ocular changes and pathological ocular changes that manifest for the first time, or are exacerbated, in uncomplicated pregnancy are discussed. The literature has evolved from simply noting differences in the eye between pregnant and non-pregnant groups, to refining knowledge of the proposed underlying pathophysiology with the advent of newer technologies in eyecare. A particular focus of this review is navigating when pregnancy changes in the eye occur or peak during the gestational period, and whether the changes are short-lived or might extend past pregnancy. While many pregnancy-associated changes are temporary and resolve post-partum, it is also recognised that some changes persist after pregnancy, with a notable absence of literature on ocular changes with loss or termination of pregnancy. Currently or previously pregnant women (or those planning to become pregnant), and other health professionals, should be educated about the importance of seeking eyecare before, during and after pregnancy.","[Nguyen, Bao N.; Britten-Jones, Alexis Ceecee; Bui, Bang, V] Univ Melbourne, Dept Optometry & Vis Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Walker, Lorraine E.] Monash Univ, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Titter, Peta] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nursing, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Melbourne; Monash University; University of Tasmania,"Nguyen, BN (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Optometry & Vis Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",bnguyen@unimelb.edu.au,"Nguyen, Bao/AAA-7839-2022; Walker, Lorraine/E-1011-2014; Bui, Bang/AAD-2679-2021; Britten-Jones, Alexis Ceecee/AAJ-4295-2020","Nguyen, Bao/0000-0002-3097-619X; Walker, Lorraine/0000-0001-9726-1853; Bui, Bang/0000-0001-7298-1352; Britten-Jones, Alexis Ceecee/0000-0002-1101-2870",Faculty of Medicine Dentistry and Health Sciences Momentum Fellowship from The University of Melbourne; Melbourne Postdoctoral Fellowship from The University of Melbourne; Women's Health Education Network,Faculty of Medicine Dentistry and Health Sciences Momentum Fellowship from The University of Melbourne; Melbourne Postdoctoral Fellowship from The University of Melbourne; Women's Health Education Network,BNN is funded by a Faculty of Medicine Dentistry and Health Sciences Momentum Fellowship from The University of Melbourne.

Although germline and mosaic (described in the NF2 gene) pathogenic variants in NF2, SMARCB1, and LZTR1 account for the majority of cases, a subset of affected individuals remains without a definitive molecular diagnosis, including those associated with 22q loss of heterozygosity at the tumor level. The absence of a specific disease cause limits effective risk assessment, clinical surveillance, and genetic counselling. In recent years, advances in sequencing technologies have facilitated the identification of novel candidate driver genes. However, the rarity of these findings makes it challenging to establish their pathogenic relevance. This review aims to evaluate the current knowledge of genetic contributors to schwannomatosis in patients for whom routine genetic testing fails to detect a molecular cause in the known associated genes. On chromosome 22, DGCR8 and SOX10 have emerged as novel susceptibility genes, supported by accumulating molecular and clinical data. In addition, genes such as CDKN2A and SMARCA4 may also contribute to schwannomatosis in the context of broader tumor predisposition syndromes. These emerging genetic associations may help explain a proportion of schwannomatosis cases that currently lack a molecular diagnosis, while there is still room for the discovery of non-coding alleles or mosaic forms of known schwannomatosis-related conditions as well as novel genes that could explain unresolved cases.","[Nogue, Clara; Salvador, Lluis; Rivera, Barbara] Bellvitge Biomed Res Inst IDIBELL, Hereditary Canc Grp, Avinguda Granvia Hosp 199, Barcelona 08908, Spain; [Nogue, Clara] Univ Barcelona UB, Gran Via Corts Catalanes 585, Barcelona 08007, Spain; [Hasselblatt, Martin] Univ Hosp Munster, Inst Neuropathol, Munster, Germany; [Rivera, Barbara] Jewish Gen Hosp, Lady Davis Inst Med Res, Segal Canc Ctr, 3755 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 1E2, Canada; [Rivera, Barbara] McGill Univ, Gerald Bronfman Dept Oncol, Montreal, PQ H4A 3T2, Canada",Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL); University of Barcelona; University of Munster; Lady Davis Institute; Jewish General Hospital - Montreal; McGill University,"Rivera, B (corresponding author), Bellvitge Biomed Res Inst IDIBELL, Hereditary Canc Grp, Avinguda Granvia Hosp 199, Barcelona 08908, Spain.;Rivera, B (corresponding author), Jewish Gen Hosp, Lady Davis Inst Med Res, Segal Canc Ctr, 3755 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 1E2, Canada.;Rivera, B (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Gerald Bronfman Dept Oncol, Montreal, PQ H4A 3T2, Canada.",brivera@idibell.cat,"Rivera, Barbara/AAI-8047-2020","Rivera, Barbara/0000-0001-9434-6288",Agncia de Gesti d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca [2021 SGR01066]; Instituto de Salud Carlos III [CP21/00038]; Children's Tumor Foundation [CTF-2023-01-003]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacin [CNS2023-144251],Agncia de Gesti d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca; Instituto de Salud Carlos III(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Children's Tumor Foundation; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacin,"CN is a fellow of the Children's Tumor Foundation Young Investigator Award (Grant number CTF-2023-01-003). https://doi.org/10.48105/CTF.CTF-2023-01-003.pc.gr.172010.

In the long term this chronic inflammatory response can lead to scarring of the liver, a condition known as fibrosis. The development of liver fibrosis is largely independent of the causative agent, although the pattern of initial fibrosis (periportal, pericentral or sinusoidal) can vary. Untreated and progressive fibrosis can sometimes lead to complete architectural deconstruction and deposition of connective tissue in the liver, intestines and other parenchymal organs, with a gradual loss of function. In the end stage of liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, encephalopathy, bleeding or carcinomas, e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (iCCCa), can occur. Intestinal fibrosis is one of the most devastating complications of Crohn's disease. With novel and consistent therapeutic interventions, fibrotic processes can be stopped and reversed. New research technologies have substantially improved our knowledge of liver fibrogenesis and intestinal fibrosis. The focus of this review article is on MASLD and Crohn's disease, chronic inflammatory diseases of the liver and intestines with increasing prevalence and a major impact on the general population.

The extraterrestrial environment, characterized by microgravity, radiation, and extreme logistical constraints, induces systemic alterations that significantly increase the risk of debilitating oral diseases. This narrative review synthesizes current knowledge on the multifaceted impacts of space travel on the orofacial complex and examines the technological frontiers being developed to mitigate these risks. Key findings reveal that spaceflight precipitates profound physiological changes, including altered salivary composition, microbial dysbiosis that enhances pathogen virulence, and accelerated bone density loss in the jaw, which can compromise dental stability. These factors increase astronaut susceptibility to conditions such as dental caries, severe periodontal inflammation, and temporomandibular disorders. In response, aerospace dentistry is pioneering innovative countermeasures to address the limitations of conventional care in microgravity. Emerging solutions include advanced tele-dentistry platforms for real-time remote consultation, AI-powered diagnostic algorithms for early disease detection, and on-demand 3D fabrication of dental instruments. Furthermore, the development of autonomous robotic dental systems and space-adapted biomaterials, including nanotechnology composites and self-healing polymers, promises to revolutionize in-flight treatment capabilities. Prioritizing these advanced dental protocols and technologies in mission planning is imperative for safeguarding crew health, ensuring operational readiness, and paving the way for sustainable human exploration of deep space.","[Sadat Kachouei, Sara Alsadat; Kachouei, Sayed Soroush Sadat] Univ Georgia, Fac Dent, Tbilisi, Georgia; [Heidari, Faezeh] Shahed Univ, Fac Dent, Dept Pediat Dent, Tehran, Iran; [Heboyan, Artak] Yerevan State Med Univ Mkhitar Heratsi, Fac Stomatol, Dept Prosthodont, Yerevan, Armenia; [Banakar, Morteza] Saveetha Univ, Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci, Saveetha Dent Coll & Hosp, Ctr Mol Med & Diag COMManD, Chennai, India; [Banakar, Morteza] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Inst Hlth, Hlth Policy Res Ctr, Shiraz, Iran; [Zafar, Muhammad Sohail; Fareed, Muhammad Amber] Ajman Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Clin Sci, Ajman, U Arab Emirates; [Zafar, Muhammad Sohail; Fareed, Muhammad Amber] Ajman Univ, Ctr Med & Bioallied Hlth Sci Res, Ajman, U Arab Emirates; [Zafar, Muhammad Sohail] Univ Jordan, Sch Dent, Amman, Jordan",Shahed University; Yerevan State Medical University; Saveetha Institute of Medical & Technical Science; Saveetha Dental College & Hospital; Shiraz University of Medical Science; Ajman University; Ajman University; University of Jordan,"Banakar, M (corresponding author), Saveetha Univ, Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci, Saveetha Dent Coll & Hosp, Ctr Mol Med & Diag COMManD, Chennai, India.;Banakar, M (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Inst Hlth, Hlth Policy Res Ctr, Shiraz, Iran.",dr.mbanakar@gmail.com,"Banakar, Morteza/O-1456-2018; Zafar, Muhammad Sohail/N-2800-2014; Heboyan, Artak/V-5219-2019; Fareed, Muhammad/AAC-1917-2019","Banakar, Morteza/0000-0003-1715-0198;",,,,103,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0892-6638,1530-6860,FASEB J,Faseb J.,DEC 6,2025,39.0,23,,,,,,e71284,10.1096/fj.202503258R,0.0,,16,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,N2866,41351523.0,Bronze,2026-02-03,WOS:001631422200001,0

Host-resistant genetic mechanisms aid breeders to identify resistance loci and linked markers for the clubroot, Fusarium yellows, downy mildew, black rot, stem rot, soft rot, white rust, and turnip mosaic virus diseases in Brassica vegetables. Introgression of the resistance (R) genes by marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding strategies allow the development of disease-resilient varieties. Brassica rapa clubroot-resistant genes (CRa, CRc, CRd, CRk, and Crr5) have been introgressed into Chinese cabbage, while CR genes (CRa, CRb, CRc, Crr1, Crr2, and Crr3) from B. rapa were also introgressed into B. oleracea. Beyond MAS, R genes can be precisely engineered by CRISPR-based technologies into precise and durable resistant varieties. The involvement of DNA methylation and histone modifications epigenetically regulate resistance mechanisms, often via ethylene/salicylic acid/jasmonic acid signaling pathways. DNA methylation mediates systemic acquired resistance by the differential expression of genes such as JAZ1, PR3, and NDR1. Future progress will depend on identifying epiQTLs and epi-markers linked to R genes. Epigenetic insights with genetic knowledge will facilitate breeding of biotic stress-resilient Brassica vegetables. This review synthesizes current molecular understanding of biotic stressors and provides future directions for disease resistance breeding of Brassica vegetable plants.","[Akter, Mst.

Scientific research on technology-based work extending has flourished in recent decades, but yielded inconclusive results about its relationship with workers' wellbeing and focused on different temporal characteristics of the behaviour. Consequently, in this article, we address the question of whether different temporal characteristics of technology-based work extending, such as the frequency and duration of the behaviour, may have different consequences for workers' wellbeing. In the course of a systematic literature review, we analyzed 78 empirical studies published between 2007 and 2021 that investigate the relationship between the self-rated frequency and the self-rated duration of work extending behaviours and 14 wellbeing indicators. Whereas most studies examined the frequency of work extending behaviours and its consequences, only 19 studies examined the effects of its duration. Based on our findings, we propose three effects: The strain effect of frequent work extending, the gain effect of sustained work extending, and the loss-of-private-time effect inherent to work extending and independent from its frequency and duration. Our findings not only provide in-depth information on a widespread contemporary behaviour and its psychological implications, we also reveal research gaps and shed light on behaviours associated with role transitions and thus contribute to boundary theory.","[Schoellbauer, Julia] Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, Dept Occupat Econ & Social Psychol, Vienna, Austria; [Hartner-Tiefenthaler, Martina] TU Wien, Inst Management Sci, Dept Labor Sci & Org, Vienna, Austria; [Kelliher, Clare] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Sch Management, Cranfield, England",University of Vienna; Technische Universitat Wien; Cranfield University,"Hartner-Tiefenthaler, M (corresponding author), TU Wien, Inst Management Sci, Dept Labor Sci & Org, Vienna, Austria.",martina.hartner-tiefenthaler@tuwien.ac.at,"Hartner-Tiefenthaler, Martina/CAC-3809-2022; Schoellbauer, Julia/GXW-2510-2022","Hartner-Tiefenthaler, Martina/0000-0003-1597-3975; Kelliher, Clare/0000-0002-0282-0307; Schoellbauer, Julia/0000-0002-2620-8438",,,,136,3,3,5,37,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

Due to its ability to capture, stabilize, and store C for extended periods, soils are considered important allies in decarbonizing the atmosphere. The term 'C stabilization' includes a series of mechanisms or processes by which soil C is protected within soils and its losses are reduced through microbial decomposition or leaching. Due to their relevance in the global C cycle, C stabilization mechanisms have received intensive attention from the scientific community. As new analytic technologies push the boundaries of what was previously possible to know, new paradigms emerge. This literature review summarizes the current knowledge of the main mechanisms that may promote SOM stabilization. Factors that govern accumulation of SOM are also addressed. We highlight the role of organo-mineral associations and spatial inaccessibility of SOM due to occlusion within soil aggregates to understand the relative contribution of these mechanisms in different soil conditions (e.g., soil texture, mineralogy, and land-use). In addition, the contribution of cutting-edge approaches and analytical techniques to advance the understanding of SOM protection is presented. Modern techniques to evaluate SOM on a micro, nano, and molecular scale can contribute to the mechanistic understanding of SOM stabilization and the study and adoption of management strategies that maintain and increase C stocks in soils.","[Carvalho, Martha Lustosa; Maciel, Victor Ferreira; Ferreira, Tiago Osorio; Cerri, Carlos Eduardo Pellegrino; Cherubin, Mauricio Roberto] Univ Sio Paulo, Dept Ciencia Solo, Escola Super Agr Luiz Queiroz, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Ferreira, Tiago Osorio; Cerri, Carlos Eduardo Pellegrino; Cherubin, Mauricio Roberto] Univ Sio Paulo, Ctr Estudos Carbono Agr Trop, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Bordonal, Ricardo de Oliveira; Carvalho, Joao Luis Nunes] Ctr Nacl Pesquisa Energia & Mat, Lab Nacl Biorrenovaveis, Campinas, SP, Brazil",,"Cherubin, MR (corresponding author), Univ Sio Paulo, Dept Ciencia Solo, Escola Super Agr Luiz Queiroz, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.;Cherubin, MR (corresponding author), Univ Sio Paulo, Ctr Estudos Carbono Agr Trop, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",cherubin@usp.br,"Cerri, Carlos Eduardo/E-6456-2015; de Oliveira Bordonal, Ricardo/O-6228-2015; Carvalho, João Luís/AAD-5370-2020; Ferreira, Tiago Osório/D-3340-2015; Cherubin, Maurício Roberto/A-6896-2016","Cerri, Carlos Eduardo/0000-0002-4374-4056; Lustosa Carvalho, Martha/0000-0002-1720-7652; de Oliveira Bordonal, Ricardo/0000-0001-5957-2909; Carvalho, João Luís/0000-0001-5089-9411; Ferreira, Tiago Osório/0000-0002-4088-7457; Cherubin, Maurício Roberto/0000-0001-7920-8362","RCGI - Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Innovation [311787/2021-5, 2020/15230-5, 21/10573-4]; Bayer S/A (project - Balanco de carbono em sistemas agricolas; CNPq [311787/2021-5]; Center for Carbon Research in Tropical Agriculture (CCARBON) - FAPESP [21/10573-4]",RCGI - Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Innovation; Bayer S/A (project - Balanco de carbono em sistemas agricolas; CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Center for Carbon Research in Tropical Agriculture (CCARBON) - FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"We gratefully acknowledge the support of the RCGI - Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Innovation (2020/15230-5) , Bayer S/A (project - Balanco de carbono em sistemas agricolas: revelando o impacto da adoc & atilde;o de praticas de manejo sustentaveis nos estoques de carbono do solo e nas emiss & otilde;es de gases de efeito estufa) and CNPq (311787/2021-5) .

However, when exposed to harsh environmental conditions, these compounds can become chemically unstable and susceptible to degradation, volatilization, and oxidation. Encapsulation technology has been largely employed to maintain the biological activities of EOs during the processing and development of novelty-enriched food products for industrial application. In this review, a brief description of EOs is presented and the main encapsulation methods used to protect them are highlighted. In addition, the structural characteristics and stability of encapsulated EOs were evaluated based on the rheological behavior, such as flow behavior, viscosity, and viscoelastic properties determined by two types of tests: oscillatory dynamic measurements (e.g., strain/stress sweep, time, temperature, and frequency sweep, including determination of storage modulus (G'), loss modulus (G ''), complex modulus (G*), and complex viscosity (eta*)), and static tests (creep and recovery). This work also contains information about fundamentals, principles, and importance of rheology for the evaluation of stability, strength, and structural characteristics of encapsulated EOs before the drying process to obtain nano(micro)particles. The knowledge of rheological behavior revealed to be important for large-scale industrial production, and application of encapsulated EOs, since during the processing and production, food products are submitted to high stress, temperature, and long-time operations.","[Tavares, Loleny; Lima, Paulo Silva; de Oliveira, Martinho Marques] Univ Aveiro, Sch Design Management & Prod Technol Northern Ave, Estr Cercal 449, P-3720509 Santiago De Riba Ul, Portugal; [Zapata Norena, Caciano Pelayo] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Food Sci & Technol, Av Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Barros, Helio L.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Pharm, Av Prof Gama Pinto, P-1649003 Lisbon, Portugal; [Smaoui, Slim] Univ Sfax Tunisia, Ctr Biotechnol Sfax, Lab Microbial Enzymat Biotechnol & Biomol LBMEB, Rd Sidi Mansour Km 6,POB 1177, Sfax 3018, Tunisia",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade de Lisboa; Universite de Sfax; Centre de Biotechnologie de Sfax,"Tavares, L (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Sch Design Management & Prod Technol Northern Ave, Estr Cercal 449, P-3720509 Santiago De Riba Ul, Portugal.",tavaresloleny@ua.pt,"Lima, Paulo/IXN-5352-2023; Barros, Helio/AAO-7163-2021; Tavares, Loleny/AAT-6798-2021; SMAOUI, Slim/AAP-4974-2020; Marques de Oliveira, Jose Martinho/D-5605-2011; Noreña, Caciano/B-9754-2008","Lima, Paulo/0000-0001-7959-5104; Barros, Helio/0000-0003-4797-7292; Tavares, Loleny/0000-0002-2112-4702; SMAOUI, Slim/0000-0002-8839-7377; Marques de Oliveira, Jose Martinho/0000-0003-1564-5728;",,,,82,32,33,1,59,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0268-005X,1873-7137,FOOD HYDROCOLLOID,Food Hydrocolloids,AUG,2022,129.0,,,,,,,107628,10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.107628,0.0,MAR 2022,11,"Chemistry, Applied; Food Science & Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Food Science & Technology,2Q4XD,,,2026-02-03,WOS:000820426300004,0

Even though catfish species are more susceptible to E. ictaluri, other fish species are also affected, and up to 44 fish species in four continents are known to be susceptible. The diseases caused by E. ictaluri are known as enteric septicaemia of catfish (ESC) in channel catfish, bacillary necrosis of pangasius (BNP) in striped catfish, red head disease in yellow catfish and edwardsiellosis in tilapia. Outbreaks caused by E. ictaluri can cause up to 100% mortality resulting in substantive economic losses to the industry, threatening food security and undermining sustainability. Although efforts have been made to prevent and control this pathogen using vaccines, antibiotics, disease resistance selective breeding, functional feed ingredients, prebiotics and probiotics, and biosecurity measures, E. ictaluri is still causing health issues in different countries.

RA group produced better results than the FA group in operation time (WMD = - 6.59; 95% CI - 12.79 to - 0.40; P = 0.04), blood loss (WMD = - 34.81; 95% CI - 50.55 to - 19.08; P < 0.0001), number of fluoroscopic (WMD = - 18.24; 95% CI - 30.63 to - 5.85; P = 0.004), accuracy of pedicle screw position: Grade A (OR = 3.16; 95% CI 2.36-4.23; P < 0.00001), Grade B (OR = 0.39; 95% CI 0.28-0.54; P < 0.00001), Grade C (OR = 0.27; 95% CI 0.13-0.54; P = 0.0002), and Grade D (OR = 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-0.98; P = 0.05), FJV: Grade 0 (OR = 3.27; 95% CI 1.34-8.02; P = 0.010), Grade 1 (OR = 0.24; 95% CI 0.16-0.38; P < 0.00001), Grade 2 (OR = 0.24; 95% CI 0.12-0.51; P = 0.0002), and Grade 3 (OR = 0.26; 95% CI 0.07-0.93; P = 0.04). But no significant differences in VAS score, ODI, JOA score, clinical efficacy, hospital stays, and complications. These results demonstrate a significant improvement in the intraoperative course of the RA technique. However, RA-MIS-TLIF has not yet demonstrated significant advantages in terms of postoperative symptom relief and functional improvement. Future research and clinical practice should further explore the efficacy of this technique to optimize outcomes and quality of life for patients with DLSD.

Human plant domestication began in the Fertile Crescent around 12,000 years ago and spread throughout the world, including China, Mesoamerica, the Andes and Near Oceania, Sub-Saharan Africa, and eastern North America. Indus valley civilizations have played a great role in the domestication of grain legumes. Crops, such as pigeon pea, black gram, green gram, lablab bean, moth bean, and horse gram, originated in the Indian subcontinent, and Neolithic archaeological records indicate that these crops were first domesticated by early civilizations in the region. The domestication and evolution of wild ancestors into today's elite cultivars are important contributors to global food supply and agricultural crop improvement. In addition, food legumes contribute to food security by protecting human health and minimize climate change impacts. During the domestication process, legume crop species have undergone a severe genetic diversity loss, and only a very narrow range of variability is retained in the cultivars. Further reduction in genetic diversity occurred during seed dispersal and movement across the continents. In general, only a few traits, such as shattering resistance, seed dormancy loss, stem growth behavior, flowering-maturity period, and yield traits, have prominence in the domestication process across the species. Thus, identification and knowledge of domestication responsive loci were often useful in accelerating new species' domestication. The genes and metabolic pathways responsible for the significant alterations that occurred as an outcome of domestication might aid in the quick domestication of novel crops. Further, recent advances in omics sciences, gene-editing technologies, and functional analysis will accelerate the domestication and crop improvement of new crop species without losing much genetic diversity. In this review, we have discussed about the origin, center of diversity, and seed movement of major food legumes, which will be useful in the exploration and utilization of genetic diversity in crop improvement. Further, we have discussed about the major genes/QTLs associated with the domestication syndrome in pulse crops and the future strategies to improve the food legume crops.","[Ambika, Muraleedhar S.] Univ Agr Sci, Dept Genet & Plant Breeding, GKVK, Bangalore, India; [Aski, Muraleedhar S.; Talukdar, Akshay; Sharma, Brij Bihari; Joshi, Rekha; Kumar, Rajendra] Indian Agr Res Inst ICAR, Div Genet, New Delhi, India; [Gayacharan, Akshay] Natl Bur Plant Genet Resources ICAR, New Delhi, India; [Hamwieh, Aladdin] Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas ICARDA, Giza, Egypt; [Gupta, Santosh Kumar] Natl Inst Plant Genome Res NIPGR, New Delhi, India; [Upadhyaya, H.

However, a consensus on the relative effectiveness and safety of this operation and other methods is still lacking. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of sutureless SF-IOL with other methods. Aphakia means that the lens leaves the normal position and loses its original function, including absence or complete dislocation and subluxation of the lens which could cause anisometropic amblyopia, strabismus, and loss of binocular function in children and adolescents. For adults, the loss of the lens could lead to high hyperopia and affect vision. Above all this disease can seriously affect the quality of life of patients.MethodsLiterature about sutureless SF-IOL in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Technical Journal VIP database, and Wanfang database published from 2000 to 2022 was reviewed. The weighted average difference was calculated by RevMan5.3 software for analysis. Two researchers independently selected the study and used the Cochrane collaboration tool to assess the risk of errors. Cochrane bias risk tool was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. This study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022363282).ResultsThe postoperative IOL-related astigmatism of sutureless SF-IOL was lower than that of suture SF-IOL, and there was statistical difference when we compared the absolute postoperative spherical equivalent after sutureless SF-IOL and suture SF-IOL. Indicating that the degree of refractive error after sutureless SF-IOL was lower. Meanwhile, the operation time of sutureless SF-IOL was shorter than that of suture SF-IOL. The subgroup analysis showed that the absolute postoperative spherical equivalent and astigmatism values in Yamane technique were lower than those in suture SF-IOL.ConclusionSutureless SF-IOL has the advantages of stable refraction, short operation time, and less postoperative complications. However, high-quality literature to compare these technologies is lacking. Some long-term follow-up longitudinal prospective studies are needed to confirm the findings.","[Liu, Zhao; Xie, Qian; Chen, Xingwang; Xie, Bing; Cai, Shanjun] Zunyi Med Univ, Dept Neurol, Affiliated Hosp, 149 Dalian Rd, Zunyi 563003, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xingwang; Xie, Bing; Cai, Shanjun] Guizhou Eye Hosp, Zunyi 563003, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xingwang; Xie, Bing; Cai, Shanjun] Natl Eye Dis Clin Res Ctr, Guizhou Prov Branch, Zunyi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xingwang; Xie, Bing; Cai, Shanjun] Zunyi Med Univ, Special Key Lab Ocular Dis Guizhou Prov, Zunyi 563003, Peoples R China",Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University,"Cai, SJ (corresponding author), Zunyi Med Univ, Dept Neurol, Affiliated Hosp, 149 Dalian Rd, Zunyi 563003, Peoples R China.;Cai, SJ (corresponding author), Guizhou Eye Hosp, Zunyi 563003, Peoples R China.;Cai, SJ (corresponding author), Natl Eye Dis Clin Res Ctr, Guizhou Prov Branch, Zunyi, Peoples R China.;Cai, SJ (corresponding author), Zunyi Med Univ, Special Key Lab Ocular Dis Guizhou Prov, Zunyi 563003, Peoples R China.",caishanjun@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [31871261],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant number 31871261.

While multiple methods have been developed to control its infestations, there is an urgent need for eco-friendly insecticides that selectively target its critical systems or pathways. One such target is its digestive system, which is essential for its survival. This review highlights the potential of using the digestive system of the red palm weevil to manage its infestations. Proteomic and transcriptomic data analyses on the weevils have provided a better understanding of the protein and gene compositions in its digestive system. With technological advancements, a more comprehensive approach can be taken to explore the opportunities in manipulating the data on the digestive system of red palm weevil, leading to improved management methods. Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, commonly known as red palm weevil (RPW), is a high-risk insect pest that has become a threat to many important palm species. There are several dominant factors that lead to the successful infestation of RPW, including its stealthy lifestyle, highly chitinized mouthpart, and high fecundity rate. Due to that, millions of dollars of losses have been suffered by many countries invaded by RPW. Several methods have been designed to control its invasion, including the usage of insecticides, but many cause resistance and environmental pollution. Therefore, an environmentally friendly insecticide that targets specific systems or pathways in RPW is urgently needed. One of the potential targets is the digestive system of RPW, as it is the major interface between the insect and its plant host. The related knowledge of RPW's digestive system, such as the anatomy, microflora, transcriptomic analysis, and proteomic analysis, is important to understand its effects on RPW's survival. Several data from different omics regarding the digestive systems of RPW have been published in separate reports. Some of the potential targets have been reported to be inhibited by certain potential insecticides, while other targets have not yet been tested with any inhibitors. Hence, this review may lead to a better understanding on managing infestations of RPW using the system biology approach for its digestive system.","[Seman-Kamarulzaman, Ahmad-Faris; Pariamiskal, Faizatul Atikah; Azidi, Amiratul Nabihah; Hassan, Maizom] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Syst Biol, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Seman-Kamarulzaman, Ahmad-Faris] Univ Teknol MARA Pahang, Fac Appl Sci, Kuantan 26400, Pahang, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Hassan, M (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Syst Biol, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",afkamarulzaman@uitm.edu.my; p115980@siswa.ukm.edu.my; maizom@ukm.edu.my,"SEMAN KAMARULZAMAN, AHMAD FARIS/E-5544-2018; Maizom, Hassan/J-4507-2017","SEMAN KAMARULZAMAN, AHMAD FARIS/0000-0002-3021-2077; Maizom, Hassan/0000-0002-7322-2216","Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia, through Long Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS) [LRGS/F2/01/2020/08]","Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia, through Long Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS)","This research was funded by the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia, through Long Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS), under the grant number LRGS/F2/01/2020/08.",107,11,12,0,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,INSECTS,Insects,JUN,2023,14.0,6,,,,,,506,10.3390/insects14060506,0.0,,15,Entomology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Entomology,K2TT1,37367322.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001015022200001,0

Among the various carbon utilization pathways, the electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2R) presents a compelling approach, enabling the direct conversion of CO2 and water into valuable fuels and chemical feedstocks using renewable electricity. While recent breakthroughs in mechanistic insights, catalyst materials, and reactor designs have been achieved, significant challenges remain in translating promising lab-scale results into techno-economically viable technologies. Key challenges hindering this transition include (1) a lack of rational screening and scalable fabrication methods for high-performance electrocatalysts and corresponding electrode assemblies; (2) a shortage of understanding how the transport phenomena within the electrodes and electrolyzers affect the microenvironment of reactions; and (3) a deficiency in designing principles for electrolyzers and stacks capable of large-scale production. All these points originate from the knowledge mismatch of the CO2R between the microscopic perspective and the systematic point of view. Therefore, bridging the gap between fundamental knowledge of the reaction at the molecular level and process engineering for scale-up at the module level is crucial to accelerating the application of CO2R.This Account describes chemistry and engineering methodologies, highlighting progress from our group and the broader field, aimed at inspiring a pathway toward large-scale CO2R. Addressing the need for screening highly active catalysts, we leverage descriptor-based neural networks to rationally construct alloys and single-atom active sites to exhibit tailored reactivity. We then focus on translating these molecular concepts into durable, high-performance catalyst layers integrated into gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) through advanced coating and fabrication techniques. These approaches are crucial for managing interfacial contact resistances and distributed Ohmic losses. Moreover, they enable precise control over interfacial gas-liquid equilibria within the porous electrode architecture. To tackle challenges of gas-flow pressure drop and Joule heating during scale-up, we have proposed device design requirements for conducting CO2 electrolysis at elevated pressure and temperature. Additionally, an outlook for a CO2R technology roadmap is discussed. Ultimately, this Account underscores how integrating fundamental molecular insights with rigorous process design provides a powerful roadmap toward industrial CO2R technology.","[Zhang, Gong; Li, Shuying; Du, Xiaowei; Zhang, Yangning; Wang, Tuo; Zhang, Peng; Gong, Jinlong] Tianjin Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Sci & Engn, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Key Lab Green Chem Technol,Minist Educ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tuo; Zhang, Peng; Gong, Jinlong] Minist Educ, Int Joint Lab Low Carbon Chem Engn, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tuo; Zhang, Peng] Tianjin Univ, Natl Ind Educ Platform Energy Storage, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tuo; Zhang, Peng] Haihe Lab Sustainable Chem Transformat, Tianjin 300192, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Peng] Tianjin Univ, Joint Sch Natl Univ Singapore & Tianjin Univ, Int Campus, Fuzhou 350207, Peoples R China; [Gong, Jinlong] Tianjin Normal Univ, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China; [Gong, Jinlong] Tianjin Univ, State Key Lab Synthet Biol, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Tianjin University; Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science & Engineering Tianjin; Tianjin University; Nankai University; Haihe Laboratory of Sustainable Chemical Transformations; TJU-NUS Joint Institute; Tianjin University; Tianjin Normal University; Tianjin University,"Zhang, P; Gong, JL (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Sci & Engn, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Key Lab Green Chem Technol,Minist Educ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.;Zhang, P; Gong, JL (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Int Joint Lab Low Carbon Chem Engn, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China.;Zhang, P (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Natl Ind Educ Platform Energy Storage, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China.;Zhang, P (corresponding author), Haihe Lab Sustainable Chem Transformat, Tianjin 300192, Peoples R China.;Zhang, P (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Joint Sch Natl Univ Singapore & Tianjin Univ, Int Campus, Fuzhou 350207, Peoples R China.;Gong, JL (corresponding author), Tianjin Normal Univ, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China.;Gong, JL (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, State Key Lab Synthet Biol, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",p_zhang@tju.edu.cn; jlgong@tju.edu.cn,"Zhang, Peng/L-3925-2014; Du, Xiaowei/P-5559-2019","Zhang, Peng/0000-0003-2228-3569; Zhang, Gong/0000-0002-9100-4810","National Natural Science Foundation of China [2021YFA1501503]; National Key R&D Program of China [22121004, 22250008, 22361142838, 22038009]; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Haihe Laboratory of Sustainable Chemical Transformations; Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Haihe Laboratory of Sustainable Chemical Transformations; Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)","The authors acknowledge the National Key R&D Program of China (2021YFA1501503), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22121004, 22250008, 22361142838, 22038009), the Haihe Laboratory of Sustainable Chemical Transformations, the Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities, and the Xplorer Prize for financial support.

During the Covid-19 pandemic there was a rapid move to online modalities of Continuous Professional Development, but there is a paucity of evidence in relation to their effectiveness compared with face-to-face, or in-class learning.Design: A rapid synthesis review.Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL and HEALTH BUSINESS ELITE databases were used to identify relevant articles that were published between 2016 and 2022. Original studies of any design investigating Continuing Professional Development activities, with or without a comparison between interventions or activities were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was followed. The Kirkpatrick model was adopted as a globally recognised method for evaluating training programmes. Results: After a full text analysis, 34 papers were included in the review. Face to face was the most common method of delivery followed by online, while blended (a mix of face-to-face and online delivery) was the least common method used. The teaching modalities were not associated with specific learning contents, but were used for a range of content. Most studies obtained positive outcomes following implementation of the educational interventions. Kirkpatrick Level 4 (results) was the most commonly measured outcome.Conclusions: While blended learning was the least common method of delivery, it was found to be more beneficial for learners than face-to-face or online exclusively. There are now new spaces to learn and new technologies that allow us to 'reimagine' where, when and how we teach. This requires Continuing Professional Development providers to design and tailor their courses according to health professionals' learning needs and the clinical contexts where they work. We recommend that Continuing Professional Development providers involve employers when designing teaching and learning activities for Long Term Care workers, to decide which modalities enable effective knowledge translation.","[Pagnucci, Nicola] Univ Genoa, Dept Hlth Sci, Via A Pastore 1, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Pagnucci, Nicola; Aleo, Giuseppe; Orlik, Witold; Fitzgerald, Catherine] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Fac Nursing & Midwifery, European Ctr Excellence Res Continuing Profess Dev, 123 St Stephens Green, Dublin, Ireland; [Aleo, Giuseppe; Orlik, Witold; Mahon, Paul; Kearns, Thomas; Fitzgerald, Catherine] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Fac Nursing & Midwifery, 123 St Stephens Green, Dublin, Ireland; [Mahon, Paul; Kearns, Thomas] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Fac Nursing & Midwifery, Ctr Nursing & Midwifery Advancement, 123 St Stephens Green, Dublin, Ireland; [Kelly, Carmel; Lordan, Thomas] Leading Healthcare Providers Skillnet, 2A Convent Rd, Dun Laoghaire A96 W7C5, Dublin, Ireland",University of Genoa; Royal College of Surgeons - Ireland; Royal College of Surgeons - Ireland; Royal College of Surgeons - Ireland,"Fitzgerald, C (corresponding author), Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Fac Nursing & Midwifery, European Ctr Excellence Res Continuing Profess Dev, 123 St Stephens Green, Dublin, Ireland.;Fitzgerald, C (corresponding author), Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Fac Nursing & Midwifery, 123 St Stephens Green, Dublin, Ireland.",catherinefitzgerald@rcsi.ie,"mahon, paul/MIQ-5099-2025; Pagnucci, Nicola/NLN-8810-2025; ALEO, GIUSEPPE/C-3848-2016","Pagnucci, Nicola/0000-0003-4601-3993; Fitzgerald, Catherine/0000-0002-3542-3869; ALEO, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-1306-3364",[21635A01],,"Funding This study was funded by Leading Healthcare Providers Skillnet, a not -for-profit learning network (grant number 21635A01)",78,6,11,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",1471-5953,1873-5223,NURSE EDUC PRACT,Nurse Educ.

The aim of this research was to inform stakeholders in the construction industry in developing nations about the value of safety and possible strategies for influencing their opinions regarding safety protocols. The importance of safety to the construction sector, which is crucial to the advancement of the country, has also been emphasised. However, due to a lack of adequate safety understanding among stakeholders in the construction sector, the construction industry is characterised by a great deal of instability and hazard. To determine what factors affect productive working conditions in construction production, this study examined safety. We studied what is obtainable in developed countries through a literature review and then making recommendations for developing countries. A systematic review approach was used to examine 81 research articles on construction safety that were released between 2004 and 2022. There were not many articles on construction safety before 2004. The person dimension, environmental factors, safety behaviour, organisation features, technology, and safety incentives were the six construction safety categories into which the results of this study were classified from the in-depth review of the health and safety literature. Additionally, these construction safety variables were developed into a conceptualised framework. To solve different construction safety issues related to working conditions in the construction sector, this study adds to the body of knowledge by systematically classifying and defining the often-utilised safety variables. It is now imperative to bring in these dimensions to improve the safe working conditions in the construction industry, particularly in developing countries. By putting these safety factors into practice, the construction industry can reduce safety risks, lower the number of accidents and fatalities, cut expenses related to subpar safety performance, safeguard the reputation of construction companies, boost employee morale and satisfaction with their work, enhance employee retention, reduce absenteeism, and enhance sustainability goals. Furthermore, it is certain that the conceptual framework that has been suggested would be novel and well-liked in developing countries. The conceptual framework was created with this supposition in mind.","[Alejo, Ayodele; Aigbavboa, Clinton] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Sustainable Human Settlement & Construct Res Ctr, Dept Construction Management & Quant Surveying, ZA-2008 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Aghimien, Douglas] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Civil Engn Technol, ZA-2008 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg; University of Johannesburg,"Alejo, A (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Sustainable Human Settlement & Construct Res Ctr, Dept Construction Management & Quant Surveying, ZA-2008 Johannesburg, South Africa.",ayourlejo@yahoo.com; caigbavboa@uj.ac.za; aghimiendouglas@gmail.com,"; Aghimien, Douglas/H-4534-2018; Aigbavboa, Clinton/AAS-6493-2020","ALEJO, Ayodele/0000-0001-9699-5425; Aigbavboa, Clinton/0000-0003-2866-3706",,,This research received no external funding.,100,3,4,12,34,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2024,16.0,18,,,,,,8213,10.3390/su16188213,0.0,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,H9P1H,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001326669800001,0

This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of 35 peer-reviewed studies to evaluate the current state of AR integration in education critically. The review analyzes key variables such as skills acquisition, pedagogical frameworks, technological features, and domain-specific applications to understand the broader impact of AR on teaching and learning. The findings reveal that AR significantly enhances student engagement (37.14%), learning experiences (34.29%), and motivation (22.86%), making it a powerful tool for fostering active participation and long-term knowledge retention. Widely adopted AR technologies include AR toolkits, 3D AR models, mobile AR applications, and marker-based/markerless systems, which support hands-on learning across diverse disciplines. The study also highlights the pedagogical versatility of AR, showing strong alignment with models such as constructivist learning, inquiry-based learning, flipped classrooms, and experiential learning, enabling educators to tailor instructional strategies to diverse student needs. In terms of disciplinary reach, AR is most prevalent in general education (27.77%) and engineering (22.22%), followed by applications in science, chemistry, medical education, and STEM. However, the review also identifies underexplored areas, particularly the limited focus on academic achievement, visualization improvement, and content realism, especially in fields like medicine and science where accurate simulations are critical. To address these gaps, the paper explores the potential of AI-powered chatbots as a complement to AR environments. These intelligent systems offer real-time, personalized feedback, enabling adaptive learning pathways that respond to individual performance and cognitive development. The integration of AI enhances AR by making learning more inclusive, student-centered, and efficient, particularly beneficial for learners with diverse needs and learning paces. Despite the transformative potential of AR, challenges such as accessibility, cost, usability, and teacher readiness remain significant barriers to large-scale adoption. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and NCERT support future educational frameworks to integrate AR and AI into curriculum design for underserved and multilingual contexts. This paper supports the development of inclusive AR systems that scale up and follow pedagogical principles to enhance experiential learning and digital equity, and cognitive development in various educational settings.","[Garg, Neha; Kaur, Amanpreet; Dutta, Rubina] Chitkara Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Chandigarh, Punjab, India; [Ahmad, Faizan] Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Technol, Cardiff, Wales","Panjab University; Chitkara University, Punjab; Cardiff Metropolitan University","Kaur, A (corresponding author), Chitkara Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Chandigarh, Punjab, India.;Ahmad, F (corresponding author), Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Technol, Cardiff, Wales.",amanpreet.kaur@chitkara.edu.in; fahmad@cardiffmet.ac.uk,"dutta, Rubina/AGY-9379-2022; Kaur, Amanpreet/AGV-5475-2022","Ahmad, Faizan/0000-0003-0595-5343; , Neha Garg/0009-0009-8252-6893",,,,43,0,1,21,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2578-1863,HUM BEHAV EMERG TECH,Hum.

During this period, there have been several government policy intervention schemes and pragmatic support actions from development agencies towards improving agriculture in this area with differing level of success. Over the same period, there have been dramatic advances in remote sensing (RS) technologies with tailored applications to sustainable agriculture globally. However, the extent to which intervention schemes have harnessed the incipient potential of RS for achieving sustainable agriculture in the study area is unknown. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the synergy between agriculture policy interventions and applications of RS towards optimizing results. Thus, this study used systematic literature review and desk analysis to identify previous and current projects and studies that have applied RS tools and techniques to all aspects of agriculture in the study area. Databases searched include Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, AoJ, and PubMed. To consolidate the gaps identified in the literature, ground-truthing was carried out. From the 26 focused publications found on the subject, only 13 (54%) were found employing RS in various aspects of agriculture observations in the study area. Out of the 13, 5 studies focused on mapping the extents of irrigation areas; 2 mapped the size of crop and pasturelands; 1 focused on soil water and nutrient retention; 1 study focused on crop health monitoring; and another focused on weeds/pest infestations and yield estimation in the study area. On the type of data, only 1 (7%) study used MODIS, 2 (15%) used ASTER image, 1 used Sentinel-2 data, 1 used Planetscope, 1 used IKONOS, 5 used Landsat images, 1 used Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and another 1 used RADAR for mapping and monitoring agriculture activities in the study area. There is no evidence of the use of LiDAR data in the area. These results validate the hypothesis that failing agriculture in the study area is due to a paucity of high-quality spatial data and monitoring to support informed farm decision-making.","[Moomen, Abdul-Wadood] Univ Energy & Nat Resources UENR, Sch Mines & Built Environm, POB 214, Sunyani, Ghana; [Yevugah, Lily Lisa; Boakye, Louvis; Osei, Jeff Dacosta] Univ Energy & Nat Resources UENR, Sch Geosci, POB 214, Sunyani, Ghana; [Muthoni, Francis] Int Inst Trop Agr IITA, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya",,"Yevugah, LL (corresponding author), Univ Energy & Nat Resources UENR, Sch Geosci, POB 214, Sunyani, Ghana.",abdul-wadood.moomen@uenr.edu.gh; lily.yevugah@uenr.edu.gh; louvis.boakye@uenr.edu.gh; jeff.osei@uenr.edu.gh; f.muthoni@cgiar.org,"Muthoni, Francis/AAJ-7353-2020; Moomen, Abdul-Wadood/X-8644-2019; Yevugah, Lily Lisa/AAX-3053-2021","Muthoni, Francis/0000-0001-6785-0550; Moomen, Abdul-Wadood/0000-0002-6842-5078; Yevugah, Lily Lisa/0000-0002-0242-6158; Boakye, Louvis/0000-0002-1426-9081",CGIAR Trust fund,CGIAR Trust fund(CGIAR),We thank all the study communities for their voluntary collaboration and maximum participation during field work.,113,3,5,3,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,APR,2024,14.0,4,,,,,,546,10.3390/agriculture14040546,0.0,,22,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,OY1F2,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001210738700001,0

They provide a wide range of ecosystem services, which directly or indirectly benefit humans and can be grouped into four broad categories: provisioning (e.g. food production); regulating (e.g. carbon sequestration); supporting (e.g. primary production); and cultural (e.g. recreational, and eco-tourism). This study provides a review of publications focusing on seagrass ecosystem services provision to identify knowledge gaps and improve our understanding of the use of these habitats as nature-based solutions to societal challenges, such as climate change. Results showed that some ecosystem services, namely food provision, carbon sequestration, and maintenance of biodiversity/nursery habitats receive a higher level of focus and attention than others, such as regulation of diseases and social relations, which are rarely, if ever, included in studies. It is clear that in order to fully comprehend the nature-based solution potential held by seagrass ecosystems, studies need to consider ecosystem services as a whole, and also combine and share results across global regions, to better understand the potential impacts of degradation and loss of these ecosystems worldwide. Suggestions include applying novel technologies such as remote sensing and ecological niche modelling to address some of the main gaps in seagrass research, like meadow extent and connectivity within landscapes, to better incorporate preservation of seagrass ecosystems in marine management plans.","[do Amaral Camara Lima, Mariana] Univ Salford, Sch Sci Engn & Environm, Manchester M5 4WT, Lancs, England; [Bergamo, Thaisa F.

This review synthesizes current knowledge on its multifactorial pathogenesis, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, apoptosis, and satellite cell impairment. Neuromuscular alterations such as motor unit Remodeling and neuromuscular junction degeneration further exacerbate functional decline. Diagnostic approaches, ranging from DXA, CT, MRI, and ultrasound imaging to functional assessments like handgrip strength and gait speed, exhibit variability that complicates standardization. Therapeutic strategies are equally versatile. Resistance-based exercise and targeted nutritional support remain first-line, but late-phase trials of myostatin-neutralising antibodies (e.g., LY2495655, bimagrumab) and oral selective androgen-receptor modulators (SARMs; e.g., enobosarm, GSK2881078) now show dose-dependent gains in appendicular lean mass and preliminary functional benefits, signalling that combination regimens integrating lifestyle and drug therapy are imminent. Integration of these approaches with personalized medicine paradigms and AI-driven diagnostic tools holds promise for improved outcomes. This review also outlines critical research areas including mechanistic studies, diagnostic standardization, and translational gaps between preclinical models and clinical application. Addressing these challenges requires an interdisciplinary strategy that encompasses molecular, clinical, and public health perspectives to mitigate the personal and societal impacts of sarcopenia. Future efforts must focus on harmonizing diagnostic criteria, refining therapeutic regimens, and leveraging emerging technologies to develop targeted interventions that preserve muscle function and enhance quality of life in the aging population.","[Jeyaraman, Madhan; Jeyaraman, Naveen] ACS Med Coll & Hosp, Dr MGR Educ & Res Inst, Dept Orthopaed, Chennai 600077, Tamil Nadu, India; [Jeyaraman, Madhan; Jeyaraman, Naveen; Nallakumarasamy, Arulkumar; Ramasubramanian, Swaminathan; Muthu, Sathish] Agathisha Inst Stemcell & Regenerat Med AISRM, Dept Regenerat Med, Chennai 600030, Tamil Nadu, India; [Jeyaraman, Madhan; Jeyaraman, Naveen; Muthu, Sathish] Orthopaed Res Grp, Dept Orthopaed, Coimbatore 641045, Tamil Nadu, India; [Nallakumarasamy, Arulkumar] Jawaharlal Inst Postgrad Med Educ & Res JIPMER KAR, Dept Orthopaed, Pondicherry 609602, India; [Muthu, Sathish] Meenakshi Acad Higher Educ & Res, Meenakshi Med Coll Hosp & Res Inst, Cent Res Lab, Chennai 600078, India; [Murugan, Shrideavi] Govt Tirunelveli Med Coll & Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Tirunelveli 627002, Tamil Nadu, India; [Rajendran, Sree Naga Sowndary] Jawaharlal Inst Postgrad Med Educ & Res JIPMER, Dept Neonatol, Dhanvantri Nagar, Gorimedu 605006, Pondicherry, India; [Rajendran, Ramya Lakshmi; Ahn, Byeong-Cheol] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Sci, FOUR KNU Convergence Educ Program Biomed Sci Creat, Daegu 41944, South Korea; [Rajendran, Ramya Lakshmi; Ahn, Byeong-Cheol; Gangadaran, Prakash] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Med, Dept Nucl Med, 680 gukchaebosang Ro, Daegu 41944, South Korea; [Rajendran, Ramya Lakshmi; Ahn, Byeong-Cheol; Gangadaran, Prakash] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Cardiovasc Res Inst, Daegu 41944, South Korea; [Ahn, Byeong-Cheol] Kyungpook Natl Univ Hosp, Dept Nucl Med, Daegu 41944, South Korea",Dr. M.G.R.

Throughout the research process, we conducted an extensive literature search across numerous databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), CQVIP, and Wanfang. Based on the literature screening criteria, we selected six studies, encompassing 358 cases of femoral neck fracture patients, for this meta-analysis. The study evaluated the effectiveness of TiRobot-assisted versus freehand placement of the Femoral Neck System (FNS). The results indicate that the TiRobot-assisted group demonstrated significant advantages in several surgical parameters. Specifically, the robot-assisted group showed superior outcomes regarding the frequency of guide pin insertion, frequency of X-ray fluoroscopy, operative time, invasive fixation time, intraoperative blood loss and incision length (MD < 0, p < 0.05). Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the Harris score, between the TiRobot-assisted group and the traditional freehand group (MD > 0, p < 0.05). However, the two groups had no significant differences concerning postoperative complications, fracture healing time, and fracture healing rate (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis suggests that the TiRobot-assisted technique has distinct advantages over the traditional freehand technique in treating femoral neck fractures. TiRobot-assisted technology, owing to its enhanced safety and efficacy, minimizes surgical trauma and expedites postoperative recovery.","[Dai, Yupei; Wang, Kaiyong; Shen, Guohang; Chen, Yang; Jin, Qunhua] Ningxia Med Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Gen Hosp, 804 Shengli South St,Ward 3, Yinchuan 750004, Ningxia Hui Aut, Peoples R China; [Dai, Yupei; Wang, Kaiyong; Jin, Qunhua] Gen Hosp Ningxia Med Univ, Inst Osteoarthropathy, Inst Med Sci, Ningxia Key Lab Clin & Pathogen Microbiol, 804 Shengli South St,Hui Autonomous Reg, Yinchuan, Ningxia, Peoples R China; [Hu, Anneng] North Sichuan Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Urol, 1 Mao Yuan South Rd, Nanchong 637000, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Ningxia Medical University; Ningxia Medical University; North Sichuan Medical University,"Jin, QH (corresponding author), Ningxia Med Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Gen Hosp, 804 Shengli South St,Ward 3, Yinchuan 750004, Ningxia Hui Aut, Peoples R China.;Jin, QH (corresponding author), Gen Hosp Ningxia Med Univ, Inst Osteoarthropathy, Inst Med Sci, Ningxia Key Lab Clin & Pathogen Microbiol, 804 Shengli South St,Hui Autonomous Reg, Yinchuan, Ningxia, Peoples R China.",13326380467@163.com,"Hu, Anneng/KHX-7198-2024; Shen, Guohang/OLQ-2473-2025; WANG, Kaiyong/KPB-2596-2024",,Key R&D Project of Autonomous Region [2023BEG02018]; Autonomous Region Major Scientific and Technological; Achievements Transformation Project [2023CJE09037]; Ningxia Medical University General Hospital Medical Engineering Special [NYZYYG-001],Key R&D Project of Autonomous Region; Autonomous Region Major Scientific and Technological; Achievements Transformation Project; Ningxia Medical University General Hospital Medical Engineering Special,This study was supported by the Key R&D Project of Autonomous Region (No.2023BEG02018); Autonomous Region Major Scientific and Technological; Achievements Transformation Project (No. 2023CJE09037); Ningxia Medical University General Hospital Medical Engineering Special (No. NYZYYG-001).,36,0,1,1,2,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1863-2483,1863-2491,J ROBOT SURG,J.

To facilitate this, efficient and durable technologies need to be developed for the generation, storage, transportation, and use of H. All these value chain stages require materials that can withstand continuous exposure to H. Once absorbed, H can eventually concentrate to critical levels in a stressed microstructure, inducing specific damage mechanisms and consecutive loss of mechanical properties. This is known as hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Being one of the most significant structural material types, steels are widely used throughout the H value chain. They can suffer from HE, and numerous attempts are made towards understanding and mitigating this complex phenomenon. While originating at a size scale of atoms, HE acts on multiple spatio-temporal scales, and combined efforts of experimental and modelling techniques are needed to deal with it. This perspective is devoted to assimilating the knowledge that can be generated by density functional theory (DFT) methods to understand interactions between H and iron-based materials, and to promote finding solutions to HE in metallic materials in general. We aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the properties calculated using DFT that can help advance finding novel H-resistant high-strength materials that facilitate the green shift at sufficient performance levels to meet the growing future needs.

The overall estimated prevalence of TGEV infection in pigs in China is 10% (3887/50403), and the prevalence of TGEV in northeast China is 38% (2582/3078700) is significantly higher than the rest of China. The prevalence of TGEV infection was related to the sampling season and region.Conclusion: The results of the study show that the prevalence of TGEV is clearly seasonal and regional. Therefore, further research and monitoring of the prevalence of TGEV infection and the development of control programs based on different conditions are essential. In addition, effective and robust regulatory measures should be taken in colder regions to prevent the spread and transmission of TGEV in pigs.","[Chen, Shuiyun; Zhang, Huiying; Chu, Mingfeng; Cheng, Wei; Chen, Xuelong; Qi, Yanping] Anhui Sci & Technol Univ, Anhui Prov Key Lab Anim Nutr Regulat & Hlth, Grass Fed Livestock Resource Utilizat & Hlth Sci &, Fengyang 23310, Peoples R China; [Zhai, Junjun] Yulin Univ, Shanxi Prov Engn & Technol Res Ctr Shanbei Cashmer, Yulin 719000, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Honghai] Daqing Agr & Rural Bur, Daqing 163711, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",Yulin University,"Chen, XL; Qi, YP (corresponding author), Anhui Sci & Technol Univ, Anhui Prov Key Lab Anim Nutr Regulat & Hlth, Grass Fed Livestock Resource Utilizat & Hlth Sci &, Fengyang 23310, Peoples R China.",cxlandqyp@163.com; qiyanping2018@vip.163.com,"QI, Yanping/OCL-3631-2025",,"Natural Science Key Foundation of Anhui Education Department [KJ2023A0877, KJ2021A0872]; Fund for Less Developed Regions of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [31960710]",Natural Science Key Foundation of Anhui Education Department; Fund for Less Developed Regions of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the Natural Science Key Foundation of Anhui Education Department (KJ2023A0877; KJ2021A0872); Fund for Less Developed Regions of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31960710).,57,12,13,1,9,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0882-4010,1096-1208,MICROB PATHOGENESIS,Microb.

Digital medical images have become valuable resources that aid health care systems' decision-making and treatment procedures. A medical image consumes a significant amount of memory, and the size of medical images continues to grow as medical imaging technology progresses. In addition, an image is shared for analysis to support knowledge sharing and disease diagnosis. Therefore, health care systems must ensure that medical images are appropriately distributed without information loss in a timely and secure manner. Image compression is the primary process performed on each medical image before it is shared to ensure that the purpose of sharing an image is accomplished. The hybrid region of interest-based medical compression algorithms reduces image size. Furthermore, these algorithms shorten the image compression process time by manipulating the advantages of lossy and lossless compression techniques. A comprehensive review of previous studies that utilized this approach was conducted. Sample studies were selected from published articles in an open database subscribed to by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia for ten years (2012 to 2023). This work aims to critically review and comprehensively analyze previous types of algorithms by focusing on their main performance results: compression ratio, mean square error and peak signal-to-noise ratio. This article will identify which type of algorithm can give optimal value to the primary performance metric for compressing medical images.","[Aziz, Suhaila Ab; Sam, Suriani Mohd; Hassan, Noor Hafizah; Abas, Hafiza; Yusof, Muhammad Fathi; Mohamed, Norliza] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Razak Fac Technol & Informat RFTI, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia; [Rasid, Siti Zaleha Abdul] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Azman Hashim Int Business Sch AHIBS, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Sam, SM (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Razak Fac Technol & Informat RFTI, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia.",surianikl@utm.my,"Abas, Hafiza/AAW-6025-2020; MOHD SAM, SURIANI/NOE-4099-2025; Abdul Rasid, Siti Zaleha/AAP-9283-2020; Yusof, Muhammad Fathi/ABH-6125-2020; Mohamed, Norliza/JNR-2834-2023","Abas, Hafiza/0000-0003-0137-3127; MOHD SAM, SURIANI/0000-0002-2965-2075; Abdul Rasid, Siti Zaleha/0000-0001-7200-6899; Yusof, Muhammad Fathi/0000-0002-0859-7820; Mohamed, Norliza/0000-0001-6159-3469","Ministry of Education, Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; [Q.K130000.3556.05G32]","Ministry of Education, Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia); Universiti Teknologi Malaysia(Universiti Teknologi Malaysia);","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Education, Malaysia, and in part by the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under Grant Q.K130000.3556.05G32",66,0,1,0,11,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11.0,,,,,98025,98038,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3312265,0.0,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,S1JT0,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001068807200001,0

It causes damage to the host plant by feeding on phloem sap as well as transmitting a wide range of devastating plant viruses (especially begomoviruses) that cause severe epidemics on crops. To fend off the menace, modern genomic-based strategies have been adapted to minimize the crop losses due to this destructive pest. Genetic engineering techniques, e.g., transgenics and RNA interference (RNAi) have shown promising results in controlling B. tabaci in plants; however, these techniques often face challenges due to the concerns about GMOs in food crops. With the enhanced knowledge about B. tabaci genomics, new technologies, e.g., manipulation of microbiota or CRISPR-based genome editing have shown promising results in several insect pests and could have an instrumental role in controlling agricultural pests including whitefly. Genome editing is an eco-friendly approach that can be employed to suppress or even destroy the target species. In this review, we have discussed B. tabaci as a pest and advancement in control strategies of B. tabaci. Various potential targets for genome editing have also been discussed that could be used in gene-editing technologies for the efficient management of B. tabaci and the viruses it transmits. Finally, we also outlined the future perspective and effective use of genome editing technology in developing CRISPR-based gene drive for whitefly population modification, suppression, and eradication.","[Mahmood, Muhammad Arslan; Naqvi, Rubab Zahra; Siddiqui, Hamid Anees; Amin, Imran; Mansoor, Shahid] Coll Pakistan Inst Engn & Appl Sci PIEAS, Natl Inst Biotechnol & Genet Engn NIBGE, Agr Biotechnol Div, Jhang Rd, Faisalabad, Pakistan",Pakistan Institute of Engineering & Applied Science,"Mansoor, S (corresponding author), Coll Pakistan Inst Engn & Appl Sci PIEAS, Natl Inst Biotechnol & Genet Engn NIBGE, Agr Biotechnol Div, Jhang Rd, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",shahidmansoor7@gmail.com,"Amin, Imran/MEO-3244-2025; Mahmood, Muhammad Arslan/JEF-1431-2023","Amin, Imran/0000-0003-3063-4103; Siddiqui, Hamid/0000-0002-0913-7340; Mahmood, Muhammad Arslan/0000-0003-1839-9032",,,,117,11,12,3,43,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1612-4758,1612-4766,J PEST SCI,J.

This review investigates the role of biosurfactants, particularly cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) produced by Bacillus spp., in the biological control of plant pathogens in horticulture. A systematic literature search (Scopus and Web of Science, 2020-2025) resulted in 57 studies, complemented by earlier references, and a keyword co-occurrence analysis confirmed the central role of CLPs in biocontrol. From these studies, multiple antifungal mechanisms were identified: iturins bind to sterols in fungal membranes, forming pores that cause ion leakage and cell death; fengycins disrupt membrane integrity, inhibit spore germination, and elicit systemic resistance; and surfactins, though weaker in direct inhibition, act as strong elicitors of plant defense signalling. Quantitative evidence demonstrates significant pathogen suppression: B. siamensis reduced Fusarium oxysporum growth by over 90%; B. velezensis suppressed Verticillium by 92.9%; and lipopeptides lowered potato black rot severity from 55.2% to 26.5%. Beyond antifungal activity, CLPs enhance plant resistance by stimulating defense-related enzymes and improve fruit quality and postharvest shelf life. Overall, Bacillus-derived lipopeptides represent powerful, eco-friendly tools to reduce agrochemical dependence, and mitigate resistance in phytopathogenic fungi. This review synthesises current knowledge on their mechanisms, applications, and production challenges, reinforcing their potential as sustainable alternatives to conventional pesticides and the need for technological advances to overcome existing barriers.","[Bender, Leticia Eduarda; Mulinari, Jessica; Trevizan Chiomento, Jose Luis; Colla, Luciane Maria] Univ Passo Fundo UPF, Sch Agrarian Sci Innovat & Innovat ESAN, Grad Program Agron PPGAgro, BR-99052900 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil",Universidade de Passo Fundo,"Colla, LM (corresponding author), Univ Passo Fundo UPF, Sch Agrarian Sci Innovat & Innovat ESAN, Grad Program Agron PPGAgro, BR-99052900 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil.",lmcolla@upf.br,"Chiomento, José/T-6534-2017; Colla, Luciane Maria/C-9230-2016; Mulinari, Jéssica/AAO-7213-2021","Colla, Luciane Maria/0000-0001-9745-4452; Mulinari, Jéssica/0000-0003-1849-7062; Bender, Leticia Eduarda/0000-0002-7585-8824",Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel; Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES); University of Passo Fundo,Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel; Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); University of Passo Fundo,"The authors are pleased to acknowledge the Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), and the University of Passo Fundo for financial support.",86,0,0,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0958-3157,1360-0478,BIOCONTROL SCI TECHN,Biocontrol Sci.

It, therefore, has been the central attention of the business and public policy sustainable development scheme for several years. Thus, gradually, mining industries are getting involved with the concerns such as carbon emissions mitigation and carbon accounting to govern a rhetorical shift towards sustainable mining. However, there is scarce knowledge about how the emergence of a green and self-sustaining forestry reclamation strategy coupled with potential carbon sequestration capacity in degraded mining areas will be an impeccable option for achieving sustainable development goal-13 (SDG-13: climate action) and ecosystem services during United Nation decade of ecosystem restoration. This paper reviews the extent to which reforestation and sustainable land management practices that employed to enhance ecosystem carbon pool and atmospheric CO2 sequestration capacity to offset CO2 emission and SOC (soil organic carbon) losses, as consequences of coal mining, to partially mitigate global climate crisis. Moreover, future research is required on mining innovation concepts and its challenges for designing an SDG impact framework, so that it not only synergies amongst SDGs, but also trade-offs between each individual politically legitimized post-2015 development agenda (i.e. UNSDGs) could be depicted in a systematic way.

In this context, improving weed management takes on added significance, since weeds are among the primary factors contributing to crop yield losses for smallholder farmers. Adopting remote-sensing-based approaches to facilitate precision agricultural applications such as integrated weed management (IWM) has emerged as a potentially more effective alternative to conventional weed control approaches. However, given their unique socio-economic circumstances, there remains limited knowledge and understanding of how these technological advancements can be best utilized within smallholder farm settings. As such, this study used a systematic scoping review and attribute analysis to analyze 53 peer-reviewed articles from Scopus to gain further insight into remote-sensing-based IWM approaches and identify which are potentially best suited for smallholder farm applications. The findings of this review revealed that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the most frequently utilized remote sensing platform for IWM applications and are also well suited for mapping and monitoring weeds within spatially heterogeneous areas such as smallholder farms. Despite the potential of these technologies for IWM, several obstacles to their operationalization within smallholder farm settings must be overcome, and careful consideration must be given on how best to maximize their potential before investing in these technologies.","[Gokool, Shaeden; Mahomed, Maqsooda; Clulow, Alistair; Kunz, Richard; Naiken, Vivek] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Ctr Water Resources Res, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Clulow, Alistair; Naiken, Vivek] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Discipline Agrometeorol, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Sibanda, Mbulisi] Univ Western Cape, Dept Geog Environm Studies & Tourism, Private Bag X17, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa; [Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Ctr Transformat Agr & Food Syst, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3201 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; [Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Climate Change & Planetary Hlth, London WC1E 7HT, England",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Kwazulu Natal; University of the Western Cape; University of Kwazulu Natal; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Gokool, S (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Ctr Water Resources Res, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",gokools@ukzn.ac.za; mahomedm@ukzn.ac.za; clulowa@ukzn.ac.za; msibanda@uwc.ac.za; kunzr@ukzn.ac.za; naikenv@ukzn.ac.za; mabhaudhi@ukzn.ac.za,"Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe/AAF-2418-2019; Sibanda, Mbulisi/V-6904-2017; gokool, shaeden/GWC-5683-2022; Kunz, Richard/N-6013-2013; Mahomed, Maqsooda/GVU-6816-2022","Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe/0000-0002-9323-8127; Sibanda, Mbulisi/0000-0002-4589-7099; gokool, shaeden/0000-0001-9321-1306; Clulow, Alistair/0000-0001-8803-8780; Kunz, Richard/0000-0001-8372-6218; Mahomed, Maqsooda/0000-0003-1869-2722",Water Research Commission,Water Research Commission,No Statement Available,62,4,5,5,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2504-446X,DRONES-BASEL,Drones-Basel,MAR,2024,8.0,3,,,,,,81,10.3390/drones8030081,0.0,,16,Remote Sensing,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Remote Sensing,MC9X6,,gold,2026-02-03,WOS:001191556500001,0

The study was motivated by the growing body of knowledge regarding global crises such as COVID-19 and climate change, as well as the rise of new research frontiers such as digital agriculture and climate-smart innovations, which all point to a change in scholarly focus. The results show that the environmental science category published the most articles, and a significant growth of articles was seen for food science and technology, agronomy, plant sciences, as well as green and sustainable science and technology. Similarly, we observed a shift of food security research to more integrating technology-based solutions to address food security challenges. The results indicate that implementing digital technologies in conjunction with smart agriculture, developing inclusive food policies, guaranteeing fair trade practices, and strengthening social protection initiatives will contribute to the development of resilient, sustainable, and just food systems. The circular economy's tenets will also help reduce food waste, enhance urban food security, and boost shock resistance in order to attain global food security and sovereignty. Future studies could focus on identifying the main obstacles to digital inclusion in food systems, how ICT solutions can be developed and used to empower underserved communities, and how the circular economy can be effectively implemented to significantly reduce food loss and waste in the food system.","[Ho, Yuh-Shan] Asia Univ, Trend Res Ctr, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lwesya, Francis] Univ Dodoma, Dept Business Adm & Management, Dodoma, Tanzania",Asia University Taiwan,"Lwesya, F (corresponding author), Univ Dodoma, Dept Business Adm & Management, Dodoma, Tanzania.",flwesya@yahoo.com,,"Lwesya, Francis/0000-0002-0415-1215",,,,95,0,0,14,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0968-0802,1099-1719,SUSTAIN DEV,Sustain.

Health technologies have shown promise in reducing disparities among these groups, but there has been no comprehensive evidence synthesis of outcomes.Purpose The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the patient, healthcare, and economic outcomes of health technology applications with rural living equity-deserving groups.Research Design The databases searched included Medline and Embase. Articles were assessed for bias using the McGill mixed methods appraisal tool.Analysis Data were synthesized narratively using a convergent integrated approach for qualitative and quantitative findings.Results This evidence synthesis includes papers (n = 21) that reported on health technologies targeting rural equity-deserving groups. Overall, patient outcomes - knowledge, self-efficacy, weight loss, and clinical indicators - improved. Healthcare access improved with greater convenience, flexibility, time and travel savings, though travel was still occasionally necessary. All studies reported satisfaction with health technologies. Technology challenges reported related to connectivity and infrastructure issues influencing appointment quality and modality options. While some studies reported additional costs, overall, studies indicated cost savings for patients.Conclusions There is a paucity of research on health technologies targeting rural equity-deserving groups, and the available research has primarily focused on women. While current evidence was primarily of high quality, research is needed inclusive of equity-deserving groups and interventions co-designed with users that integrate culturally sensitive approaches.

Unlike conventional MD, IH-MD heats locally between the hydrophobic membrane and saline water to enhance the vapor flux and minimize heat loss. However, a unified understanding of the performance of various IH-MD systems remains lacking. Stability challenges such as membrane wetting, scaling, fouling, and corrosion caused by the introduction of heating materials pose significant obstacles to industrial application. This review critically examined recent advances in interfacial heating methods, including photothermal, Joule, conduction, and induction heating. Photothermal approaches offer sustainability and improved energy efficiency but are limited by sunlight exposure and adsorption, while electrothermal methods provide stable interfacial heating flux at the cost of higher energy use and potential material degradation. Strategies to enhance energy performance and durability are discussed in detail, such as combining multiple heating methods, refining module and configuration designs, optimizing membrane properties, and adjusting operating conditions. We also assessed the economic viability of IH-MD for industrial applications. While IH-MD faces challenges related to material durability, system complexity, and scale-up, its ability to eliminate thermal polarization, reduce energy consumption, and enable integration with renewable energy sources positions it as a transformative approach for future sustainable desalination and water purification technologies. This review aims to bridge the knowledge gaps between scientific innovation and real-world applications of various IH-MD technologies.","[Hu, Jiahui; Zhu, Guangyu; Zhang, Wen] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Ronen, Avner] Bengurion Univ Negev, Zuckerberg Inst Water Res, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Dept Desalinat & Water Treatment, IL-84990 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Jassby, David] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Li, Qilin] Rice Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Wang, Peng; Wang, Wenbin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 519080, Guangdong, Peoples R China",New Jersey Institute of Technology; Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Rice University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Zhang, W (corresponding author), New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",wen.zhang@njit.edu,"Hu, Jiahui/NKO-9102-2025; Ronen, Avner/HIZ-5726-2022; Wang, Peng/ONJ-9591-2025; Li, Qilin/A-8970-2008","Hu, Jiahui/0009-0000-4657-7612; wang, wenbin/0000-0002-0541-6609; Ronen, Avner/0000-0002-7134-6848; Zhang, Wen/0000-0001-8413-0598; Wang, Peng/0000-0003-0856-0865; Li, Qilin/0000-0001-5756-3873",Bureau of Reclamation [R22AC00433]; U.S. Bureau of Reclamation,Bureau of Reclamation; U.S. Bureau of Reclamation,The authors are grateful for funding support from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Award R22AC00433).,139,10,10,45,74,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

Urbanization strongly affects ecological processes, often deleteriously, because it is associated with a decrease in green spaces (areas of land covered by vegetation), loss of natural habitats, increased rates of species extinction, a greater prevalence of invasive and exotic species, and anthropogenic pollutant accumulation. In urban environments, green spaces play a key role by providing many ecological benefits and contributing to human psychophysical well-being. It is known that interactions between plants and microorganisms that occur in the rhizosphere are of paramount importance for plant health, soil fertility, and the correct functioning of plant ecosystems. The growing diffusion of DNA sequencing technologies and omics analyses has provided increasing information about the composition, structure, and function of the rhizomicrobiota. However, despite the considerable amount of data on rhizosphere communities and their interactions with plants in natural/rural contexts, current knowledge on microbial communities associated with plant roots in urban soils is still very scarce. The present review discusses both plant-microbe dynamics and factors that drive the composition of the rhizomicrobiota in poorly investigated urban settings and the potential use of beneficial microbes as an innovative biological tool to face the challenges that anthropized environments and climate change impose. Unravelling urban biodiversity will contribute to green space management, preservation, and development and, ultimately, to public health and safety.","[Monaco, Pamela; Baldoni, Apollonia; Naclerio, Gino; Scippa, Gabriella Stefania; Bucci, Antonio] Univ Molise, Dept Biosci & Terr, I-86090 Pesche, Italy",University of Molise,"Monaco, P; Bucci, A (corresponding author), Univ Molise, Dept Biosci & Terr, I-86090 Pesche, Italy.",pamela.monaco@unimol.it; apollonia.baldoni@unimol.it; naclerio@unimol.it; scippa@unimol.it; antonio.bucci@unimol.it,"Naclerio, Gino/A-5692-2008; SCIPPA, GABRIELLA/F-6007-2012; Bucci, Antonio/AAV-3771-2020","Bucci, Antonio/0000-0002-9596-3058","National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) of Italian Ministry of University and Research - European Union-NextGenerationEU [3138, 3175]; Italian Ministry of University and Research [CN_00000033, 1034, CUP:H73C22000300001]; National Biodiversity Future Center under the NRRP [CN_00000033, CUP: H73C22000300001]","National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) of Italian Ministry of University and Research - European Union-NextGenerationEU; Italian Ministry of University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); National Biodiversity Future Center under the NRRP","Funder: Project funded under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), Mission4 Component 2 Investment 1.4-Call for tender No. 3138 of 16 December 2021, rectified by Decree n.3175 of 18 December 2021 of Italian Ministry of University and Research funded by the European Union-NextGenerationEU.

POCD symptoms include memory loss, focus inattention, and communication difficulties. Inflammasomes, intracellular multiprotein complexes that control inflammation, may have a significant role in the development of POCD. It has been postulated that the NLRP3 inflammasome promotes cognitive impairment by triggering the inflammatory response in the brain. Nevertheless, there are many gaps in the current literature to understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and develop future therapy. This review article underlines the limits of our current knowledge about the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome and POCD. We first discuss inflammasomes and their types, structures, and functions, then summarize recent evidence of the NLRP3 inflammasome's involvement in POCD. Next, we propose a hypothesis that suggests the involvement of inflammasomes in multiple organs, including local surgical sites, blood circulation, and other peripheral organs, leading to systemic inflammation and subsequent neuronal dysfunction in the brain, resulting in POCD. Research directions are then discussed, including analyses of inflammasomes in more clinical POCD animal models and clinical trials, studies of inflammasome types that are involved in POCD, and investigations into whether inflammasomes occur at the surgical site, in circulating blood, and in peripheral organs. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits of using new technologies and approaches to study inflammasomes in POCD. A thorough investigation of inflammasomes in POCD might substantially affect clinical practice.","[Zhang, Siyu; Sun, Jintao; Li, Yang; Zhou, Hongmei] Zhejiang Chinese Med Univ, Anesthesiol Dept, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Siyu; Sun, Jintao; Li, Yang; Lu, Jian; Hu, Li; Zhao, Heng; Zhou, Hongmei] Jiaxing Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Hosp Jiaxing 2, Anesthesiol Dept,Jiaxing Key Lab Basic Res & Clin, Jiaxing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Cuiying] Capital Med Univ, Sch Nursing, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Cuiying; Zhao, Heng] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Inst Brain Disorders, Joint Innovat Ctr Brain Disorders, Minist Sci & Technol,Lab Brain Disorders, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Xiaoxing] Wuhan Univ, Renmin Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Chinese Medical University; Jiaxing University; Capital Medical University; Capital Medical University; Wuhan University,"Zhou, HM (corresponding author), Jiaxing Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Hosp Jiaxing 2, Jiaxing, Peoples R China.;Zhao, H (corresponding author), Beijing Capital Med Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",heng.zhao10@gmail.com; drhongmeizhou@163.com,,,Jiaxing Science and Technology Planned Project [2019AY32016]; Medical and health science and Technology project of Zhejiang Province [2020KY318],Jiaxing Science and Technology Planned Project; Medical and health science and Technology project of Zhejiang Province,"This work was supported by Jiaxing Science and Technology Planned Project (2019AY32016), Medical and health science and Technology project of Zhejiang Province (2020KY318)",181,11,14,0,21,INT SOC AGING & DISEASE,FORT WORTH,"EDITORIAL OFF, 3400 CAMP BOWIE BLVD, FORT WORTH, TX 76106 USA",2152-5250,,AGING DIS,Aging Dis.,NOV 27,2023,14.0,6,,,,1981,2002,,10.14336/AD.2023.0501,0.0,MAY 2023,22,Geriatrics & Gerontology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geriatrics & Gerontology,GO1Y8,37450925.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:000993971700001,0

The transition from traditional reactive medicine to personalized medicine is based on a biomarker-driven process and a deep knowledge of biological mechanisms according to which the development of diseases occurs. In this context, the advancements in high-throughput omics technologies represent a unique opportunity to discover novel biomarkers and to provide an unbiased picture of the biological system. One of the medical fields in which omics science has started to be recently applied is that of ophthalmology. Ocular diseases are very common, and some of them could be highly disabling, thus leading to vision loss and blindness. The pathogenic mechanism of most ocular diseases may be dependent on various genetic and environmental factors, whose effect has not been yet completely understood. In this context, large-scale omics approaches are fundamental to have a comprehensive evaluation of the whole system and represent an essential tool for the development of novel therapies. This Review summarizes the recent advancements in omics science applied to ophthalmology in the last ten years, in particular by focusing on proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics applications from an analytical perspective.

However, inevitable quality deterioration can occur during freezing, frozen storage, and thawing. This review explores the eating quality deterioration characteristics (color, water holding capacity, tenderness, and flavor) and mechanisms (irregular ice crystals, oxidation, and hydrolysis of lipids and proteins) of frozen muscle foods. It also summarizes and classifies the novel physical-field-assisted-freezing technologies (high-pressure, ultrasound, and electromagnetic) and bioactive antifreeze (ice nucleation proteins, antifreeze proteins, natural deep eutectic solvents, carbohydrate, polyphenol, phosphate, and protein hydrolysates), regulating the dynamic process from water to ice. Moreover, some novel thermal and nonthermal thawing technologies to resolve the loss of water and nutrients caused by traditional thawing methods were also reviewed. We concluded that the physical damage caused by ice crystals was the primary reason for the deterioration in eating quality, and these novel techniques promoted the eating quality of frozen muscle foods under proper conditions, including appropriate parameters (power, time, and intermittent mode mentioned in ultrasound-assisted techniques; pressure involved in high-pressure-assisted techniques; and field strength involved in electromagnetic-assisted techniques) and the amounts of bioactive antifreeze.

Components that are encapsulated are usually sensitive to light, pH, oxygen or highly volatile. Also, encapsulation is also applied for ingredients that might influence taste. Many polymers from natural sources have been tested for encapsulation of foods. In the past few years, pectins have been proposed as emerging broadly applicable encapsulation materials. The reasons are that pectins are versatile and inexpensive, can be tailored to meet specific demands and provide health benefits. Emerging new insight into the chemical structure and related health benefits of pectins opens new avenues to use pectins in food and feed. To provide insight into their application potential, we review the current knowledge on the structural features of different pectins, their production and tailoring process for use in microencapsulation and gelation, and the impact of the pectin structure on health benefits and release properties in the gut, as well as processing technologies for pectin-based encapsulation systems with tailor-made functionalities. This is reviewed in view of application of pectins for microencapsulation of different sensitive food components. Although some critical factors such as tuning of controlled release of cargo in the intestine and the impact of the pectin production process on the molecular structure of pectin still need more study, current insight is that pectins provide many advantages for encapsulation of bioactive food and feed ingredients and are cost-effective.","[Morales-Medina, Rocio; Drusch, Stephan] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Food Technol & Food Chem, Dept Food Technol & Food Mat Sci, Konigin Luise Str 22, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Acevedo, Francisca] Univ La Frontera, Fac Med, Dept Basic Sci, Temuco, Chile; [Acevedo, Francisca; Castro-Alvarez, Alejandro] Univ La Frontera, Fac Med & Sci & Technol Bioresource Nucleus BIORE, Ctr Excellence Translat Med CEMT, Casilla 54-D, Temuco, Chile; [Castro-Alvarez, Alejandro] Univ La Frontera, Fac Med, Dept Preclin Sci, Casilla 54-D, Temuco, Chile; [Benie, Astrid] CP Kelco ApS, VedBanen 16, DK-4623 Lille Skensved, Denmark; [Poncelet, Denis] ENCAPPROCESS, 114 Allee Paul Signac, F-44240 Suce Sur Erdre, France; [Dragosavac, Marijana M.] Loughborough Univ, Chem Engn, Leicester, Leics, England; [Defain Tesoriero, Maria Victoria; Lowenstein, Patricia; Yonaha, Veronica; Iturralde, Ramiro; Peter, Regina Gauna] Natl Inst Ind Technol INTI, Dept New Formulat Technol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [de Vos, Paul] Univ Groningen, Dept Pathol & Med Biol, Div Med Biol, Immunoendocrinol, Hanzepl 1, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands; [de Vos, Paul] Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Hanzepl 1, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands",Technical University of Berlin; Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad de La Frontera; Loughborough University; Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Industrial (INTI); University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Morales-Medina, R (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Food Technol & Food Chem, Dept Food Technol & Food Mat Sci, Konigin Luise Str 22, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",morales-medina@tu-berlin.de,"; de vos, paul/A-3170-2013; Morales-Medina, Rocio/N-1326-2015; Castro-Alvarez, Alejano/HSH-9849-2023","Benie, Astrid/0009-0006-1171-7164; Acevedo, Francisca/0000-0002-7060-0656; usch, Stephan/0000-0001-8777-7514; de vos, paul/0000-0001-9618-2408; Morales-Medina, Rocio/0000-0002-7297-7940; Castro-Alvarez, Alejano/0000-0001-8360-8027",European Union [872019]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [872019] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA),European Union(European Union (EU)); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skodowska-Curie grant agreement No 872019.,116,31,32,11,95,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2042-6496,2042-650X,FOOD FUNCT,Food Funct.,OCT 31,2022,13.0,21,,,,10870,10881,,10.1039/d2fo00350c,0.0,SEP 2022,12,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Food Science & Technology,5V3HY,36239179.0,"Green Published, hybrid",2026-02-03,WOS:000867797800001,0

It results in significant morbidity for patients, can upstage disease and will frequently result in more prolonged treatment courses. This pictorial review provides a thorough examination of the imaging characteristics of perineural tumour spread in head and neck malignancy. It highlights key imaging features, from initial diagnosis to its post-therapy appearance, emphasising the clinical relevance and role of imaging in post-therapy assessment. Multi-modality imaging examples are included with a focus on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron-emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). MRI features of perineural tumour spread include intermediate T2 signal expansion of a nerve, abnormal enhancement extending along a nerve, expansion of a skull or neural foramen and loss of normal fat planes surrounding nerve pathways. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT is a useful adjunct to MRI, perineural tumour spread results in abnormal FDG accumulation in a linear fashion anatomically spreading along a nerve pathway. Knowledge of these features and useful check areas will ensure that radiologists can be confident both in making the diagnosis and re-assessment post-therapy.

Barriers in using ICT might for example relate to health issues, sensory loss, lack of technical skills, or reluctance to use technologies. Though knowledge on these barriers is crucial for the development and implementation of ICT for older adults, no systematic review was found on this subject. The proposed qualitative systematic review aims to explore barriers experienced by older adults aging in place in using ICT for social interaction.MethodsThe review will be conducted in accordance with the JBI methodology. Databases for search will include MEDLINE (via PubMed), CINAHL (via EBSCO), and Web of Science (ISI), among others. Included studies focus on older adults ageing in place 60 years or older. Pairs of authors will independently, by following agreed guidelines, assess the eligibility of studies, and extract data. The testing of eligibility criteria and screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts will be performed. The findings will describe for example populations, context, culture, and the phenomena of interest. Qualitative research findings will, where possible, be pooled by using JBI SUMARI for the meta-aggregation approach.DiscussionThe mapping of published studies has the potential to identify research gaps in the existing literature, which again may inform developers and stakeholders in designing more user-friendly and adaptive ICT solutions for older people ageing in place.Systematic review registrationCRD42022370044.","[Joranson, Nina] VID Specialized Univ, Fac Hlth Studies, POB 184, N-0319 Oslo, Norway; [Zechner, Minna] Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, POB 54,Unioninkatu 37, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Yaylagul, Nilufer Korkmaz] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Gerontol Dept, Dumlupinar Blvd, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkiye; [Efthymiou, Areti] Hellen Mediterranean Univ, Dept Social Work, Qual Life Lab, Estavromenos Heraklion 71410, Crete, Greece; [Silva, Rosa] Nursing Sch Porto, Ctr Hlth Technol & Serv Res CINTESIS, P-4200072 Porto, Portugal; [Silva, Rosa] Portugal Ctr Evidence Based Practice, P-3000232 Coimbra, Portugal",VID Specialised University; University of Helsinki; Akdeniz University; Hellenic Mediterranean University; Nursing School of Coimbra,"Joranson, N (corresponding author), VID Specialized Univ, Fac Hlth Studies, POB 184, N-0319 Oslo, Norway.",nina.joranson@vid.no,"Efthymiou, Areti/AAP-6981-2020; Silva, Rosa/AAC-5368-2019; Zechner, Minna/AAD-1010-2019","Efthymiou, Areti/0000-0001-8838-1669; Silva, Rosa/0000-0002-3947-7098; Zechner, Minna/0000-0002-0784-4519; Korkmaz Yaylagul, Nilufer/0000-0001-9918-7968","This article is based upon the work of COST Action 19136 International Interdisciplinary Network on Smart Healthy Age-friendly Environments, supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology).

To date, primarily recommended disinfection practices are energy exhausting, chemical driven, and cause severe impact on the environment. The research on advanced oxidation processes has been recognized as promising strategies for disinfection purposes. In particular, semiconductor-based photo catalysis is an effective renewable solar-driven technology that relies on the reactive oxidative species, mainly hydroxyl (center dot OH) and superoxide (center dot O-2(-)) radicals, for rupturing the capsid shell of the virus and loss of pathogenicity. However, the limited understanding of critical aspects such as viral photo-inactivation mechanism, rapid virus mutagenicity, and virus viability for a prolonged time restricts the large-scale application of photocatalytic disinfection technology. In this work, fundamentals of photocatalysis disinfection phenomena are addressed with a reviewed remark on the reported literature of semiconductor photocatalysts efficacies against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, to validate the photocatalysis process on an industrial scale, we provide updated data on available commercial modalities for an effective virus photo-inactivation process. An elaborative discussion on the long-term challenges and sustainable solutions is suggested to fill in the existing knowledge gaps. We anticipate this review will ignite interest among researchers to pave the way to the photocatalysis process for disinfecting virus-contaminated environments and surfaces for current and future pandemics.","[Kumar, Abhinandan; Hasija, Vasudha; Sudhaik, Anita; Raizada, Pankaj; Van-Huy Nguyen; Singh, Pardeep] Shoolini Univ, Sch Adv Chem Sci, Solan 173212, Himachal Prades, India; [Quyet Van Le] Korea Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Nguyen, D.

Most emergency responders do not have first-hand experience with major natural disasters, and thus, there is an urgent need for pre-disaster training. Due to the scenes unreality of traditional emergency drills, the failure to appeal to the target audience and the novel coronavirus pandemic, people are forced to maintain safe social distancing. Therefore, it is difficult to carry out transregional or transnational emergency drills in many countries under the lockdown. There is an increasing demand for simulation training systems that use virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality visualization technologies to simulate major natural disasters. The simulation training system related to natural disasters provides a new way for popular emergency avoidance science education and emergency rescue personnel to master work responsibilities and improve emergency response capabilities. However, to our knowledge, there is no overview of the simulation training system for major natural disasters. Hence, this paper uncovers the visualization techniques commonly used in simulation training systems, and compares, analyses and summarizes the architecture and functions of the existing simulation training systems for different emergency phases of common natural disasters. In addition, the limitations of the existing simulation training system in practical applications and future development directions are discussed to provide reference for relevant researchers to better understand the modern simulation training system.","[Li, Ning; Sun, Na; Cao, Chunxia; Hou, Shike; Gong, Yanhua] Tianjin Univ, Inst Disaster & Emergency Med, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Li, Ning; Sun, Na; Cao, Chunxia; Hou, Shike; Gong, Yanhua] Tianjin Univ, Wenzhou Safety Emergency Inst, Wenzhou 325000, Peoples R China; [Li, Ning; Sun, Na; Cao, Chunxia; Hou, Shike; Gong, Yanhua] Tianjin Key Lab Disaster Med Technol, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Tianjin University,"Hou, SK; Gong, YH (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Inst Disaster & Emergency Med, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.;Hou, SK; Gong, YH (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Wenzhou Safety Emergency Inst, Wenzhou 325000, Peoples R China.;Hou, SK; Gong, YH (corresponding author), Tianjin Key Lab Disaster Med Technol, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",houshike@tju.edu.cn; gongyanhua@tju.edu.cn,"Cao, Chunxia/MFI-2414-2025; Li, Ning/JAX-6759-2023","Cao, Chunxia/0000-0003-4857-425X; Gong, Yanhua/0000-0002-2693-0498; Li, Ning/0000-0002-9789-1633",Ministry of Science and Technology of China (National Key Research and Development Program of China) [2019YFC1606304]; Scientific Research Translational Foundation of Wenzhou Safety (Emergency) Institute of Tianjin University [TJUWYY2022021],Ministry of Science and Technology of China (National Key Research and Development Program of China)(National Key Research & Development Program of China); Scientific Research Translational Foundation of Wenzhou Safety (Emergency) Institute of Tianjin University,"This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (National Key Research and Development Program of China, 2019YFC1606304), and the Scientific Research Translational Foundation of Wenzhou Safety (Emergency) Institute of Tianjin University (TJUWYY2022021).",155,35,47,9,135,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

The loss of sensation that typically occurs after mastectomy can have significant negative psychological, sexual, and functional impact on patients after surgery. In order to minimize this impact, more recent attention has been paid to ways to both avoid nerve injury at the time of mastectomy and reconstruct injured nerves either during mastectomy or at the time of delayed reconstruction. These advances have been facilitated by anatomic studies investigating different variants of intercostal anatomy and better understanding the course of the nerves innervating the mastectomy skin and nipple-areolar complex. With improved knowledge of the intercostal nerve anatomy, surgeons are able to carefully preserve nerves at the time of mastectomy, thus improving sensory outcomes. Additionally, nerve reconstruction techniques have advanced, particularly with newer nerve allograft technologies, which allows for nerve reconstruction to be done both at the time of mastectomy, as well as in a delayed fashion. Much of the current literature on intercostal nerve reconstruction to improve postmastectomy sensation has been performed in the setting of autologous reconstruction, but several more recent studies have assessed outcomes following implant -based reconstruction. The focus of this article is to describe the current state of sensory preservation and reinnervation for mastectomy with implant -based reconstruction and the advances that have allowed for these new approaches.","[Peled, Anne Warren] Sutter Hlth Calif Pacific Med Ctr, San Francisco, CA USA; [Peled, Ziv M.] Peled Plast Surg, San Francisco, CA USA; [Peled, Anne Warren] 2100 Webster St,Suite 318, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA",California Pacific Medical Center,"Peled, AW (corresponding author), 2100 Webster St,Suite 318, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA.",drpeled@apeledmd.com,,,,,,37,4,4,0,0,AME PUBLISHING COMPANY,SHATIN,"FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,2616-2776,ANN BREAST SURG,Ann.

Therefore, explorations of pest-specific, eco-friendly and easy-to-adopt technologies for hemipteran pest control are urgently needed. To the best of our knowledge, microRNAs (miRNAs), which are endogenous non-coding small RNAs approximately 22 nucleotides in length, are involved in regulating gene expression via the direct recognition and binding of the 3 '-untranslated region (3 '-UTR) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or by acting as a center of a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network at the post-transcriptional level. This review systematically outlines the characterization and functional investigation of the miRNA biogenesis pathway in hemipteran pests, such as whiteflies, true bugs, aphids and planthoppers. In addition, we explored the results of small RNA sequencing and functional observations of miRNAs in these pests, and the results suggest that the numerous miRNAs obtained and annotated via high-throughput sequencing technology and bioinformatic analyses contribute to molting development, fitness, wing polyphenism, symbiont interactions and insecticide resistance in hemipteran pests. Finally, we summarize current advances and propose a framework for future research to extend the current data and address potential limitations in the investigation and application of hemipteran miRNAs.","[Ren, Yipeng; Chen, Juhong; Xue, Huaijun; Bu, Wenjun] Nankai Univ, Inst Entomol, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Dong, Wenhao] Tianjin Univ Commerce, Sch Biotechnol & Food Sci, Tianjin Key Lab Food & Biotechnol, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Tianjin University of Commerce,"Xue, HJ; Bu, WJ (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Inst Entomol, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",xuehj@nankai.edu.cn; wenjunbu@nankai.edu.cn,"Xue, Huai-Jun/G-8541-2011; Dong, Wenhao/B-7515-2019","Xue, Huai-Jun/0000-0002-7714-7532; Ren, Yipeng/0000-0001-8890-022X",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The authors would like to thank all laboratory members for their technical advice and helpful discussions.

However, there are still many controversies in this aspect, and there are no clear conclusions on the effectiveness and safety of three-dimensional vascular reconstruction combined with three-dimensional navigation in laparoscopic hepatectomy. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically review the results of previous studies with meta method in this study to determine their clinical efficacy and complications and guide clinical treatment. Methods: We used the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals Full-Text Database (VIP), and Wanfang database to conduct an online search for data from randomized controlled trials of preoperative 3D reconstruction versus conventional CT in hepatectomy published up to October 2021. Relevant literature was selected based on the inclusion criteria, data was extracted, and quality evaluation of the included literature was carried out. I-2 test was used to evaluate heterogeneity among the studies, and Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 was used to evaluate the studies. Results: A total of 16 studies were included in this study. Meta-analysis showed that there were statistically significant differences between the 3D vascular reconstruction group and conventional surgery group in operation time [mean differences (MD) =-40.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): -74.94, -5.26, P=0.02, I-2=78%, Z=2.26] and intraoperative blood loss (MD =-50.40, 95% CI: -62.93, -37.86, P<0.00001, I-2=9%, Z=7.88), but no statistically significant difference was found in total days in hospital (MD =-0.39, 95% CI: -1.81, 1.03, P=0.59, I-2=76%, Z=0.54), and postoperative complications rate (OR =0.98, 95% CI: 0.64, 1.50, P=0.91, I-2=0%, Z=0.11). Discussion: Preoperative 3D reconstruction plays an important role in preoperative evaluation and surgical planning, which improves the operation time of PHC and reduces the intraoperative blood loss, but no effect to length of stay in hospital or complication rate comparing to conventional 2D techniques.","[Jiang, Jihua; Jiang, Renya] Wenzhou Med Univ, Quzhou Peoples Hosp, Quzhou Affiliated Hosp, Dept Hepatobiliary Surg, 100 Minjiang Dadao, Quzhou 324000, Peoples R China; [Pei, Lei] Wenzhou Med Univ, Quzhou Peoples Hosp, Quzhou Affiliated Hosp, Dept Radiol, Quzhou, Peoples R China",Wenzhou Medical University; Wenzhou Medical University,"Jiang, RY (corresponding author), Wenzhou Med Univ, Quzhou Peoples Hosp, Quzhou Affiliated Hosp, Dept Hepatobiliary Surg, 100 Minjiang Dadao, Quzhou 324000, Peoples R China.",jiangrenya2021@163.com,,,Quzhou City Science and Technology Plan Guiding Project [2019065],Quzhou City Science and Technology Plan Guiding Project,This work was funded by the Quzhou City Science and Technology Plan Guiding Project (No. 2019065).,27,19,26,0,9,AME PUBLISHING COMPANY,SHATIN,"FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",2078-6891,2219-679X,J GASTROINTEST ONCOL,J.

However, a significant portion of the food produced for human consumption is wasted annually on a global scale. Reducing harvest and postharvest food waste, waste during food processing, as well as food waste at the consumer level, have been key objectives of improving and maintaining sustainability. These issues can range from damage during processing, handling, and transport, to the use of inappropriate or outdated systems, and storage and packaging-related issues. Microbial growth and (cross)contamination during harvest, processing, and packaging, which causes spoilage and safety issues in both fresh and packaged foods, is an overarching issue contributing to food waste. Microbial causes of food spoilage are typically bacterial or fungal in nature and can impact fresh, processed, and packaged foods. Moreover, spoilage can be influenced by the intrinsic factors of the food (water activity, pH), initial load of the microorganism and its interaction with the surrounding microflora, and external factors such as temperature abuse and food acidity, among others. Considering this multifaceted nature of the food system and the factors driving microbial spoilage, there is an immediate need for the use of novel approaches to predict and potentially prevent the occurrence of such spoilage to minimize food waste at the harvest, post-harvest, processing, and consumer levels. Quantitative microbial spoilage risk assessment (QMSRA) is a predictive framework that analyzes information on microbial behavior under the various conditions encountered within the food ecosystem, while employing a probabilistic approach to account for uncertainty and variability. Widespread adoption of the QMSRA approach could help in predicting and preventing the occurrence of spoilage along the food chain. Alternatively, the use of advanced packaging technologies would serve as a direct prevention strategy, potentially minimizing (cross)contamination and assuring the safe handling of foods, in order to reduce food waste at the post-harvest and retail stages. Finally, increasing transparency and consumer knowledge regarding food date labels, which typically are indicators of food quality rather than food safety, could also contribute to reduced food waste at the consumer level. The objective of this review is to highlight the impact of microbial spoilage and (cross)contamination events on food loss and waste. The review also discusses some novel methods to mitigate food spoilage and food loss and waste, and ensure the quality and safety of our food supply.","[Karanth, Shraddha; Feng, Shuyi; Pradhan, Abani K.] Univ Maryland, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Patra, Debasmita] Univ Maryland Extens, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, College Pk, MD USA; [Pradhan, Abani K.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Food Safety & Secur Syst, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Pradhan, AK (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;Pradhan, AK (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Ctr Food Safety & Secur Syst, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",akp@umd.edu,,"Karanth, Shraddha/0000-0002-6970-8539",,,,141,186,216,31,216,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

However, there are still obvious shortcomings in coping with large grain losses. Therefore, quantitative analysis of the research hotspots and evolutionary trends of grain storage technology is important to help the development of grain storage technology. This article uses the Web of Science database from 2007 to 2022 as a data sample with the help of CiteSpace software to analyze the basic situation, research hotspots, and evolutionary trends to draw a series of relevant knowledge maps. Visual analysis revealed that the number of publications had grown rapidly since 2015. First, the Journal of Stored Products Research, Journal of Economic Entomology, and Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, with citation frequencies of 929, 536, and 453, should be focused on in order to keep up with the latest research developments in this field. The United States, China, and Brazil occupy dominant positions in relation to grain storage technology studies in general. Purdue University, Kansas State University, and Agricultural Research Institute ranked the top three in terms of the number and centrality of publications. In terms of research hotspots, the centrality of temperature, insects, carbon dioxide, and quality were 0.16, 0.09, 0.08, and 0.08. It shows that the field of grain storage technology in recent years has focused on grain storage temperature, pest control, and grain storage quality research. From the perspective of the evolution trend, the life cycle of emergent words lasts for several years, after which the strength of emergent words slowly decreases and is replaced by new emergent words. Mortality was the first keyword to appear and remained from 2007 to 2011, indicating that research on fumigants and their toxicity, as well as pest mortality under air fumigation and chemical fumigation conditions, became more popular during this period. In recent years, new terms have emerged that had never been used before, such as grain quality (2019-2022) and stability (2020-2022). We can find that people pursue food quality more with the improvement of people's living standards. In this context, future research should seek more efficient, safe, economical, and environmentally friendly methods of grain storage and continuously improve the level of scientific grain storage.","[Chen, Guixiang; Hou, Jia; Liu, Chaosai] Henan Univ Technol, Coll Civil Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guixiang] Henan Key Lab Grain Storage Facil & Safety, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guixiang] Henan Int Joint Lab Modern Green Ecol Storage Syst, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China",Henan University of Technology,"Chen, GX (corresponding author), Henan Univ Technol, Coll Civil Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.;Chen, GX (corresponding author), Henan Key Lab Grain Storage Facil & Safety, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.;Chen, GX (corresponding author), Henan Int Joint Lab Modern Green Ecol Storage Syst, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.",cgx@haut.edu.cn,"Hou, Jia/ACY-0987-2022","Hou, Jia/0000-0002-8038-335X; Liu, Chaosai/0000-0001-8559-6760",National Grain Public Welfare Research Project of China; Innovative Funds Plan of Henan University of Technology; [201513001-01]; [2020ZKCJ05],National Grain Public Welfare Research Project of China; Innovative Funds Plan of Henan University of Technology; ;,This research was funded by the National Grain Public Welfare Research Project of China (Grant Nos. 201513001-01) and the Innovative Funds Plan of Henan University of Technology (Grant Nos. 2020ZKCJ05).,72,11,14,7,107,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2304-8158,FOODS,Foods,DEC,2022,11.0,23,,,,,,3836,10.3390/foods11233836,0.0,,19,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food Science & Technology,6X6SA,36496644.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:000896540100001,0

This review explores the burgeoning field of stimuli-responsive materials, proposing protein-based films as a premier platform for developing next-generation active and intelligent packaging systems. Proteins offer an unparalleled combination of biocompatibility, biodegradability, and functional versatility, making them ideal building blocks for materials that can dynamically interact with their environment. We critically examine a diverse array of fabrication strategies, including layer-by-layer assembly, directed self-assembly, electro-responsive fabrication, and composite material design, highlighting a central fabrication-function-safety trilemma that must be navigated for successful translation to food applications. A comprehensive analysis of stimulus-response modalities is presented, categorizing triggers as either intrinsic (pH, enzymes, redox state) or extrinsic (temperature, light, electrical/magnetic fields, water). By synthesizing findings from disparate fields such as biomedicine, soft robotics, and neuroscience, we propose novel biomimetic design paradigms. Specifically, we suggest modeling protective coatings on the human tear film a complex, multicomponent system for surface protection and developing neuro-inspired sensor arrays that integrate multiple spoilage signals using embedded logic, analogous to biological neural processing. The functional outputs of these smart systems are detailed, focusing on controlled antimicrobial release, modulation of senescence pathways, and intelligent freshness monitoring. This suggestive review concludes by outlining critical knowledge gaps and proposing future research trajectories aimed at creating scalable, food-safe, and highly effective protein-based films, positioning them as a cornerstone technology for reducing food waste and enhancing global food security.","[Qutub, Mohammad; Tatode, Amol; Premchandani, Tanvi; Taksande, Jayshree; Chelpelwar, Vaishnavi B.; Umekar, Milind] Smt Kishoritai Bhoyar Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India; [Sheikh, Sohail S.] SVKMs Dr Bhanuben Nanavati Coll Pharm, Dept Qual Assurance, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Nalkande, Sakshi] Smt Kishoritai Bhoyar Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmacol, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India; [Hussain, Ujban] Rashtrasant Tukdoji Maharaj Nagpur Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India; [Khan, Rahmuddin] Jamia Hamdard, Sch Pharmaceut Educ & Res SPER, Dept Pharmaceut, New Delhi, India",Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University; Jamia Hamdard University,"Tatode, A (corresponding author), Smt Kishoritai Bhoyar Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.",qutubmalikqm@gmail.com; aatatode@gmail.com; tanvipremchandani10@gmail.com; jayabtaksande@gmail.com,"UMEKAR, MILIND/ABI-6283-2020; Tatode, Dr. Amol A./OML-6027-2025","Khan, Rameen/0009-0007-6451-0076; Sheikh, Sohail/0009-0005-0328-7224",,,,311,0,0,9,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0141-8130,1879-0003,INT J BIOL MACROMOL,Int.

Synthesizing the contributions of climate governmentality studies since 2015, we provide a critical assessment of the technologies of government and the resulting visibilities and identities in the context of the Paris Agreement. Our reading of the current cli-mentality reveals a much higher continuity from the Kyoto era to the Paris era than generally assumed by dominant IR approaches. The cli-mentality of the Paris era radicalizes the neoliberal approach of the Kyoto era while extending its reach into more policy sectors. The responsibilisation of states, sub-state actors and individuals obscures root causes of the climate crisis and reproduces key elements of the socio-economic and political order. The dominant problematisation of climate change in both academia and policymaking narrows down the solution space for climate politics and forecloses transformative approaches. Climate mitigation mobilizes neoliberal self-governance through nationally-determined contributions while obscuring unequal historical responsibilities. Adaptation is organized in depoliticized processes of preparing for presumably inevitable climate futures. This is reinforced by climate finance which employs financialisation and de-risking to mobilize additional private capital. Climate-related loss and damage funding is rendered as charity, foreclosing liability and reparation claims. Future research should examine (1) how the dominant cli-mentality is resisted and challenged by social movements and climate litigation, (2) if and how it is stabilized through the global economic order and its regulations, and (3) which globally varying effects the cli-mentality has.","[Steig, Florian] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Oels, Angela] Univ Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany",University of Oxford; University of Augsburg,"Steig, F (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",florian.steig@gtc.ox.ac.uk,"Steig, Florian/MAH-4746-2025","Steig, Florian/0009-0009-5134-9425",,,,194,5,7,8,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1757-7780,1757-7799,WIRES CLIM CHANGE,Wiley Interdiscip.

This systematic review synthesizes evidence from 47 peer-reviewed studies across sub-Saharan Africa between 2000-2025 to analyze how urban home gardens, rooftop farms, and agroforestry systems contribute to sustainable urban development. The protocol follows PRISMA guidelines and focuses on (i) plant species selection for ecological resilience, (ii) integration of modern technologies in urban gardens, and (iii) socio-economic benefits to communities. The findings emphasize the ecological multifunctionality of urban gardens, which support services such as pollination, soil fertility, and microclimate regulation. Biodiversity services are shaped by both ecological and socio-economic factors, highlighting the importance of mechanisms such as polyculture, shared labour and management of urban gardens, pollinator activity and socio-economic status, reflected in sub-Saharan urban gardens. Socioeconomically, urban gardening plays a crucial role in enhancing household food security, income generation, and psychosocial resilience, particularly benefiting women and low-income communities. However, barriers exist, including insecure land tenure, water scarcity, weak technical support, and limited policy integration. Although technologies such as climate-smart practices and digital tools for irrigation are emerging, their adoption remains uneven. Research gaps include regional underrepresentation, a lack of longitudinal data, and limited focus on governance and gender dynamics. To unlock urban gardening's full potential, future research and policy must adopt participatory, equity-driven approaches that bridge ecological knowledge with socio-political realities.","[Mhlanga, Philisiwe Felicity; Wesch, Nike Susan; Moseri, Moteng Elizabeth; Neumann, Frank Harald; Ngobese, Nomali Ziphorah] North West Univ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Private Bag X6001, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Mhlanga, PF (corresponding author), North West Univ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Private Bag X6001, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa.",55859127@mynwu.ac.za; nike.wesch@nwu.ac.za; moteng.moseri@nwu.ac.za; frank.neumann@nwu.ac.za; nomali.ngobese@nwu.ac.za,"; Mhlanga, Philisiwe/A-7499-2013; Ngobese, Nomali/P-5289-2019","Mhlanga, Philisiwe Felicity/0000-0002-4886-492X; Neumann, Frank H/0000-0002-3620-2742; Wesch, Niké/0000-0002-8189-0695;",,,,91,1,1,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2223-7747,,PLANTS-BASEL,Plants-Basel,OCT 17,2025,14.0,20,,,,,,3187,10.3390/plants14203187,0.0,,25,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,9AE3N,41157745.0,"Green Accepted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001601498900001,0

At the same time, increasing drought phenomena reduce water availability. At present, traditional irrigation systems used by farmers allow them to supply the necessary amount of water to crops, but they often result in overirrigation. The latter over time could lead to a loss of water resources. On the other hand, especially in case of water shortage, inefficient use of water may fail to meet irrigation needs. To remedy this problem, precision irrigation methods are being developed to dose the amount of water needed by crops without wasting both raw material and economics, in order to produce more with less. Specifically, the main technologies used in precision irrigation are IoT-based sensors and machine learning algorithms. In this sense, a data-driven bibliometric review on precision irrigation was conducted from 2001 to 2023; the analysis evidenced 10 main clusters discussed considering the very recent literature after 2020. Among the clusters extracted through CiteSpace are those concerning UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), machine vision, WSN sensors (wireless sensor network) and energy savings. This shows that these topics concerning a new way of seeing precision irrigation, placing greater attention to new technologies and algorithms. The focus is on recent research related to monitoring and advanced control concepts for precision irrigation. It is expected that this revision work will serve as a useful reference to improve the reader's knowledge of advanced monitoring and control opportunities linked to precision irrigation.","[Violino, Simona; Figorilli, Simone; Pallottino, Federico; Costa, Corrado; Menesatti, Paolo] Ctr Ric Ingn & Trasformazioni Agroalimentari, Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr CREA, Via Pascolare 16,Monterotondo, I-00015 Rome, Italy; [Ferrigno, Marianna] Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal econ Agr CREA, Ctr Ric Polit & Bioecon, Via Corticella 133, I-40128 Bologna, Italy; [Manganiello, Veronica] Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal econ Agr CREA, Ctr Ric Polit & Bioecon, Ctr Direzionale Isola E-5,sc CP1,int 5-Vle Costitu, I-80143 Naples, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Costa, C (corresponding author), Ctr Ric Ingn & Trasformazioni Agroalimentari, Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr CREA, Via Pascolare 16,Monterotondo, I-00015 Rome, Italy.",corrado.costa@crea.gov.it,"menesatti, paolo/D-5480-2012; Pallottino, Federico/AAH-7759-2020; violino, simona/AFR-2387-2022","Pallottino, Federico/0000-0003-2035-1257; Manganiello, Veronica/0000-0003-0348-6600; Figorilli, Simone/0000-0003-4035-4199; ferrigno, marianna/0000-0002-5347-0984; violino, simona/0000-0003-1853-7642","Italian Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture, Food Sovereignty and Forestry (MASAF); Tecnologie digitali integrate per il rafforzamento sostenibile di produzioni e trasformazioni agroalimentari (AgroFiliere) [DM 36503.7305.2018]; AGROENER [26329]","Italian Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture, Food Sovereignty and Forestry (MASAF); Tecnologie digitali integrate per il rafforzamento sostenibile di produzioni e trasformazioni agroalimentari (AgroFiliere); AGROENER","This work was funded by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture, Food Sovereignty and Forestry (MASAF) , national program sub-project Tecnologie digitali integrate per il rafforzamento sostenibile di produzioni e trasformazioni agroalimentari (AgroFiliere)  (AgriDigit program) (DM 36503.7305.2018 of 20/12/2018) and AGROENER project (D.D. n. 26329, 1 April 2016) .",53,17,19,4,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2772-3755,,SMART AGR TECHNOL,Smart Agric.

Despite a growing interest in biological mechanisms and epidemiologic studies for ambient temperature and human reproductive outcomes, systematic evidence synthesis is limited. Mapping human infertility outcomes in relation to ambient temperature is important to inform public health and identify research gaps. This scoping review systematically searched (n = 21,332) and included eligible epidemiologic studies (n = 135) on temperature and fertility in human populations to identify the types of temperature metrics and outcomes examined. Included studies used a variety of temperature exposure metrics: ambient temperature measurements, thermal indices, extreme temperatures (e.g., heatwaves), season, occupational heat exposure, climate region, and outdoor activities. Seven types of outcomes were identified across various geographical regions: sperm parameters, outcomes of assisted reproductive technologies, pregnancy loss, population-level reproductive outcomes (e.g., birth rate), infertility diagnosis (yes/no), testicular torsion, and ovarian function. The largest number of studies was for sperm parameters, followed by outcomes of assisted reproductive technologies. Results consistently indicated that higher temperature exposure was associated with reduced sperm parameters (e.g., motility) and increased odds of infertility, while other outcome types showed heterogeneous exposure-response associations. While the methodologies vary by the type of exposures and outcomes, most studies lacked longitudinal or prospective study designs, detailed description of exposure assessments, and consideration for non-monotonic exposure-response associations. This review maps research on temperature and human infertility, highlighting methodological limitations and knowledge gaps to guide future epidemiologic studies and systematic evidence synthesis for evidence-based public health and clinical decision making.","[Heo, Seulkee; Byun, Garam; Choi, Yongsoo; Song, Yimeng; Ma, Tian; Stewart, Rory; Amezcua-Smith, Audrey; Son, Ji-Young; Goldsmith, Leo; Wang, Yichen; Bell, Michelle L.] Yale Univ, Sch Environm, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Bravo, Mercedes] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Burrows, Kate] Univ Chicago, Div Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Choi, Hayon Michelle] Harvard Univ, Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chen, Chen] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Foo, Damien] Curtin Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Curtin Hlth Nexus, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Kim, Sera] Res & Management Ctr Hlth Risk Particulate Matter, Seoul, South Korea; [Johnson, Nicholaus P.; Deziel, Nicole C.] Yale Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Kim, Honghyok] Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Chicago, IL 60612 USA",Yale University; Duke University; University of Chicago; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Their cycling is influenced by sediment dynamics, water circulation, and complex interactions with biological and chemical factors. Heavy metal pollution demonstrates serious risks to coastal biota, including fish, shellfish, algae, and marine mammals through mechanisms such as bioaccumulation and biomagnification. These processes lead to biodiversity loss, habitat degradation, and reduced ecosystem functionality. Current mitigation strategies for pollution control regulations and remediation techniques show promise but face challenges in implementation. Emerging technologies such as nanotechnology and bioremediation offer innovative solutions but require further validation. Knowledge gaps persist in understanding the long-term ecological impacts of heavy metal contamination and optimizing management strategies for diverse coastal ecosystems. Coastal ecosystems are vital for supporting biodiversity and providing essential ecosystem services, but they are increasingly threatened by heavy metal pollution-a pervasive environmental challenge that demands urgent attention. This review investigates the sources, characteristics, pathways, ecological impacts, and management strategies associated with heavy metal contamination in coastal environments. The review synthesizes findings from recent literature, employing a systematic approach to analyze natural and anthropogenic sources, contamination pathways, and the biogeochemical processes governing heavy metal cycling. Future research should focus on addressing these gaps through interdisciplinary approaches, integrating advanced modeling techniques, stakeholder engagement, and sustainable management practices. By prioritizing these efforts, we can safeguard coastal ecosystems and their essential services from the escalating threats of heavy metal pollution.","[El-Sharkawy, Mahmoud; Mahmoud, Esawy] Tanta Univ, Fac Agr, Soil & Water Dept, Tanta 31527, Egypt; [Alotaibi, Modhi O.] Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biol, POB 84428, Riyadh 11671, Saudi Arabia; [Alotaibi, Modhi O.] Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman Univ, Nat & Hlth Sci Res Ctr, Environm & Biomat Unit, POB 84428, Riyadh 11671, Saudi Arabia; [Li, Jian; Du, Daolin] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Environm & Safety Engn, Sch Emergency Management, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Tanta University; Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University; Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University; Jiangsu University,"El-Sharkawy, M (corresponding author), Tanta Univ, Fac Agr, Soil & Water Dept, Tanta 31527, Egypt.;Alotaibi, MO (corresponding author), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biol, POB 84428, Riyadh 11671, Saudi Arabia.;Alotaibi, MO (corresponding author), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman Univ, Nat & Hlth Sci Res Ctr, Environm & Biomat Unit, POB 84428, Riyadh 11671, Saudi Arabia.",mahmoud.elsharkawy@agr.tanta.edu.eg; mouotaebe@pnu.edu.sa; jianli@ujs.edu.cn; daolindu@ujs.edu.cn; esawy.rezk@agr.tanta.edu.eg,"El-Sharkawy, Mahmoud/AER-2401-2022; mahmoud, esawy/AFL-9839-2022; Alotaibi, Modhi O/AAN-1939-2021; Du, Daolin/HHC-9359-2022","El-Sharkawy, Mahmoud/0000-0003-2927-4657; mahmoud, esawy/0000-0002-1006-779X; Alotaibi, Modhi O/0000-0002-6604-1652;","Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project; Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [PNURSP2025R101]","Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project(Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University); Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University);","This research was funded by Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project No. (PNURSP2025R101), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",207,71,79,84,140,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2025,17.0,2,,,,,,701,10.3390/su17020701,0.0,,29,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,T5I1O,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001405329700001,0

CGMs are sensors that provide real time, longitudinal tracking of interstitial glucose with a range of commercial monitors currently available. Recent advancements in CGM technology have led to the development of athlete-specific devices targeting glucose monitoring in sport. Although largely untested, the capacity of CGMs to capture the duration, magnitude, and frequency of interstitial glucose fluctuations every 1-15 min may present a unique opportunity to monitor fueling adequacy around competitive events and training sessions, with applications for applied research and sports nutrition practice. Indeed, manufacturers of athlete-specific devices market these products as a fueling gauge, enabling athletes to push their limits longer and get bigger gains. However, as glucose homeostasis is a complex phenomenon, extensive research is required to ascertain whether systemic glucose availability (estimated by CGM-derived interstitial glucose) has any meaning in relation to the intended purposes in sport. Whether CGMs will provide reliable and accurate information and enhance sports nutrition knowledge and practice is currently untested. Caveats around the use of CGMs include technical issues (dislodging of sensors during periods of surveillance, loss of data due to synchronization issues), practical issues (potential bans on their use in some sporting scenarios, expense), and challenges to the underpinning principles of data interpretation, which highlight the role of sports nutrition professionals to provide context and interpretation.","[Bowler, Amy-Lee M.; Coffey, Vernon G.; Cox, Gregory R.] Bond Univ, Fac Hlth Sci & Med, Robina, Qld, Australia; [Whitfield, Jamie; Marshall, Lachlan; Burke, Louise M.] Australian Catholic Univ, Mary MacKillop Inst Hlth Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Coffey, Vernon G.] Bond Univ, Ctr Data Analyt, Bond Business Sch, Robina, Qld, Australia",Bond University; Australian Catholic University; Bond University,"Cox, GR (corresponding author), Bond Univ, Fac Hlth Sci & Med, Robina, Qld, Australia.",gcox@bond.edu.au,"Burke, Louise/ABC-5691-2020; Cox, Gregory/KMY-2138-2024; Whitfield, Jamie/J-1570-2018","Bowler, Amy-Lee/0000-0003-2149-9683; Cox, Gregory/0000-0003-4334-608X; Whitfield, Jamie/0000-0002-8961-8872",Bond University's Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine; Australian Catholic University; Queensland Academy of Sport's Sport Performance Innovation and Knowledge Excellence Programme,Bond University's Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine; Australian Catholic University; Queensland Academy of Sport's Sport Performance Innovation and Knowledge Excellence Programme,"This study was funded by Bond University's Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine, Australian Catholic University, and Queensland Academy of Sport's Sport Performance Innovation and Knowledge Excellence Programme.",60,38,43,0,17,HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC,CHAMPAIGN,"1607 N MARKET ST, PO BOX 5076, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820-2200 USA",1526-484X,1543-2742,INT J SPORT NUTR EXE,Int.

We examine the publication landscape in the area in an effort to provide insights into current advances and developments. We then discuss the evolution of key concepts in the field, genetic associations, as well as the major technologies and development pipelines of rare disease treatments. We focus our attention on three specific rare diseases: (i) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a terminal neurodegenerative disease affecting the central nervous system resulting in progressive loss of motor neurons that control voluntary muscles; (ii) Huntington's disease, another terminal neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the brain, with a wide impact on a person's functional abilities; and (iii) myasthenia gravis, a chronic autoimmune synaptopathy leading to skeletal muscle weakness. While the pathogenesis of these rare diseases is being elucidated, there is neither a cure nor preventative treatment available, only symptomatic treatment. The objective of the paper is to provide a broad overview of the evolving landscape of current knowledge on rare diseases and specifically on the biology and genetics of the three spotlighted diseases, to outline challenges and evaluate growth opportunities, an aim to further efforts in solving the remaining challenges.","[Iyer, Kavita A.; Tenchov, Rumiana; Sasso, Janet M.; Polshakov, Dmitrii; Zhou, Qiongqiong Angela] CAS, Div Amer Chem Soc, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Ralhan, Krittika; Jotshi, Jyotsna; Maind, Ankush] ACS Int India Pvt Ltd, Pune 411044, India",American Chemical Society,"Zhou, QA (corresponding author), CAS, Div Amer Chem Soc, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",qzhou@cas.org,"; Tenchov, Rumiana/KII-3575-2024","zhou, Qiongqiong/0000-0001-6711-369X; Sasso, Janet/0000-0002-1156-5184;",Science Connect team at CAS,Science Connect team at CAS,"The authors sincerely appreciate Dharmini Patel for project coordination and are grateful to Manuel Guzman, Michael Dennis, Dawn Riedel, Dawn George, and Hong Xie for executive sponsorship.

Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition that destroys the supporting tissues of the teeth and ultimately leads to tooth loss. As one of the most prevalent oral conditions, periodontitis endangers the oral health of 70% of people worldwide, and has been increasingly linked to various systemic diseases. In this regard, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is a key pathogen in the oral microbiome and a Gram-negative oral anaerobic bacterium that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Porphyromonas gingivalis can express various virulence factors to evade innate and adaptive immunities, which causes P. gingivalis to survive and propagate in the host, destroy periodontal tissues, and contribute to systemic diseases. This narrative review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the impact of P. gingivalis in oral microbiome formation and its mechanistic links to systemic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. This review will explore the pathogenic mechanisms employed by P. gingivalis, including immune evasion, dissemination, and molecular mimicry, and evaluate the clinical and epidemiological evidence linking periodontitis with systemic health outcomes. By consolidating these insights, this review seeks to highlight the importance of periodontal health in preventing systemic diseases and propose potential therapeutic interventions targeting P. gingivalis. These findings highlight that early diagnosis and effective treatment of periodontitis, particularly targeting P. gingivalis, are essential not only to preserving oral health but also to reducing the risk and progression of systemic diseases.","[Messina, Bianca Maria; Polizzi, Alessandro; Isola, Gaetano] Univ Catania, Dept Gen Surg & Med Surg Special, Unit Periodontol, I-95124 Catania, Italy; [Grippaudo, Cristina] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Head Neck & Sensory Organs, Largo F Vito 1, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Grippaudo, Cristina] Fdn Policlin Univ A Gemelli IRCCS, Dept Neurosci Sense Organs & Thorax, UOC Dent Clin, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Blasi, Andrea] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Neurosci Reprod Sci & Oral Sci, I-80138 Naples, Italy",University of Catania; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; University of Naples Federico II,"Grippaudo, C (corresponding author), Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Head Neck & Sensory Organs, Largo F Vito 1, I-00168 Rome, Italy.;Grippaudo, C (corresponding author), Fdn Policlin Univ A Gemelli IRCCS, Dept Neurosci Sense Organs & Thorax, UOC Dent Clin, I-00168 Rome, Italy.",bianca.messina@tiscali.it; cristina.grippaudo@unicatt.it; alessandro.polizzi@phd.unict.it; andrea.blasi@unina.it; gaetano.isola@unict.it,"Isola, Gaetano/H-2878-2019; Blasi, Anea/AES-5343-2022; Polizzi, Alessano/AAE-3790-2021; GRIPPAUDO, Cristina/AAB-1001-2022","Isola, Gaetano/0000-0003-4267-6992; Blasi, Anea/0000-0003-4791-8794; Polizzi, Alessano/0000-0001-6717-8899; GRIPPAUDO, Cristina/0000-0002-9499-0556",,,,98,8,8,10,12,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Thymol, a natural monoterpene with a broad spectrum of strong biological activities, began to be widely applied in science and industry, including the production of active food packaging materials. In this framework, this article provides a comprehensive review on the use of thymol for active food packaging, summarizing reported technologies and explaining the impact of its addition on the thermal, structural, mechanical, and barrier properties of polymeric films. Moreover, this review analysis effects of films' physical properties on the release of thymol and revises the strategies to tune the release kinetics. It also provides a critical and comprehensive analysis of the published data on the antimicrobial properties of active films containing thymol. Based on the presented data, knowledge gaps were identified, and possible research trends were discussed. The analysis of the presented technologies showed that supercritical solvent impregnation might overcome the drawbacks of conventional processes, such as high thymol loss and its uneven distribution. The reviewed data indicated that bioactive polymeric materials containing thymol, especially PLA, might have applications in flexible and semirigid packaging because of the improvement of polymer ductility.

The nuclei of muscle fibres (myonuclei) are usually situated peripherally which complicates the equitable distribution of gene products. Myonuclear abundance can also change under conditions such as hypertrophy and atrophy. Specialised zones in muscle fibres have different functions and thus distinct synthetic demands from myonuclei. The complex structure and regulatory requirements of multinuclear muscle cells understandably led to the hypothesis that myonuclei govern defined 'domains' to maintain homeostasis and facilitate adaptation. The purpose of this review is to provide historical context for the myonuclear domain and evaluate its veracity with respect to mRNA and protein distribution resulting from myonuclear transcription. We synthesise insights from past and current in vitro and in vivo genetically modified models for studying the myonuclear domain under dynamic conditions. We also cover the most contemporary knowledge on mRNA and protein transport in muscle cells. Insights from emerging technologies such as single myonuclear RNA-sequencing further inform our discussion of the myonuclear domain. We broadly conclude: (1) the myonuclear domain can be flexible during muscle fibre growth and atrophy, (2) the mechanisms and role of myonuclear loss and motility deserve further consideration, (3) mRNA in muscle is actively transported via microtubules and locally restricted, but proteins may travel far from a myonucleus of origin and (4) myonuclear transcriptional specialisation extends beyond the classic neuromuscular and myotendinous populations. A deeper understanding of the myonuclear domain in muscle may promote effective therapies for ageing and disease.","[Bagley, James R.] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Kinesiol, Muscle Physiol Lab, San Francisco, CA USA; [Denes, Lance T.] NYU, Inst Syst Genet, New York, NY USA; [McCarthy, John J.] Univ Kentucky, Ctr Muscle Biol, Lexington, KY USA; [McCarthy, John J.] Univ Kentucky, Coll Med, Dept Physiol, Lexington, KY USA; [Wang, Eric T.] Univ Florida, Ctr NeuroGenet, Dept Mol Genet & Microbiol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Wang, Eric T.] Univ Florida, Myol Inst, Gainesville, FL USA; [Wang, Eric T.] Univ Florida, Genet Inst, Gainesville, FL USA; [Murach, Kevin A.] Univ Arkansas, Exercise Sci Res Ctr, Dept Hlth, Human Performance & Recreat, Fayetteville, AR USA; [Murach, Kevin A.] Univ Arkansas, Cell & Mol Biol Grad Program, Fayetteville, AR USA; [Murach, Kevin A.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Hlth Human Performance & Recreat, Mol Muscle Mass Regulat Lab, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University; New York University; University of Kentucky; University of Kentucky; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Murach, KA (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Hlth Human Performance & Recreat, Mol Muscle Mass Regulat Lab, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",kmurach@uark.edu,"; Wang, Eric/OGQ-7550-2025; Murach, Kevin/GQZ-3584-2022; Bagley, James/H-9982-2019","McCarthy, John/0000-0003-4522-5601; Wang, Eric/0000-0003-2655-5525; Denes, Lance/0000-0003-1763-3325; Bagley, James/0000-0002-2709-548X",CSUPERB New Investigator Grant; NIH [R00 AG063994]; National Institute on Aging [R00AG063994] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,CSUPERB New Investigator Grant; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),This work was supported by a CSUPERB New Investigator Grant to J.R.B. and NIH R00 AG063994 to K.A.M.,204,40,44,4,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-3751,1469-7793,J PHYSIOL-LONDON,J.

The three poles have undergone accelerating loss of sea ice, ice shelves, and/or glaciers, accompanied by pronounced warming in the Arctic and TP and region-specific warming in Antarctica. Despite their geographical remoteness, the three poles exhibit evident linkages, yet substantial gaps remain in our understanding of their climate teleconnections. This review summarizes the interactions among Earth's three poles. The three poles are dynamically linked through a hierarchy of pathways. The Arctic-TP interactions are dominated by stationary Rossby-wave trains triggered by sea-ice and snow anomalies and reinforced by land-surface feedback over the plateau. The Arctic- Antarctic coupling relies on ocean heat transport through the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and on the modulation of tropical Atlantic temperature and the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The Antarctic-TP signals travel via sea-surface temperature anomalies in the Indian Ocean forced by the Antarctic Oscillation, which propagate northward and excite wave trains and transport moisture onto the TP. Closing the remaining knowledge gaps will require coordinated paleoclimate constraints, targeted field campaigns over the Southern Ocean and TP, and next-generation Earth-system models equipped with machine-learning techniques. Such integrative efforts are essential for more reliable projections of compound extremes and for informing adaptation strategies. (c) 2025 Science China Press.

Traditionally, several methods are used to preserve strawberries after harvest and extend their shelf life, including thermal, plasma, radiation, chemical, and biological treatments. Although these methods are effective, they are a concern from the perspective of safety and consumer acceptance of the treated food. To address these issues, more advanced environment-friendly technologies have been developed over the past decades, including modified and controlled atmosphere packaging, active biopolymer-based packaging, or edible coating formulations. This method can not only significantly extend the shelf life of fruit but also solve safety concerns. Some studies have shown that combining two or more of these technologies can significantly extend the shelf life of strawberries, which could significantly contribute to expanding the global supply chain for delicious fruit. Despite the large number of studies underway in this field of research, no systematic review has been published discussing these advances. This review aims to cover important information about postharvest physiology, decay factors, and preservation methods of strawberry fruits. It is a pioneering work that integrates, relates, and discusses all information on the postharvest fate and handling of strawberries in one place. Additionally, commercially used techniques were discussed to provide insight into current developments in strawberry preservation and suggest future research directions in this field of study.

This crisis can be reduced by increasing agricultural production in a whole part of the country. However, rainfall in arid and semi-arid areas is generally insufficient to meet the basic needs of crop production. In order to improve the livelihoods of its rural communities, the government of Ethiopia has currently started implementing rainwater harvesting (RWH) techniques at the household level. This method can help boost the country's agricultural production and livestock. The main goal of this review is to examine the status of the knowledge and practices of RWH technology for crop production in Ethiopia. The different reviews conducted in Ethiopia revealed the importance of RWH technologies for the country's rain-fed regions. The positive effects of macro-catchment systems on water productivity in regions such as Amhara, Oromia, Tigray, and the Southern were among the most important findings. Most of these systems are built and operated in these regions, which gave a good picture of their practices. Besides this, the different challenges were addressed during the application of RWH practices in the field, including pond siltation, seepage losses, water lifting problems, and lack of awareness, which were the major ones.

This integrative review aimed to identify the main changes in brain connections found in fMRI scans of individuals with Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). The data collection method involved searching for the terms Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Psychological Dependence and Internet Addiction Disorder in the PubMed and Embase databases. Studies published between 2020 and January 2023 were included and manually analyzed through the virtual environment created in the Rayyan software, compiling a total of 18 scientific studies. The main findings reveal changes such as significant increases or decreases in functional connectivity in certain regions of the brain. Some potential negative impacts on the uncontrolled use of technologies among the young population were evaluated, such as the loss of inhibitory control in decision-making, transforming leisure into dependence, and although the IGD understands the associated risks and harms, it faces difficulties in resisting the desire to stop playing. This situation emphasizes the need for more long-term studies that can be comparative between different age groups. Conclusion, the brain regions with the most significant changes in functional connectivity in individuals with IGD symptoms are the prefrontal cortex, fronto-parietal regions, frontal gyrus, insula lobe, cingulate cortex and striatum. The lack of comprehensive knowledge about the effects of video game addiction across different age groups is a significant concern. Therefore, it is essential to carry out research that evaluates the impact of these technologies on different stages of human development.","[Botelho, Apolinario de Oliveira; Ribeiro, Francieli Bernardo; Souza, Daiane Cristini Barbosa de] Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil; [Machado, Jessica Soares] Univ Hosp Giessen & Marburg, Marburg, Germany",University Hospital of Giessen & Marburg,"Souza, DCBD (corresponding author), Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil.",daiane.cristini@ifsc.edu.br,"Bernardo Ribeiro, Francieli/NSU-2885-2025","Bernardo Ribeiro, Francieli/0009-0005-4294-1954; Botelho, Apolinário de Oliveira/0009-0008-5988-3852; Soares Machado, Jéssica/0000-0001-9475-2163",Federal Institute of Science and Technology of Santa Catarina (IFSC),Federal Institute of Science and Technology of Santa Catarina (IFSC),The authors would like to thank the Federal Institute of Science and Technology of Santa Catarina (IFSC) for supporting this study.,29,2,2,3,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1055-0887,1545-0848,J ADDICT DIS,J.

Previous studies examining barriers, challenges and knowledge gaps for PE in research are not specific to women/individuals with lived experiences of pregnancy or those trying to conceive.Objective To identify and describe methods used to engage patient partners in perinatal health research.Search Strategy Ovid, Web of Science, CINAHL and grey literature were searched by a medical librarian from inception to October 2025.Selection Criteria Included studies described the process of PE in perinatal health research. Patient partners were considered as individuals with lived experience of having conceived, been pregnant and/or given birth to a child.Data Collection and Analysis Of the 331 full-text articles reviewed, 164 articles were included, with most studies (129/164; 78.7%) conducted in the past 5 years.Main Results Two-thirds of studies reported compensation for patient partner engagement (n = 111). The most commonly reported barriers to PE included language limitations, recruitment of diverse populations and lack of access to technology or barriers to using technology. Loss-to-follow-up was the greatest limitation to effective patient partner engagement once recruited. Facilitators to PE included the provision of multiple mediums for engagement (e.g., virtual and in-person), avoiding scientific jargon and training research teams in PE strategies.Conclusion This review highlights the need for greater awareness of PE reporting in perinatal health research. Further research is needed to assess approaches for measuring PE to accurately measure and evaluate its impact on study design, execution and findings.","[Zhao, Lucy; Tailor, Lauren S.; Marks, Yanara; Fajardo, Renee G.; Chiodo, Sabrina; Novosel, Olivia M.; Cunningham, Jessie; Grandi, Sonia M.] Hosp Sick Children, Child Hlth Evaluat Sci CHES, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Zhao, Lucy; Novosel, Olivia M.] Univ Toronto, Temerty Fac Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tailor, Lauren S.; Chiodo, Sabrina; Grandi, Sonia M.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Fajardo, Renee G.] Western Univ, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, London, ON, Canada; [Cunningham, Jessie] Hosp Sick Children, Hlth Sci Lib, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids),"Grandi, SM (corresponding author), Hosp Sick Children, Child Hlth Evaluat Sci CHES, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Grandi, SM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol, Toronto, ON, Canada.",sonia.grandi@sickkids.ca,,"Tailor, Lauren/0000-0002-2085-8755",Sickkids Research Institute,Sickkids Research Institute,This work was supported by Sickkids Research Institute.,44,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1470-0328,1471-0528,BJOG-INT J OBSTET GY,BJOG,2026 JAN 8,2026,,,,,,,,,10.1111/1471-0528.70145,0.0,JAN 2026,10,Obstetrics & Gynecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Obstetrics & Gynecology,AT1ZP,41504099.0,hybrid,2026-02-03,WOS:001656180000001,0

Altitude-induced air density reduction causes 8-13 % power loss per km of altitude and significant emissions deterioration in piston engines-problems that demand effective technical solutions. This systematic review examines two-stage turbocharging systems operating in high-altitude environments, focusing on aviation applications from moderate to near-space elevations and ground transportation in mountainous regions. The review systematically analyzes various turbocharging configurations, key parameters, matching methods, and inter-stage flow phenomena to establish a comprehensive framework for altitude-adaptive two-stage turbocharging. These systems provide notable advantages in control flexibility, altitude adaptability, and improvements in fuel economy and emission control, with optimized configurations achieving up to 95 % sea-level power restoration at 5.5 km altitude and enabling unmanned aerial vehicles to reach 20 km with pressure ratios exceeding 23. While delivering superior performance compared to single-stage alternatives, these gains come with implementation challenges including increased system cost, weight, and packaging complexity. By synthesizing previously fragmented research across system configurations, parameter optimization, and flow dynamics, this work provides both theoretical foundations and practical design guidance for sustainable high-altitude engine systems. Future development pathways include compact architectures, electrification integration, renewable fuels, and advanced propulsion systems aimed at addressing performance and environmental demands across challenging altitude profiles. This work fills critical knowledge gaps in high-altitude engine technology and supports sustainable transportation development in environmentally sensitive mountain environments.","[Zhou, Yu; Geng, Tai; Shao, Longtao; Zhong, Zhiming; Song, Yue; Ding, Shuiting] Beihang Univ, Res Inst Aeroengine, 37 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yu; Li, Xueyu; Geng, Tai; Shao, Longtao; Zhong, Zhiming; Song, Yue] Aircraft Engine Integrated Syst Safety Beijing Key, 37 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Li, Xueyu] Beihang Univ, Sch Transportat Sci & Engn, Xueyuan Rd 37, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zheng] Beihang Univ, Hangzhou Int Innovat Inst, Hangzhou 311115, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Kun] Aero Engine Acad China, 21 Shunxing Rd, Beijing 101304, Peoples R China; [Ding, Shuiting] Civil Aviat Univ China, 2898 Jinbei Rd, Tianjin 300300, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Beihang University; Beihang University; Civil Aviation University of China,"Song, Y (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Res Inst Aeroengine, 37 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",zybuaa@hotmail.com; lixueyu_buaa@qq.com; teddyG@buaa.edu.cn; sltwhut@163.com; zheng.xu@buaa.edu.cn; m18683870513@163.com; zkjason1213@163.com; sy1704312@buaa.edu.cn; dshuiting@163.com,"Zhong, Zhiming/GRR-5001-2022; XU, Zheng/OVZ-7103-2025","XU, Zheng/0000-0001-8217-2428","Basic Research Program of the National Nature Science Foundation of China [52475503, 52206131, U2233213, U2333217]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [3252027]; National Key R & D Program of China [2022YFB2602002, 2018YFB0104100]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LQ22E060004]; Science Center of Gas Turbine Project [P2022-A-I-001-001]",Basic Research Program of the National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Key R & D Program of China; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Science Center of Gas Turbine Project,"This research was funded by the Basic Research Program of the National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant number [52475503] , [52206131] , [U2233213] and [U2333217] ) , Beijing Natural Science Foundation, grant number [3252027] , National Key R & D Program of China, grant number [2022YFB2602002] and [2018YFB0104100] , and Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number [LQ22E060004] , Science Center of Gas Turbine Project [P2022-A-I-001-001] .",169,3,3,20,21,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

It is affected by diseases that reduce animals' quality of life, consequently leading to economic losses in livestock. With advancements in tissue bioengineering and regenerative medicine, studying the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the bovine mammary gland can improve our understanding of its physiology and the processes that affect it. This knowledge could also enable the development of sustainable therapeutic alternatives for both the dairy production chain and human oncology research. A common approach in regenerative medicine is decellularization, a process that removes all cells from tissue while preserving its architecture and ECM components for subsequent recellularization. The success of recellularization depends on obtaining immunologically compatible scaffolds and using appropriate cell culture sources and methods to ensure tissue functionality. However, tissue culture technology still faces challenges due to specific requirements and high costs. Here, we review the literature on biomaterials and tissue engineering, providing an overview of the ECM of the bovine mammary gland and advances in its bioengineering, with a focus on regenerative medicine for bovine species. The methodology employed consists of a structured search of scientific databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and SciELO, using specific keywords related to tissue engineering and the bovine mammary gland. The selection criteria prioritized peer-reviewed articles published between 2002 and 2025 that demonstrated scientific relevance and contributed to the understanding of bovine mammary gland bioengineering. Although research on this topic has advanced, vascularization, tissue maturation, and scalability remain key barriers to widespread application and economic viability.","[Chissico Junior, Fernando; Santos da Silva, Thamires] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Vet Med & Anim Sci, Dept Surg, BR-05508270 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Chissico Junior, Fernando] Univ Save UniSave, Sch Vet Med & Anim Sci, Dept Vet Med & Anim Sci, Chongoene 1200, Mozambique; [Vieira Meirelles, Flavio] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Anim Sci & Food Engn, Dept Vet Med, Pirassununga Campus, BR-13635900 Pirassununga, SP, Brazil; [Monzani, Paulo Sergio] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Anim Sci & Food Engn, Dept Food Engn, Pirassununga Campus, BR-13635900 Pirassununga, SP, Brazil; [Fornari Laurindo, Lucas; Maria Barbalho, Sandra] Univ Marilia UNIMAR, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Pharmacol, BR-17525902 Marilia, SP, Brazil; [Fornari Laurindo, Lucas; Maria Barbalho, Sandra; Miglino, Maria Angelica] Univ Marilia UNIMAR, Sch Med, Postgrad Program Struct & Funct Interact Rehabil, BR-17525902 Marilia, SP, Brazil; [Miglino, Maria Angelica] Univ Marilia UNIMAR, Sch Vet Med, Postgrad Program Anim Hlth Prod & Environm, BR-17525902 Marilia, SP, Brazil; [Miglino, Maria Angelica] Univ Marilia UNIMAR, Sch Vet Med, Dept Anim Anat, BR-17525902 Marilia, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Marilia; Universidade de Marilia; Universidade de Marilia; Universidade de Marilia,"Miglino, MA (corresponding author), Univ Marilia UNIMAR, Sch Med, Postgrad Program Struct & Funct Interact Rehabil, BR-17525902 Marilia, SP, Brazil.;Miglino, MA (corresponding author), Univ Marilia UNIMAR, Sch Vet Med, Postgrad Program Anim Hlth Prod & Environm, BR-17525902 Marilia, SP, Brazil.;Miglino, MA (corresponding author), Univ Marilia UNIMAR, Sch Vet Med, Dept Anim Anat, BR-17525902 Marilia, SP, Brazil.",fernandochissico@usp.br; thamiresssilva@usp.br; meirellf@usp.br; monzani.paulo@gmail.com; lucaslaurindo@unimar.br; smbarbalho@gmail.com; miglino@usp.br,"SANTOS DA SILVA, THAMIRES/KHD-9833-2024; Meirelles, Flavio/B-5048-2010; Miglino, Maria Angelica/B-9519-2012; Monzani, Paulo Sérgio/A-4046-2016; FORNARI LAURINDO, LUCAS/HZJ-7263-2023; barbalho, sana/Z-3515-2019","SANTOS DA SILVA, THAMIRES/0000-0002-7848-8558; Meirelles, Flavio/0000-0003-0372-4920; Miglino, Maria Angelica/0000-0003-4979-115X; Monzani, Paulo Sérgio/0000-0003-4001-3431; Chissico Júnior, Fernando/0009-0006-4521-3052; FORNARI LAURINDO, LUCAS/0000-0003-3159-0982; barbalho, sana/0000-0002-5035-876X",Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [21/05445-7],Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"This study was funded by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, grant number 21/05445-7).",153,2,2,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2306-5354,BIOENGINEERING-BASEL,Bioengineering-Basel,MAY 9,2025,12.0,5,,,,,,501,10.3390/bioengineering12050501,0.0,,24,"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering, Biomedical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering,3BX3B,40428120.0,"Green Accepted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001496657900001,0

While many driver genes were identified decades ago, and most cancers can be classified based on morphology and progression, there is still a significant gap in knowledge about genetic aberrations and nuclear DNA damage. The study of two critical groups of genes-tumor suppressors, which inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis, and oncogenes, which regulate proliferation and survival-can help to understand the genomic causes behind tumorigenesis, leading to more personalized approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Aberration of tumor suppressors, which undergo two-hit and loss-of-function mutations, and oncogenes, activated forms of proto-oncogenes that experience one-hit and gain-of-function mutations, are responsible for the dysregulation of key signaling pathways that regulate cell division, such as p53, Rb, Ras/Raf/ERK/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/beta-catenin. Modern breakthroughs in genomics research, like next-generation sequencing, have provided efficient strategies for mapping unique genomic changes that contribute to tumor heterogeneity. Novel therapeutic approaches have enabled personalized medicine, helping address genetic variability in tumor suppressors and oncogenes. This comprehensive review examines the molecular mechanisms behind tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes, the key signaling pathways they regulate, epigenetic modifications, tumor heterogeneity, and the drug resistance mechanisms that drive carcinogenesis. Moreover, the review explores the clinical application of sequencing techniques, multiomics, diagnostic procedures, pharmacogenomics, and personalized treatment and prevention options, discussing future directions for emerging technologies.","[Stojchevski, Radoslav; Avtanski, Dimiter] Northwell Hlth, Lenox Hill Hosp, Friedman Diabet Inst, New York, NY 10022 USA; [Stojchevski, Radoslav; Avtanski, Dimiter] Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA; [Stojchevski, Radoslav; Avtanski, Dimiter] Donald & Barbara Zucker Sch Med Hofstra Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA; [Sutanto, Edward Agus] CUNY, City Coll New York, Sch Med, 160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Sutanto, Rinni] New York Inst Technol, Coll Osteopath Med, Glen Head, NY 11545 USA; [Hadzi-Petrushev, Nikola; Mladenov, Mitko] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Inst Biol, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Skopje 1000, North Macedonia; [Singh, Sajal Raj; Sinha, Jitendra Kumar; Ghosh, Shampa; Yarlagadda, Bhuvaneshwar] GloNeuro, Sect 107,Vishwakarma Rd, Noida 201301, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Krishna Kumar] Symbiosis Int Deemed Univ SIU, Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Pk, Pune 411057, Maharashtra, India; [Verma, Prashant] BML Munjal Univ, Sch Management, NH8, Gurugram 122413, Haryana, India; [Sengupta, Sonali] All India Inst Med Sci AIIMS, Dept Gastroenterol, New Delhi 110029, India; [Bhaskar, Rakesh] Yeungnam Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea; [Bhaskar, Rakesh] Yeungnam Univ, Res Inst Cell Culture, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea",Northwell Health; Northwell Health; Northwell Health; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY); Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Symbiosis International University; BML Munjal University; All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) New Delhi; Yeungnam University; Yeungnam University,"Avtanski, D (corresponding author), Northwell Hlth, Lenox Hill Hosp, Friedman Diabet Inst, New York, NY 10022 USA.;Avtanski, D (corresponding author), Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA.;Avtanski, D (corresponding author), Donald & Barbara Zucker Sch Med Hofstra Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA.;Bhaskar, R (corresponding author), Yeungnam Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea.;Bhaskar, R (corresponding author), Yeungnam Univ, Res Inst Cell Culture, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea.",rstojchevski@northwell.edu; esutant000@citymail.cuny.edu; rsutanto@nyit.edu; nikola@pmf.ukim.mk; jksinha@gloneuro.org; krishnakumar@scit.edu; bhaskar88@yu.ac.kr; davtanski@northwell.edu,"Bhaskar, Rakesh/GLR-0104-2022; Verma, Prashant/IYJ-4352-2023; Stojchevski, Radoslav/AEC-2778-2022; Singh, Krishna Kumar/N-9355-2013; MLADENOV, MITKO/A-1980-2019; Avtanski, Dimiter/W-6187-2018; Sinha, Jitena Kumar/G-1084-2012; Sutanto, Edward/PBV-9714-2025; Ghosh, Shampa/G-4237-2012; sengupta, sonali/F-8830-2016","Bhaskar, Rakesh/0000-0002-0181-6197; Stojchevski, Radoslav/0000-0002-5942-1622; Yarlagadda, Bhuvaneshwar/0009-0009-7818-0981; Singh, Krishna Kumar/0000-0003-3849-5945; Hadzi-Petrushev, Nikola/0000-0002-4498-7359; MLADENOV, MITKO/0000-0003-3475-2131; Avtanski, Dimiter/0000-0002-4479-6448; Sinha, Jitena Kumar/0000-0002-7444-6932; Sutanto, Edward/0009-0005-4069-112X; Ghosh, Shampa/0000-0002-3252-7216; sengupta, sonali/0000-0002-9710-9576",Gerald J. and Dorothy R.

Besides the higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and aging worldwide, immune mediated disorders remain an important cause of kidney disease and are especially prevalent in young adults. Regardless of the initial insult, final pathway to CKD and kidney failure is always the loss of normal tissue and fibrosis development, in which the dynamic equilibrium between extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation is disturbed, leading to excessive production and accumulation. During fibrosis, a multitude of cell types intervene at different levels, but myofibroblasts and inflammatory cells are considered critical in the process. They exert their effects through different molecular pathways, of which transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) has demonstrated to be of particular importance. Additionally, CKD itself promotes fibrosis due to the accumulation of toxins and hormonal changes, and proteinuria is simultaneously a manifestation of CKD and a specific driver of renal fibrosis. Pathways involved in renal fibrosis and CKD are closely interrelated, and although important advances have been made in our knowledge of them, it is still necessary to translate them into clinical practice. Given the complexity of this process, it is highly likely that its treatment will require a multi-target strategy to control the origin of the damage but also the mechanisms that perpetuate it. Fortunately, rapid technology development over the last years and new available drugs in the nephrologist's armamentarium give reasons for optimism that more personalized assistance for CKD and renal fibrosis will appear in the future.","[Xipell, Marc; Guillen, Elena; Blasco, Miquel; Quintana, Luis F.; De Cos, Marina] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, Ctr Referencia Enfermedad Glomerular Compleja Sist, Dept Nephrol & Renal Transplantat, Barcelona, Spain; [Garcia-Herrera, Adriana] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, Ctr Referencia Enfermedad Glomerular Compleja Sist, Dept Pathol, Barcelona, Spain; [Lledo, Gema M.; Espinosa, Gerard; Cervera, Ricard] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, Inst Invest Biome August Pi Sunyer IDIBAPS d i, Dept Autoimmune Dis, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona,"Quintana, LF (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, Ctr Referencia Enfermedad Glomerular Compleja Sist, Dept Nephrol & Renal Transplantat, Barcelona, Spain.",lfquinta@clinic.cat,"Quintana, Luis F/AAF-4788-2020; Garcia-Herrera, Aiana/ITV-6767-2023; Espinosa, Gerard/AAV-2751-2020; LLEDO, GEMA MARIA/ABD-4043-2021; Xipell, Marc/HTS-2146-2023; Blasco, Miquel/T-7845-2019","Quintana, Luis F/0000-0001-7582-8476; Garcia-Herrera, Aiana/0000-0003-4156-1587; Espinosa, Gerard/0000-0003-1336-0163; de Cos Gomez, Marina/0000-0002-4027-8467; LLEDO, GEMA MARIA/0000-0002-0425-6519;",Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCII) [PI17/00080]; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) [PI17/00080],Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCII); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),This work was supported by: Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCII) and Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) (PI17/00080).

Grounded in the complementarity and substitution view (CSV) of technology, the review seeks to identify the potential benefits and the challenges posed by AI, offering a balanced and integrative understanding of its psychological impact on workers. Design/methodology/approach-This paper adopts a systematic literature review (SLR) approach, following PRISMA guidelines. A total of 438 articles were initially retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases. After a rigorous screening process based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 60 articles were deemed eligible for in-depth analysis. Findings-AI impacts WMH in beneficial, risky and ambiguous ways. Benefits include decision-making support, job satisfaction, efficiency, performance and accuracy. Risks involve deteriorated workplace relationships, loss of autonomy, privacy concerns and unreliability. Ambiguous effects relate to mental health dynamics, skills and workload. Some of such effects impact WMH directly, while others configure as indirect pathways. Originality/value-Despite AI's growing workplace presence, its effects on WMH are underexplored. This systematic literature review fills that gap by synthetizing current knowledge through complementarity and substitution lenses, outlining that both complementarity and substitution views can lead to risks and advantages for WMH. It reveals a research focus on healthcare, with psychology and business fields less studied, and offers theoretical insights, practical implications and future research directions on the direct and indirect effects of AI on WMH.","[Ferrarini, Filippo; Leonelli, Simona] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Marco Biagi Dept Econ, Reggio Emilia, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Ferrarini, F (corresponding author), Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Marco Biagi Dept Econ, Reggio Emilia, Italy.",filippo.ferrarini@unimore.it; simona.leonelli@unimore.it,"Leonelli, Simona/G-6927-2018; FERRARINI, FILIPPO/GON-7399-2022","Leonelli, Simona/0000-0001-8199-4585; FERRARINI, FILIPPO/0000-0002-9091-1056",,,,90,0,0,5,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0263-5577,1758-5783,IND MANAGE DATA SYST,Ind.

During the operational phase, well integrity monitoring and control is intended to reduce the risk of failures from degradation mechanisms so as to understand, mitigate and eliminate them. In addition to fault detection, it is important to develop means to predict and avoid critical faults and barrier degradation mechanisms. One of the current concerns in the oil and gas industry is the concept of well life extension (LE) and predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of the barriers to establish the premise for well life extension. The aim is to save on drilling expenditure on new wells while increasing reservoir extraction, prolonging the revenue stream. The decisions on whether to extend the life of existing wells or to plug and abandon them depend on both the well integrity status and the economic outlook. However, solid well integrity and barrier failure risk reduction must be the underpinning criteria during life extension to ensure human safety, a clean environment and safeguard from capital loss. In this review we investigate the current state of the art in well integrity management across the industry ranging from operator practices to regulations, with the aim of identifying industry knowledge gaps within well integrity practices and management from both operators and regulators. We also investigate some emerging technologies in well barrier monitoring and failure prediction. Special focus is on well integrity management in fields in their late life with respect to well barrier failure prognosis and life extension decision analysis to maximise asset value.","[Semwogerere, David; Sangesland, Sigbjorn; Pavlov, Alexey] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geosci & Petr, Trondheim, Norway; [Vatn, Jorn] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Trondheim, Norway; [Colombo, Danilo] Petrobras SA, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Petrobras,"Semwogerere, D (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geosci & Petr, Trondheim, Norway.",david.semwogerere@ntnu.no,,"Semwogerere, David/0009-0000-0830-6627",,,,164,3,3,4,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2949-8929,2949-8910,GEOENERGY SCI ENG,Geoenergy Sci.

This systematic review aims to synthesize current research on serious games in STEM education, evaluating their impact and identifying implications for educators, policymakers, and future research.Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted across Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore databases, yielding 584 articles. A total of 37 peer-reviewed journal articles met the inclusion criteria, guided by the PICOS framework, which focused on studies reporting the use of serious games in STEM education contexts. Data extraction included study characteristics, game types, participant demographics, educational contexts, and reported outcomes.Analysis The selected studies were analyzed to assess the effectiveness of serious games in enhancing learning outcomes, engagement, and performance in STEM education. The analysis also explored challenges related to the implementation of serious games, including technological limitations, the need for comprehensive educator training, and ethical considerations around data privacy, all of which may impact adoption in educational settings.Results Serious games demonstrated a positive impact on learning outcomes, such as knowledge acquisition, skill retention, and the application of STEM concepts, along with increased student engagement and motivation. These findings suggest that serious games can serve as valuable tools for educators seeking to foster active learning environments. For policymakers, the results indicate a need for strategic investments in technology infrastructure, teacher training, and curriculum integration to maximize the benefits of serious games in STEM education. However, significant limitations were identified, including technological barriers, variability in study quality, and the need for sustained educator support, which may impact generalizability and implementation.Conclusion This review highlights the transformative potential of serious games as tools for STEM education but emphasizes the importance of addressing key challenges to realize their full benefits. For educators, implementing serious games requires alignment with curriculum goals and access to adequate training and resources. Policymakers are encouraged to support these efforts by providing financial resources and promoting frameworks for ethical, data-secure use of serious games in education. Future research should focus on establishing a globally recognized framework for serious games in STEM, conducting longitudinal studies to evaluate long-term impacts, and exploring diverse educational contexts to ensure inclusive and effective integration.","[Tene, Talia] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Chem, Loja, Ecuador; [Lopez, Diego Fabian Vique; Aguirre, Paulina Elizabeth Valverde] Escuela Super Politecn Chimborazo ESPOCH, Fac Ciencias, Riobamba, Ecuador; [Oviedo, Nilo Israel Cabezas] Escuela Super Politecn Chimborazo ESPOCH, Fac Ciencias Pecuarias, Riobamba, Ecuador; [Gomez, Cristian Vacacela; Bellucci, Stefano] INFN Lab Nazl Frascati, Frascati, Italy",Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja; Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN),"Gomez, CV; Bellucci, S (corresponding author), INFN Lab Nazl Frascati, Frascati, Italy.",vacacela@lnf.infn.it; bellucci@lnf.infn.it,"Aguirre, Paulina/HZM-5542-2023; Tene, Talia/JCE-0404-2023",,Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja [POA_VIN-56],Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja,"The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Fresh ginger possesses the ability to effectively stimulate movement within the body, alleviate the act of vomiting, induce sweating, and provide relief for external syndromes. Dried ginger possesses both defensive and stimulant characteristics, which effectively raise the internal temperature and enhance the Yang energy. Fresh ginger is more hydrating than dried ginger, highly skilled at heating the Middle-jiao, alleviating pain, halting bleeding, and managing diarrhea. Dried ginger possesses the ability to alleviate coldness when consumed in a heated form, as well as to alleviate diarrhea when consumed in a heated form. It thrives in warm conditions and has a tendency to revert back to its warm nature. The moisture content of baked ginger is inferior to that of dried ginger, but it is highly effective in alleviating pain, bleeding, and diarrhea by warming the Middle-jiao. Ginger charcoal and stir-fried charcoal, produced through carbonization, have excellent heat retention properties and are effective in warming meridians and stopping bleeding. The potency and ability to spread of roasted ginger is less intense compared to fresh ginger, and its moisture content is not as low as that of dried ginger. The medicinal characteristics of this substance are gentle, making it beneficial for alleviating vomiting in patients who are physically frail. Its primary mode of action is on the Middle-jiao. Nevertheless, the main chemical compositions of various traditional Chinese medicines are nearly identical due to their shared base element. Ginger, in particular, possesses a range of pharmacological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, and anticoagulant properties. However, modern pharmacological research has not fully acknowledged the clinical medicinal value of ginger and consequently, fails to provide accurate guidance for clinical medication. This situation has a negative impact on the contemporary advancement of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The research on modernizing ginger is conducted by analyzing and considering the prospects. It is based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory and incorporates the comprehensive perspective of TCM philosophy. In order to modernize ginger, it is essential to have a proper knowledge of the concepts of recognizing nature by efficacy, homology, and mutual expression of nature and efficacy and rationally utilizing modern drug research technology. By applying these principles, we can construct a bridge towards the advancement of ginger.","[Zhang, Cheng; Tan, Xiuchi; Long, Jiaxin; Wang, Xinyue] Chengdu Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Pharm, Chengdu 611137, Peoples R China; [Chen, Cui; Li, Yuqing; Cai, Junjie; Huang, Jiquan; Li, Chuwen; Dang, Yuanye] Guangzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 5, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Mol Target & Clin Pharmacol, Guangzhou 511436, Peoples R China; [Chen, Cui; Li, Yuqing; Cai, Junjie; Huang, Jiquan; Li, Chuwen; Dang, Yuanye] Guangzhou Med Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, NMPA, Guangzhou 511436, Peoples R China; [Chen, Cui; Li, Yuqing; Cai, Junjie; Huang, Jiquan; Li, Chuwen; Dang, Yuanye] Guangzhou Med Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, State Key Lab, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Rao, Anyang] Hongxing Town Govt Ruoergai Cty, Aba Tibetan & Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Chengdu 624504, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Hua] Univ Macau, Inst Chinese Med Sci, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Macau 999078, Peoples R China",Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Guangzhou Medical University; Guangzhou Medical University; Guangzhou Medical University; University of Macau,"Li, CW; Dang, YY (corresponding author), Guangzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 5, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Mol Target & Clin Pharmacol, Guangzhou 511436, Peoples R China.;Li, CW; Dang, YY (corresponding author), Guangzhou Med Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, NMPA, Guangzhou 511436, Peoples R China.;Li, CW; Dang, YY (corresponding author), Guangzhou Med Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, State Key Lab, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Luo, H (corresponding author), Univ Macau, Inst Chinese Med Sci, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Macau 999078, Peoples R China.",hualuo@um.edu.mo; lichuwen@gzhmu.edu.cn; dangyuanye@163.com,"LUO, HUA/AAU-7254-2021; Li, Chuwen/AAP-2187-2021","LUO, HUA/0000-0002-9710-6084;","Educational Commission of Guangdong Province, China","Educational Commission of Guangdong Province, China",Not applicable.,80,14,17,9,38,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1749-8546,,CHIN MED-UK,Chin.

The CW contains different types and proportions of polysaccharides, proteins, phenolic compounds, and minerals in their macromolecular structure that influence the rate and extent of fiber digestion and selective retention of particulate matter due to its physical characteristics (buoyancy and comminuting) in the reticulorumen. The biosynthetic formation of the CW dictates possible manipulation mechanisms (targeted plant and microbes selection) and processing methods (physical, chemical, microbial, and enzymatic treatments and the use of genetically engineered bacteria) to increase its digestibility, leading to better utilization of the CW by the ruminant animal and hopefully lower the contribution of ruminants' greenhouse gas emissions. Early studies on lignin biosynthesis have led to more advanced studies focusing on replacing traditional monolignols with homopolymers that are easier to deconstruct or degrade. Concurrently, laboratory methods must be developed, evaluated, and modified to accurately reflect the digestibility and nutritive value of CW brought about by modern manipulation mechanisms or processing methods. However, the laboratory methods must also be reliable, precise, feasible, trivial, easy to implement, and cost-effective, but at the same time environmentally friendly and aware. For instance, although the acid detergent lignin has been demonstrated to behave uniformly as a nutritional entity, its chemical determination and association with carbohydrates still lack consensus. Spectroscopy (near-infrared and Raman) and in vitro gas production techniques have been adopted to assess plant chemical composition and nutritive value, but an incomplete understanding of the impacts caused by disrupting the CW for sample processing still exists. Different variations of multicompartmental and time- and age-dependent mathematical models have been proposed to determine the ruminal rates of degradation and passage of fiber. However, low-quality and incomplete data due to inconsistent marker results used to determine passage rates and transit time of fiber in the gastrointestinal tract have hindered advancements and adoptions of the next generation of computer models to understand ruminal fiber degradation. Lay Summary The underlying principles of forage cell wall utilization by ruminants have been known for over 50 years, but a significant amount of knowledge of the structure and synthesis of critical components of the plant cell wall, mechanisms and methods to alter its digestibility, and assessment techniques to quantify its components as well as their fermentability has been accumulated in the last 30 years. Such knowledge has even allowed us to make recommendations about the importance of fiber in the diet to improve animal performance and welfare. For instance, some industries (especially the paper mill and biofuels) have attained significant advancements toward modifying plant lignin (a critical component of the cell wall that reduces fermentability) and lignin-degrading microorganisms that could assist the animal nutrition community in increasing the digestibility of forage cell wall without further pretreatment. There are many techniques and technologies available to increase cell wall digestibility and, consequently, animal productivity. However, each has potential and limitations, and when used alone, it may not yield the best outcome. From a ruminant nutrition perspective, combining such techniques and technologies with the next generation of mathematical models seems more likely to yield significant improvements in forage cell wall digestibility. In the last 30 years, the scientific community has gained a much better understanding of plant cell wall biosynthesis and how to manipulate it to favor its utilization by ruminant animals. Furthermore, we have developed many innovative and advanced mechanisms to improve the prediction of the cell wall's digestibility.","[Tedeschi, Luis O.; Adams, Jordan M.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Anim Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Vieira, Ricardo A.

In this review, we analyse different methods of sewage sludge treatment in terms of potential environmental risk and raw materials recovery. The review begins with a comparison and assessment of existing reviews on this topic. Then, it focuses on the properties and current utilisation of sewage sludge in agriculture and a brief description of sludge thermal treatment methods (mono-and co-incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification). The final part of the review is devoted to technologies for treating sludge ash from mono-incinerators to recover phosphorus, a substance listed as a critical raw material by the EU. Our results show that direct use of sewage sludge likewise composts containing sewage sludge should no longer be considered as a direct source of nutrients and organic matter in agriculture, because of its pollutant content. Co-incineration and landfilling represent a dead-end in sludge treatment due to the loss of raw materials, whereas pyrolysis is sustainable for remote locations with low heavy metal content sludge. Heavy metals also pose a problem for the direct use of sludge ash and must be therefore removed. There are already sludge ash processing technologies that are capable of processing ash to form a variety of raw materials such as phosphorus. These regeneration approaches are currently in their infancy, but are gradually being introduced. The sewage sludge treatment industry is rapidly evolving, and we have attempted to summarise and discuss the current state of knowledge in this review, which will provide a baseline towards the future of sewage sludge suitable treatment.","[Husek, Matej; Mosko, Jaroslav; Pohorely, Michael] Univ Chem & Technol, Dept Power Engn, Fac Environm Technol, Tech 5, Prague 16628 6, Czech Republic; [Husek, Matej; Mosko, Jaroslav; Pohorely, Michael] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Chem Proc Fundamentals, Rozvojova 135, Prague 16502 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic","University of Chemistry & Technology, Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Chemical Process Fundamentals of the Czech Academy of Sciences","Pohorely, M (corresponding author), Univ Chem & Technol, Dept Power Engn, Fac Environm Technol, Tech 5, Prague 16628 6, Czech Republic.",michael.pohorely@vscht.cz,"Pohořelý, Michael/H-3505-2014; Husek, Matej/JHU-4457-2023; Moško, Jaroslav/AAC-1167-2021","Pohořelý, Michael/0000-0001-8803-8131; Husek, Matej/0000-0002-5658-205X; Moško, Jaroslav/0000-0002-4371-6661","Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic [QK21020022]; Czech Academy of Sciences AV 21 Sustainable energy, and Specific university research-grant [A1_FTOP_2022_001, A2_FTOP_2022_003]","Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Agriculture, Czech Republic); Czech Academy of Sciences AV 21 Sustainable energy, and Specific university research-grant","This work was supported by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic -project QK21020022, Czech Academy of Sciences AV 21 Sustainable energy, and Specific university research -grant No. A1_FTOP_2022_001 and No. A2_FTOP_2022_003.",180,107,119,27,339,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Crop rotation represents a crucial agricultural practice for maintaining soil sustain-ability and promoting long-term soil health. Well-designed crop rotation systems can effectively maintain soil fertility, enhance agricultural resource utilization efficiency, and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, thereby generating significant ecological and economic benefits. The integration of legume green manure into rotations offers particular promise due to its nitrogen fixing capacity and soil health benefits. However, owing to the inherent complexity of soil systems and their multifunctionality, a comprehensive theoretical framework for soil carbon sequestration and emission reduction within legume green manure rotation systems remains to be established. This review systematically examines the impact of legume green manure on key factors and processes controlling soil carbon dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions within rotation systems. We synthesize current knowledge on the underlying mechanisms and identify critical research gaps. Future research should focus on the following key aspects to advance our understanding and application of legume green manure in rotation systems: (i) clarifying the synergistic physico-chemical-biological mechanisms of soil carbon sequestration mediated by legume green manure; (ii) investigating the impact of legume green manure on carbon sequestration and emission reduction in deep soil layers; (iii) enhancing quantitative analysis of carbon-nitrogen cycling dynamics using advanced techniques like isotope tracing; (iv) conducting comparative studies on regional variations in the effects of legume green manure; and (v) advancing mechanization and precision management technologies for legume green manure integration.","[Wang, Xiaoli; Wang, Yulong; Nan, Yunyou; Yu, Aizhong; Zhao, Cai; Yin, Wen; Hu, Falong; Zhang, Huanhuan; Chai, Qiang; Fan, Zhilong] Gansu Agr Univ, Coll Agron, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoli; Wang, Yulong; Nan, Yunyou; Yu, Aizhong; Zhao, Cai; Yin, Wen; Hu, Falong; Zhang, Huanhuan; Chai, Qiang; Fan, Zhilong] Gansu Agr Univ, State Key Lab Aridland Crop Sci, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China",Gansu Agricultural University; Gansu Agricultural University,"Fan, ZL (corresponding author), Gansu Agr Univ, Coll Agron, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.;Fan, ZL (corresponding author), Gansu Agr Univ, State Key Lab Aridland Crop Sci, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",fanzl@gsau.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [32160765]; National Green Manure Industry Technology System [CARS-22-G12]; Major Special Projects of Sci-ence and Technology in Gansu Province [24ZDNA008],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Green Manure Industry Technology System; Major Special Projects of Sci-ence and Technology in Gansu Province,"This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32160765) , the National Green Manure Industry Technology System (CARS-22-G12) , the Major Special Projects of Sci-ence and Technology in Gansu Province (24ZDNA008) .",102,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2666-1543,,J AGR FOOD RES,J.

Electricity, typically generated by burning fossil fuels, remains essential but is also a major source of environmental harm. Hydrogen presents a promising alternative energy vector, capable of replacing traditional electricity generation methods and serving as an efficient energy storage medium. Among available technologies, water electrolyzers are among the most competitive systems for hydrogen production, as they emit no harmful pollutants during operation. However, hydrogen production requires energy input, and renewable sources particularly solar power offer one of the cleanest pathways for this purpose. Like other renewables, solar energy is intermittent, and such fluctuations can affect the stability and efficiency of hydrogen production systems. Directly coupling solar PV with electrolyzers offers potential cost benefits by eliminating converters and reducing conversion losses, but it also presents challenges in terms of system stability and the long-term durability of the electrolyzer. Currently, beyond conventional ground-mounted systems, alternative photovoltaic (PV) configurations are gaining attention, including floating PV (FPV), agrivoltaic PV, and building-integrated PV systems. FPV, in particular, is gaining momentum due to its close proximity to water sources, which facilitates integration with electrolyzers. Offshore FPV systems can be potential by supporting solar-powered desalination to purify seawater for electrolysis. At the gigawatt scale or above of solar-powered hydrogen production, several challenges emerge, including land use constraints, high material costs, and limited availability of resources. While electrolyzer durability is generally well understood, their long-term performance under fluctuating solar input whether through direct or indirect coupling remains under-researched, representing a significant gap in the current body of knowledge.","[Ghosh, Aritra] Univ Exeter, Fac Environm Sci & Econ ESE, Renewable Energy Elect & Elect Engn, Penryn, England",University of Exeter,"Ghosh, A (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Fac Environm Sci & Econ ESE, Renewable Energy Elect & Elect Engn, Penryn, England.",a.ghosh@exeter.ac.uk,"Ghosh, Aritra/AGU-0899-2022","Ghosh, Aritra/0000-0001-9409-7592",,,,239,9,9,26,31,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",2367-198X,,SOL RRL,Sol.

The traditional edible oil refining processes, including hydration degumming, alkaline refining, adsorption decolorization and distillation deodorization, are designed to remove these components to improve the nutritional quality and storage safety of the oil. Whereas, their drawbacks, such as the use of chemical substances, wastewater production, neutral oil and micronutrients loss, toxic compounds production, and high energy consumption, have become the growing concerns for the reconstruction of eco-friendly and energy-efficient edible oils processing chains. Applications of physically assisted methods, new materials or enzymes provide alternative options for developing novel edible oil processing technologies. This literature review systematically summarized the characteristics of the undesirable components in crude vegetable oils and concluded with an overview of the research progress on removal strategies, with a special focus on elucidating the current applications and future developments for the removal of phosphatides, FFAs, pigments, oxidation products and toxic contaminants such as mycotoxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Compared with the traditional edible oil refining technologies, the novel methods, such as enzymatic reaction, membrane filtration, adsorption separation, and physical-assist technologies (ultrasound, microwave, and high-voltage electrostatic field), are expected to effectively address the shortcomings of the conventional methods, which are the driving force for achieving the energy saving and eco-friendly manufacturing of high-quality edible oils. Whereas, more efforts are encouraged to bridge the knowledge gap between their practical application and theoretical basis, thus paving the way for their large-scale mature industrial application.","[Lv, Yaping; Ye, Zhan; Luo, Shufan; Xiong, Yuanyi; Liu, Yuanfa] Jiangnan Univ, State Key Lab Food Sci & Resources, 1800 Lihu Rd, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lv, Yaping; Ye, Zhan; Luo, Shufan; Xiong, Yuanyi; Liu, Yuanfa] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Food Sci & Technol, 1800 Lihu Rd, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ye, Zhan; Liu, Yuanfa] Jiangnan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Food Safety & Qual Control, 1800 Lihu Rd, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ye, Zhan; Liu, Yuanfa] Jiangnan Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Funct Food, 1800 Lihu Rd, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zuqing] EverWin Cereals & Oils Co Ltd, 66 Jiuchikan, Chongqing, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University; Jiangnan University; Jiangnan University; Jiangnan University,"Lv, YP; Ye, Z; Liu, YF (corresponding author), Jiangnan Univ, Sch Food Sci & Technol, 1800 Lihu Rd, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",7210112040@stu.jiangnan.edu.cn; yezhan@jiangnan.edu.cn; yfliu@jiangnan.edu.cn,"Yuanfa, Liu/ABH-9944-2020; xiong, yuanyi/NCV-6653-2025; Ye, Zhan/AAD-7081-2020","Yaping, Lv/0000-0003-1521-6026; Ye, Zhan/0000-0001-6945-7728","National Key R&D Program of China [2023YFD2100400, 2021YFD2100300]; Key R&D Program of Shandong Province [2023TZXD010]; Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province [2021CXGC010808]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [JUSRP123045]",National Key R&D Program of China; Key R&D Program of Shandong Province; Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"Acknowledgements This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2023YFD2100400 and 2021YFD2100300) , the Key R&D Program of Shandong Province (2023TZXD010) , Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province (2021CXGC010808) , the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (JUSRP123045) .",159,10,10,29,116,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,J CLEAN PROD,J.

The use of inappropriate infrastructure and inappropriate handling protocols poses food safety and health-related risks. This review provides evidence for the link between drying and storage operations in the context of preserving grain quality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the close grain quality relationship between drying and storage, with an appraisal of operations in Africa. This study further benchmarked successful and scalable models in Africa to infer guidance for promotion of optimal and effective drying and storage initiatives. While open-sun drying is undoubtedly the most adopted approach to grain drying for the rural-poor farmers, this study revealed greater success in grain storage, especially with the breakthrough at the introduction and adoption of small-scale hermetic storage technologies. Upon assessment of the cob, WFP Zero Food Loss Initiative, and AflaSight models implemented in Rwanda and Uganda, this study suggests: (i) the adoption of system thinking; (ii) the use of sustainable approaches such as gender inclusion, sustainable financing options, and use of existing infrastructures along-side novel interventions; and (iii) enabling policies and political will as strategic pathways for successful implementation of improved grain-quality interventions during drying and storage. In the short term, grain handlers must develop appropriate grain management protocols during open-sun drying to limit the impact of drying-related grain quality deterioration. Consortia-based implementation of the three models evaluated in this review could improve grain quality, food security and safety, and market linkages with premium grain markets, fostering economic growth and transformation.","[Baidhe, Emmanuel; Clementson, Clairmont L.; Senyah, Judith; Hammed, Ademola] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, Fargo, ND 58108 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo,"Clementson, CL (corresponding author), North Dakota State Univ, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, Fargo, ND 58108 USA.",emmanuel.baidhe@ndsu.edu; clairmont.clementson@ndsu.edu; judith.senyah@ndsu.edu; ademola.hammed@ndsu.edu,"Hammed, Ademola Monsur/H-9609-2019","Hammed, Ademola Monsur/0000-0003-2170-6128","U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture [7005039]; U.S. Department of Agriculture","U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This research was supported in part by the intramural research program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch #7005039.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the combined use of semaglutide and basal insulin in individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP) were searched to identify relevant publications. The primary outcome measure was the change in HbA1c levels. Secondary outcome measures encompassed change in body weight, fluctuations in FPG levels, occurrence of adverse events, serious adverse events, hypoglycemic episodes, and gastrointestinal reactions including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Mean differences (MDs) and relative risk (RR) with confidence intervals (CI) of 95 % were used to analyze the deference. Results: 7 RCTs with 2354 patients were incorporated into the study. Compared to placebo or other active treatment, the addition of semaglutide to basal insulin demonstrated significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) [mean differences (MD): -1.17 %, P < 0.00001], body weight [MD -5.99 kg, P < 0.00001], and fasting blood glucose (FPG) [MD -1.08 %, P < 0.00001]. No evidence indicated a higher risk of adverse events [RR 1.46, P = 0.13]. However, it did result in increased rates of gastrointestinal adverse events, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Conclusions: The combination treatment of semaglutide and basal insulin demonstrates significant improvements in glycemic control and reduction in body weight, without an increased risk of hypoglycemia.

Green or renewable hydrogen, synthesized through water electrolysis, has emerged as a sustainable alternative for fossil fuels in energy-intensive sectors such as aluminum, cement, chemicals, steel, and transportation. However, the scalability of green hydrogen production faces challenges including infrastructure gaps, energy losses, excessive power consumption, and high costs throughout the value chain. Therefore, this study analyzes the challenges within the green hydrogen value chain, focusing on the development of nascent technologies. Presenting a comprehensive synthesis of contemporary knowledge, this study assesses the potential impacts of green hydrogen on hard-to-abate sectors, emphasizing the expansion of clean energy infrastructure. Through an exploration of emerging renewable hydrogen technologies, the study investigates aspects such as economic feasibility, sustainability assessments, and the achievement of carbon neutrality. Additionally, considerations extend to the potential for large-scale renewable electricity storage and the realization of net-zero goals. The findings of this study suggest that emerging technologies have the potential to significantly increase green hydrogen production, offering affordable solutions for decarbonization. The study affirms that global-scale green hydrogen production could satisfy up to 24% of global energy needs by 2050, resulting in the abatement of 60 gigatons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions - equivalent to 6% of total cumulative CO2 emission reductions. To comprehensively evaluate the impact of the hydrogen economy on ecosystem decarbonization, this article analyzes the feasibility of three business models that emphasize choices for green hydrogen production and delivery. Finally, the study proposes potential directions for future research on hydrogen valleys, aiming to foster interconnected hydrogen ecosystems.","[Jayachandran, M.] Puducherry Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Pondicherry 605014, India; [Gatla, Ranjith Kumar] Inst Aeronaut Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hyderabad 500043, India; [Flah, Aymen] Univ Gabes, Natl Engn Sch Gabes, Energy Proc Environm & Elect Syst Unit, Gabes 6029, Tunisia; [Flah, Aymen] Middle East Univ, MEU Res Unit, Amman 11831, Jordan; [Flah, Aymen] Univ Business & Technol UBT, Coll Engn, Dept Business Adm, Jeddah 21448, Saudi Arabia; [Flah, Aymen] Univ Gabes, Private Higher Sch Appl Sci & Technol Gabes, Gabes 6029, Tunisia; [Milyani, Ahmad H.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Milyani, Hisham M.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Appl Coll, Dept Business Adm, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Blazek, Vojtech; Prokop, Lukas] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, ENET Ctr, Ostrava 70800, Czech Republic; [Kraiem, Habib] Northern Border Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Ar Ar 91431, Saudi Arabia",Pondicherry Engineering College; Universite de Gabes; Middle East University; University of Business & Technology; Universite de Gabes; King Abdulaziz University; King Abdulaziz University; Technical University of Ostrava; Northern Border University,"Jayachandran, M (corresponding author), Puducherry Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Pondicherry 605014, India.;Flah, A (corresponding author), Univ Gabes, Natl Engn Sch Gabes, Energy Proc Environm & Elect Syst Unit, Gabes 6029, Tunisia.;Flah, A (corresponding author), Middle East Univ, MEU Res Unit, Amman 11831, Jordan.;Flah, A (corresponding author), Univ Business & Technol UBT, Coll Engn, Dept Business Adm, Jeddah 21448, Saudi Arabia.;Flah, A (corresponding author), Univ Gabes, Private Higher Sch Appl Sci & Technol Gabes, Gabes 6029, Tunisia.",jayachandran.escet@pec.edu; aymen.flah@enig.u-gabes.tn,"M, JAYACHANAN/AAD-5011-2020; Gatla, Ranjith kumar/G-4398-2016; kraiem, habib/GRX-0771-2022; Prokop, Lukáš/AGV-0824-2022; Milyani, Ahmad/AAX-6538-2020; Blazek, Vojtech/GLT-8776-2022; Aymen, Flah/C-3583-2012","M, JAYACHANAN/0000-0002-9819-3642; Gatla, Ranjith kumar/0000-0003-2154-3285; Prokop, Lukáš/0000-0003-0495-5499; Blazek, Vojtech/0000-0003-0508-8518;",National Centre for Energy II,National Centre for Energy II,No Statement Available,189,73,80,50,124,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12.0,,,,,23363,23388,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3363869,0.0,,26,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,IB8Z9,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001163968000001,0

Clinical data from 35 cases who had extranodal RDD with ocular involvement were collected for analysis, including 5 cases diagnosed at our hospital and 30 reported in the literature which searched via PubMed, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), and WanFang Data database from database creation to April 2023. Lesion location, clinical presentation, pathological presentation, treatment modality, follow-up time, and prognosis were recorded. circle RESULTS: Lesions of five cases were located in the orbit, eyelid, lacrimal gland, or conjunctiva. The main presenting features were proptosis, eyelid swelling, and conjunctival hyperemia with decreased vision. Four patients underwent surgical resection, one received surgery and adjunctive immunosuppression, and none experienced recurrence during follow-up. A total of 30 cases were retrieved from the literature. The mean age was 41.4y, and 66.7% were male. The lacrimal gland and conjunctiva/subconjunctiva were the most commonly affected sites (each 20.0%). Most patients received surgical management (50.0%) or immunosuppressive therapy (20.0%). Only one recurrence (3.3%) was reported during follow-up. circle CONCLUSION: When symptoms like ocular protrusion and visual acuity loss occur, RDD should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The diagnosis of RDD primarily depends on pathological histology, which serves as the key basis for confirmation. Although RDD generally has a favorable prognosis, long-term follow-up of patients is still essential to closely monitor for potential recurrence.","[Li, Jing; Yang, Run-Zi; Liu, Rui; Wang, Nan; Xu, Liang-Yuan; Guo, Qi-Han; Ren, Ting-Ting; Ma, Jian-Min] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Tongren Hosp, Beijing Inst Ophthalmol, Beijing Tongren Eye Ctr, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Mao, Mei-Ling] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Tongren Hosp, Pathol Dept, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China",Capital Medical University; Capital Medical University,"Ma, JM (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Beijing Tongren Eye Ctr, Beijing Tongren Hosp, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China.",jmma@sina.com,,,Beijing Science and Technology Rising Star Program-Cross-Cooperation Project [20220484218]; Beijing Hospitals Authority Clinical Medicine Development of Special Funding Support [ZLRK202503]; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing [7222025],Beijing Science and Technology Rising Star Program-Cross-Cooperation Project; Beijing Hospitals Authority Clinical Medicine Development of Special Funding Support; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing(Beijing Natural Science Foundation),Supported by Beijing Science and Technology Rising Star Program-Cross-Cooperation Project (No.20220484218) ; Beijing Hospitals Authority Clinical Medicine Development of Special Funding Support (ZLRK202503) ; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing (No.7222025) .,45,0,0,0,0,IJO PRESS,XI AN,"NO 269 YOUYI EAST RD, XI AN, 710054, PEOPLES R CHINA",2222-3959,2227-4898,INT J OPHTHALMOL-CHI,Int.

Consequently, there has been a persistent need to enhance their efficiency and performance. The water-injected six-stroke engine is based on conventional four-stroke engines, producing additional power by injecting water into the hot combustion products during the expansion stroke, thereby increasing the overall engine efficiency. However, a comprehensive review that consolidates existing knowledge and identifies future research opportunities in six-stroke engine technology is lacking. This study addresses this gap by thoroughly examining the thermodynamic operation of six-stroke engines and analyzing the impact of water injection on engine performance. The review covers literature from 1994 to 2023, categorizing studies based on the modeling approach, working fluid, thermodynamic cycle, and consideration of heat transfer. Among the 18 analyzed articles, predominantly published from 2015 to 2019, half utilize analytical models, while the rest employ experimental models addressing heat transfer losses. Notably, water injection exhibits a substantial influence, manifesting as a 5.18% increase in brake power and a 1.55% enhancement in thermal efficiency, particularly with acetylene as the working fluid. Finally, a literature overview of water injection in hot gas environments within the engine cylinder was conducted in addition to a preliminary thermodynamic analysis of the Otto and Diesel cycles to compare different configurations outlined in the literature. The lack of studies, experimental setups, and non-idealized models that consider factors such as heat transfer or water evaporation during injection is evident. By critically synthesizing the available literature, this study offers valuable insights into the potential advantages, limitations, and prospects of six-stroke engine studies.","[Mejia-Gallon, V.; Gomez, S.; Grisales, D.

The excessive utilization of plastics leads to the accumulation of such recalcitrant pollutants in the environment. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, unprecedented demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, face masks, and gloves made up of single-use items has resulted in the massive generation of plastic biomedical waste. As secondary pollutants, microplastic particles (<5 mm) are derived from pellet loss and degradation of macroplastics. Therefore, urgent intervention is required for the management of these hazardous materials. Physicochemical approaches have been employed to degrade synthetic polymers, but these approaches have limited efficiency and cause the release of hazardous metabolites or by-products into the environment. Therefore, bioremediation is a proper option as it is both cost-efficient and environmentally friendly. On the other hand, plants evolved lignocellulose to be resistant to destruction, whereas insects, such as wood-feeding termites, possess diverse microorganisms in their guts, which confer physiological and ecological benefits to their host. Plastic and lignocellulose polymers share a number of physical and chemical properties, despite their structural and recalcitrance differences. Among these similarities are a hydrophobic nature, a carbon skeleton, and amorphous/crystalline regions. Compared with herbivorous mammals, lignocellulose digestion in termites is accomplished at ordinary temperatures. This unique characteristic has been of great interest for the development of a plastic biodegradation approach by termites and their gut symbionts. Therefore, transferring knowledge from research on lignocellulosic degradation by termites and their gut symbionts to that on synthetic polymers has become a new research hotspot and technological development direction to solve the environmental bottleneck caused by synthetic plastic polymers.","[Al-Tohamy, Rania; Ali, Sameh S.; Zhang, Meng; Sun, Jianzhong] Jiangsu Univ, Biofuels Inst, Sch Environmnt & Safety Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China; [Ali, Sameh S.; Mahmoud, Yehia A.

However, their broad use has been impeded by the performance, durability, and efficiency limitations of PEMFCs. A better knowledge of the compositions and architectures of PEMFCs may lead to enhancement in their durability and efficiency. The design, engineering, and well-architectured composite membranes retain water content in the polymer matrices and reduce the ohmic losses while operating at elevated temperatures. Researchers have been working on composite polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) in recent years to overcome the challenging issues currently faced in commercializing PEM technology. Achieving effective operations at higher working temperatures while retaining the physical and chemical characteristics of PEMs is one of the critical challenges. Herein, we outline the critical requirements for the composite membranes, molecular dynamic simulations, functional characteristics, and challenges that prevent the commercial application of PEMs for PEMFCs. More recent studies have focused on improving PEMs by composite material changes to address shortcomings in proton conductivity and stability. In this review, we delve into some of the latest innovations in PEMFC membranes, focusing on hybrid membranes that combine various inorganic, organic, and hybrid fillers with pristine polymeric membranes, such as Nafion, sulfonated polysulfone, polyaniline, polybenzimidazole, etc. This review also evaluates the fundamental steps utilized to develop novel sustainable composite membranes and how they stack up against current standards in PEM fuel cells. Furthermore, challenges to overcome in the advancement of PEMs toward real-world applications and future prospective research paths are also proposed.","[Wani, Ajaz Ahmad; Kamarudin, Siti Kartom; Raduwan, Nor Fatina; Yusoff, Yusra Nadzirah] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Wani, Ajaz Ahmad; Khan, Amjad Mumtaz; Yousuf, Shariq] Aligarh Muslim Univ, Dept Chem, Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Shaari, Norazuwana] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fak Sains Dan Teknol, Pusat Penyelidikan Teknol Nukl, Bangi 43600, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Shaari, Norazuwana] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fak Sains dan Teknol, Fuel Cell Inst, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ansari, M.

The Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) is a vital region for national food security and global agricultural markets but is threatened by climate change, hydropower dams, sand mining, and excessive groundwater extraction. These pressures challenge the VMD's agricultural productivity and sustainability in the Anthropocene era. Despite efforts to foster resilience, there remains a critical gap in understanding how these agricultural transformations respond to environmental challenges. This review explores the multifaceted relationship between livelihood transformations and environmental pressures in the VMD, offering a comprehensive analysis of agricultural shifts over the past 50 years to identify viable adaptation pathways. Our review highlights that climate change-induced sea level rise and hydropower dam development both cause an increase in salinity intrusion, damage many agricultural lands and lead to substantial land use change and livelihood transformation, particularly in the floodplains and coastal areas. Additionally, sand mining has significantly influenced livelihood transitions in urban areas by causing riverbank erosion and leading to agricultural land losses. Furthermore, extensive groundwater extraction instigating land subsidence triggers land allocation, particularly in coastal zones. We emphasize the importance of adaptive management at both deltawide and farm-level scales, integrating stakeholder engagement with institutional improvements. This approach aims to address environmental impacts while pursuing a pathway incorporating nature-based solutions and smart technologies to enhance the sustainability of agricultural systems in the VMD under current and future environmental pressures. Our review provides a foundation for developing adaptive strategies that promote sustainable development and resilience in deltaic environments and share knowledge for similar deltas worldwide.","[Tran, Dung Duc; Park, Edward; Wang, Jingyu] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore; [Park, Edward; Lee, Janice] Nanyang Technol Univ, Earth Observ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Park, Edward; Lee, Janice] Nanyang Technol Univ, Asian Sch Environm, Singapore, Singapore; [Tran, Dung Duc] Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City VNU HCM, Inst Environm & Resources IER, Ctr Water Management & Climate Change WACC, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Loc, Ho Huu] Wageningen Univ, Earth Syst & Global Change Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Zhan, Shaohua] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Social Sci, Singapore, Singapore; [Kantoush, Sameh A.] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst DPRI, Kyoto, Japan",Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University; Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNUHCM) System; VNU-HCM Institute for Environment & Resources (VNUHCM-IER); Wageningen University & Research; Nanyang Technological University; Kyoto University,"Tran, DD; Park, E (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore.",ducdung.tran@nie.edu.sg; edward.park@nie.edu.sg,"Wang, Jingyu/AAB-7776-2021; Duc Tran, Dung/J-2496-2015; Lee, Janice Ser Huay/HTM-2431-2023; Park, Edward/JCD-7857-2023; Zhan, Shaohua/G-3634-2019","Wang, Jingyu/0000-0002-4841-0872; Duc Tran, Dung/0000-0003-2331-4996; Zhan, Shaohua/0000-0002-9996-8833","Ministry of Education, Singapore [2021-T1-001-056, MOE-T2EP402A20-0001, MOE-T2EP50222-0007, MOE-MOET32022-0006, NIE AcRF - RI 10/22 EP]; Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS) via the National Research Foundation Singapore; Singapore Ministry of Education under the Research Centres of Excellence initiative; Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) [TX2025-24-01]; [RG142/22]","Ministry of Education, Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS) via the National Research Foundation Singapore; Singapore Ministry of Education under the Research Centres of Excellence initiative(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM);","This research was supported by various grants from the Ministry of Education, Singapore, under its Academic Research #Tier 1 [RG142/22], #Tier 1 [2021-T1-001-056], #Tier 2 [MOE-T2EP402A20-0001], #Tier 2 [MOE-T2EP50222-0007], Tier3 Climate Transformation Programme - MOE-MOET32022-0006, NIE AcRF - RI 10/22 EP and the Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS) via its funding from the National Research Foundation Singapore and the Singapore Ministry of Education under the Research Centres of Excellence initiative.

Most of them are listed on the table of high-risk factors for malignancy, and metabolic disorders systematically or locally contribute to cancer progression and poor prognosis of patients. Importantly, adipose tissue is fundamental to the occurrence and development of these metabolic disorders. White adipose tissue stores excessive energy, while thermogenic fat including brown and beige adipose tissue dissipates energy to generate heat. In addition to thermogenesis, beige and brown adipocytes also function as dynamic secretory cells and a metabolic sink of nutrients, like glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids. Accordingly, strategies that activate and expand thermogenic adipose tissue offer therapeutic promise to combat overweight, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders through increasing energy expenditure and enhancing glucose tolerance. With a better understanding of its origins and biological functions and the advances in imaging techniques detecting thermogenesis, the roles of thermogenic adipose tissue in tumors have been revealed gradually. On the one hand, enhanced browning of subcutaneous fatty tissue results in weight loss and cancer-associated cachexia. On the other hand, locally activated thermogenic adipocytes in the tumor microenvironment accelerate cancer progression by offering fuel sources and is likely to develop resistance to chemotherapy.

Coated porous fertilizers (CPFs) using bio-polymers are a branch of slow/controlled release fertil-izers that have demonstrated a great deal of promise in the past 10 years to enhance performance in a range of technological applications. The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive assessment of research progress on CPFs, focusing on their design, release mechanisms, and potential role in sustainable agriculture par-ticularly nutrient use efficiency. To achieve this, a bibliometric approach was used to evaluate publication trends, research hotspots, and global collaboration patterns over the past decade, while a technical review examined coating materials, nutrient delivery systems, and release kinetics. Findings reveal that biodegradable polymers and bio-based materials used in CPF coatings significantly enhance nutrient use ef-ficiency by enabling controlled release and minimizing nutrient losses. Engineered porous structures further improve targeted delivery, reduce leaching, and extend nu-trient availability across crop growth stages. However, the analysis also highlights persistent challenges such as high production costs, formulation complexity, and the need for biosafety validation before widespread adoption. The implications of this study suggest that CPFs can play a pivotal role in addressing declining soil fertility and the environmental concerns linked to excessive use of conventional fertilizers. By integrating advances in materials science with agronomic practices, CPFs have the potential to contribute to global food security while promoting ecological sus-tainability. This review not only consolidates current knowledge but also identifies research gaps and practical bottlenecks, offering direction for future innovations in fertilizer technology.","[Kalita, Abreeta] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Chem, Coimbatore 641003, Tamil Nadu, India; [Vaid, Vasudha] MCM DAV Coll, Dept Chem, Kangra 176001, Himachal Prades, India",Tamil Nadu Agricultural University,"Kalita, A (corresponding author), Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Chem, Coimbatore 641003, Tamil Nadu, India.",abreetasweet84@gmail.com; vasudhavaid93@gmail.com,"Kalita, Abreeta/PIH-5520-2026",,,,,188,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0170-0839,1436-2449,POLYM BULL,Polym.

This systematic study sought to rigorously assess the applicability and efficacy of artificial intelligence (AI) models in the diagnosis, classification, and prediction of periodontal diseases. Methods: A web-based search was performed across many reputable databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Saudi Digital Library. Articles published between January 2000 and January 2025 were included in the search. Following the application of the inclusion criteria, 33 publications were selected for critical analysis utilizing QUADAS-2, and their certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE technique. Results: The primary applications of AI technology include the diagnosis, classification, and grading of periodontal diseases; diagnosis of gingivitis; evaluation of the radiographic alveolar bone level and degree of alveolar bone loss; and prediction of periodontal disease risk. The AI models utilized in these studies outperformed current clinical methods in diagnosing, classifying, and predicting periodontal diseases, demonstrating a superior level of precision and accuracy. Their accuracies ranged from 73% to 99.4%, their sensitivities from 75% to 100%, and their precisions from 56% to 99.5%. Conclusions: AI has a lot of potential to help with periodontal diagnosis and risk assessment. Its performance is often similar to or better than that of traditional clinical approaches. But before it can be used widely in clinical settings, problems with the quality of the dataset, its generalizability, its interpretability, and its acceptance by regulators must be solved. AI should be seen as a tool that helps doctors make better decisions and not as a way to replace their knowledge and skills.","[Jafer, Mohammed; Ibraheem, Wael; Dawood, Tazeen; Vishwanathaiah, Satish; Maganur, Prabhadevi C.] Jazan Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Prevent Dent Sci, Jazan 45142, Saudi Arabia; [Abbas, Ali; Hakami, Khalid] Jazan Univ, Coll Dent, Dent Intern, Jazan, Saudi Arabia; [Khurayzi, Turki; Aldosari, Mubarak] Riyadh Second Hlth Cluster, Dept Periodont, Riyadh 11176, Saudi Arabia; [Hakami, Abdullah J.] King Saud Univ, Dept Prosthet Dent Sci, Riyadh 11472, Saudi Arabia; [Alqahtani, Shahd] Princess Norah Bint Abdulrahman Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Periodont, Riyadh 11671, Saudi Arabia; [Ageely, Khaled] Minist Hlth, Jazan Hlth Cluster, Jazan 45142, Saudi Arabia; [Khanagar, Sanjeev B.] King Saud Bin Abdulaziz Univ Hlth Sci, Coll Dent, Prevent Dent Sci Dept, Riyadh 11426, Saudi Arabia; [Khanagar, Sanjeev B.] Minist Natl Guard Hlth Affairs, King Abdullah Int Med Res Ctr, Riyadh 11481, Saudi Arabia",Jazan University; Jazan University; King Saud University; Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University; King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences; King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences; Ministry of National Guard - Health Affairs,"Vishwanathaiah, S; Maganur, PC (corresponding author), Jazan Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Prevent Dent Sci, Jazan 45142, Saudi Arabia.",majafar@jazanu.edu.sa; wibraheem@jazanu.edu.sa; tsararsyed@jazanu.edu.sa; 202004672@stu.jazanu.edu.sa; 202004610@stu.jazanu.edu.sa; abdullah.dentist17@gmail.com; shahad20alqori@gmail.com; mubarkabdullah1393@gmail.com; khaledageely1991@gmail.com; khanagars@ksau-hs-edu.sa; svishwanathaiah@jazanu.edu.sa; cgowda@jazanu.edu.sa,"; Ibraheem, Wael/KHU-2957-2024","Hakami, Khalid/0009-0004-0175-2260; Aldosari, Mubarak/0009-0004-2838-4576; Ibraheem, Wael/0000-0003-0933-5459; Hakami, Abdullah J/0000-0003-3810-6882; vishwanathaiah, satish/0000-0002-8376-297X; Abbas, Ali/0009-0003-9861-1378; Khurayzi, Turki/0009-0001-6382-7684",,,,76,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4418,DIAGNOSTICS,Diagnostics,DEC 18,2025,15.0,24,,,,,,3247,10.3390/diagnostics15243247,0.0,,32,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,AG2LA,41464246.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001647398200001,0

They are essential to solve challenges posed by the need to reduce human impact on the environment. Modeling and simulation of materials behavior have been recognized over the years as fundamental as an asset in industrial R & D, guiding the decision-making process regarding the design or optimization of new products and manufacturing processes. At the same time, it reduces product cost and development time. However, highlighting the revenue brought by using such tools is not trivial, especially because they mainly affect the complex activities such as the innovation process, whose return only becomes available in the long run and it is difficult to measure. This means that the materials modeling field is often overlooked in an industry setting, where it is not integrated in the company workflow. In some cases, modeling provides the potential to capture tacit knowledge preventing the loss of capability in an aging specialist community, that why its industrial integration is important. This paper explores the reason behind this dichotomy, presenting first what it is intended for the modeling process, and the main types used in materials application. The current industrial adoption is reviewed by outlining success stories, economic impact, business uptake, and barriers. Past and current approaches and strategies are also presented and discussed. In prospective, materials modeling plays a key role in developing material-centric industry for sustainable economy, providing physical understating (physics-based models) and fast approaches (data-driven solutions). Digitalization is the mean for the green economy and it needs to push for a more integration at the core of the business of materials modeling.","[Scotti, Lucia; Basoalto, Hector; Cogswell, Daniel] Univ Sheffield, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Mappin St, Sheffield S1 3JD, England; [Moffat, James] Univ Manchester, Henry Royce Inst, Dept Mat, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, England",University of Sheffield; University of Manchester,"Scotti, L (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Mappin St, Sheffield S1 3JD, England.",luciascotti.ls@gmail.com; h.basoalto@sheffield.ac.uk; james.moffat@manchester.ac.uk; d.cogswell@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Cogswell, Daniel/0000-0002-3401-2371; Basoalto, Hector/0000-0002-2102-914X; Moffat, James/0000-0001-6752-2063","This work was supported by UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship [grant number MR/T02058X/1].

This review synthesizes current knowledge on stress-induced PFC plasticity, encompassing structural, functional, and molecular changes. We examine how chronic stress leads to dendritic atrophy, spine loss, and alterations in neuronal connectivity within the PFC, particularly affecting the medial PFC. These structural changes are accompanied by disruptions in neurotransmitter systems, most notably glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling, and alterations in synaptic plasticity mechanisms. At the molecular level, we discuss the intricate interplay between stress hormones, neurotrophic factors, and epigenetic modifications that underlie these changes. The review highlights the significant behavioral and cognitive consequences of stress-induced PFC plasticity, including impairments in working memory, decision-making, and emotional regulation, which may contribute to the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders. We also explore individual differences in stress susceptibility, focusing on sex-specific effects and age-dependent variations in stress responses. The role of estrogens in conferring stress resilience in females and the unique vulnerabilities of the developing and aging PFC are discussed. Finally, we consider potential pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions that may mitigate or reverse stress-induced changes in the PFC. The review concludes by identifying key areas for future research, including the need for more studies on the reversibility of stress effects and the potential of emerging technologies in unraveling the complexities of PFC plasticity. This comprehensive overview underscores the critical importance of understanding stress-induced PFC plasticity for developing more effective strategies to prevent and treat stress-related mental health disorders.","[Algaidi, Sami Awda] Taibah Univ, Fac Med, Dept Basic Med Sci, Medina, Saudi Arabia",Taibah University,"Algaidi, SA (corresponding author), Taibah Univ, Fac Med, Dept Basic Med Sci, Medina, Saudi Arabia.",sqaidi@taibahu.edu.sa,"Algaidi, Sami/GRA-7827-2022","Algaidi, Sami/0000-0002-0599-680X",,,,166,11,12,6,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0006-8993,1872-6240,BRAIN RES,Brain Res.,MAR 15,2025,1851.0,,,,,,,149461,10.1016/j.brainres.2025.149461,0.0,JAN 2025,24,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,U9R1C,39864644.0,,2026-02-03,WOS:001415065200001,0

Meanwhile, new technology tools have emerged for gainand loss-of-function studies, specifically in gene silencing and developing tractable plant models for genetic transformation. Additionally, innovative and adapted transformation protocols have optimized genetic engineering in most fruit trees. The recent explosion of new gene-editing tools allows for broadening opportunities for functional studies in fruit trees. Yet, the fruit tree research community has not fully embraced these new technologies to provide large-scale genome characterizations as in cereals and other staple food crops. Instead, recent research efforts in the fruit trees appear to focus on two primary translational tools: transgene-free gene editing via Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery and the ectopic application of RNA-based products in the field for crop protection. The inherent nature of the propagation system and the long juvenile phase of most fruit trees are significant justifications for the first technology. The second approach might have the public favor regarding sustainability and an eco-friendlier environment for a crop production system that could potentially replace the use of chemicals. Regardless of their potential, both technologies still depend on the foundational knowledge of gene-to-trait relationships generated from basic genetic studies. Therefore, we will discuss the status of gene silencing and DNAbased gene editing techniques for functional studies in fruit trees followed by the potential and limitations of their translational tools (RNP delivery and RNAbased products) in the context of crop production.","[Gouthu, Satyanarayana; Eubanks, Britt A.

Despite this, ART-conceived pregnancies are also associated with higher risks for adverse maternal and offspring outcomes. Recent evidence highlights the role of the reproductive tract microbiome (mainly the vaginal and endometrial microbiome) in implantation success and gestational physiology. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state of knowledge pertaining to the content, function, and disruption of the uterine and vaginal microbiome in ART contexts and to consider the adverse effects of changing the microbiome on maternal health, pregnancy outcomes, and development of progeny.MethodsA narrative synthesis of the literature covering the period 2005-2025 was undertaken using the PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL databases. Articles addressing microbiome changes associated with ART and reproductive outcomes were included.ResultsART procedures such as vaginal antisepsis, oocyte retrieval, embryo transfers, hormone stimulation, and use of prophylactic antibiotics have caused observable disruptions to the reproductive tract microbiome. The loss of Lactobacillus dominance and the development of dysbiosis are linked with lower implantation rates, a higher incidence of gestational disorders, such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, a heavy risk of preterm delivery, and an increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes, such as altered immune development and developmental delay. Furthermore, newer alternatives including probiotics, individual microbiome testing, and multi-omic platforms show promise, but are limited by variability in clinical approaches and a lack of empirical backing.ConclusionThe uterine and vaginal microbiome profoundly impact ART outcomes by modulating implantation, immune tolerance, and fetal development. Integrating microbiome-informed diagnostics and therapies into fertility treatments offers a new frontier in precision reproductive medicine.","[Motiwala, Zainab Yusufali] Aligarh Muslim Univ, JNMCH, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Misra, Sidharth] Univ Texas Southwestern, Dept Surg, Dallas, TX USA; [Sharma, Ishika; Choudhari, Sneha; Yadav, Harshita Mahendra] Terna Dent Coll, Dept Prosthodont, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Bisht, Rahul] Armed Forces Med Coll, Pune, India",Aligarh Muslim University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; Armed Forces Medical College,"Sharma, I (corresponding author), Terna Dent Coll, Dept Prosthodont, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.",ns642523@gmail.com,"Motiwala, Zainab/NYT-4122-2025","Sharma, Ishika/0009-0003-9441-1459",,,,107,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1058-0468,1573-7330,J ASSIST REPROD GEN,J.

The potential adoption of this technology calls for important changes to clinical management processes and allocation policy. Such potential policy change decisions may be supported by decision models from health economics, comparative effectiveness research and operations management. Objective We used a systematic approach to identify and extract information about models published in the kidney transplantation literature and provide an overview of the status of our collective model-based knowledge about the kidney transplant process. Methods Database searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and other sources, for reviews and primary studies. We reviewed all English-language papers that presented a model that could be a tool to support decision making in kidney transplantation. Data were extracted on the clinical context and modelling methods used. Results A total of 144 studies were included, most of which focused on a single component of the transplantation process, such as immunosuppressive therapy or donor-recipient matching and organ allocation policies. Pre- and post-transplant processes have rarely been modelled together. Conclusion A whole-disease modelling approach is preferred to inform precision medicine policy, given its potential upstream implementation in the treatment pathway. This requires consideration of pre- and post-transplant natural history, risk factors for allograft dysfunction and failure, and other post-transplant outcomes. Our call is for greater collaboration across disciplines and whole-disease modelling approaches to more accurately simulate complex policy decisions about the integration of precision medicine tools in kidney transplantation.

This article compares the clinical efficacy of robot-assisted and freehand CD for ONFH by meta-analysis. Methods Computer searches of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal Database, WanFang, and Chinese BioMedical Literature Database were conducted from the time of database inception to November 15, 2023. The literature on the clinical efficacy of robot-assisted and freehand CD in the treatment of ONFH was collected. Two researchers independently screened the literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data, and strictly evaluated the quality of the included literature. Outcome measures encompassed operative duration, intraoperative blood loss volume, frequency of intraoperative fluoroscopies, visual analog scale (VAS) score, Harris hip score (HHS), complications, and radiographic progression. Data synthesis was carried out using Review Manager 5.4.1 software. The quality of evidence was evaluated according to Grades of Recommendation Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) standards. Results Seven retrospective cohort studies involving 355 patients were included in the study. The results of meta-analysis showed that in the robot-assisted group, the operative duration (MD = -17.60, 95% CI: -23.41 to -11.78, P < 0.001), intraoperative blood loss volume (MD = -19.98, 95% CI: -28.84 to -11.11, P < 0.001), frequency of intraoperative fluoroscopies (MD = -6.60, 95% CI: -9.01 to -4.20, P < 0.001), and Delta VAS score (MD = -0.45, 95% CI: -0.67 to -0.22, P < 0.001) were significantly better than those in the freehand group. The GRADE evidence evaluation showed DeltaVAS score as low quality and other indicators as very low quality. There was no significant difference in the terms of Delta HHS (MD = 0.51, 95% CI: -1.34 to 2.35, P = 0.59), complications (RR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.03 to 2.74, P = 0.29), and radiographic progression (RR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.25 to 1.02, P = 0.06) between the two groups. Conclusion There is limited evidence showing the benefit of robot-assisted therapy for treatment of ONFH patients, and much of it is of low quality. Therefore, caution should be exercised in interpreting these results. It is recommended that more high-quality studies be conducted to validate these findings in future studies.","[Ouyang, Wensi; Guo, Guimei; Jiang, Tianpei; Zhao, Changwei; Zhou, Xiaoling] Changchun Univ Chinese Med, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China; [Ouyang, Wensi; Guo, Guimei; Zhao, Changwei; Zhou, Xiaoling] Changchun Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp, Changchun 130021, Peoples R China",Changchun University of Chinese Medicine; Changchun University of Chinese Medicine,"Zhao, CW; Zhou, XL (corresponding author), Changchun Univ Chinese Med, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China.;Zhao, CW; Zhou, XL (corresponding author), Changchun Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp, Changchun 130021, Peoples R China.",zcw_1980@126.com; zlx19800110@163.com,"JIANG, TIANPEI/KXR-2110-2024","JIANG, TIANPEI/0009-0006-9717-450X",,,,32,0,1,3,11,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2474,BMC MUSCULOSKEL DIS,BMC Musculoskelet.

However, anthropogenic activities are causing the sixth mass extinction, threatening even our own species. For many animals, dwindling numbers are becoming fragmented populations with low genetic diversity, threatening longterm species viability. With extinction rates 1000-10,000 times greater than natural, ex situ and in situ conservation programmes need additional support to save species. The indefinite storage of cryopreserved (-196 degrees C) viable cells and tissues (cryobanking), followed by assisted or advanced assisted reproductive technology (ART: utilisation of oocytes and spermatozoa to generate offspring; aART: utilisation of somatic cell genetic material to generate offspring), may be the only hope for species' long-term survival. As such, cryobanking should be considered a necessity for all future conservation strategies. Following cryopreservation, ART/aART can be used to reinstate lost genetics back into a population, resurrecting biodiversity. However, for this to be successful, species-specific protocol optimisation and increased knowledge of basic biology for many taxa are required. Current ART/aART is primarily focused on mammalian taxa; however, this needs to be extended to all, including to some of the most endangered species: amphibians. Gamete, reproductive tissue and somatic cell cryobanking can fill the gap between losing genetic diversity today and future technological developments. This review explores species prioritisation for cryobanking and the successes and challenges of cryopreservation and multiple ARTs/aARTs. We here discuss the value of cryobanking before more species are lost and the potential of advanced reproductive technologies not only to halt but also to reverse biodiversity loss. Lay summary The world is undergoing its sixth mass extinction; however, unlike previous events, the latest is caused by human activities and is resulting in the largest loss of biodiversity (all living things on Earth) for 65 million years. With an extinction rate 1000-10,000-fold greater than natural, this catastrophic decline in biodiversity is threatening our own survival. As the number of individuals within a species declines, genetic diversity reduces, threatening their long-term existence. In this review, the authors summarise approaches to indefinitely preserve living cells and tissues at low temperatures (cryobanking) and the technologies required to resurrect biodiversity. In the future when appropriate techniques become available, these living samples can be thawed and used to reinstate genetic diversity and produce live young ones of endangered species, enabling their long-term survival. The successes and challenges of genome resource cryopreservation are discussed to enable a move towards a future of stable biodiversity.","[Bolton, Rhiannon L.; Pettit, Matt T.; Bolton, Anthony E.; Walker, Susan L.] Nat SAFE, Chapel Field Stud, Ash Lane, Whitchurch, Shrops, England; [Mooney, Andrew] Dublin Zoo, Phoenix Pk, Dublin 8, Ireland; [Pettit, Matt T.] IMT Int Ltd, Chester, Cheshire, England; [Morgan, Lucy] Gemini Genet, Chapel Field Stud, Ash Lane, Whitchurch, England; [Drake, Gabby J.; Walker, Susan L.] Chester Zoo, Upton By Chester, England; [Appeltant, Ruth] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Womens & Reprod Hlth, Womens Ctr, John Radcliffe Hosp, Level 3, Oxford, England; [Gillis, James D.] South East Zoo Alliance Reprod & Conservat, Yulee, FL USA; [Hvilsom, Christina] Copenhagen Zoo, Frederiksberg, Denmark",University of Oxford,"Bolton, RL (corresponding author), Nat SAFE, Chapel Field Stud, Ash Lane, Whitchurch, Shrops, England.",rhiannon@natures-safe.com,"Appeltant, Ruth/AAI-5536-2020; Mooney, Anew/IQW-9632-2023","Appeltant, Ruth/0000-0002-0170-1963; Gillis, James/0000-0002-3077-0327; Mooney, Anew/0000-0002-2592-9786; Bolton, Rhiannon/0000-0003-2164-8896",,,,309,68,78,3,30,BIOSCIENTIFICA LTD,BRISTOL,"STARLING HOUSE, 1600 BRISTOL PARKWAY N, BRISTOL, ENGLAND",,2633-8386,REPROD FERTIL,Reprod.

This review article presents the advantages of biogas technologies (mainly agricultural, based on waste of animal and plant origin) and extensively discusses the main principles of biogas production in the anaerobic digestion (AD). In this respect, the main parameters of the process, which require monitoring and decisive for its efficiency are described, therefore: temperature, pH value, retention time and organic loading rate (OLR). The principles of substrate selection are also discussed and the necessity and advantages of the use of organic waste according to the model of a circular economy and the concept of sustainable development, are indicated. It is emphasized that according to the new European regulations, the crops classified as food cannot be considered energy crops. The part on biogas production is summarised with an explanation of the necessity to treat and purify biogas. Biogas purification is important from the point of view of the efficiency of its conversion into electricity. A special place in this paper is devoted to the design, construction, functioning and operation of biogas plants, based on both scientific and practical aspects. In conclusion of this chapter, the economic aspects and profitability of operating biogas plants are discussed. Cost and benefit analyses are the major tool used for the systematic evaluation of the financial costs and potential benefits associated with the operation of biogas plants. The important fact is that the return on investment can be achieved within a few years, provided the activities are well-planned and executed. In addition to the fundamental issues of the operation of biogas plants, this article presents the global situation regarding the development of biogas plants, discussing in detail the specific needs and limitations on different continents. It is a interesting and extensive part of this article. The global agricultural biogas market is at very different levels of development. Most such installations are located in Asia and Europe. China has the highest number of biogas plants, with more than 100,000 biogas plants, followed by Germany with over 10,000 plants. In addition to the 100,000 biogas plants, China also has a large number of household biogas units, which gives a total of approx. 40 million operating units. The article concludes with a discussion of opportunities and barriers to the development of biogas plants, pointing to: financial issues, access to feedstock, political regulations, public awareness and the geopolitical situation. The most frequently cited reasons for investment failure include economic problems, lack of professional knowledge.","[Gadirli, Gulnar; Pilarska, Agnieszka A.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm & Mech Engn, Dept Hydraul & Sanit Engn, Ul Piatkowska 94A, PL-60649 Poznan, Poland; [Dach, Jacek; Pilarski, Krzysztof] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm & Mech Engn, Dept Biosyst Engn, Wojska Polskiego 50, PL-60627 Poznan, Poland; [Kolasa-Wiecek, Alicja] Univ Opole, Inst Environm Engn & Biotechnol, Fac Nat Sci & Technol, Kominka 6, PL-46020 Opole, Poland; [Borowiak, Klaudia] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm & Mech Engn, Dept Ecol & Environm Protect, Ul Piatkowska 94C, PL-60649 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences; Poznan University of Life Sciences; University of Opole; Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Pilarska, AA (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm & Mech Engn, Dept Hydraul & Sanit Engn, Ul Piatkowska 94A, PL-60649 Poznan, Poland.",gulnargadrli@gmail.com; pilarska@up.poznan.pl; jacek.dach@up.poznan.pl; pilarski@up.poznan.pl; akolasa@uni.opole.pl; klaudia.borowiak@up.poznan.pl,"Pilarska, Agnieszka/AAI-1119-2019; Borowiak, Klaudia/O-1333-2015; Dach, Jacek/G-6016-2012","Pilarska, Agnieszka/0000-0001-6128-0315; Pilarska, Agnieszka/0000-0001-6128-0315; Borowiak, Klaudia/0000-0001-9879-3683; Kolasa, Alicja/0000-0002-5842-7280; Dach, Jacek/0000-0002-3162-1198",Higher Education's programme: Regional Initiative Excellence (RID) in the years 2019-2022,Higher Education's programme: Regional Initiative Excellence (RID) in the years 2019-2022,No Statement Available,137,33,35,8,42,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,ENERGIES,Energies,FEB,2024,17.0,3,,,,,,568,10.3390/en17030568,0.0,,26,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,HN8Y7,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001160286900001,0

It is estimated that a foot ulcer will develop at some point in the lives of 15-25 % of diabetic patients. Serious complications, including infection and amputation, are often led to by these wounds. In the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, nanofiber-based wound dressings have emerged in recent years as promising therapeutic strategies for diabetic wound healing. Hyaluronic acid (HA), among various nanofiber materials, has gained considerable attention due to its unique properties, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, and excellent moisture retention capacity. By promoting skin hydration and controlling inflammation, a crucial role in wound healing is played by HA. Wounds are also helped to heal faster by HA through the regulation of inflammation levels and signaling the body to build more blood vessels in the damaged area. Great potential in various applications, including wound healing, has been shown by the development and use of nanofiber formulations in medicine. However, challenges and limitations associated with nanofibers in medicine exist, such as reproducibility, proper characterization, and biological evaluation. By providing a biomimetic environment that enhances re-epithelialization and facilitates the delivery of active substances, nanofibers promote wound healing. In accelerating wound healing, promising results have been shown by HA-contained nanofiber formulations in diabetic wounds. Key strategies employed by these formulations include revascularization, modulation of the inflammation microenvironment, delivery of active substances, photothermal nanofibers, and nanoparticle-loaded fabrics. Particularly crucial is revascularization as it restores blood flow to the wound area, promoting healing. Wound healing can also be enhanced by modulating the inflammation microenvironment through controlling inflammation levels. Future perspectives in this field involve addressing the current challenges and limitations of nanofiber technology and further optimizing HAcontained nanofiber formulations for improved efficacy in diabetic wound healing. This includes exploring new fabrication techniques, enhancing the biocompatibility and biodegradability of nanofibers, and developing multifunctional nanofibers for targeted drug delivery. Not only does writing a review in the field of nanofiberbased wound dressings, particularly those containing hyaluronic acid, allow us to consolidate our current knowledge and understanding but also broadens our horizons. An opportunity is provided to delve deeper into the intricacies of this innovative therapeutic strategy, explore its potential and limitations, and envision future directions. By doing so, a contribution can be made to the ongoing advancements in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, ultimately improving the quality of life for patients with diabetic wounds.","[Astaneh, Mohammad Ebrahim; Fereydouni, Narges] Fasa Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Anat Sci, Fasa, Iran; [Astaneh, Mohammad Ebrahim; Fereydouni, Narges] Fasa Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Tissue Engn, Fasa, Iran; [Fereydouni, Narges] Fasa Univ Med Sci, Noncommunicable Dis Res Ctr, Fasa, Iran; [Astaneh, Mohammad Ebrahim; Fereydouni, Narges] Fasa Univ Med Sci, Student Res Comm, Fasa, Iran",,"Fereydouni, N (corresponding author), Fasa Univ Med Sci, Noncommunicable Dis Res Ctr, Fasa, Iran.",Narges.fereydouni2020@gmail.com,"Fereydouni, Narges/ABD-8931-2020",,,,,162,33,34,1,30,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0141-8130,1879-0003,INT J BIOL MACROMOL,Int.

However, pole-mounted flat PV panels (PMFPVP) suffer from significant performance limitations due to shading, dust accumulation, high maintenance costs, and energy storage inefficiencies. These challenges necessitate frequent cleaning and system oversizing, making them less viable for low-maintenance applications. In response, this review examines the potential of Pole-Integrated Vertical PV Tubes (PIVPVT) as an alternative technology that mitigates these issues while enhancing energy output stability and reducing maintenance requirements. This study employs a comprehensive review methodology, integrating an arithmetic analysis of polygonal VPVT designs with an in-depth techno-economic comparison of VPVT and FPVP systems. The analysis includes a structural evaluation of VPVT materials, operational cost assessments, and a case-based economic feasibility study under different environmental conditions. Key performance indicators such as shading resilience, dust accumulation impact, cleaning costs, and lifecycle economic viability are examined to establish VPVT's competitiveness against conventional flat PV panels. The results indicate that while VPVT systems have higher initial capital costs, they offer substantial long-term advantages, particularly in non-maintainable or highdust environments. VPVT technology reduces energy storage requirements by maintaining a more stable power output curve throughout the day, minimizes shading losses due to its cylindrical structure, and significantly lowers cleaning frequency and associated operational costs. The findings highlight VPVT as a sustainable and economically viable alternative to flat PV panels in pole-mounted applications, particularly for urban, arid, and remote locations where conventional systems are constrained by maintenance challenges. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on low-maintenance PV technologies and provides a roadmap for future deployments of VPVT systems in sustainable energy infrastructure.","[A'amar, Khaled; Bicer, Yusuf; Al-Ansari, Tareq] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Coll Sci & Engn, Div Sustainable Dev, Doha, Qatar",Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar,"A'amar, K (corresponding author), Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Coll Sci & Engn, Div Sustainable Dev, Doha, Qatar.",khaa08498@hbku.edu.qa,"; Bicer, Yusuf/P-5446-2019","A'amar, Khaled/0009-0007-4062-5303;",Graduate Sponsorship Research Award from the Qatar National Research Fund [GSRA10-L-1-0602-23074]; Qatar National Library; Hamad Bin Khalifa University,Graduate Sponsorship Research Award from the Qatar National Research Fund; Qatar National Library(Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)); Hamad Bin Khalifa University(Qatar Foundation (QF)Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar),"This publication was made possible by the Graduate Sponsorship Research Award (GSRA10-L-1-0602-23074) from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation) , the Qatar National Library (covers the open access fee) , and Hamad Bin Khalifa University.",72,3,3,0,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0038-092X,1471-1257,SOL ENERGY,Sol.

Telehealth technologies, for example, smart devices, are novel approaches for health programs delivery regardless of geographical boundaries. Objectives: To assess the effect of telehealth interventions on mobility, quality of life, and antecedents of health behavior compared with a control condition (usual care or simpler telehealth interventions with fewer number of behavior change techniques [BCTs]) for community-dwelling adults (.50 years) with an LLL and the effect of mode of delivery and BCTs used in telehealth interventions on health outcomes. Study design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus on January 28, 2021, to identify relevant randomized controlled trials. Two authors independently screened records and assessed risk of bias. We conducted a narrative synthesis of evidence and, when appropriate, used the standardized mean difference (SMD) and mean difference for meta-analyses and the Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for practice recommendations. Results: We identified six randomized controlled trials. Telephone was the most common delivery mode (n53), and instructions for performing behaviors was the most common BCT (n 5 5). Very low certainty evidence showed no changes in mobility (six studies: SMD 5 0.33 [95% confidence interval [CI] 520.08, 0.75]), quality of life (two studies: mean difference520.08 [95% CI520.30, 0.15]), and antecedents of behavior (five studies: SMD 5 0.04 [95% CI520.28, 0.36]). Conclusions: Our review highlights a knowledge gap for the effect of telehealth interventions for people with LLL.

The neurodevelopmental hypothesis proposes that SZ is associated with genetic and environmental risk factors, which influence connectivity in neuronal circuits during vulnerable developmental periods. We carried out a non-systematic review of genetic/environmental factors that increase SZ risk in light of its neurodevelopmental hypothesis. We also reviewed the potential impact of SZ-related environmental and genetic risk factors on grey and white matter pathology and brain function based on magnetic resonance imaging and post-mortem studies. Finally, we reviewed studies that have used patient-derived neuronal models to gain knowledge of the role of genetic and environmental factors in early developmental stages. Taken together, these studies indicate that a variety of environmental factors may interact with genetic risk factors during the pre- or postnatal period and/or during adolescence to induce symptoms of SZ in early adulthood. These risk factors induce disturbances of macro- and microconnectivity in brain regions involving the prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortices and the hippocampus. On the molecular and cellular level, a disturbed synaptic plasticity, loss of oligodendrocytes and impaired myelination have been shown in brain regions of SZ patients. These cellular/histological phenotypes are related to environmental risk factors such as obstetric complications, maternal infections and childhood trauma and genetic risk factors identified in recent genome-wide association studies. SZ-related genetic risk may contribute to active processes interfering with synaptic plasticity in the adult brain. Advances in stem cell technologies are providing promising mechanistic insights into how SZ risk factors impact the developing brain. Further research is needed to understand the timing of the different complex biological processes taking place as a result of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors.","[Schmitt, Andrea; Falkai, Peter; Papiol, Sergi] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Univ Hosp, Nussbaumstr 7, D-80336 Munich, Germany; [Schmitt, Andrea] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Psychiat, Lab Neurosci LIM27, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Falkai, Peter] Max Planck Inst Psychiat, Kraepelinstr 2-10, Munich, Germany; [Papiol, Sergi] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Inst Psychiat Phen & Genom IPPG, Univ Hosp, Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Max Planck Society; University of Munich,"Schmitt, A (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Univ Hosp, Nussbaumstr 7, D-80336 Munich, Germany.;Schmitt, A (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Psychiat, Lab Neurosci LIM27, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",Andrea.Schmitt@med.uni-muenchen.de,"Falkai, Peter/E-3273-2017; Schmitt, Anea/V-3003-2018","Schmitt, Anea/0000-0002-5426-4023",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,131,58,61,4,23,SPRINGER WIEN,Vienna,"Prinz-Eugen-Strasse 8-10, A-1040 Vienna, AUSTRIA",0300-9564,1435-1463,J NEURAL TRANSM,J.

This challenge is exacerbated by a reduction in cultivable land and the adverse effects of climate change on crop yield quantity and quality. Breeders actively embrace cutting-edge omics technologies to pursue resilient genotypes in response to these pressing issues. In this global context, new breeding techniques (NBTs) are emerging as the future of agriculture, offering a solution to introduce resilient crops that can ensure food security, particularly against challenging climate events. Indeed, the search for domestication genes as well as the genetic modification of these loci in wild species using genome editing tools are crucial steps in carrying out de novo domestication of wild plants without compromising their genetic background. Current knowledge allows us to take different paths from those taken by early Neolithic farmers, where crop domestication has opposed natural selection. In this process traits and alleles negatively correlated with high resource environment performance are probably eradicated through artificial selection, while others may have been lost randomly due to domestication and genetic bottlenecks. Thus, domestication led to highly productive plants with little genetic diversity, owing to the loss of valuable alleles that had evolved to tolerate biotic and abiotic stresses. Recent technological advances have increased the feasibility of de novo domestication of wild plants as a promising approach for crafting optimal crops while ensuring food security and using a more sustainable, low-input agriculture. Here, we explore what crucial domestication genes are, coupled with the advancement of technologies enabling the precise manipulation of target sequences, pointing out de novo domestication as a promising application for future crop development.","[Rogo, Ugo; Simoni, Samuel; Fambrini, Marco; Giordani, Tommaso; Pugliesi, Claudio; Mascagni, Flavia] Univ Pisa, Dept Agr Food & Environm DAFE, Via Borghetto 80, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Pugliesi, C (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Agr Food & Environm DAFE, Via Borghetto 80, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",ugo.rogo@phd.unipi.it; samuel.simoni@phd.unipi.it; marco.fambrini@unipi.it; tommaso.giordani@unipi.it; claudio.pugliesi@unipi.it; flavia.mascagni@unipi.it,"GIORDANI, TOMMASO/AAC-7352-2021","GIORDANI, TOMMASO/0000-0003-2933-5683; Pugliesi, Claudio/0000-0001-5846-7947; Mascagni, Flavia/0000-0001-9747-8040; Rogo, Ugo/0009-0007-0819-7054","Department of Agriculture, Food, and Environment of the University of Pisa, Italy","Department of Agriculture, Food, and Environment of the University of Pisa, Italy",No Statement Available,153,5,5,8,38,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1661-6596,1422-0067,INT J MOL SCI,Int.

There was an even greater demand with COVID-19 and subsequent isolation/social distancing measures for this risk group. The objective of this study is to map and identify the uses and types of digital health interventions and their reported impacts on the quality of HBPC for older adults worldwide.Methods and analysis This is a scoping review protocol which will enable a rigorous, transparent and reliable synthesis of knowledge. The review will be developed from the theoretical perspective of Arksey and O'malley, with updates by Levac and Peters and respective collaborators based on the Joanna Briggs Institute manual, and guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Data from white literature will be extracted from multidisciplinary health databases such as: the Virtual Health Library, LILACS, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cinahl and Embase; while Google Scholar will be used for gray literature. No date limit or language restrictions will be determined. The quantitative data will be analyzed through descriptive statistics and qualitative data through thematic analysis. The results will be submitted to stakeholder consultation for preliminary sharing of the study and will later be disseminated through publication in open access scientific journals, scientific events and academic and community journals. The full scoping review report will present the main impacts, challenges, opportunities and gaps found in publications related to the use of digital technologies in primary home care.Discussion The organization of this protocol will increase the methodological rigor, quality, transparency and accuracy of scoping reviews, reducing the risk of bias.","[de Siqueira Silva, Isis; Horacio Lopes, Rayssa; Jose de Araujo, Aguinaldo] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Postgrad Collect Hlth, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Renata Diniz Vieira Silva, Cicera] Univ Fed Campina Grande, Teacher Training Ctr, Tech Sch Hlth Cajazeiras, Cajazeiras, Brazil; [Cabral de Figueiredo, Renan] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Postgrad Family Hlth, Natal, RN, Brazil; [de Goes Bay, Osvaldo, Jr.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Fac Hlth Sci Trairi, Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil; [Velez Lapao, Luis] Univ Nova Lisboa, Global Hlth & Trop Med, Inst Higiene & Med Trop, Lisbon, Portugal; [Bezerra Xavier, Pedro] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Postgrad Collect Hlth, Santa Cruz, Brazil; [Alice da Costa Uchoa, Severina] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Publ Hlth Dept, Natal, RN, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte; Universidade Federal de Campina Grande; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Institute of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine - UNL; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte,"Silva, ID (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Postgrad Collect Hlth, Natal, RN, Brazil.",isis1998.siqueira.silva@gmail.com,"Diniz, Renata/OGO-3060-2025; DA COSTA UCHOA, SEVERINA ALICE/LMP-8395-2024; Velez Lapão, Luís Miguel/E-8465-2011; de Siqueira Silva, Ísis/HNP-2687-2023","DA COSTA UCHOA, SEVERINA ALICE/0000-0002-2531-9937; Horacio Lopes, Rayssa/0000-0001-7041-4792; Velez Lapão, Luís Miguel/0000-0003-0506-1294; José de Araújo, Aguinaldo/0000-0002-3697-1269; Bay Junior, Osvaldo de Goes/0000-0002-1017-2346; Figueirêdo, Renan Cabral de/0000-0001-5172-3733; de Siqueira Silva, Ísis/0000-0002-2403-2504",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) [001],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This study was partly financed by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) -Finance Code 001.,45,4,4,0,19,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-2565,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

Furthermore, economical losses also occur in animal husbandry. In both human and veterinary medicine, hormonal and surgical treatments, as well as assisted reproductive technologies are used to cure reproductive disorders, however they do not improve fertility. With ovarian disorders being the main reproductive pathology in human and bovine, over the past 2 decades research has approached regenerative medicine in animal model to restore normal function. Ovarian pathologies are characterized by granulosa cell and oocyte apoptosis, follicular atresia, decrease in oocyte quality and embryonic development potential, oxidative stress and mitochondrial abnormalities, ultimately leading to a decrease in fertility. At current, application of mesenchymal stromal cells or derivatives thereof represents a valid strategy for regenerative purposes. Considering their paracrine/autocrine mode of actions that are able to regenerate injured tissues, trophic support, preventing apoptosis and fibrosis, promoting angiogenesis, stimulating the function and differentiation of endogenous stem cells and even reducing the immune response, are all important players in their future therapeutic success. Nevertheless, obtaining mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from adult tissues requires invasive procedures and implicates decreased cell proliferation and a reduced differentiation capacity with age. Alternatively, the use of embryonic stem cells as source of cellular therapeutic encountered several ethical concerns, as well as the risk of teratoma formation. Therefore, several studies have recently focussed on perinatal derivatives (PnD) that can be collected non-invasively and, most importantly, display similar characteristics in terms of regenerating-inducing properties, immune-modulating properties and hypo-immunogenicity. This review will provide an overview of the current knowledge and future perspectives of PnD application in the treatment of ovarian hypofunction.","[Lange-Consiglio, Anna; Herrera, Valentina; Cremonesi, Fausto] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Med Vet, Lodi, Italy; [Lange-Consiglio, Anna; Cremonesi, Fausto] Univ Milan, Ctr Clin Vet & Zootecn Sperimental Ateneo, Lodi, Italy; [Capra, Emanuele] Consiglio Nazl Ric IBBA CNR, Ist Biol & Biotecnol Agr, Lodi, Italy; [Lang-Olip, Ingrid] Med Univ Graz, Div Cell Biol Histol & Embryol, Gottfried Schatz Res Ctr, Graz, Austria; [Ponsaerts, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst Vaxinfectio, Lab Expt Hematol, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Milan; University of Milan; Medical University of Graz; University of Antwerp,"Lange-Consiglio, A (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dipartimento Med Vet, Lodi, Italy.;Lange-Consiglio, A (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Ctr Clin Vet & Zootecn Sperimental Ateneo, Lodi, Italy.",anna.langeconsiglio@unimi.it,"; Herrera, Valentina/LEM-6915-2024; Ponsaerts, Peter/B-6213-2017; Capra, Emanuele/AAV-1595-2020; Cremonesi, Fausto/J-2506-2014; Lange-Consiglio, Anna/AAI-4146-2021","Lang-Olip, Ingrid/0000-0003-0403-4884; Herrera, Valentina/0000-0002-6855-9279; Ponsaerts, Peter/0000-0002-1892-6499;","Department of Veterinary Medicine of Universita degli Studi di Milano, Italy; [17116]; [CA17116]","Department of Veterinary Medicine of Universita degli Studi di Milano, Italy; ;","This study was funded by the Department of Veterinary Medicine of Universita degli Studi di Milano, Italy.",70,9,10,0,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-4185,,FRONT BIOENG BIOTECH,Front.

The situation in kidney transplant patients is probably better, as these patients are preselected for good adherence and proactive behaviour. Nonetheless, non-adherence remains a common, significant and likely underdiagnosed problem in transplant nephrology. Not taking immunosuppressive medication as directed is strongly correlated with late acute rejection, which is often severe, leading to progressive loss of transplant function and poor outcomes overall. It is important to acknowledge that non-adherence is multifactorial and that interventions work best if clinicians understand risk factors and the causes of non-adherence in their patients. Reflex labelling of patients as non-adherent in documentation and clinic letters is unlikely to be helpful but good documentation is also important. It is also important to be aware of the phases of adherence and to have some knowledge of how to measure non-adherence. Dose simplification may help in some patients and technology can be employed to improve adherence, particularly in younger and information technology-literate patients. Peer support and patient information are also important. Individual assessment is important in patients who have lost a previous transplant due to non-adherence. We also emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and the relative paucity of robust data in this area. Based on the limited evidence and our individual and departmental experience, our 10 tips aim to provide clinicians with a toolbox of evidence-based interventions to address this important issue in daily clinical practice. We also provide a list of suggestions for institutions to address this important issue at departmental and institutional levels and suggest future research.","[Mahmood, Kassir; Woywodt, Alexander] Lancashire Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Renal Med, Preston, England; [Allen, Jude] Northern Care Alliance, Salford, England; [Varley, Rebecca] Manchester Univ Fdn Trust, Dept Renal & Pancreat Transplantat, Manchester, England; [Vrijens, Bernard] Adv Analyt Res Drug Exposure AARDEX Grp, Liege, Belgium; [Huuskes, Brooke M.] La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Inst Mol Sci LIMS, Transplant Patient, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Huuskes, Brooke M.] La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Inst Mol Sci LIMS, Ctr Cardiovasc Biol & Dis Res, Cardiorenal Div, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",La Trobe University; La Trobe University,"Woywodt, A (corresponding author), Lancashire Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Renal Med, Preston, England.",Alex.Woywodt@lthtr.nhs.uk,"Woywodt, Alexander/ABD-2711-2020","Woywodt, Alexander/0000-0002-3825-6955",,,,65,1,1,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2048-8505,2048-8513,CLIN KIDNEY J,Clin.

Errors in ART are thought to be rare, but can have devastating consequences for patients and their offspring. The objectives of this article are to review known cases of human error in the ART laboratory and suggest preventative strategies. Methods We performed a systematic review of the literature in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines using PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they involved known cases of unintentional human error in the ART laboratory. Only full-text articles in English were included. References of the resulted studies were considered for inclusion. Results A total of 420 articles were screened and 37 articles were selected for inclusion. These largely included case reports and reviews in the medical and legal literature. Twenty-two adverse events due to human error in the ART laboratory were identified. Eight of these adverse events were the result of the insemination with the wrong sperm, 6 errors lead to the transfer of the wrong embryo, 3 lead to an error in preimplantation genetic testing, and 5 adverse events lead to the failure of gamete and embryo cryostorage. Conclusions Since the advent of ART, there have been reports of catastrophic events occurring secondary to human error in the laboratory to include incidents of unintended parentage, and have resulted in the loss of embryos and gametes through cryostorage failure. Proposed solutions include the stringent implementation and adherence to safety protocols, adequate laboratory staffing and training, and novel methods for specimen labeling and tracking. Of utmost importance is having knowledge of these errors and the ability to determine cause so that future events can be prevented.","[Nesbit, Carleigh; Esfandiari, Navid] Dartmouth Hitchcock Med Ctr, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Lebanon, NH 03766 USA; [Blanchette Porter, Misty; Esfandiari, Navid] Univ Vermont, Robert Larner Coll Med, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, Burlington, VT USA",Dartmouth College; University of Vermont,"Esfandiari, N (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Larner Coll Med, Med Ctr, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, Burlington, VT 05401 USA.",carleigh.B.nesbit@hitchcock.org; misty.blanchette-porter@uvmhealth.org; Navid.Esfandiari@uvmhealth.org,"; Blanchette Porter, Misty/NPI-9111-2025","Esfandiari HCLD, Navid/0000-0003-0979-5236;",,,,59,4,4,0,8,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1549-8417,1549-8425,J PATIENT SAF,J.

Factors that could contribute to this include losses during dialysis and insufficient intake of vitamin C. Furthermore, vitamin C deficiency in HD patients may be related to inflammatory state, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that oral vitamin C supplementation improves lipid profile and diminishes inflammation and oxidative stress. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies (NRS) were analyzed, retrieved from EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases (July 2024). Inclusion criteria: patients ( > 18 years) on HD; exclusion: intravenous supplementation, animals, children, adolescents, pregnant, lactating, hospitalized, transplanted. The Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions and Risk of Bias 2 assessed risk of bias. Twelve studies were included (8 RCTs, 4 NRS), involving 549 participants (353 in the vitamin C supplementation, 97 control, 99 placebo). The lipid profile was evaluated in 6. The intervention ranged from 4 to 52 weeks, with doses from 51.4 to 1000 mg/day, orally. Three of 8 RCTs showed high risk of bias and 3 reported some concerns regarding the blinding process. The NRS presented low risk of bias. It was not possible to evaluate inflammation and oxidative stress because of differences in the variables. Meta-analysis showed a reduction in low-density lipoprotein (weighted mean difference: -24.81; I 2 79.1%, confidence interval-44.28 to-5.33, P = .008), dose of 107.1-1000 mg/day, for at least 12 weeks. Limitations include the number of studies and patients, and the lack of knowledge about the intake and concentration of vitamin C. Vitamin C supplementation requires further clarification in HD patients. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

It is the only native pine species of Hispaniola, and holds ecological, cultural, and medicinal significance across the Dominican Republic and Haiti. A data search was conducted across several databases (Google Scholar, SciFinder, Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed/Medline, and TRIP) to evaluate the existing knowledge of P. occidentalis spp. and compare it to that of other Pinus species for medicinal uses. The search showed evidence about the medicinal use of this pine species for treating respiratory ailments (cough, cold, and flu), skin infections, wounds, and inflammatory conditions, mainly through hot decoctions of pine needles, bark, cone tender sprouts, and the resin in some locations in Hispaniola. Still, phytochemical data were scarce, limited to the composition of the needle's essential oil and resin's turpentine oil in the 20th century. Systematic pharmacological validation of these limited ethnopharmacological findings is still pending, along with the determination of phytochemicals. Research on P. occidentalis shows potential as a natural health product. The urgent need for sustainable strategies is emphasized by conservation concerns related to habitat loss and deforestation. Future research should focus on detailed ethnopharmacology, conservation and propagation techniques for its exploitation, extraction technologies, chemical profiling, and pharmacological screening according to ethnomedicinal surveys, to set P. occidentalis as a promising candidate for phytotherapeutic development and integrative health applications in Hispaniola. These gaps underscore the need for a research roadmap of this endemic tree across the island. The review represents the first comprehensive synthesis of the ethnomedical applications of P. occidentalis Swartz, systematically mapping its cultural and therapeutic significance across Hispaniola.","[Nunez-Selles, Alberto J.] Univ Nacl Pedro Henriquez Urena UNPHU, Res Div, Santo Domingo, Dominican Rep; [Nuevas-Paz, Lauro] Univ Nacl Evangel UNEV, Technol Res & Dev Ctr TECUNEV, Santo Domingo, Dominican Rep; [Gomez-Torres, Elisa A.] Inst Innovac Biotecnol & Ind IIBI, Dept Pharmaceut & Bioprospecting, Santo Domingo, Dominican Rep",,"Núñez-Selles, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Pedro Henriquez Urena UNPHU, Res Div, Santo Domingo, Dominican Rep.",alnunez@unphu.edu.do,"NUNEZSELLES, ALBERTO/KXS-0879-2024",,Fondo Nacional de Innovacin y Desarrollo Cientfico-Tecnolgico,Fondo Nacional de Innovacin y Desarrollo Cientfico-Tecnolgico,"The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

However, end of life in CMC is poorly understood and little is known about illness trajectories, communication, and decision-making experiences. Objective: To synthesize existing literature and characterize the end-of-life experience in CMC. Methods: A literature search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar was conducted up to August 26, 2021. Studies reporting CMC at end of life were included and the extracted data were analyzed descriptively. Findings: Of 1535 publications identified, 23 studies were included. Most studies (15/23 [65%]) were published from 2015 to 2021 and were quantitative in nature (20/23 [87%]). The majority of studies that extracted data from a single country (18/20 [90%]) originated from North America. Study outcomes were categorized into four main domains: (1) place of death (2) health care use (3) interventions received or withdrawn (4) communication, and end-of-life experiences. The weighted percentage of in-hospital CMC deaths was 80.6%. Studies reported that CMC had increased health care use and were subjected to more intensive interventions at end of life compared with non-CMC. Qualitative studies highlighted the following themes: Intrinsic prognostic uncertainty, differing perspectives of the child's quality of life, the chronic illness experience, a desire to have parental expertise acknowledged, surprise at the terminal event, the experience of multiple losses, with an overarching theme of the need for compassionate care at end of life. Conclusions: This scoping review highlighted important characteristics of end of life in CMC, outlining the emerging evidence and knowledge gaps on this topic. A better understanding of this cohort of seriously and chronically ill children would serve to inform clinical practice, service development, and future research.","[Ng, Grace Mei Chan; Bourassa, Marie-Helene; Patel, Hema] McGill Univ Hlth Ctr, Dept Pediat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ng, Grace Mei Chan; Bourassa, Marie-Helene; Patel, Hema] McGill Univ, Dept Pediat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ng, Grace Mei Chan] HCA Hosp Ltd, Star PALS Pediatr Adv Life Support, Singapore, Singapore; [Ng, Grace Mei Chan] Kwong Wai Shiu Hosp, HCA Hosp Ltd, 705 Serangoon Rd 03-01, Singapore 328127, Singapore",McGill University; McGill University,"Ng, GMC (corresponding author), Kwong Wai Shiu Hosp, HCA Hosp Ltd, 705 Serangoon Rd 03-01, Singapore 328127, Singapore.",gracen@hcahospicecare.org.sg,,,,,,37,0,0,0,1,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1096-6218,1557-7740,J PALLIAT MED,J.

However, such accuracy incurs substantial computational and energy costs, limiting deployment on resource-constrained embedded devices. Approximate Computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to mitigate this challenge by trading off tolerable accuracy loss for significant gains in energy, power, area, and performance. Leveraging the inherent error resilience of DL models, approximation techniques have been extensively explored at multiple layers of the DL computing stack, and several surveys also exist. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior Systematic Literature Review (SLR) exists that is specifically focused on Approximate Computing for DL in Embedded Systems. This article presents SLR by selecting 51 studies published between January 2019 and May 2025. These studies are organized into four categories corresponding to layers of the DL computing stack, including cross-layer approximations. Furthermore, 12 approximation techniques, 11 benchmark datasets, 26 prominent DL architectures, and three embedded platforms for the energy-efficient DL deployment are summarized, along with the leading tools, frameworks, and optimization/evaluation metrics. Additionally, the academic and industry-wide global adoption has also been highlighted. This SLR reveals that Approximate Multipliers, CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets, ResNet-50 and LeNet models, and ASIC-based 45 nm technology designs are most frequently targeted, whereas Synopsys DC, PyTorch, and Verilog emerged as the predominant tools and frameworks supporting approximations in DL. Finally, this SLR highlights the current challenges, research gaps, and introduces a conceptual cross-layer approximate DL framework to address them. The findings of this SLR offer a comprehensive reference for the researchers and practitioners to select suitable approximation techniques along with the underlying tools and hardware platforms, aligned with their application requirements.","[Rasheed, Y.; Gillani, G.

The purpose of this invited narrative review is to provide fundamental knowledge to non-specialists about exercise and education, diet, biomechanical interventions, and other physical therapist-delivered treatments. In addition to summarizing the rationale for common rehabilitative therapies, we provide a synthesis of current core recommendations. Robust evidence based on randomized clinical trials supports exercise with education and diet as core treatments for OA. Structured, supervised exercise therapy is advised. The mode of exercise may vary but should be individualized. The dose should be based on an initial assessment, the desired physiological changes, and progressed when appropriate. Diet combined with exercise is strongly recommended and studies demonstrate a dose-response relationship between the magnitude of weight loss and symptom improvement. Recent evidence suggests the use of technology to remotely deliver exercise, diet and education interventions is cost-effective. Although several studies support the mechanisms for biomechanical interventions (e.g., bracing, shoe inserts) and physical therapist-delivered (passive) treatments (e.g., manual therapy, electrotherapeutic modalities) fewer rigorous randomized trials support their clinical use; these therapies are sometimes recommended as adjuncts to core treatments. The mechanisms of action for all rehabilitative interventions include contextual factors such as attention and placebo effects. These effects can challenge our interpretation of treatment efficacy from clinical trials, yet also provide opportunities to maximize patient outcomes in clinical practice. When evaluating rehabilitative interventions, the field may benefit from increased emphasis on research that considers contextual factors while evaluating mechanistic, longer-term, clinically-important and policyrelevant outcome measures.

The past 25 yr have been a period of rapid improvement in dairy reproduction through the implementation of new technology that was unknown a short time ago. The next 25 yr will likely be similar with the refinement of existing technology and development of new technology to address the current challenges to dairy reproduction. Many of these new developments will address the need for greater on-farm automation necessitated by the consolidation of farms (more cows per farm) in the face of shortages in large animal veterinary and agricultural labor. Genomics will continue to play an important role in improving fertility on farm. There is the possibility that postpartum uterine health could benefit from advanced technologies that are emerging as effective treatments for tissue damage caused by disease. The reprogramming of somatic cells into gametes (in vitro gametogenesis) or embryos (blastoids) may entirely change the methods used to propagate elite genetics from female animals. Despite important advances in new technology, there are also important questions and researchable topics that need to be addressed so that the field of dairy reproduction can advance. These include automating or simplifying the current method of artificial insemination, addressing the short lifespan of sperm in the reproductive tract, and solving fertilization failure and embryonic loss following insemination. Embryo technologies await new discoveries to improve embryo yield from donor animals, increase the development of embryos in culture, reduce the damage caused by freezing embryos, and effectively evaluate embryo quality before transfer. The collective result of new knowledge and new technology will drive further improvements in genetics, fertility, and the efficiency of reproduction in high-producing dairy cattle.","[Lucy, M.

The searched literature was then screened according to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The critical data were extracted and analyzed using Review Manager software5.4.1. Pooled effects were calculated on the basis of data attributes by mean difference (MD) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of the studies.ResultsA total of 13 studies and 949 patients met the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis, 445 in the UBE-LIF group and 504 in the MIS-TLIF group. UBE-TLIF was superior to MIS-TLIF in terms of intraoperative blood flow, postoperative drainage flow, duration of hospital stay, VAS score for low back pain and ODI score, but the operative time was longer than MIS-TLIF group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of total complication rate, modified Macnab grading criteria, fusion rate, VAS score of leg pain, lumbar lordosis, intervertebral disk height.ConclusionBoth UBE-TLIF and MIS-TLIF are effective surgical modalities for the treatment of degenerative lumbar spine diseases. They have similar treatment outcomes, but UBE-TLIF has the advantages of less intraoperative blood loss, shorter postoperative hospital stay, and faster recovery.Trial registration: This study has been registered at INPLASY.COM (No. INPLASY202320087).","[Han, Hao; Li, Jie] Grad Sch Xuzhou Med Univ, XuzhouJiangsu, Peoples R China; [Song, Yifan; Li, Jie] Grad Sch Bengbu Med Coll, BengbuAnhui, Peoples R China; [Han, Hao; Song, Yifan; Li, Yiming; Zhou, Hengcai; Li, Jie] Xuzhou Cent Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Affiliat Xuzhou Clin Coll Xuzhou Med Univ, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Fu, Yufei; Li, Jie] Xuzhou Cent Hosp, Dept Med Imaging, Xuzhou Clin Coll Xuzhou Med Univ, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Li, J (corresponding author), Grad Sch Bengbu Med Coll, BengbuAnhui, Peoples R China.;Li, J (corresponding author), Xuzhou Cent Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Affiliat Xuzhou Clin Coll Xuzhou Med Univ, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Li, J (corresponding author), Xuzhou Cent Hosp, Dept Med Imaging, Xuzhou Clin Coll Xuzhou Med Univ, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",lijie87919@163.com,,,Not applicable.,Not applicable.,Not applicable.,41,22,26,0,6,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1749-799X,,J ORTHOP SURG RES,J.

Hybrid Nature-based Solutions (HNbS) have emerged as promising alternatives, yet current taxonomic classifications remain ambiguous and insufficient to accommodate emerging technologies. This synthetic review analyses the evolution and current role of NbS in coastal climate change adaptation through a comprehensive juxtaposition of design principles and functional mechanisms of engineered and nature-based coastal defences. The review synthesises knowledge from sustainable climate adaptation and digital fabrication literature to establish precise taxonomic classifications for solutions that integrate engineered and nature-based approaches, namely HNbS. The analysis reveals gaps in the existing HNbS taxonomy, particularly regarding structures enabled by digital fabrication technologies. The three identified, distinct categories of HNbS are: (1) Hybrid Nature-based Strategies, combining engineered and natural elements at planning scales; (2) Hybrid Nature-based Modules, integrating both components within individual structures; and (3) Confluent Hybrid Nature-based Solutions, representing an emerging category where engineering and natural systems converge at material or microorganism scales, offering distinctly engineered infrastructures with natural characteristics. While contemporary hybrid approaches are being implemented, Confluent Hybrid Nature-based Solutions under research, may face a critical timing mismatch due to a gap between lengthy innovation timelines and urgent adaptation needs. Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways provide a framework for strategically accommodating these emerging innovations, enabling early-stage solutions and performance demonstration under real-world conditions. The new taxonomic framework outlined in this study prevents imprecise terminology and provides a foundation for robust, low-regret coastal adaptation strategies addressing contemporary and future coastal pressures like climate change impacts and biodiversity conservation requirements.","[David, C.

Now, transforming these huge volumes of data into knowledge is the primary challenge in computational biology. The traditional methods of data analysis have failed to carry out the task. Hence, researchers are turning to machine learning based approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional big data. In machine learning, once a model is trained with a training dataset, it can be applied on a testing dataset which is independent. In current times, deep learning algorithms further promote the application of machine learning in several field of biology including plant virology. Main body Plant viruses have emerged as one of the principal global threats to food security due to their devastating impact on crops and vegetables. The emergence of new viral strains and species help viruses to evade the concurrent preventive methods. According to a survey conducted in 2014, plant viruses are anticipated to cause a global yield loss of more than thirty billion USD per year. In order to design effective, durable and broad-spectrum management protocols, it is very important to understand the mechanistic details of viral pathogenesis. The application of machine learning enables precise diagnosis of plant viral diseases at an early stage. Furthermore, the development of several machine learning-guided bioinformatics platforms has primed plant virologists to understand the host-virus interplay better. In addition, machine learning has tremendous potential in deciphering the pattern of plant virus evolution and emergence as well as in developing viable control options. Conclusions Considering a significant progress in the application of machine learning in understanding plant virology, this review highlights an introductory note on machine learning and comprehensively discusses the trends and prospects of machine learning in the diagnosis of viral diseases, understanding host-virus interplay and emergence of plant viruses.","[Ghosh, Dibyendu; Chakraborty, Supriya] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Life Sci, Mol Virol Lab, New Delhi 110067, India; [Chakraborty, Srija; Kodamana, Hariprasad] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Chem Engn, New Delhi 110016, India; [Kodamana, Hariprasad] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Sch Artificial Intelligence, New Delhi 110016, India","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi","Chakraborty, S (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Life Sci, Mol Virol Lab, New Delhi 110067, India.",supriyachakrasls@yahoo.com,,"Kodamana, Hariprasad/0000-0003-3166-2712; GHOSH, DIBYENDU/0000-0001-9707-0635","Department of Biotechnology, Govt of India [BT/PR31648/GET/119/283/2019]; BRNS [51/14/11/2019-BRNS]; SERB India [CRG/2018/001555]; Prime Minister's Research Fellow (PMRF) scholarship","Department of Biotechnology, Govt of India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India); BRNS(Department of Atomic Energy (DAE)Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS)); SERB India(Department of Science & Technology (India)Science Engineering Research Board (SERB), India); Prime Minister's Research Fellow (PMRF) scholarship","This work was supported by a grant from the Department of Biotechnology, Govt of India vide grant no.

Still, the lack of scientific knowledge, infrastructure, and nonexistence of proper storage facilities forces the farmers to sell their produce in the nearby market immediately after harvest. Although refrigeration and cold storage facilities are developing now to store the horticultural produce, they are not only energy-intensive but also require huge investment. The majority of farmers cannot afford these facilities even on a rental basis for their harvest. The metabolism of fresh horticultural commodities continues even after the harvest and the rate of deterioration rises because their maturation, senescence, and unfavorable atmospheric factors predominate, especially in tropical countries. A low-cost, energy-efficient, environmentally benign and made from the locally available material evaporative cooling chamber (ECC) may resolve some of these issues of on-farm storage. It is an efficient and cost-effective way to reduce the temperature and increase relative humidity inside the chamber. A lot of evaporative cooling structures were developed, but still, this simple technology did not make a dent in the production catchment rural areas. In this article, an attempt is made to review the basic principle, methods, factors that influence storage conditions of perishables, design consideration of different evaporative cooling systems, major limitations, challenges, and constraints of its low adoption. The recent developments for modifications and improvement in existing ECCs using the latest technological interventions with the help of Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things and their cost analysis are also highlighted. Practical Applications Adoption of a low-cost and environmentally friendly evaporative cooling system for on-farm storage made from locally available materials will reduce postharvest losses and improve the economic status of farmers.","[Patel, Deep P.; Jain, Sanjay Kumar] Maharana Pratap Univ Agr & Technol, Coll Technol & Engn, Dept Proc & Food Engn, Udaipur 313001, Rajasthan, India; [Lakhawat, Shreedhar Singh] Maharana Pratap Univ Agr & Technol, Rajasthan Coll Agr, Dept Hort, Udaipur, Rajasthan, India; [Wadhawan, Nikita] Maharana Pratap Univ Agr & Technol, Coll Dairy & Food Technol, Dept Food Technol, Udaipur, Rajasthan, India",College of Technology & Engineering Udaipur,"Patel, DP (corresponding author), Maharana Pratap Univ Agr & Technol, Coll Technol & Engn, Dept Proc & Food Engn, Udaipur 313001, Rajasthan, India.",dp2manjrol@gmail.com,"Jain, Sanjay Kumar/AAY-5968-2020; Wadhawan, Nikita/KHU-7165-2024; , Deep P Patel/JBS-6520-2023","Jain, Sanjay Kumar/0000-0002-2692-7555; , Deep P Patel/0000-0003-0897-5948",Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) (Government of India),Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) (Government of India)(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India),This study was supported by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) (Government of India).,97,11,12,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0145-8876,1745-4530,J FOOD PROCESS ENG,J.

They are advantageous over fossil fuel vehicles in many aspects: for example, they consume no fuel, are economical, and only require charging the internal batteries, which power the motor for propulsion. Thus, due to their numerous advantages, research is necessary to improve the technological aspects that can enhance electric vehicles' overall performance and efficiency. However, electric vehicle charging stations are the key hindrance to their adoption. Charging stations will affect grid stability and may lead to altering different parameters, e.g., power losses and voltage deviation when integrated randomly into the distribution system. The distributed generation, along with charging stations with the best location and size, can be a solution that mitigates the above concerns. Metaheuristic techniques can be used to find the optimal siting and sizing of distributed generations and electric vehicle charging stations. This review provides an exhaustive review of various methods and scientific research previously undertaken to optimize the placement and dimensions of electric vehicle charging stations and distributed generation. We summarize the previous work undertaken over the last five years on the multi-objective placement of distributed generations and electric vehicle charging stations. Key areas have focused on optimization techniques, technical parameters, IEEE networks, simulation tools, distributed generation types, and objective functions. Future development trends and current research have been extensively explored, along with potential future advancement and gaps in knowledge. Therefore, at the conclusion of this review, the optimization of electric vehicle charging stations and distributed generation presents both the practical and theoretical importance of implementing metaheuristic algorithms in real-world scenarios. In the same way, their practical integration will provide the transportation system with a robust and sustainable solution.","[Kumar, Mahesh; Kumar, Aneel; Soomro, Amir Mahmood; Shaikh, Muzamil Ahmed] Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Jamshoro 76062, Pakistan; [Baloch, Mazhar] Asharqiyah Univ, Coll Engn, Ibra 400, Oman; [Chaudhary, Sohaib Tahir] Dhofar Univ, Coll Engn, Salala 201, Oman",Mehran University Engineering & Technology; Dhofar University,"Baloch, M (corresponding author), Asharqiyah Univ, Coll Engn, Ibra 400, Oman.",rathii.mahesh@faculty.muet.edu.pk; aneel4uu@gmail.com; amir.soomro@faculty.muet.edu.pk; mazhar.baloch@asu.edu.om; stahir@du.edu.om; muzamil.shaikh@gmail.com,"Hussain Baloch, Mazhar/AGS-3786-2022; Kumar, Mahesh/S-8443-2016","Hussain Baloch, Mazhar/0000-0002-4027-049X; Kumar, Mahesh/0000-0003-3207-6897","A' Sharqiyah University, Ibra Oman","A' Sharqiyah University, Ibra Oman","The authors acknowledged the A' Sharqiyah University, Ibra Oman for the support and facilities to complete this research with the collaboration of Dhofar University, Oman and Mehran University, Pakistan",109,4,4,4,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2032-6653,,WORLD ELECTR VEHIC J,World Electr.

Nevertheless, satisfying both goals require the implementation of new methods. The present assessment was based on over 190 scientific publications. Forecasts from the beginning of the 21st century showed that the increase in temperature and CO(2 )concentration would improve the productivity of crops by extending the growing season and allow for the cultivation of new species. However, this beneficial effect may be limited by the increasing intensity of the extreme weather phenomena such as: rainstorm, droughts, early frosts, storms etc. Here, we review more recent studies which indicate, however, that this beneficial effect of climate change will not be permanent and, consequently, will significantly reduce crop yields. Climate change is forcing the agronomy sector to implement adaptive methods for minimizing possible crop losses consisting, inter alia, (i) using crop species/varieties that are less sensitive; (ii) optimizing water management; (III) improving pest, disease and weed control efficiency. The pressure on the agriculture sector to increase food production due to the increase in the human population and the present hunger in specific regions run counter to the need to reduce the adverse climate impacts of agriculture. The current state of knowledge indicates that despite the implementation of new technologies, agricultural measures will not be able to significantly reduce climate change. Indeed, these approaches will not replace the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors. However, without the participation of agronomy in reducing GHG emissions by increasing carbon sequestration, the goals of the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris will not be achieved.","[Dmuchowski, Wojciech; Gworek, Barbara] Natl Res Inst, Inst Environm Protect, Warsaw, Poland; [Baczewska-Dabrowska, Aneta H.

Even utilized modern project management (PM) approaches in claim resolution did not offer comprehensive solutions. Incomplete resolution of a claim results in a dispute, a more challenging, lengthy, and complex problem. Some construction specialists have tried incorporating new technologies, exclusively unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), in construction to perform certain activities, contributing to enhanced efficiencies, productivity, and practicalities. While the available literature does contain rich discussions of UAV applications in various construction tasks, it does lack broad investigations on UAV rationale to resolve complicated claims. Accordingly, a systematic review is conducted to bridge this knowledge gap, identifying multiple UAV workabilities and feasibilities in claim resolution. A meta-analysis is applied to offer crucial statistics on claim value and length universally, clarifying UAV importance in minimizing corresponding financial losses and time. The systematic review outcomes revealed that UAVs could participate in supplying concise, rapid, massive, flexible, and high-resolution data to resolve claims. They can replace traditional physical inspection needed in particular situations, traveling to farthest sites, covering larger surface areas, collecting accurate data during snowy and rainy days or disasters, helping answer owner inquiries and unnecessary complaints, and resolving claims. Also, their feasibility is noted during snowy and rainy days or other situations where physical inspection is not possible, causing the postponement of meeting sessions, either in construction companies or courts, until proofs are provided. Their contribution is reflected in clarifying some gray data correlated with contract terms, delays, damages, site conditions, cost variations, rework, and misunderstandings. It is hoped that construction professionals could benefit from robust UAV applications in PM, certainly in claim resolution. The created research framework is instrumental in enabling UAV involvement in resolving claims reliably.","[Al Omari, Mohammad; Seyrfar, Abolfazl; Alqaisi, Aaraf; Osman, Ibrahim] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil Mat & Environm Engn, 1200 Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Ataei, Hossein] Univ Illinois, Undergrad Studies, 1200 W Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Ataei, Hossein] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil Mat & Environm Engn, Construct Engn & Management Program, 1200 W Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Al Omari, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Civil Mat & Environm Engn, 1200 Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",maloma6@uic.edu; hataei@uic.edu; aseyrf2@uic.edu; aalqai3@uic.edu; iosman4@uic.edu,"; Al-Omari, Mohammad/MYA-7714-2025","Seyrfar, Abolfazl/0000-0002-3742-7249; Osman, Ibrahim/0000-0002-1930-6822; Al-Omari, Mohammad/0009-0006-2122-5059; AlQaisi, Aaraf/0000-0001-7334-2640",,,,135,0,0,1,1,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1943-4162,1943-4170,J LEG AFF DISPUTE RE,J.

More specifically, growers should use tools that enable informed decisions on whether and when crop protection is needed, and which methods should be used. These tools include risk algorithms, decision rules, intervention thresholds, and decision support systems (DSSs), collectively named decision tools (DTs). A large number of DTs have been developed and made available to advisors and farmers, mainly through Internet-based systems. The adoption rate of these systems, however, has been low because of technical limitations and farmer perceptions. Fragmentation of the DTs offered, poor local implementation, and restriction to particular users are among the causes for low adoption. If properly mobilised, the use and effects of DTs could substantially be increased. Sharing of IPM DTs has a strong potential for providing wider access to the existing knowledge, for fostering IPM implementation, and for supporting plant health policies. In this article, we outline an overall approach to develop a web-based platform, in which DTs are shared and made widely available. Such a platform can include a range of ready-to-use DTs, i.e. DTs which are currently available, that have been field-validated, and which are already being used in some agricultural contexts. The platform also provides open, full documentation of DTs, makes DTs available for validation and adaptation in different agricultural contexts, and makes DTs easily available for multiple kinds of end-users involved in IPM (farmers, IPM experts, public and private information and service providers, and policy makers). We also consider how DT sharing can reduce both the technological and behavioural limitations of existing plant health management systems.","[Rossi, Vittorio; Caffi, Tito; Salotti, Irene; Fedele, Giorgia] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore Piacenza, DiProVeS, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Fedele, G (corresponding author), Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore Piacenza, DiProVeS, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy.",giorgia.fedele@unicatt.it,"Fedele, Giorgia/GWB-9610-2022; Salotti, Irene/AIE-0644-2022; Caffi, Tito/I-3626-2012","Fedele, Giorgia/0000-0001-5974-9719; Salotti, Irene/0000-0001-9930-0975;","Part of this work was developed within the SHARE4IPM proposal and submitted under the call H2020-SFS-2018-2020.

Although its benefits are widely acknowledged, IPM is not universally practiced by farmers. Potato farming, which produces one of the most important staple crops in the world, provides a good illustration of the issues surrounding IPM adoption. Potatoes are attacked by a complex of insect pests that can inflict catastrophic crop losses. Potato production has gone through the processes of consolidation and intensification, which are linked to increased pest problems, particularly selection for insecticide-resistant pest populations. While use of insecticides remains the most common method of pest control in potatoes, other techniques, including crop rotation and natural ene- mies, are also available. In addition, there are effective monitoring techniques for many potato pests. However, reliable economic thresholds are often lacking. Potato ecosystems are complex and diverse; therefore, the knowledge necessary for developing ecologically based pest manage- ment is not easily obtained or transferable. Furthermore, potato systems change with the arrival of new pest species and the evolution of existing pests. Modern technological advances, such as remote sensing and molecular biotechnology, are likely to improve potato IPM. However, these tools are not going to solve all problems. IPM is not just about integrating different techniques; it is also about integrating the efforts and concerns of all stakeholders. The collaboration of farmers and scientists in agricultural research is needed to foster the development of IPM systems that are appropriate for grower implementation and thus more likely to be adopted. Additional em- phasis also needs to be placed on the fact that not only does IPM decrease degradation of the environment, but it also improves the economic well-being of its practitioners.","[Gao, Yulin] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Alyokhin, Andrei] Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Orono, ME USA; [Prager, Sean M.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Plant Sci, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Reitz, Stuart] Oregon State Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Ontario, OR USA; [Huseth, Anders] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Raleigh, NC USA","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Plant Protection, CAAS; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Saskatchewan; Oregon State University; North Carolina State University","Gao, YL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Beijing, Peoples R China.",gaoyulin@caas.cn; alyokhin@maine.edu; sean.prager@usask.ca; stuart.reitz@oregonstate.edu; ashuseth@ncsu.edu,"Alyokhin, Andrei/ABH-2287-2021; Reitz, Stuart/AAC-4467-2019","Huseth, Anders/0000-0002-5273-8555","National Natural Science Foundation of China [32372535]; Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research [2021B0301030004]; Science and Technology Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences [2060302]; US Department of Agriculture-NIFA Hatch Projects [NC2884, ME032125]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research; Science and Technology Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; US Department of Agriculture-NIFA Hatch Projects,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 32372535) , the Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research (grant 2021B0301030004) , and the Science and Technology Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (grant 2060302) .

The IIoT, a seamless integration of the physical and digital realms with minimal human intervention, has ushered in radical changes in the economy and modern business practices. At the heart of the IIoT lies its ability to gather and analyze vast volumes of data, which is then harnessed by artificial intelligence systems to perform intelligent tasks such as optimizing networked units' performance, identifying and correcting errors, and implementing proactive maintenance measures. However, implementing IIoT systems is fraught with difficulties, notably in terms of security and privacy. IIoT implementations are susceptible to sophisticated security attacks at various levels of networking and communication architecture. The complex and often heterogeneous nature of these systems makes it difficult to ensure availability, confidentiality, and integrity, raising concerns about mistrust in network operations, privacy breaches, and potential loss of critical, personal, and sensitive information of the network's end-users. To address these issues, this study aims to investigate the privacy requirements of an IIoT ecosystem as outlined by industry standards. It provides a comprehensive overview of the IIoT, its advantages, disadvantages, challenges, and the imperative need for industrial privacy. The research methodology encompasses a thorough literature review to gather existing knowledge and insights on the subject. Additionally, it explores how the IIoT is transforming the manufacturing industry and enhancing industrial processes, incorporating case studies and real-world examples to illustrate its practical applications and impact. Also, the research endeavors to offer actionable recommendations on implementing privacy-enhancing measures and establishing a secure IIoT ecosystem.","[Demertzi, Vasiliki] Int Hellen Univ, Sch Sci, Comp Sci Dept, Kavala Campus, Kavala 65404, Greece; [Demertzis, Stavros] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Fac Engn, Sch Spatial Planning & Dev, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Demertzis, Konstantinos] Hellen Open Univ, Sch Sci & Technol Informat Studies, Patras 26335, Greece",International Hellenic University; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Hellenic Open University,"Demertzis, K (corresponding author), Hellen Open Univ, Sch Sci & Technol Informat Studies, Patras 26335, Greece.",demertzis.konstantinos@ac.eap.gr,"Demertzis, Stefanos/AEQ-9926-2022; Demertzis, Konstantinos/S-8835-2017",,,,,135,22,23,1,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4893,ALGORITHMS,Algorithms,AUG,2023,16.0,8,,,,,,378,10.3390/a16080378,0.0,,32,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,Q4YP0,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001057595000001,0

The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has significantly improved the research on this pest, and its genome structure, gene expression profiles, and host-plant interactions are being unveiled. The integration of genomic sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics has greatly increased our understanding of the biological characteristics of planthoppers, which will benefit the identification of resistant rice varieties and strategies for their control. Strategies like more optimal genome assembly and single-cell RNA-seq help to update our knowledge of gene control structure and cell type-specific usage, shedding light on how planthoppers adjust as well. However, to date, a comprehensive genome-wide investigation of the genetic interactions and population dynamics of BPHs has yet to be exhaustively performed using these next-generation omics technologies. This review summarizes the recent advances and new perspectives regarding the use of omics data for the BPH, with specific emphasis on the integration of both fields to help develop more sustainable pest management strategies. These findings, in combination with those of post-transcriptional and translational modifications involving non-coding RNAs as well as epigenetic variations, further detail intricate host-brown planthopper interaction dynamics, especially regarding resistant rice varieties. Finally, the symbiogenesis of the symbiotic microbial community in a planthopper can be characterized through metagenomic approaches, and its importance in enhancing virulence traits would offer novel opportunities for plant protection by manipulating host-microbe interactions. The concerted diverse omics approaches collectively identified the holistic and complex mechanisms of virulence variation in BPHs, which enables efficient deployment into rice resistance breeding as well as sustainable pest management.","[Wang, Xinfeng; Wang, Yaxuan; Yang, Houhong; Liu, Fang; Cai, Yubiao; Xiao, Jing; Fu, Qiang; Wan, Pinjun] China Natl Rice Res Inst, Natl Key Lab Rice Biol Breeding, Hangzhou 311401, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; China National Rice Research Institute, CAAS","Fu, Q; Wan, PJ (corresponding author), China Natl Rice Res Inst, Natl Key Lab Rice Biol Breeding, Hangzhou 311401, Peoples R China.",wangxinfeng0211@163.com; wangyaxuan604@163.com; 82101221215@caas.cn; qlyj0331@163.com; caiyubiao2020@163.com; xiaojing00004@163.com; fuqiang@caas.cn; wanpinjun@caas.cn,"Wan, Pin-Jun/IQU-9234-2023","Wan, Pin-Jun/0000-0002-6786-2567",The Pioneer and Leading Goose R&D Program of Zhejiang [2022C02034]; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Public Welfare Research Institute [202406]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFD1401100]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LY22C140008]; China Agriculture Research System [CARS-01]; Rice Pest Management Research Group of the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of China Academy of Agricultural Science,The Pioneer and Leading Goose R&D Program of Zhejiang; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Public Welfare Research Institute; National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); China Agriculture Research System; Rice Pest Management Research Group of the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of China Academy of Agricultural Science,"This research was funded by the Pioneer and Leading Goose R&D Program of Zhejiang (2022C02034), the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Public Welfare Research Institute (CPSIBRF-CNRRI-202406), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFD1401100), the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LY22C140008), the China Agriculture Research System (CARS-01), and the Rice Pest Management Research Group of the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of China Academy of Agricultural Science (CAAS-ASTIP-2021-CNRRI).",100,2,2,6,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1661-6596,1422-0067,INT J MOL SCI,Int.

Indian sub-continent has a good capability to tackle the task of meeting the worldwide demand for such products due to its rich wealth in case of herbal medicine. Historically, Indian people conventionally played a vital role in the development and management of these biological sources and also preserve their pertinent data that were accumulated via trial and error over centuries. Objectives: Due to tremendous global resurgence in traditional and alternative healthcare systems, the market for herbal medicines has grown at an impressive rate and therefore has great economic importance. However, the primary barriers to the expansion of herbal medicine include biodiversity loss, over-exploitation and improper use of medicinal plants, industrialization, biopiracy, and a lack of regulation and infrastructure. For the expansion of herbal medicine usage in the twenty-first century, conservation, proper research based on traditional knowledge, quality control of herbal medicine, and correct documentation are required. Methods: The desired and encouraging testifying items for systematically evaluated reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) standards were opted. A literature exploration was accomplished utilizing SCIENCE DIRECT, SCOPUS and GOOGLE SCHOLAR to locate articles for the present scenario about traditional and herbal medicines. Conclusion: The availability and type of conventional medicine safety and effectiveness data are far from sufficient to fulfil the requirements required to support its use globally. This review paper examines the restrictions and issues associated with conservation, science and technology, regulatory constraints, potential usage of herbal medicines, the drug production industry, safety and efficacy, and the prospects for traditional remedies on a nationally and internationally scale.","[Saggart, Sachin] Amritsar Grp Coll, Dept Pharmaceut, Meharbanpur, Punjab, India; [Mir, Prince Ahad] Khalsa Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmacognsoy & Phytochem, Amritsar, Punjab, India; [Kumar, Nishant] Khalsa Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut, Amritsar, Punjab, India; [Chawla, Apporva] Khalsa Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmacol, Amritsar, Punjab, India; [Uppals, Jasreen] Khalsa Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, Amritsar, Punjab, India; [Shilpa] Amritsar Grp Coll, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, Meharbanpur, Punjab, India; [Kaur, Anmoldeep] Amritsar Grp Coll, Dept Pharmacol, Meharbanpur, Punjab, India",,"Mir, RA (corresponding author), Khalsa Coll Pharm, Pharmacognsoy & Phytochem, GT Rd, Amritsar 143002, Punjab, India.",princeahad@kashmiruniversity.net,,,,,,77,59,76,0,17,PHCOG NET,KARNATAKA,"17, 2ND FLR, BUDDHA VIHAR RD, NEAR SPORTS ZONE, COX TOWN, BENGALURU, KARNATAKA, 560005, INDIA",0974-8490,0976-4836,PHARMACOGN RES,Pharmacogn.

Kiwifruit Bacterial Canker (KBC), caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), was selected as a case study for being an example of a pandemic disease that severely impacted crop production, leading to huge economic losses, and for the effort that has been made to control this disease. This review provides an in-depth and critical analysis on the scientific progress made for developing alternative tools for sustainable KBC management. Their status in terms of technological maturity is discussed and a set of opportunities and threats are also presented. The gradual replacement of susceptible kiwifruit cultivars, with more tolerant ones, significantly reduced KBC incidence and was a major milestone for Psa containment - which highlights the importance of plant breeding. Nonetheless, this is a very laborious process. Moreover, the potential threat of Psa evolving to more virulent biovars, or resistant lineages to existing control methods, strengthens the need of keep on exploring effective and more environmentally friendly tools for KBC management. Currently, plant elicitors and beneficial fungi and bacteria are already being used in the field with some degree of success. Precision agriculture technologies, for improving early disease detection and preventing pathogen dispersal, are also being developed and optimized. These include hyperspectral technologies and forecast models for Psa risk assessment, with the latter being slightly more advanced in terms of technological maturity. Additionally, plant protection products based on innovative formulations with molecules with antibacterial activity against Psa (e.g., essential oils, phages and antimicrobial peptides) have been validated primarily in laboratory trials and with few compounds already reaching field application. The lessons learned with this pandemic disease, and the acquired scientific and technological knowledge, can be of importance for sustainably managing other plant diseases and handling future pandemic outbreaks.","[Santos, Miguel G.; Nunes da Silva, Marta; Carvalho, Susana M.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing subcutaneous semaglutide with placebo or any other antidiabetic agent in adults with T2D were eligible. The risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined to synthesize the results.ResultsA total of 17 trials enrolling 14,940 T2D patients were included. For efficacy, compared with placebo, semaglutide exhibited beneficial effects on glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) control [MD -0.97%, 95% CI (-1.33, -0.62), I2 = 91%; MD -1.36%, 95% CI (-1.59, -1.13), I2 = 84%, semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg, respectively], body weight reduction, blood pressure control. At the same time, subcutaneous semaglutide 0.5 and 1 mg reduced HbA1c by 0.56% (95% CI 0.32 to 0.80) and 0.63% (95% CI 0.35 to 0.91) compared to other glucose-lowering agents. For tolerability, semaglutide did not increase the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed hypoglycaemia, acute pancreatitis and diabetic retinopathy compared to placebo or active comparators, but did increase the risk of nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.ConclusionsSemaglutide has a better effect on glycaemic control and weight loss than other therapies.

This review synthesized online learning developments aimed at replacing previously face-to-face 'classroom' activities for postgraduate learners. Methods Four online databases (CINAHL, Embase, PsychINFO, and PubMed) and MedEdPublish were searched through 21 December 2020. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias. The PICRAT technology integration framework was applied to examine how teachers integrated and learners engaged with technology. A descriptive synthesis and outcomes were reported. A thematic analysis explored limitations and lessons learned. Results Fifty-one publications were included. Fifteen collaborations were featured, including international partnerships and national networks of program directors. Thirty-nine developments described pivots of existing educational offerings online and twelve described new developments. Most interventions included synchronous activities (n Fif5). Virtual engagement was promoted through chat, virtual whiteboards, polling, and breakouts. Teacher's use of technology largely replaced traditional practice. Student engagement was largely interactive. Underpinning theories were uncommon. Quality assessments revealed moderate to high risk of bias in study reporting and methodology. Forty-five developments assessed reaction; twenty-five attitudes, knowledge or skills; and two behavior. Outcomes were markedly positive. Eighteen publications reported social media or other outcomes, including reach, engagement, and participation. Limitations included loss of social interactions, lack of hands-on experiences, challenges with technology and issues with study design. Lessons learned highlighted the flexibility of online learning, as well as practical advice to optimize the online environment. Conclusions This review offers guidance to educators attempting to optimize learning in a post-pandemic world. Future developments would benefit from leveraging collaborations, considering technology integration frameworks, underpinning developments with theory, exploring additional outcomes, and designing and reporting developments in a manner that supports replication.","[Khamees, Deena] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, McGovern Med Sch, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Peterson, William; Commissaris, Carolyn; Davis, Mallory; Spadafore, Maxwell; Griffith, Max; Hider, Ahmad; Pawlik, Cameron; Stojan, Jennifer] Univ Michigan, Med Sch, Emergency Med, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Patricio, Madalena] Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Lisbon, Portugal; [Pawlikowska, Teresa] Univ Med & Hlth Sci, Royal Coll Surg, Dublin, Ireland; [Austin, Andrea; Daniel, Michelle] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego Sch Med, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Grafton-Clarke, Ciaran; Uraiby, Hussein] Univ Leicester, Sch Med, Leicester, Leics, England; [Thammasitboon, Satid] Texas Childrens Hosp, Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Gordon, Morris] Blackpool Victoria Hosp, Blackpool, England; [Gordon, Morris] Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Med, Preston, Lancs, England",University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Universidade de Lisboa; Royal College of Surgeons - Ireland; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Leicester; Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor College Medical Hospital; University of Lancashire,"Khamees, D (corresponding author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, McGovern Med Sch, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",deena.khamees@uth.tmc.edu,"; Grafton-Clarke, Ciaran/AAC-7159-2021; Griffith, Max/HGT-9815-2022","Spadafore, Maxwell/0000-0001-5927-1428; Grafton-Clarke, Ciaran/0000-0002-8537-0806; Hider, Ahmad/0000-0001-8897-8932; Khamees, Deena/0000-0002-2262-9964; Peterson, William/0000-0003-3950-3054; Uraiby, Hussein/0000-0002-5797-9227; Pawlikowska, Teresa/0000-0001-8432-3488; Griffith, Max/0000-0002-7596-5785; Davis, Mallory/0000-0002-0324-7696; Thammasitboon, Satid/0000-0001-6896-092X",,,,79,28,36,2,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-159X,1466-187X,MED TEACH,Med.

Besides mediating normal bone physiology, they also have important roles in various metabolic bone diseases, including osteoporosis. SSPCs are of tremendous interest because they represent prime future targets for osteoanabolic therapies and bone regenerative medicine. Remarkable progress has been made in characterizing various SSC and SSPC populations in postnatal bone. SSPCs exist in the periosteum and within the bone marrow stroma, including subsets localizing around arteriolar and sinusoidal blood vessels; they can display osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic and/or fibroblastic potential, and exert critical haematopoiesis-supportive functions. However, much remains to be clarified. By the current markers, bona fide SSCs are commonly contained within broader SSPC populations characterized by considerable heterogeneity and overlap, whose common versus specific functions in health and disease have not been fully unravelled. Here, we review the present knowledge of the identity, fates and relationships of SSPC populations in the postnatal bone environment, their contributions to bone maintenance, the changes observed upon ageing, and the effect of metabolic diseases such as osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus. Various populations of skeletal stem and progenitor cells (SSPCs) exist within the native skeletal environments of humans and mice, with complex roles in the maintenance of bone tissue. This Review discusses the current state of knowledge of the identity and roles of SSPCs in skeletal health, disease and ageing. Skeletal stem and/or progenitor cells (SSPCs) have crucial roles in bone physiology by giving rise to osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes, regulating osteoclastogenesis and angiogenesis and providing haematopoiesis-supportive stromal cells.Pure populations of skeletal stem cells (SSCs) are challenging to identify; by the currently available cell surface and genetic markers, bona fide SSCs are usually contained within broader SSPC populations and lineages.Ageing affects SSPCs cell-autonomously and by disrupting their niches, and is linked to reduced availability and adipogenesis-biased differentiation of SSPCs, cellular senescence, loss of bone mass, vascular decline and inflammageing.SSPCs are involved in various metabolic and endocrine bone diseases, including postmenopausal osteoporosis, diabetic bone disease, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, and probably many others, but their precise roles require further clarification.Further in-depth characterization of the identity and regulatory control of SSPCs, particularly human SSPCs, is needed to explore and utilize the full therapeutic potential of these cells.Advances in single-cell multiomics, 3D-imaging technologies and genetic systems provide powerful tools for untangling heterogeneity and increasing insights into the specific markers, localization, relationships and function of mouse and human SSPC populations in health and disease.","[Melis, Seppe; Trompet, Dana; Maes, Christa] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Skeletal Biol & Engn Res Ctr SBE, Dept Dev & Regenerat, Lab Skeletal Cell Biol & Physiol SCEBP, Leuven, Belgium; [Trompet, Dana; Chagin, Andrei S.] Gothenburg Univ, Inst Med, Sahlgrenska Acad, Ctr Bone & Arthrit Res,Dept Internal Med & Clin Nu, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Trompet, Dana; Chagin, Andrei S.] Karolinska Inst, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Stockholm, Sweden",KU Leuven; University of Gothenburg; Karolinska Institutet,"Maes, C (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Skeletal Biol & Engn Res Ctr SBE, Dept Dev & Regenerat, Lab Skeletal Cell Biol & Physiol SCEBP, Leuven, Belgium.",christa.maes@kuleuven.be,"; Chagin, Anei/F-4080-2014","Maes, Christa/0000-0003-4243-5486; Chagin, Anei/0000-0002-2696-5850; Trompet, Dana/0000-0001-9472-6184","EU (European Research Council (ERC) [282131]; Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (MCSA) Innovative Training Network (ITN) [721432]; Fund for Scientific Research of Flanders (FWO) [G0E7116N, G0C8519N, G0B5219N, G078923N, G038224N]; University of Leuven (KU Leuven) [C14/18/105, PGUM/22/023, C14/24/151]; FWO PhD fellowship support [11N5322N]; FWO [1S26717N]; Novo Nordisk Foundation [NNF21OC0070314]; Swedish Research Council [2020-02298]; Swedish government; ALF [ALFGBG-966178]; Swedish Research Council [2020-02298] Funding Source: Swedish Research Council",EU (European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)); Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (MCSA) Innovative Training Network (ITN); Fund for Scientific Research of Flanders (FWO)(FWO); University of Leuven (KU Leuven)(KU Leuven); FWO PhD fellowship support; FWO(FWO); Novo Nordisk Foundation(Novo Nordisk Foundation); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Swedish government; ALF; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"C.M. acknowledges past and present research support on topics related to this Review from the EU (European Research Council (ERC) starting grant #282131), the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (MCSA) Innovative Training Network (ITN) (#721432), the Fund for Scientific Research of Flanders (FWO) (research projects G0E7116N, G0C8519N, G0B5219N, G078923N, G038224N) and the University of Leuven (KU Leuven) (grants C14/18/105, PGUM/22/023, C14/24/151).

The mechanisms responsible for the initiation and maintenance of adequate and synchronized uterine activity that are necessary for labor and delivery result from a complex interplay of hormonal, mechanical, and electrical factors that have not yet been fully elucidated. Monitoring uterine activity during term labor and in suspected preterm labor is an important component of obstetrical care because cases of inadequate and excessive uterine activity can be associated with substantial maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Inadequate labor progress is a common challenge encountered in intrapartum care, with labor dystocia being the most common indication for cesarean deliveries performed during labor. Hereafter, an accurate assessment of uterine activity during labor can assist in the management of protracted labor by diagnosing inadequate uterine activity and facilitating the titration of uterotonic medications before a trial of labor is prematurely terminated. Conversely, the ability to diagnose unwanted or excessive uterine activity is also critical in cases of threatened preterm labor, tachysystole, or patients undergoing a trial of labor after cesarean delivery. Knowledge of uterine activity in these cases may guide the use of tocolytic medications or raise suspicion of uterine rupture. Current diagnostic capabilities are less than optimal, hindering the medical management of term and preterm labor. Currently, different methods exist for evaluating uterine activity during labor, including manual palpation, external tocodynamometry, intrauterine pressure monitoring, and electrical uterine myometrial activity tracing. Legacy uterine monitoring techniques have advantages and limitations. External tocodynamometry is the most widespread tool in clinical use owing to its noninvasive nature and its ability to time contractions against the fetal heart rate monitor. However, it does not provide information regarding the strength of uterine contractions and is limited by signal loss with maternal movements. Conversely, the intrauterine pressure catheter quantifies the strength of uterine contractions; however, its use is limited by its invasiveness, risk for complications, and limited additive value in all but few clinical scenarios. New monitoring methods are being used, such as electrical uterine monitoring, which is noninvasive and does not require ruptured membranes. Electrical uterine monitoring has yet to be incorporated into common clinical practice because of lack of access to this technology, its high cost, and the need for appropriate training of clinical staff. Further work needs to be done to increase the accessibility and implementation of this technique by experts, and further research is needed to implement new practical and useful methods. This review describes current clinical tools for uterine activity assessment during labor and discusses their advantages and shortcomings. The review also summarizes current knowledge regarding novel technologies for monitoring uterine contractions that are not yet in widespread use, but are promising and could help improve our understanding of the physiology of labor, delivery, and preterm labor, and ultimately enhance patient care.","[Rosen, Hadar] Mayanei Hayeshua Med Ctr, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Bnei Braq, Israel; [Yogev, Yariv] Tel Aviv Sourasky Med Ctr, Lis Matern & Womens Hosp, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Yogev, Yariv] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University; Tel Aviv University; Sackler Faculty of Medicine; Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center; Tel Aviv University; Sackler Faculty of Medicine,"Rosen, H (corresponding author), Mayanei Hayeshua Med Ctr, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Bnei Braq, Israel.",rosenhadar@gmail.com,,"Rosen, Hadar/0000-0002-0374-9637",,,,97,20,22,2,10,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0002-9378,1097-6868,AM J OBSTET GYNECOL,Am.

Climate change poses critical threats to agricultural production and ecosystem sustainability. One of the most prominent impacts of these changes is the increasing incidence of drought stress on a global scale. Drought reduces the water uptake capacity of plants, decreases photosynthetic efficiency, and negatively affects physiological processes, leading to significant reductions in agricultural yields. Various strategies have been developed to enhance the drought tolerance of plants, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Among these strategies, grafting, a horticultural technique, offers a promising alternative solution to overcome drought stress' adverse effects. Grafting with drought-tolerant rootstocks also stands out for its potential to optimize water management, reduce yield losses, root development, and stress tolerance in plants. The evaluation of grafting technology under drought conditions supports water uptake in plants while helping maintain photosynthetic capacity. Grafting can also enhance uptake of nutrients, translocation of water, and osmoregulation, thereby assisting vegetable crops in surviving under drought stress. Vegetable grafting has been done commercially on tomatoes, sweet peppers, eggplants, watermelons, muskmelon, and cucumbers to enhance plant tolerance to a type of abiotic conditions, like salinity, drought, waterlogging, high or low temperatures, and heavy metal toxicity, as well as to improve yield and quality. This review aims to present the adverse effects of drought stress at plants and the current status of vegetable grafting for drought management using resistant rootstocks. Moreover, we summarized all possible the latest knowledge related to the response of grafted vegetables using different rootstocks on improving plant growth, water use efficiency, photosynthetic capacity, yield and quality. This information may encourage researchers and vegetable farmers to increase vegetable yield and quality under drought stress conditions. We conclude the review with the potential of vegetable grafting to maintain and enhance productivity in agricultural systems under drought stress is demonstrated.","[Ulas, Firdes] Erciyes Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Hort, Kayseri, Turkiye; [Kilic, Fatma Nur; Ulas, Abdullah] Erciyes Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Soil Sci & Plant Nutr, Kayseri, Turkiye",Erciyes University; Erciyes University,"Ulas, F (corresponding author), Erciyes Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Hort, Kayseri, Turkiye.",fulas@erciyes.edu.tr,"ulas, firdes/AAS-2720-2021; Ulas, Abdullah/K-3989-2012","Ulas, Abdullah/0000-0001-9029-031X",,,,165,5,5,13,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2948-264X,2948-2658,J CROP HEALTH,J.

The aim of this study is to distinguish prevalent criteria of human-centricity for AI applications in the scientific discourse and to relate them to the work contexts for which they are specifically intended. This leads to configurations of actor-structure engagements that foster human-centricity in the workplace.Theoretical foundation: The study applies configurational theory to sociotechnical systems' analysis of work settings. The assumption is that different approaches to promote human-centricity coexist, depending on the stakeholders responsible for their application.Method: The exploration of criteria indicating human-centricity and their synthesis into configurations is based on a cross-disciplinary literature review following a systematic search strategy and a deductive-inductive qualitative content analysis of 101 research articles.Results: The article outlines eight criteria of human-centricity, two of which face challenges of human-centered technology development (trustworthiness and explainability), three challenges of human-centered employee development (prevention of job loss, health, and human agency and augmentation), and three challenges of human-centered organizational development (compensation of systems' weaknesses, integration of user-domain knowledge, accountability, and safety culture). The configurational theory allows contextualization of these criteria from a higher-order perspective and leads to seven configurations of actor-structure engagements in terms of engagement for (1) data and technostructure, (2) operational process optimization, (3) operators' employment, (4) employees' wellbeing, (5) proficiency, (6) accountability, and (7) interactive cross-domain design. Each has one criterion of human-centricity in the foreground. Trustworthiness does not build its own configuration but is proposed to be a necessary condition in all seven configurations.Discussion: The article contextualizes the overall debate on human-centricity and allows us to specify stakeholder-related engagements and how these complement each other. This is of high value for practitioners bringing human-centricity to the workplace and allows them to compare which criteria are considered in transnational declarations, international norms and standards, or company guidelines.","[Wilkens, Uta; Lupp, Daniel; Langholf, Valentin] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Work Sci, Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Wilkens, U (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Work Sci, Bochum, Germany.",uta.wilkens@ruhr-uni-bochum.de,"Wilkens, Uta/MDT-3149-2025","Wilkens, Uta/0000-0002-7485-4186; Lupp, Daniel/0000-0001-5925-0598; Langholf, Valentin/0000-0002-0440-4665",Competence Center HUMAINE: Transfer-Hub of the Ruhr Metropolis for human-centered work with AI (human-centered AI network) [BMBF 02L19C200],Competence Center HUMAINE: Transfer-Hub of the Ruhr Metropolis for human-centered work with AI (human-centered AI network),"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

The discovery was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2020, as CRISPR has opened up new possibilities to edit the human genome. CRISPR has been applied to study cancer because the method allows for many new ways to model the disease. This includes the development of pre-clinical models of cancer, where CRISPR is used to generate mutations that are found in human cancer. Therefore, unique mutations can be studied in a physiologically relevant setting, and CRISPR technology has accelerated the engineering of these models. This review focuses on exploring the current knowledge of CRISPR editing in adult tissues for generating pre-clinical models to study cancer. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are widely used in cancer research to edit specific genes and study their functions. This applies both to in vitro and in vivo studies where CRISPR technology has accelerated the generation of specific loss- or gain-of-function mutations. This review focuses on CRISPR for generating in vivo models of cancer by editing somatic cells in specific organs. The delivery of CRISPR/Cas to designated tissues and specific cell compartments is discussed with a focus on different methods and their advantages. One advantage of CRISPR/Cas is the possibility to target multiple genes simultaneously in the same cell and therefore generate complex mutation profiles. This complexity challenges the interpretation of results and different methods to analyze the samples discussed herein. CRISPR-induced tumors are also different from classical tumors in pre-clinical models. Especially the clonal evolution of CRISPR-induced tumors adds new insight into cancer biology. Finally, the review discusses future perspectives for CRISPR technology in pre-clinical models with a focus on in vivo screening, CRISPR activation/inhibition, and the development of prime/ base-editing for the introduction of specific gene editing.","[Thomsen, Martin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biomed, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Thomsen, Martin K.] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Inst Adv Studies AIAS, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Thomsen, MK (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biomed, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark.;Thomsen, MK (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Inst Adv Studies AIAS, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark.",mkt@biomed.au.dk,"Thoen, Martin/AAU-5014-2021","Thoen, Martin/0000-0002-5055-7531","Danish Cancer Society [R204-A12490, R311-A18039]; Dagmar Marshall Fond; Aarhus University Research Foundation, Denmark; P.A.

Early and prompt identification of PCV is essential in managing and controlling this disease effectively. A range of detection techniques for PCV have been developed and primarily divided into two categories focusing on nucleic acid or serum antibody identification. The methodologies encompass conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Despite their efficacy, these techniques are often impeded by the necessity for substantial investment in equipment, specialized knowledge, and intricate procedural steps, which complicate their application in real-time field detections. To surmount these challenges, a sensitive, rapid, and specific PCV detection method using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas12a/13a coupled with isothermal amplification, such as enzymatic recombinase amplification (ERA), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), has been developed. This novel method has undergone meticulous optimization for detecting PCV types 2, 3, and 4, boasting a remarkable sensitivity to identify a single copy per microliter. The specificity of this technique is exemplary, with no observable interaction with other porcine viruses such as PEDV, PRRSV, PRV, and CSFV. Its reliability has been validated with clinical samples, where it produced a perfect alignment with qPCR findings, showcasing a 100% coincidence rate. The elegance of merging CRISPR-Cas technology with isothermal amplification assays lies in its on-site testing without the need for expensive tools or trained personnel, rendering it exceptionally suitable for on-site applications, especially in resource-constrained swine farming environments. This review assesses and compares the process and characteristics inherent in the utilization of ERA/LAMP/RPA-CRISPR-Cas12a/Cas13a methodologies for the detection of PCV, providing critical insights into their practicality and effectiveness.","[Wang, Huijuan; Zhou, Gang; Liu, Huiming; Peng, Ruqun; Sun, Tingli; Li, Sujuan; Chen, Mingjie; Wang, Yingsi; Shi, Qingshan; Xie, Xiaobao] Guangdong Acad Sci, Inst Microbiol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Microbial Culture Collect &, State Key Lab Appl Microbiol Southern China, Guangzhou 510070, Peoples R China",Guangdong Academy of Sciences,"Xie, XB (corresponding author), Guangdong Acad Sci, Inst Microbiol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Microbial Culture Collect &, State Key Lab Appl Microbiol Southern China, Guangzhou 510070, Peoples R China.",wanghj@gdim.cn; zgbees@gdim.cn; liuhuiming@gdim.cn; pengruqun@gdim.cn; suntingli@gdim.cn; lisujuan@gdim.cn; chenmj@gdim.cn; wongvincy@163.com; shiqingshan@hotmail.com; xiexb@gdim.cn,"Chen, Mingjie/F-1147-2018; Liu, Huiming/MXL-1862-2025; xie, xiaobao/HKV-4315-2023","Chen, Mingjie/0000-0002-7400-5192; Shi, Qing-Shan/0000-0003-4228-3080; xie, xiaobao/0000-0002-4902-6979",GDAS' Project of Science and Technology Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China [32102647]; Scientific and Technological Planning Project of Guangzhou [202201010146]; Open Project of Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Biosafety for Market Regulation [2023BS003]; Research and Development Plan in Key Areas of Guangdong Province [2022B1111040002]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2023A1515012057]; [2021GDASYL-20210103008]; [2022GDASZH-2022010101],GDAS' Project of Science and Technology Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific and Technological Planning Project of Guangzhou; Open Project of Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Biosafety for Market Regulation; Research and Development Plan in Key Areas of Guangdong Province; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); ;,"This work was funded by the GDAS' Project of Science and Technology Development (Nos. 2021GDASYL-20210103008 and 2022GDASZH-2022010101), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 32102647), Scientific and Technological Planning Project of Guangzhou (No. 202201010146), Open Project of Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Biosafety for Market Regulation (No. 2023BS003), Research and Development Plan in Key Areas of Guangdong Province (No. 2022B1111040002), and Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (No. 2023A1515012057).",76,3,4,8,43,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4915,VIRUSES-BASEL,Viruses-Basel,OCT,2024,16.0,10,,,,,,1548,10.3390/v16101548,0.0,,12,Virology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Virology,K2Z9B,39459882.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001342622500001,0

As climate change intensifies, weather patterns are becoming less predictable and extreme weather events more likely. To ensure continued production of enough food for the growing world population, crop losses due to adverse conditions must be curtailed. One way to do this is to improve the level of abiotic stress tolerance in crops through breeding. The process of breeding plants has seen recent increases in speed and efficiency due in large part to the application of genome sequencing and development of high-density genetic marker panels. Using genotypic data produced by these technologies, a statistical technique known as 'genomic prediction' can predict the level of tolerance to different abiotic stresses in an individual plant. Furthermore, the development of genome editing will allow for targeted modification of specific nucleotides, to enhance abiotic stress resilience. The continued sequencing and analysis of thousands of genomes of individuals in each plant species, known as 'pan-genomics', will allow us to identify the precise polymorphisms that underlie abiotic stress tolerance. Such polymorphisms have the potential to significantly increase the accuracy of genome-assisted breeding methods, and support the identification of targets for genome editing, further enhancing the development of abiotic stress tolerant crops. In addition, use of multiple 'omics data will allow for accurate representations of the genetic pathways in crop plants that control abiotic stress responses. Coupling this knowledge with pan-genomics could further enhance the accuracy of genome-assisted breeding, increasing the efficiency of crop breeding and generating new prospects for developing abiotic stress tolerance via genome editing. In this review, we summarise recent research using 'omics techniques to understand the genetic basis of abiotic stress tolerance in plants with a focus on major food crops. We evaluate the potential avenues for improving crop production using 'omics techniques and discuss areas for future research that we think should be prioritised.","[Derbyshire, Mark C.] Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, Ctr Crop & Dis Management, Perth, WA, Australia; [Batley, Jacqueline] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Edwards, David] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Edwards, David] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Appl Bioinformat, Perth, WA, Australia",Curtin University; University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Edwards, D (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA, Australia.;Edwards, D (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Ctr Appl Bioinformat, Perth, WA, Australia.",dave.edwards@uwa.edu.au,"Batley, Jacqueline/A-5723-2008; Edwards, David/H-3710-2015","Batley, Jacqueline/0000-0002-5391-5824; Edwards, David/0000-0001-7599-6760; Derbyshire, Mark/0000-0001-5302-9868","Curtin University; Grains Research and Development Corporation [CUR00023]; Australian Research Council [DP200100762, DP210100296]; Australian Research Council [DP200100762] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Curtin University(Curtin University); Grains Research and Development Corporation(Grains R&D Corp); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),MCD was supported by Curtin University and the Grains Research and Development Corporation CUR00023.

This review systematically examines the research progress and application prospects of various chemical agents-including surfactants, chelating agents, nano-materials, modified brines and alkali solutions, and polymers-in controlling reservoir wettability. Current studies are primarily based on crude oil characteristics and natural core samples, and are constrained by the complexity of mineral composition and crude oil chemistry. Future experiments should systematically investigate the interactions between active crude oil components and rock minerals, and employ advanced characterization techniques to deepen understanding of wettability-control mechanisms. Although most surfactants are costeffective, their stability in complex reservoir environments is poor, which limits their application. Emerging gemini and composite surfactants have demonstrated good potential for wettability alteration; future research should develop highly adaptable surfactants through multi-ion synergistic effects. The selection of chelating agents and operational parameters requires further optimization, and their wettability-control mechanisms and synergistic effects with surfactants should be elucidated. The application of nanomaterials in wettability modification is still in its early stage, with issues such as colloidal stability and adsorption kinetics requiring further investigation. Despite the risk of pore-throat blockage in high-salinity, low-permeability reservoirs, optimizing nanomaterial formulations remains an effective solution. Low-mineralization water injection shows application potential, but its water-source compatibility and production-enhancement mechanisms remain controversial. Future efforts should focus on developing efficient, alkali-free composite flooding systems to overcome current technological bottlenecks. Field deployment still faces multiple challenges, including adsorption loss, precipitation plugging, formation damage, and cost-environmental concerns; it is recommended to optimize formulations and injection strategies through refined pilot tests, while developing green, biodegradable multi-component chemicals to achieve large-scale application of chemical EOR. This study also explores multiscale techniques for chemical-induced wettability alteration, providing novel insights and integrated strategies for advancing wettability-control research, ultimately aiming to bridge theoretical knowledge and field application in oil and gas extraction.","[Zheng, Haoxuan; Shi, Yongmin; Tian, Yu; Yan, Xiaolong; Yang, Lin; Chen, Junyao; Tian, Xun] Shaanxi Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Shaanxi Key Lab Chem Addit Ind, Xian 710021, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yongmin] Peking Univ, Sch Earth & Space Sci, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Bi, Weiyu] Changqing Oilfield Co PetroChina, Oil & Gas Technol Res Inst, Xian 710021, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Shaanxi University of Science & Technology; Peking University; China National Petroleum Corporation,"Shi, YM; Tian, Y (corresponding author), Shaanxi Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Shaanxi Key Lab Chem Addit Ind, Xian 710021, Peoples R China.",bs230811023@sust.edu.cn; sym@pku.edu.cn; tianyu@sust.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51904180]; National Science and Technology Major Projects of China [20172X05013-005-009]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M643808XB],Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science and Technology Major Projects of China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [ No. 51904180]; the National Science and Technology Major Projects of China [NO.20172X05013-005-009] and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M643808XB].,375,0,0,21,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2949-8929,2949-8910,GEOENERGY SCI ENG,Geoenergy Sci.

The scientific community has taken advantage of technological advances coupled with suitable SES biological traits to record numerous variables in challenging environments and to study interactions between SES and oceanographic features. In the context of big dataset acquisition, there is a growing need for methodological tools to analyze and extract key data features while integrating their complexity. Although much attention has been paid to study elephant seal foraging strategies, the continuity of their surrounding three-dimensional environments is seldom integrated. Knowledge gaps persist in understanding habitat use by SES, while the representativeness of a predator-based approach to understanding ecosystem structuring is still questioned. In this study, we explore SES habitat use by using a functional data analysis approach (FDA) to describe the foraging environment of five female elephant seals feeding in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Functional principal component analysis followed by model-based clustering were applied to temperature and salinity (TS) profiles from Mercator model outputs to discriminate waters sharing similar thermohaline structures. Secondly, in situ TS profiles recorded by the SES were employed to determine the habitat visited within the range of potential environments identified from the model data. Four Functional Oceanographic Domains (FOD) were identified in the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, all visited, in varying proportion, by four of the five females studied. We found that the females favored areas where all the FODs converge and mix, generating thermal fronts and eddies. Prey-capture attempts increased in such areas. Our results are in accordance with previous findings, suggesting that (sub-)mesoscale features act as biological hotspots. This study highlights the potential of coupling FDA with model-based clustering for describing complex environments with minimal loss of information. As well as contributing to better understanding of elephant seal habitat use and foraging strategies, this approach opens up a wide range of applications in oceanography and ecology.","[Fonvieille, Nadege; Nerini, David] Aix Marseille Univ, Univ Toulon, Mediterranean Inst Oceanog, CNRS INSU,IRD, F-13288 Marseille 09, France; [Fonvieille, Nadege; Guinet, Christophe; Picard, Baptiste; Tournier, Martin; Goulet, Pauline] La Rochelle Univ, CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, UMR 7372, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Saraceno, Martin] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ciencias Atmosfera & Oceanos DCAO, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Saraceno, Martin] Univ Buenos Aires, Ctr Invest Mar & Atmosfera CIMA, CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Saraceno, Martin] Inst Francoargentino Estudios Clima & Impactos IFA, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Campagna, Claudio] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Program, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Campagna, Claudio] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Argentina Programs, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Campagna, Julieta] CENPAT CONICET, Ctr Estudio Sistemas Marinos CESIMAR, Puerto Madryn, Argentina",Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Centro Nacional Patagonico (CENPAT),"Fonvieille, N (corresponding author), Aix Marseille Univ, Univ Toulon, Mediterranean Inst Oceanog, CNRS INSU,IRD, F-13288 Marseille 09, France.",nadege.fonvieille@univ-amu.fr,"Saraceno, Martin/AAS-1231-2020; Fonvieille, Nadege/KEJ-3829-2024","Fonvieille, Nadege/0000-0002-2659-4738",French Ministry for Education and Research; CNES-TOSCA (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales),French Ministry for Education and Research; CNES-TOSCA (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales)(Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)),"Through NF Ph.D., this work was funded by the French Ministry for Education and Research.

Due to the patient's small field of vision, patient specific, complex nerve system, and other factors, even a minor loss can result in irreversible damage. Surgeons could benefit from the use of augmented reality (AR) technology, which would bring three-dimensional image data into the operating room. AR visualization can improve surgical procedures, facilitate intraoperative planning, and enhance surgical guidance for the anatomy of interest, all of which contribute to the application's minimal invasiveness. This literature review on image guidance in liver surgery provides the reader with information about AR techniques. To ascertain the current state of Augmented reality technology's application in liver surgery, a PubMed and Embase search were conducted using the following keywords: < (Augmented reality) AND (liver surgery) > and < 'Augmented reality' AND 'liver surgery' > (publication date from January 1991 until Jun 2022). The query yielded a total of 205 publications-excluded papers in other languages, virtual reality (VR), and reviews leaving 135 studies for review. After removing duplication, the titles and abstracts of those studies were manually reviewed. Finally, 31 pertinent studies were determined to be pertinent to the subject. Generally, augmented reality technology includes preoperative planning and three-dimensional reconstruction, intraoperative three-dimensional navigation, and registration. Visualization may be aided by virtual three-dimensional reconstruction models of the liver from Computed Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans. The results demonstrate that by utilizing augmented reality technology, blood vessels and tumor structures in the liver can be visualized during surgery, allowing for precise navigation during complicated surgical procedures. Augmented reality has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in both minimally invasive and invasive liver surgery. With recent advancements and significant effort by liver surgeons, augmented reality technologies have the potential to increase hepatobiliary surgical procedures dramatically. However, further clinical trials will be necessary to evaluate augmented reality as a tool for reducing post-operative morbidity and mortality. The impact of these cutting-edge computerized image guidance techniques on clinically relevant outcome parameters should be assessed in the future.","[Gholizadeh, Maryam] Univ Med Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany; [Bakhshali, Mohamad Amin; Aliakbarian, Mohsen; Gholizadeh, Farzaneh; Eslami, Saeid] Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Mazlooman, Seyed Reza] Islamic Azad Univ, Tehran, Iran; [Modrzejewski, Andrzej] Pomeranian Med Univ, Szczecin, Poland",Universitat Greifswald; Greifswald Medical School; Mashhad University of Medical Sciences; Islamic Azad University; Pomeranian Medical University,"Bakhshali, MA (corresponding author), Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran.",bakhshalima2@mums.ac.ir,"; Bakhshali, Mohamad Amin/AAR-7133-2020; Eslami, Saeid/AAZ-6005-2020","Mazlooman, Seyed Reza/0009-0009-3341-5097; Gholizadeh, Maryam/0000-0002-0193-4839; Bakhshali, Mohamad Amin/0000-0002-7879-0570;",,,,40,14,20,2,25,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1863-2483,1863-2491,J ROBOT SURG,J.

Our field's understanding of IOP has evolved considerably in recent years, driven by tonometric technologies with increasing accuracy, reproducibility, and temporal resolution that have refined our knowledge regarding the relationship between IOP and glaucoma risk and pathogenesis. The goal of this article is to review the published literature pertinent to the following points: 1) the factors that determine IOP in physiologic and pathologic states; 2) technologies for measuring IOP; 3) scientific and clinical rationale for measuring diverse IOP metrics in patients with glaucoma; 4) the impact and shortcomings of current standard-of-care IOP monitoring approaches; 5) recommendations for approaches to IOP monitoring that could improve patient outcomes; and 6) research questions that must be answered to improve our understanding of how IOP contributes to disease progression. Retrospective and prospective data, including that from landmark clinical trials, document greater IOP fluctuations in glaucomatous than healthy eyes, tendencies for maximal daily IOP to occur outside of office hours, and, in addition to mean and maximal IOP, an association between IOP fluctuation and glaucoma progression that is independent of mean in-office IOP. Ambulatory IOP monitoring, measuring IOP outside of office hours and at different times of day and night, provides clinicians with discrete data that could improve patient outcomes. Eye care clinicians treating glaucoma based on isolated in-office IOP measurements may make treatment decisions without fully capturing the entire IOP profile of an individual. Data linking home blood pressure monitors and home glucose sensors to dramatically improved outcomes for patients with systemic hypertension and diabetes and will be reviewed as they pertain to the question of whether ambulatory tonometry is positioned to do the same for glaucoma management. Prospective randomized controlled studies are warranted to determine whether remote tonometry-based glaucoma management might reduce vision loss and improve patient outcomes.","[Asrani, Sanjay G.] Duke Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Med Ctr, Durham, NC USA; [Mcglumphy, Elyse J.] Delaware Ophthalmol Consultants, Wilmington, DE USA; [Al-Aswad, Lama A.] Univ Penn, Scheie Eye Inst, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Chaya, Craig J.; Wirostko, Barbara] Univ Utah, John A Moran Eye Ctr, 50 North Med Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA; [Lin, Shan] Glaucoma Ctr San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA; [Musch, David C.; Robin, Alan L.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Musch, David C.; Robin, Alan L.] Univ Michigan, Kellogg Eye Ctr, Dept Epidemiol, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Pitha, Ian; Robin, Alan L.; Johnson, Thomas V.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Wilmer Eye Inst, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD USA",Duke University; University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Medicine,"Wirostko, B (corresponding author), Univ Utah, John A Moran Eye Ctr, 50 North Med Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA.;Johnson, TV (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Shelley & Alan Holt Rising Prof Ophthalmol Wilmer, Sch Med, 400 N Broadway,Smith Bldg,Rm M-027, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.",u0721158@utah.edu; johnson@jhmi.edu,"Pitha, Ian/LYO-0670-2024; Johnson, Thomas/C-9351-2011","Johnson, Thomas/0000-0002-5372-5457","Research to Prevent Blindness (New York, NY)","Research to Prevent Blindness (New York, NY)(Research to Prevent Blindness (RPB))","The Max IOP Consensus Meeting was held in New Orleans, LA on April 22nd, 2023, and chaired by BW and TVJ.

Some keystone species have been functionally extirpated, resulting in severe commercial and ecological losses. When efforts to exclude or mitigate pests have failed, researchers have sometimes applied biotechnology tools to incorporate pest resistance in at-risk species to enable their reintroduction. Often erroneously equated solely with genetic engineering, biotechnology also includes traditional and genome informed breeding-and may provide a holistic approach toward applying genomic-based information and interventions to increase tree species' pest resistance. Traditional tree breeding is responsible for successes to date, but new technologies offer hope to increase the efficiency of such efforts. Remarkable recent progress has been made, and for some at-risk species, novel biotechnological advances put reintroduction within reach. The high costs of reintroduction of at-risk species at necessary scale, however, will initially limit the pursuit to a few species. Successful deployment of pest resistant material may require improved species-specific knowledge and should integrate into and leverage existing reforestation systems, but these operations are sometimes rare where pest threats are greatest. While use of some biotechnologies, such as traditional tree breeding, are commonplace, others such as genetic engineering are controversial and highly regulated, yet may be the only viable means of achieving reintroduction of some at-risk species. Efforts to modify policy toward allowing the use of appropriate biotechnology, especially genetic engineering, have lagged. Provided that risk-benefits are favorable, policy is likely to follow with public opinion; in some countries, society is now increasingly open to using available biotechnologies. Continued engagement using the most recent advances in social science to build public trust, combined with a science-based collaboration among land managers and regulators, will generate the collective momentum needed to motivate policymakers to act rapidly given the speed at which forest health threats unfold and the large areas they affect.","[Jacobs, Douglass F.

To our knowledge, no reviews have been performed to assess and compare all these modalities together versus control groups (conventional fluoroscopy) through high Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) and Prospective Control Studies (PCSs). The aim of this study was to assess and compare 3D-imaging technologies from pre-operative planning to per-operative navigation and robotic in the management of pelvic ring fractures through high level studies.MethodsA literature search was performed using PubMed, the Cochrane library and Google scholar using keywords up to December 2023. Only prospective comparative studies (RCT and PCS) were included. A total of 341 articles were identified, 39 articles were selected for full-text analysis leaving 7 articles included in this literature systematic review.ResultsA trend towards improved precision in screw placement and reduction of radiation exposure without consequences in term of functional outcomes have been identified. No conclusions can be extrapolated regarding operative time and blood loss except for robotic which improve these parameters because robotic arm assistance help surgeons to correctly follow the planning based on 2D-fluoroscopy. Surgery duration and radiation dose are significantly reduced with robotic-arm assistance for the same reasons. With navigation the results have to be nuanced according to the experience of the surgical team. Interest of navigation is emphasized in sacral dysmorphism in comparison with conventional fluoroscopy. This highlights the benefits of navigation for ilio-sacral screw placement in difficult cases and less experimented teams.ConclusionHigh level studies which assess and compare 3D-imaging technologies from pre-operative planning to per-operative navigation and robotic in the management of pelvic ring fractures are low. To date and according to the present high level literature, navigation and 3D-technologies in pelvic ring surgery should be recommended for difficult cases.Level of evidence, II:Systematic review of Level II studies.","[Boudissa, Mehdi; Khoury, Georges; Tonetti, Jerome] Grenoble Alpes Univ, Grenoble Alpes Univ Hosp, Pharm Dept, INSERM U1055,LBFA, Grenoble, France; [Boudissa, Mehdi; Tonetti, Jerome] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IMAG lab, TIMC, CNRS UMR 5525, F-38700 Grenoble, France; [Franke, Jochen] Heidelberg Univ, BG Trauma Ctr Ludwigshafen, Ludwig Guttmann St 13, D-67071 Ludwigshafen, Germany; [Gaensslen, Axel] Wolfsburg Hosp, Dept Trauma Orthoped & Hand Surg, Wolfsburg, Germany",Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); CHU Grenoble Alpes; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS); Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Boudissa, M (corresponding author), Grenoble Alpes Univ, Grenoble Alpes Univ Hosp, Pharm Dept, INSERM U1055,LBFA, Grenoble, France.;Boudissa, M (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, IMAG lab, TIMC, CNRS UMR 5525, F-38700 Grenoble, France.",mboudissa@chu-grenoble.fr,"Khoury, Georges/AGZ-0672-2022","Boudissa, Mehdi/0000-0002-1651-9566","Grenoble University Hospital (Grenoble, France)","Grenoble University Hospital (Grenoble, France)","The study is sponsored by Grenoble University Hospital (Grenoble, France).

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between JIA and periodontal diseases to facilitate oral health management and periodontal disease prevention in JIA patients. We conducted a comprehensive search of Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Chinese Scientific and Technological Journal (VIP) database, Wan Fang Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) up to 30 September 2022, without publication dates or language restrictions. Two authors independently evaluated observational studies for inclusion, and the quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Continuous variables are presented as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Parameters of the simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S), plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), clinical attachment loss (CAL), and probing depth (PD) were considered as outcome measures and were compared between JIA patients and healthy controls. The initial search comprised 15 studies with a total of 1537 individuals. The meta-analysis showed the parameters of OHI-S (MD = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.04-0.19, p = 0.002), PI (MD = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.67-2.50, p < 0.00001), GI (MD = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.17-0.82, p = 0.003), CAL (MD = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.01-0.43, p = 0.04), and PD (MD = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.08-2.77, p = 0.04) in JIA patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls. All of the included studies were of high quality. This systematic review and meta-analysis showed a possible association between JIA and periodontal diseases.

METHODS: Clinical records and histopathology from three patients diagnosed with UM arising from a previously unsuspected OM were critically reviewed at a single academic institution. The patients' demographic information, medical history, presenting clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory results, ancillary (including molecular genetic) testing, and management were collected. A literature review was conducted. RESULTS: Three novel cases were identified, totaling 18 reported cases of malignant transformation of an OM to UM. The three new cases were diagnosed histopathologically on enucleation specimens for UM, without prior clinical history of OM. Where demographic information was available, ten patients were female and six male, with an average age at presentation of 45.75 years (range 15-69 years). For patients with an initial clinical diagnosis of OM, the interval to diagnosis of melanoma was between 0.25 years and 33 years, with the most common symptoms of evolution to UM being progressive vision loss, ocular pain, and elevated intraocular pressure. Six total cases did not have a previously known history of melanocytoma. CONCLUSION: OM is rare; malignant transformation of OM to UM is also very uncommon. The incidental histopathological observation of darkly pigmented, polyhedral, magnocellular cells adjacent to or admixed with frank melanoma resulted in immunohistochemical confirmation of a precursor OM in three unsuspected cases, mimicking somewhat the appearance of UM with abundant admixed melanophages. OM may be a precursor to UM in more instances than previously recognized, and further data, as well as careful attention by pathologists, is needed to refine diagnosis and clinical management strategies regarding patients with known OM, especially outside of the optic nerve head.

These disorders disrupt normal metabolic processes, leading to substantial economic losses for the livestock industry. Metabolic disorders can arise from defective biochemical pathways, deficiencies in enzymes, coenzymes, or cofactors, and may be either inherited or acquired. Dairy cows are particularly susceptible during the transition period from late lactation to early management, facing conditions such as ketosis, milk fever, and hepatic lipidosis. This susceptibility is primarily due to reduced dry matter intake caused by fetal development and a decline in rumen capacity. The negative energy balance (NEB) during this phase, characterized by elevated blood concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) due to increased energy mobilization, is closely linked to the onset of these diseases. Providing high-energy-density diets during this period is critical to mitigating the effects of NEB. Metabolic disorders represent a major health challenge in cattle, adversely affecting animal welfare and agricultural output. A comprehensive understanding of their etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, and management strategies is essential for effective prevention and treatment. Ongoing research and the adoption of preventive measures are vital to reducing the economic and health impacts of these diseases. Early diagnosis and proactive management strategies are crucial to mitigating their impact on dairy cattle health and productivity. Early identification enables timely interventions, preventing disease progression and reducing adverse effects on animal health. Proactive measures, such as optimizing nutritional programs, implementing precision farming technologies, and ensuring timely veterinary care, are essential for enhancing the overall wellbeing of dairy cows. This review serves as a valuable resource for veterinarians, researchers, and dairy farmers, offering in-depth insights into the etiology, clinical signs, diagnostics, and management of prevalent metabolic disorders in dairy cattle. By equipping stakeholders with this knowledge, it aims to support informed decision-making and improve herd management practices. The focus on early diagnosis and proactive strategies underscores the potential to significantly reduce the economic and health burdens imposed by metabolic diseases on the livestock industry.","[Kang, Danju; Lungu, Shera Elizabeth; Danso, Felix; Chen, Yanjun; Zheng, Xinyu; Lin, Hongying; Chen, Jinjun] Guangdong Ocean Univ, Coll Coastal Agr, Dept Vet Med, Zhanjiang, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Dzou, Chrystella Fernanda] Guangdong Ocean Univ, Coll Appl Econ, Dept Econ, Zhanjiang, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Nie, Fanghong] Guangdong Ocean Univ, Coll Food Sci & Technol, Coll Coastal Agr, Zhanjiang, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Guangxian] Guangdong Ocean Univ, Coll Coastal Agr, Dept Anim Sci, Zhanjiang, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Guangdong Ocean University; Guangdong Ocean University; Guangdong Ocean University; Guangdong Ocean University,"Chen, JJ (corresponding author), Guangdong Ocean Univ, Coll Coastal Agr, Dept Vet Med, Zhanjiang, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Zhou, GX (corresponding author), Guangdong Ocean Univ, Coll Coastal Agr, Dept Anim Sci, Zhanjiang, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",chenjj@gdou.edu.cn; zhougx@gdou.edu.cn,"Lin, Hongying/GPP-6961-2022; zheng, xinyu/KMY-2347-2024",,"Guangdong Ocean University [R20045, R19066]",Guangdong Ocean University,The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Drying is an important step in the post -harvest handling of rice and can influence rice qualities and thus play a key role in determining rice commercial and nutritional value. In rice processing, traditional drying methods may lead to longer drying times, greater energy consumption, and unintended quality losses. Thus, it is imperative to improve the physical, chemical, and milling properties of rice while preserving its nutritional value, flavor, and appearance as much as possible. Additionally, it is necessary to increase the efficiency with which heat energy is utilized during the thermal processing of freshly harvested paddy. Moreover, this review provides insights into the current application status of six different innovative drying technologies such as radio frequency (RF) drying, microwave (MW) drying, infrared (IR) drying, vacuum drying (VD), superheated steam (SHS) drying, fluidized bed (FB) drying along with their effect on the quality of rice such as color, flavor, crack ratio, microstructure and morphology, bioactive components and antioxidant activity as well asstarch content and glycemic index. Dielectric methods of drying due to volumetric heating results in enhanced drying rate, improved heating uniformity, reduced crack ratio, increased head rice yield and better maintain taste value of paddy grains. These novel emerging drying techniques increased the interactions between hydrated proteins and swollen starch granules, resulting in enhanced viscosity of rice flour and promoted starch gelatinization and enhanced antioxidant activity which is helpful to produce functional rice. Moreover, this review not only highlights the existing challenges posed by these innovative thermal technologies but also presents potential solutions. Additionally, the combination of these technologies to optimize operating conditions can further boost their effectiveness in enhancing the drying process. Nevertheless, future studies are essential to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanism of quality changes induced by emerging processing technologies. This knowledge will help expand the application of these techniques in the rice processing industry.","[Mahmood, Naveed; Liu, Yanhong; Zhang, Yue; Lei, Dengwen] China Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xu; Yves, Harimana] Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Food Sci, Harbin 150030, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Munir, Zeeshan] Univ Kassel, Dept Agr Engn, Nordbahnhofstr 1a, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany; [Pandiselvam, R.] ICAR Cent Plantat Crops Res Inst, Div Physiol Biochem & Postharvest Technol, Kasaragod 671124, Kerala, India; [Saleemi, Mansab Ali] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, San Antonio, TX USA; [Sufyan, Muhammad] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Northeast Agricultural University - China; Universitat Kassel; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Plantation Crops Research Institute; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio; China Agricultural University,"Mahmood, N; Liu, YH (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",naveed1229uaf@gmail.com; liuyanhong@cau.edu.cn,"Saleemi, Mansab/AAV-1442-2021; Pandiselvam, Ravi/I-5229-2019","Pandiselvam, Ravi/0000-0003-0996-8328; Mahmood, Naveed/0009-0002-3815-8981","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31772088]; Key Laboratory of Agro-Products Postharvest Handling, Ministry of Agriculture [KLAPPH2-2017-03]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Laboratory of Agro-Products Postharvest Handling, Ministry of Agriculture","This work received financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (31772088) and Key Laboratory of Agro-Products Postharvest Handling, Ministry of Agriculture (KLAPPH2-2017-03) .",127,15,16,29,128,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0963-9969,1873-7145,FOOD RES INT,Food Res.

This study aims to review and synthesize the contributions of previous research undertaken in this area and propose future directions for improving the process of delay and disruption claims. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a holistic systematic review of literature following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. A total of 230 articles were shortlisted related to delay and disruption claims in construction using Scopus and Web of Science databases. Findings Six research themes were identified and critically reviewed including delay analysis, disruption analysis, claim management, contract administration, dispute resolution and delay and disruption information and records. The systematic review showed that there is a dearth of research on managing the wide-ranging information required for delay and disruption claims, ensuring the transparency and uniformity in delay and disruption claims' information and adopting an end-user's centred research approach for resolving the problems in the process of delay and disruption claims. Practical implications Complexities in delay and disruption claims are real-world problems faced by industry practitioners. The findings will help the research community and industry practitioners to prioritize their energies toward information management of delay and disruption claims. Originality/value This study contributes to the body of knowledge in delay and disruption claims by identifying the need for conducting more research on its information requirements and management. Subsequently, it provides an insight on the use of modern technologies such as drones, building information modeling, radio frequency identifiers, blockchain, Bigdata and machine learning, as tools for more structured and efficient attainment of required information in a transparent and consistent manner.

In type 1 diabetes, this interconnected network is vulnerable to malfunction and immune attack, with strategies to prevent or repair islet damage still in their infancy. In 2014, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) established the Human Islet Research Network (HIRN) to accelerate our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of type 1 diabetes development. In this article, investigators from the HIRN detail pioneering advances, technologies, and systems that contextualize insulin-producing beta-cells and other related cells within their physiological environment. Disease models, devices, and therapies are evaluated by the HIRN in light of promising functional and mechanistic data. Collaborative relationships and opportunities within this network are emphasized as a means of enhancing the quality of innovative research and talent in science. Topics are developed through a series of questions, achievements, and milestones, with the 75th anniversary of the NIDDK as an opportunity to reflect on the past, present, and future of type 1 diabetes research.Article Highlights The Human Islet Research Network (HIRN) was created by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases to accelerate pioneering basic and translational research on the prevention, development, and progression of type 1 diabetes. There are critical knowledge gaps in research on the processes underlying human beta-cell protection, loss, and replacement in type 1 diabetes. A multidisciplinary and collaborative research community focused on outstanding biological questions propels the development of innovative models, tools, and technologies and helps contextualize the complexity of this disease. Discoveries arising from the HIRN will profoundly improve our understanding of type 1 diabetes pathogenesis and expedite the development of disease avoidance, diagnosis, and treatment strategies.","[Parent, Audrey V.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Diabet Ctr, San Francisco, CA USA; [Agarwal, Ashutosh] Univ Miami, Dept Biomed Engn, Coral Gables, FL USA; [Agarwal, Ashutosh] Univ Miami, Desai Sethi Urol Inst, Miller Sch Med, Miami, FL USA; [Alvarez-Dominguez, Juan Rene] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Alvarez-Dominguez, Juan Rene] Univ Penn, Inst Regenerat Med, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Alvarez-Dominguez, Juan Rene] Univ Penn, Inst Diabet Obes & Metab, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Drigo, Rafael] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Nashville, TN USA; [Atkinson, Mark A.] Univ Florida, Diabet Inst, Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Gainesville, FL USA; [Atkinson, Mark A.] Univ Florida, Diabet Inst, Dept Pathol Immunol & Lab Med, Coll Med, Gainesville, FL USA; [Brehm, Michael A.] Univ Massachusetts, Chan Med Sch, Diabet Ctr Excellence, Program Mol Med, Worcester, MA USA; [Ferreira, Leonardo M.

This review examines the contribution of nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems to solving the problems associated with bacterial resistance and provides a thorough overview of their mechanisms of action, efficiency, and perspectives for the future. Owing to their unique physicochemical properties, nanomaterials reveal new ways of passing through the traditional mechanisms of bacterial defence connected to the permeability barrier of membranes, efflux pumps, and biofilm formation. This review addresses the different types of nanomaterials, including metallic nanoparticles, liposomes, and polymeric nanoparticles, in terms of their antimicrobial properties and modes of action. More emphasis has been placed on the critical discussion of recent studies on such active systems. Both in vitro and in vivo models are discussed, with particular attention paid to multidrug-resistant bacteria. This review begins by reviewing the urgency for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by citing recent statistics, which indicate that the number of deaths and reasons for financial losses continue to increase. A background is then provided on the limitations of existing antibiotic therapies and the pressing need to develop innovative approaches. Nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems have been proposed as promising solutions because of their potential to improve drug solubility, stability, and targeted delivery, although side effects can also be mitigated. In addition to established knowledge, this review also covers ongoing debates on the continuous risks associated with the use of nanomaterials, such as toxicity and environmental impact. This discussion emphasizes the optimization of nanomaterial design to target specific bacteria, and rigorous clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy in humans. It concludes with reflections on the future directions of nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems in fighting AMR, underlining the need for an interdisciplinary approach, along with continuous research efforts to translate these promising technologies into clinical practice. As the fight against bacterial resistance reaches its peak, nanomaterials may be the key to developing next-generation antimicrobial therapies.","[Obeid, Mohammad A.; Aljabali, Alaa A.

AR enables real-time visualization of anatomical structures and surgical plans, enhancing intraoperative precision. However, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), standardized protocols, and long-term follow-up. This review aims to evaluate current evidence on the effectiveness and limitations of AR in TKA. Methods: A scoping review of English written preclinical and clinical studies published between January 2013 and October 2023 was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Eligible studies were in English and reported on AR-assisted TKA systems. Sources included peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings. Studies with unclear methodology or insufficient comparative data were excluded. Results: The review included five preclinical and six clinical studies. Preclinical studies demonstrated the high precision of AR systems, with tibial cut errors averaging 0.66 degrees [standard deviation (SD) +/- 0.55 degrees] in the coronal plane and 0.89 degrees (SD +/- 0.75 degrees) in the sagittal plane. Similarly, femoral cuts exhibited average errors of 1.1 degrees (SD +/- 0.8 degrees) in the coronal plane and 0.86 degrees (SD +/- 0.5 degrees) in the sagittal plane. Clinical studies confirmed the non-inferiority of AR systems compared to accelerometer-based navigation, with success rates of alignment within 3 degrees of the mechanical axes reaching 95.4% for AR systems versus 93.2% for accelerometer navigation. Additionally, AR systems showed minimal impact on operative time and blood loss. However, significant heterogeneity in study designs and the lack of standardized PROMs were noted, limiting broader applicability and analysis. Conclusions: AR technology shows promise in improving surgical precision and reducing variability in TKA. However, challenges such as study heterogeneity, and the lack of standardized protocols and longterm outcomes limit its adoption. Future research should focus on standardized methods, patient-centered outcomes, and cost-effectiveness to support broader clinical use.","[Cacciola, Giorgio; Carturan, Francesco; Masse, Alessandro] Univ Turin, Ctr Traumatol Ortoped CTO, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Citta Salute & Sci Torino, Via Gianfranco Zuretti 29, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [Bosco, Francesco] Univ Palermo, Dept Precis Med Med Surg & Crit Care MePreCC, Palermo, Italy; [Bosco, Francesco] ASP 6, GF Ingrassia Hosp Unit, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Palermo, Italy; [Vezza, Daniele; De Meo, Federico; Schiro, Matteo; Sabatini, Luigi] Human Gradenigo Hosp, Dept Robot & Miniinvas Orthopaed Surg, Turin, Italy; [Cavaliere, Pietro] Ist Ortoped Mezzogiorno Italia Franco Scalabrino, Messina, Italy",A.O.U.

Therefore, it is important to maintain high quality CT image while effectively reducing radiation dose. In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning technology, deep learning-based LDCT denoising methods have become quite popular because of their data-driven and high-performance features to achieve excellent denoising results. However, to our knowledge, no relevant article has so far comprehensively introduced and reviewed advanced deep learning denoising methods such as Transformer structures in LDCT denoising tasks. Therefore, based on the literatures related to LDCT image denoising published from year 2016-2023, and in particular from 2020 to 2023, this study presents a systematic survey of current situation, and challenges and future research directions in LDCT image denoising field. Four types of denoising networks are classified according to the network structure: CNNbased, Encoder-Decoder-based, GAN-based, and Transformer-based denoising networks, and each type of denoising network is described and summarized from the perspectives of structural features and denoising performances. Representative deep-learning denoising methods for LDCT are experimentally compared and analyzed. The study results show that CNN-based denoising methods capture image details efficiently through multi-level convolution operation, demonstrating superior denoising effects and adaptivity. Encoder-decoder networks with MSE loss, achieve outstanding results in objective metrics. GANs based methods, employing innovative generators and discriminators, obtain denoised images that exhibit perceptually a closeness to NDCT. Transformer-based methods have potential for improving denoising performances due to their powerful capability in capturing global information. Challenges and opportunities for deep learning based LDCT denoising are analyzed, and future directions are also presented.","[Zhang, Ju; Ye, Lieli] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Gong, Weiwei; Shangguan, Zhibo] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fanghong] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Zhijiang Coll, Shaoxing, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Yun] Zhejiang Hosp, Dept Med Imaging, Hangzhou, Peoples R China",Hangzhou Normal University; Zhejiang University of Technology; Zhejiang University of Technology,"Cheng, Y (corresponding author), Zhejiang Hosp, Dept Med Imaging, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.",juzhang@hznu.edu.cn; 703447127@qq.com; 1537400425@qq.com; 328371324@qq.com; 1905471686@qq.com; 962110508@qq.com,"Gong, Weiwei/ONI-6705-2025",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [60974042],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (60974042) .

Here, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the prevalence of BRV among Bovidae from 1984 to 2021 in China. A total of 64 publications on BRV investigation in China were screened from the databases Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang Database, Technology Periodical Database (VIP), PubMed, and ScienceDirect. The random-effect model was used to calculate the pooled prevalence of BRV, and the analyzed data were derived from 25 provinces in China. The estimated pooled prevalence of BRV in China was 35.7% (8176/17,292). In addition, the prevalence of BRV in Southwestern China (77.1%; 2924/3600) was significantly higher than that in other regions of China. Regarding geographic and climatic factors, the prevalence of BRV in the subgroup of latitude 30-35 degrees (76.8%; 3303/4659) was significantly higher than that in the subgroup of latitude less than 30 degrees (37.0%; 485/1275) or more than 35 degrees (32.6%; 1703/5722), while the prevalence of BRV in the subgroup of longitude 100-105 degrees (75.4%; 2513/3849) was significantly higher than that in the subgroup of longitude less than 100 degrees (32.6%; 619/2255) or more than 105 degrees (48.9%; 2359/5552). Rainfall was positively correlated with the prevalence of BRV, whereas temperature was negatively correlated with the positive rate of BRV (P < 0.05). Our data showed that the prevalence of BRV was strongly correlated with geographical and climatic conditions. Thus, we recommend that the corresponding prevention and control programs should be formulated according to different geographical conditions. The strengthening of BRV surveillance in areas with high altitude, low temperature, and heavy rainfall may contribute to the decrease of the incidence of BRV infection among Bovidae herds in China.","[Qin, Yi-Feng; Zhao, Quan; Jiang, Jing] Changchun Sci Tech Univ, Coll Life Sci, Shuangyang 130600, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Qin, Yi-Feng; Gong, Qing-Long; Zhang, Yuan] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, Changchun 130118, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Miao; Sun, Zheng-Yao] Qingdao Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, Qingdao 266109, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wei; Wei, Xin-Yu; Chen, Yu] Heilongjiang Bayi Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Vet Med, Daqing 163319, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",Jilin Agricultural University; Qingdao Agricultural University; Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University,"Zhao, Q; Jiang, J (corresponding author), Changchun Sci Tech Univ, Coll Life Sci, Shuangyang 130600, Jilin, Peoples R China.;Zhang, Y (corresponding author), Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, Changchun 130118, Jilin, Peoples R China.",zhangyuan1101@163.com; zhaoquan0825@163.com; jiangjingxiaoyao@163.com,"Gong, Qing-Long/AAV-2127-2020; Zhang, Miao/JOJ-9361-2023",,,,,128,10,13,3,59,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0882-4010,1096-1208,MICROB PATHOGENESIS,Microb.

While these systems improve accuracy, traceability, and clinical decision-making, they also expose perfusion workflows to significant cybersecurity risks. Given that perfusion data directly reflect artificial circulation, any loss of integrity or service can have immediate clinical consequences.Materials and Methods A comprehensive narrative review was conducted to synthesize current knowledge on cybersecurity in perfusion informatics and performance. The research strategy combined systematic database searches (PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science) with targeted grey literature review (regulatory frameworks and institutional reports). Inclusion criteria focused on articles published between 2010 and 2024 addressing healthcare cybersecurity, perfusion informatics, and medical device security. Studies were analyzed qualitatively to identify recurring themes, technological approaches, and governance models. Reference cross-checking ensured comprehensive coverage, and terminology was standardized according to ISO/IEC 27001 principles. The review followed an integrative, non-meta-analytic design, emphasizing conceptual synthesis rather than statistical aggregation.Results Thirty-three primary and secondary sources were identified. The literature reveals a consistent pattern of vulnerabilities across clinical DMS, with perfusion systems being particularly exposed to ransomware, data tampering, and service interruption. The review highlights the centrality of the Confidentiality-Integrity-Assurance of Service triad as a guiding model. Key strategies identified include encryption and role-based access control, blockchain audit trails, federated learning, and post-quantum cryptography. However, empirical studies focusing specifically on perfusion remain scarce, underscoring a major research gap.Conclusions Cybersecurity in perfusion informatics must evolve from a technical adjunct to a clinical mandate. Integrating security frameworks into perfusion workflows supported by legal compliance (HIPAA, GDPR, ISO 27001) and ethical governance is essential to preserve patient safety. Future research should prioritize multicenter simulations, resilience testing, and cross-disciplinary training to ensure the continuity, integrity, and trustworthiness of digital perfusion systems.","[El Dsouki, Youssef; Lorusso, Roberto] Maastricht Univ Med Ctr, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Condello, Ignazio] Univ Insubria, Univ Varese Insubria, Sch Med & Surg, Varese, Italy; [Iacona, Calogero] Polytech Univ Lugano, Comp & Commun Sci, ISSEA, Lugano, Switzerland; [El Daccache, Samir] Univ Technol Compiegne, Dept Complex Syst Engn, Compiegne, France; [Lorusso, Roberto] Cardiovasc Res Ctr Maastricht CARIM, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); University of Insubria; Universite de Technologie de Compiegne,"El Dsouki, Y (corresponding author), Maastricht Univ, Cardiovasc Res Inst Maastricht CARIM, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, P Debyelaan 25, NL-6202 AZ Maastricht, Netherlands.",youssefdsouki@gmail.com,"; Lorusso, Roberto/ABB-9275-2020; Condello, Ignazio/ABD-9269-2020","Iacona, Calogero/0009-0008-6301-4414; El Dsouki, Youssef/0000-0001-6181-9480; Condello, Ignazio/0000-0003-1192-1908; Lorusso, Roberto/0000-0002-1777-2045",,,,16,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0267-6591,1477-111X,PERFUSION-UK,Perfusion-UK,2026 JAN 12,2026,,,,,,,,PMID 8700166,10.1177/02676591261417526,0.0,JAN 2026,9,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,AY0RO,41524152.0,hybrid,2026-02-03,WOS:001659485900001,0

Compassion is essential for high-quality healthcare and research shows how prosocial caring behaviors benefit human health and societies. However, the possible association between AI technologies and compassion is under conceptualized and underexplored. Objectives: The aim of this scoping review is to provide a comprehensive depth and a balanced perspective of the emerging topic of AI technologies and compassion, to inform future research and practice. The review questions were: How is compassion discussed in relation to AI technologies in healthcare? How are AI technologies being used to enhance compassion in healthcare? What are the gaps in current knowledge and unexplored potential? What are the key areas where AI technologies could support compassion in healthcare? Materials and methods: A systematic scoping review following five steps of Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Presentation of the scoping review conforms with PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). Eligibility criteria were defined according to 3 concept constructs (AI technologies, compassion, healthcare) developed from the literature and informed by medical subject headings (MeSH) and key words for the electronic searches. Sources of evidence were Web of Science and PubMed databases, articles published in English language 2011-2022. Articles were screened by title/abstract using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data extracted (author, date of publication, type of article, aim/context of healthcare, key relevant findings, country) was charted using data tables. Thematic analysis used an inductive-deductive approach to generate code categories from the review questions and the data. A multidisciplinary team assessed themes for resonance and relevance to research and practice. Results: Searches identified 3,124 articles. A total of 197 were included after screening. The number of articles has increased over 10 years (2011, n = 1 to 2021, n = 47 and from Jan-Aug 2022 n = 35 articles). Overarching themes related to the review questions were: (1) Developments and debates (7 themes) Concerns about AI ethics, healthcare jobs, and loss of empathy; Human-centered design of AI technologies for healthcare; Optimistic speculation AI technologies will address care gaps; Interrogation of what it means to be human and to care; Recognition of future potential for patient monitoring, virtual proximity, and access to healthcare; Calls for curricula development and healthcare professional education; Implementation of AI applications to enhance health and wellbeing of the healthcare workforce. (2) How AI technologies enhance compassion (10 themes) Empathetic awareness; Empathetic response and relational behavior; Communication skills; Health coaching; Therapeutic interventions; Moral development learning; Clinical knowledge and clinical assessment; Healthcare quality assessment; Therapeutic bond and therapeutic alliance; Providing health information and advice. (3) Gaps in knowledge (4 themes) Educational effectiveness of AI-assisted learning; Patient diversity and AI technologies; Implementation of AI technologies in education and practice settings; Safety and clinical effectiveness of AI technologies. (4) Key areas for development (3 themes) Enriching education, learning and clinical practice; Extending healing spaces; Enhancing healing relationships. Conclusion: There is an association between AI technologies and compassion in healthcare and interest in this association has grown internationally over the last decade. In a range of healthcare contexts, AI technologies are being used to enhance empathetic awareness; empathetic response and relational behavior; communication skills; health coaching; therapeutic interventions; moral development learning; clinical knowledge and clinical assessment; healthcare quality assessment; therapeutic bond and therapeutic alliance; and to provide health information and advice. The findings inform a reconceptualization of compassion as a human-AI system of intelligent caring comprising six elements: (1) Awareness of suffering (e.g., pain, distress, risk, disadvantage); (2) Understanding the suffering (significance, context, rights, responsibilities etc.); (3) Connecting with the suffering (e.g., verbal, physical, signs and symbols); (4) Making a judgment about the suffering (the need to act); (5) Responding with an intention to alleviate the suffering; (6) Attention to the effect and outcomes of the response. These elements can operate at an individual (human or machine) and collective systems level (healthcare organizations or systems) as a cyclical system to alleviate different types of suffering. New and novel approaches to human-AI intelligent caring could enrich education, learning, and clinical practice; extend healing spaces; and enhance healing relationships. Implications: In a complex adaptive system such as healthcare, human-AI intelligent caring will need to be implemented, not as an ideology, but through strategic choices, incentives, regulation, professional education, and training, as well as through joined up thinking about human-AI intelligent caring. Research funders can encourage research and development into the topic of AI technologies and compassion as a system of human-AI intelligent caring. Educators, technologists, and health professionals can inform themselves about the system of human-AI intelligent caring.","[Morrow, Elizabeth] Res Support Northern Ireland, Downpatrick, North Ireland; [Zidaru, Teodor] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Anthropol, London, England; [Ross, Fiona] Kingston Univ London, Fac Hlth Sci Social Care & Educ, London, England; [Patel, Kunal D.] Iheed, Dublin, Ireland; [Ream, Melissa] Kent Surrey Sussex Acad Hlth Sci Network AHSN, Worthing, Surrey, England; [Ream, Melissa] Natl AHSN Network Artificial Intelligence AI Initi, Worthing, Surrey, England; [Stockley, Rich] Surrey Heartlands Hlth & Care Partnership, Head Res & Engagement, Ashford, Surrey, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Kingston University,"Zidaru, T (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Anthropol, London, England.",t.m.zidaru-barbulescu@lse.ac.uk,"Morrow, Elizabeth/L-9231-2016; z, t/GQA-6221-2022","Morrow, Elizabeth/0000-0003-0649-629X;",ESRC [ES/V009494/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,337,107,137,68,385,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

The APOE epsilon 4 allele significantly increases AD risk, whereas the epsilon 2 allele is protective relative to the most common epsilon 3 allele. However, large differences in effect size exist across ethnoracial groups that are likely to depend on both global genetic ancestry and local genetic ancestry, as well as gene-environment interactions. Although early studies linked APOE to amyloid-beta - one of the two culprit aggregation-prone proteins that define AD - in the past decade, mounting work has associated APOE with other neurodegenerative proteinopathies and broader ageing-related brain changes, such as neuroinflammation, energy metabolism failure, loss of myelin integrity and increased blood-brain barrier permeability, with potential implications for longevity and resilience to pathological protein aggregates. Novel mouse models and other technological advances have also enabled a number of therapeutic approaches aimed at either attenuating the APOE epsilon 4-linked increased AD risk or enhancing the APOE epsilon 2-linked AD protection. This Review summarizes this progress and highlights areas for future research towards the development of APOE-directed therapeutics. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the greatest genetic modulator of sporadic Alzheimer disease risk. This Review provides a comprehensive update on our current knowledge of the genetics of APOE and its role in Alzheimer and other neurodegenerative diseases, and summarizes emerging APOE-targeted therapies designed to prevent or slow down Alzheimer disease. The risk of Alzheimer disease associated with the genotype is modulated by global and local genetic ancestries, other genetic risk loci and the lifetime exposome of an individual. missense mutations are providing key insights into the pathophysiology of the classic three APOE isoforms.The genotype might modulate the risk of other neurodegenerative diseases by influencing the pathobiology of their culprit aggregation-prone proteins.The isoforms affect a wide range of molecular and cellular functions in multiple brain cell types via cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms.Several strategies to target APOE therapeutically have shown efficacy in preclinical studies and hold promise for translation into clinical trials.","[Jackson, Rosemary J.; Hyman, Bradley T.; Serrano-Pozo, Alberto] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Jackson, Rosemary J.; Hyman, Bradley T.; Serrano-Pozo, Alberto] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Hyman, Bradley T.; Serrano-Pozo, Alberto] Massachusetts Alzheimers Dis Res Ctr, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School,"Hyman, BT; Serrano-Pozo, A (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.;Hyman, BT; Serrano-Pozo, A (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Hyman, BT; Serrano-Pozo, A (corresponding author), Massachusetts Alzheimers Dis Res Ctr, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",bhyman@mgh.harvard.edu; aserrano1@mgh.harvard.edu,"; Hyman, Bradley/ACU-8617-2022; SERRANO-POZO, ALBERTO/L-1519-2019","Jackson, Rosemary/0000-0002-5478-5611; Hyman, Bradley/0000-0002-7959-9401; SERRANO-POZO, ALBERTO/0000-0003-0899-7530","NIH/NIA [2RF1AG047644, 1RF1AG073236, R56AG080525, 5U01NS111671, 5K08AG064039, P30AG062421]; The Karen Toffler Charitable Trust; Harrison Gardner Jr Innovation Award; JPB Foundation",NIH/NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); The Karen Toffler Charitable Trust; Harrison Gardner Jr Innovation Award; JPB Foundation,"NIH/NIA (2RF1AG047644 to R.J.J. and B.T.H., 1RF1AG073236 to R.J.J., R56AG080525 to R.J.J. and B.T.H., 5U01NS111671 to B.T.H., 5K08AG064039 to A.S.-P. and P30AG062421 to A.S.-P. and B.T.H.), The Karen Toffler Charitable Trust (to A.S.-P. and B.T.H.), The Harrison Gardner Jr Innovation Award (to A.S.-P.) and The JPB Foundation (to B.T.H.).",277,92,103,21,59,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1759-4758,1759-4766,NAT REV NEUROL,Nat.

Driven by the potential to decarbonize hard-to-electrify sectors while leveraging existing engine platforms, there is increasing interest in hydrogen utilization in heavy-duty applications. This review examines recent advances in the fundamental understanding of hydrogen-diesel dual-fuel DI combustion under compression-ignition engine relevant conditions. It focuses on key factors influencing ignition, jet interactions, and combustion development, addressing a critical knowledge gap in dual-fuel DI technology with hydrogen, where recent advancements have provided new insights. Studies indicate that injection timing and sequence play a crucial role in determining combustion mode, transitioning between premixed and mixing-controlled regimes depending on hydrogen-diesel interactions. Early hydrogen injection promotes premixed combustion but can induce pressure oscillations, whereas later injection favors a mixing-controlled mode with lower peak heat release. Jet-jet interactions further complicate combustion, with converging injection configurations facilitating flame propagation but extending ignition delay due to increased preignition mixing. Experimental investigations have shown that injection duration influences jet momentum balance, affecting the entrainment of pilot combustion products into the hydrogen jet and, consequently, flame stabilization and heat release characteristics. Ambient conditions also have a significant effect on dual-fuel combustion. Lower ambient temperatures extend the ignition delay and fuel-air mixing time before ignition, leading to higher peak heat release rates. Reduced oxygen concentrations shift flame stabilization downstream and increase lift-off distance variability. Forced laser-induced ignition studies, supported by simplified numerical analysis, suggest that edge-flame deflagration mechanisms explain flame recession and stabilization under low-oxygen and low-temperature conditions. Injection parameters, including the pressure and nozzle diameter, also influence hydrogen jet development. Higher injection pressure enhances jet penetration and mixing but may extend the diffusion flame length, increasing heat transfer losses. Similarly, larger nozzle diameters increase the mass flow rate and heat release but also increase the hydrogen flame length. Overall, hydrogen-diesel dual-fuel DI combustion presents a viable pathway toward cleaner and more efficient engine operation. However, further research is required to optimize combustion processes and fully realize its potential.","[Rorimpandey, Patrick; Aryal, Kirtan; Zhai, Guanxiong; Yeoh, Guan Heng; Kook, Sanghoon; Chan, Qing Nian] Univ New South Wales, Sch Mech & Mfg Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Xu, Shijie] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Key Lab Educ Minist Power Machinery & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Mun Pang, Kar] Everllence, DK-2450 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of New South Wales Sydney; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Chan, QN (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Mech & Mfg Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",qing.chan@unsw.edu.au,"Kook, Sanghoon/C-5372-2009; Xu, Shijie/ABR-1014-2022","Zhai, Guanxiong/0000-0001-9307-206X;",Australian Government; Commonwealth through the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; SJTU-UNSW Collaborative Research Fund (Stage I),Australian Government(Australian Government); Commonwealth through the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; SJTU-UNSW Collaborative Research Fund (Stage I),The first author acknowledges the support of the Commonwealth through the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.

Naturally obtained 3 beta-hydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic acids reported for neuroprotective and dendritic structure are reported as solubility enhancers. Plants are free from toxic substances and act as natural capping agents. In this review, the pharmacological properties of ursolic acid (UA) and the structural properties of the dendritic structure are discussed. UA acid appears to have negligible toxicity and immunogenicity, as well as favorable biodistribution, according to the current study, and the dendritic structure improves drug solubility, prevents drug degradation, increases circulation time, and potentially targets by using different pathways with different routes of administration. Nanotechnology is a field in which materials are synthesized at the nanoscale. Nanotechnology could be the next frontier of humankind's technological advancement. Richard Feynman first used the term 'Nanotechnology' in his lecture, There is Plenty of Room at the Bottom, on 29th December, 1959, and since then, interest has increased in the research on nanoparticles. Nanotechnology is capable of helping humanity by solving major challenges, particularly in neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent type, which may account for 60-70% of cases. Other significant forms of dementia include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (abnormal protein aggregates that form inside nerve cells), and a number of illnesses that exacerbate frontotemporal dementia. Dementia is an acquired loss of cognition in several cognitive domains that are severe enough to interfere with social or professional functioning. However, dementia frequently co-occurs with other neuropathologies, typically AD with cerebrovascular dysfunction. Clinical presentations show that neurodegenerative diseases are often incurable because patients permanently lose some neurons. A growing body of research suggests that they also advance our knowledge of the processes that are probably crucial for maintaining the health and functionality of the brain. Serious neurological impairment and neuronal death are the main features of neurodegenerative illnesses, which are also extremely crippling ailments. The most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders cause cognitive impairment and dementia, and as average life expectancy rises globally, their effects become more noticeable.","[Singh, Aditya; Ansari, Vaseem Ahamad; Mahmood, Tarique; Ahsan, Farogh; Wasim, Rufaida; Shariq, Mohammad; Parveen, Saba; Shamim, Arshiya] Integral Univ, Dept Pharm, Kursi Rd, Lucknow 226026, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Maheshwari, Shubhrat] Rama Univ Mandhana, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Bithoor Rd, Kanpur 209217, Uttar Pradesh, India",Integral University,"Ansari, VA (corresponding author), Integral Univ, Dept Pharm, Kursi Rd, Lucknow 226026, Uttar Pradesh, India.",vaseem9in@gmail.com,"Singh, Aditya/CAA-8248-2022; Ahsan, Dr. Farogh/P-5984-2015; PARVEEN, DR.

Despite the many suggestions made in recent years, the shift from pediatric to adult care continues to pose difficulties for adolescents and young adults with epilepsy (AWE). The holistic perspective of AWE's experiences and needs during transition is not as well understood. Aim: To synthesize the qualitative evidence related to AWE's experiences and needs transitioning from pediatric to adult hospital care. Methods: This systematic review adhered to the rigorous Joanna Briggs methodology for qualitative evidence synthesis. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, from their inception to April 2024. The findings were critically appraised and aggregated using meta-synthesis. Results: The search yielded a total of 3,985 studies, and twenty-one were included in the review. Two of the included studies were undertaken in a program where a transition clinic was established. The meta-synthesis reveals that the transition experience of AWE is more than a change from one clinic to another and is interwoven into a pattern of developmental, health-illness, situational, and organizational transition issues. Five synthesized findings were developed: 1) Feeling different from others and striving to address the impact of epilepsy in everyday life; 2) the transition from pediatric to adult care - a problematic intersection point; 3) the family's role - support or parental overprotectiveness 4) seeking knowledge and being familiar with epilepsy supported by healthcare professionals and technologies, and 5) development of independence and responsibility through involvement and support from healthcare professionals and parents. Conclusion: During the transition from pediatric to adult hospital care, AWEs encounter a loss of familiarity, increased responsibility, and feelings of not belonging. Therefore, it is essential to create an environment where they can thrive beyond the limitations of their illness. Understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity should characterize this environment to support AWEs in facilitating the development of responsibility, independence, and confidence as they navigate transitions.","[Hansen, Ole Abildgaard; Beier, Christoph P.] Odense Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, JB Winslows Vej 4, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark; [Hansen, Ole Abildgaard] Univ Southern Denmark, Odense Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Res, Open Patient Data Explorat Network, JB Winslows Vej 9a, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark; [Hansen, Ole Abildgaard; Clemensen, Jane; Beier, Christoph P.; Smith, Anthony C.] Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Innovat Med Technol, Klovervaenget 8C,Entrance 101, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark; [Smith, Anthony C.] Univ Queensland, Princess Alexandra Hosp, Ctr Online Hlth, 199 Ipswich Rd, Woolloongabba, Qld 4102, Australia; [Smith, Anthony C.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Princess Alexandra Hosp Campus, Woolloongabba, Qld 4102, Australia; [Clemensen, Jane] Odense Univ Hosp, Hans Christian Andersen Hosp Children & Adolescent, Klovervaenget 23C, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark; [Larsen, Malene Kaas] Odense Univ Hosp, Dept Surg, JB Winslows Vej 4, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark; [Larsen, Malene Kaas] Univ Southern Denmark, Clin Inst, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark; [Pedersen, Jan Barasinski] Middelfart Municipal Social & Hlth Adm, Nytorv 9, DK-5500 Middelfart, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; Odense University Hospital; University of Southern Denmark; Odense University Hospital; University of Southern Denmark; Princess Alexandra Hospital; University of Queensland; University of Queensland; University of Southern Denmark; Odense University Hospital; University of Southern Denmark; Odense University Hospital; University of Southern Denmark,"Hansen, OA (corresponding author), Thorsgade 35, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark.",ole.a.hansen@rsyd.dk; Jane.Clemensen@rsyd.dk; Christoph.Beier@rsyd.dk; Jan.Barasinski@middelfart.dk; a.smith8@uq.edu.au; Malene.Larsen@rsyd.dk,"Beier, Christoph Patrick/ADO-7939-2022; Smith, Anthony/E-9538-2010; Clemensen, Jane/AAM-1434-2020","Beier, Christoph Patrick/0000-0001-8268-1492; Larsen, Malene Kaas/0000-0002-9075-2809; Smith, Anthony/0000-0002-7756-5136; Hansen, Ole Abildgaard/0000-0002-1876-0249; Clemensen, Jane/0000-0002-6127-1010",,,on issues in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines.,98,8,10,2,8,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1525-5050,1525-5069,EPILEPSY BEHAV,Epilepsy Behav.,SEP,2024,158.0,,,,,,,109955,10.1016/j.yebeh.2024.109955,0.0,JUL 2024,17,Behavioral Sciences; Clinical Neurology; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry,A3E6J,39059136.0,"Green Published, hybrid",2026-02-03,WOS:001281398100001,0

This article starts with a comparison of existing cybersecurity standards and regulations from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)-ISO27001, followed by a discussion on more specific and recent standards and regulations, such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (CPMI-IOSCO), and more general cryptography (and post-quantum cryptography), in the context of cybersecurity. These topics are followed up by a review of recent technical reports on cyber risk/security and a discussion on cloud security questions. Comparison of Blockchain cyber risk is also performed on the recent EU standards on cyber security, including European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme (EUCS)-cloud, and US standards-The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The study includes a review of Blockchain endpoint security, and new technologies e.g., IoT. The research methodology applied is a review and case study analysing secondary data on cybersecurity. The research significance is the integration of knowledge from the United States (US), the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), and international standards and frameworks on cybersecurity that can be alighted to new Blockchain projects. The results show that cybersecurity standards are not designed in close cooperation between the two major western blocks: US and EU. In addition, while the US is still leading in this area, the security standards for cryptocurrencies, internet-of-things, and blockchain technologies have not evolved as fast as the technologies have. The key finding from this study is that although the crypto-market has grown into a multi-trillion industry, the crypto-market has also lost over 70% since its peak, causing significant financial loss for individuals and cooperation's. Despite this significant impact to individuals and society, cybersecurity standards and financial governance regulations are still in their infancy, specifically in the UK.","[Radanliev, Petar] Univ Oxford, Oxford E Res Ctr, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Radanliev, P (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford E Res Ctr, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford, England.",petar.radanliev@eng.ox.ac.uk,"Radanliev, Petar/L-7509-2015","Radanliev, Petar/0000-0001-5629-6857",SPF [EP/S035362/1] Funding Source: UKRI,SPF(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),,61,10,14,1,34,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",2523-3173,1867-3236,REV SOCIONETWORK STR,Rev.

Data: Studies comparing the clinical effect of different interventions in the process of wound closure in IIP were included. Sources: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), and Wanfang Database. Study selection: A total of 34 studies involving 1213 implants and eight interventions were included in the network meta-analysis (NMA). The agreement between reviewers reached a kappa value of 0.84. In terms of reducing marginal peri-implant recession (MPR), as the primary outcome, NMA showed that connective tissue graft (CTG) [MD =-0.44, 95 % CI (-0.56,-0.33)], collagen matrix (CM) [MD =-0.32, 95 % CI (-0.46,-0.17)] and CGF [MD =-0.11, 95 %CI (-0.16,-0.06)] showed significant less MPR than the control group, and CTG [MD =-0.33, 95 %CI (-0.46,-0.20)] and CM [MD =-0.20, 95 %CI (-0.36,-0.05)] were also associated with less MPR compared to concentrate growth factor (CGF). The optimal intervention to prevent MPR was CTG. Among the secondary outcomes, CTG was determined as the optimal intervention to increase gingival thickness (GT), CGF ranked as the promising intervention to reduce marginal bone loss (MBL) and improve pink aesthetic score (PES). Conclusion: The use of CTF could enhance soft tissue stability by minimizing MPR and increasing GT in the process of wound closure in IIP, and CGF could better prevent MBL and improving PES. However, the findings related to CGF were based on a limited number of studies. Clinical significance: CTG and CGF ought to be worthy of clinical promotion to intervene wound closure of IIP in esthetic area, with the ability of improving the peri-implantsoft and hard tissues. However, clinicians should still consider the specific clinical situation when selecting the most appropriate intervention or alternative materials.","[Lu, Wei; Wu, Yang; Yao, Xinyu; Yu, Hedong] Hubei Univ Med, Taihe Hosp, Dept Stomatol, Shiyan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chao] Hubei Univ Med, Taihe Hosp, Ctr Evidence Based Med & Clin Res, Shiyan 442000, Hubei, Peoples R China",Hubei University of Medicine; Hubei University of Medicine,"Zhang, C (corresponding author), Hubei Univ Med, Taihe Hosp, Ctr Evidence Based Med & Clin Res, Shiyan 442000, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Yu, HD (corresponding author), Hubei Univ Med, Taihe Hosp, Ctr Evidence Based Med & Clin Res, Dept Stomatol, Shiyan 442000, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zhangchao0803@126.com; yuhedong85@163.com,"Zhang, Chao/KYP-8672-2024; Lu, Wei/NTQ-7985-2025","Zhang, Chao/0000-0002-9891-0605;",,,,126,0,0,2,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0300-5712,1879-176X,J DENT,J.

The study presents a conceptual model designed to reduce offshore dependence and maintain operational organizational capabilities. The study applies a systematic literature review approach to synthesize existing theories and research on the topic of crisis management and its impact on organizational sustainability during a war-induced crisis. A literature review encompassed identification of the themes that was followed by conceptualizing the model, and development of the propositions. The search terms included organizational operational performance, sustained economic performance, economic crisis, crisis management, war crisis and conflict crisis. Selection criteria for existing literature were based on relevance to the topic, quality of research, and theoretical contribution. Content analysis was performed to identify key themes and patterns referencing war, supply, sourcing capabilities, and sustainability. A detailed, systematic, and rigorous review of relevant literature, theories, and concepts in the field resulted in the identification of strategic activities for fostering cost-effective practices. Sustainable performance, by this account, can be achieved by assessing damage to supply chains and compensating for oil, gas, and energy flow vulnerabilities during crises. When pre-existing channels are cut off, resilient enterprises quickly use their human, infrastructural, and technological internal capabilities to rapidly obtain distinct auxiliary resources for production and manufacturing. By analyzing and synthesizing existing frameworks and concepts, we integrated current knowledge and recent developments on key variables. The research indicates that functional capabilities, such as continuous material flow, input diversification, environmental constraint management, and coordination among different organizational units, improve organizational sustainability. This will help to avoid bankruptcy when resources are scarce, and first-tier suppliers are located in conflict-affected countries. The paper identifies the drivers of resource availability, namely frequency in resource discovery, technological change in extraction methods, consumption, substitution, re-usage, and loss. Business capabilities explored in this paper are primarily stabilization-oriented and were chosen due to their potential for mitigating the consequences of resource scarcity.","[Obrenovic, Bojan; Njavro, Mato] Zagreb Sch Econ & Management, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Obrenovic, Bojan; Njavro, Mato] Luxembourg Sch Business, L-2453 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Godinic, Danijela] Univ Zagreb, Fac Philosophy, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Obrenovic, B (corresponding author), Zagreb Sch Econ & Management, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.;Obrenovic, B (corresponding author), Luxembourg Sch Business, L-2453 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",bojan@inovatus-usluge.hr; danijela.godinic5@gmail.com; mato.njavro@zsem.hr,"Obrenovic, Bojan/ADP-9461-2022","Obrenovic, Bojan/0000-0001-6072-4367",,,,174,3,9,2,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Loss of functional wild-type p53 is achieved via two main mechanisms: mutation of the gene leading to an absence of tumour suppressor activity and, in some cases, gain-of-oncogenic function; or inhibition of the wild-type p53 protein mediated by overexpression of its negative regulators MDM2 and MDMX. Because of its high potency as a tumour suppressor and the dependence of at least some established tumours on its inactivation, p53 appears to be a highly attractive target for the development of new anticancer drugs. However, p53 is a transcription factor and therefore has long been considered undruggable. Nevertheless, several innovative strategies have been pursued for targeting dysfunctional p53 for cancer treatment. In mutant p53-expressing tumours, the predominant strategy is to restore tumour suppressor function with compounds acting either in a generic manner or otherwise selective for one or a few specific p53 mutations. In addition, approaches to deplete mutant p53 or to target vulnerabilities created by mutant p53 expression are currently under development. In wild-type p53 tumours, the major approach is to protect p53 from the actions of MDM2 and MDMX by targeting these negative regulators with inhibitors. Although the results of at least some clinical trials of MDM2 inhibitors and mutant p53-restoring compounds are promising, none of the agents has yet been approved by the FDA. Alternative strategies, based on a better understanding of p53 biology, the mechanisms of action of compounds and treatment regimens as well as the development of new technologies are gaining interest, such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras for MDM2 degradation. Other approaches are taking advantage of the progress made in immune-based therapies for cancer. In this Review, we present these ongoing clinical trials and emerging approaches to re-evaluate the current state of knowledge of p53-based therapies for cancer. Although p53 was once considered undruggable, in this Review, Peuget et al. discuss the progress made in targeting p53 as a form of cancer therapy with approaches ranging from restoration of mutant p53 function to inhibition of the negative regulator of p53, MDM2, as well as newer strategies, including p53-based mRNA vaccines and antibodies.","[Peuget, Sylvain; Selivanova, Galina] Karolinska Inst, Dept Microbiol Tumour & Cell Biol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Zhou, Xiaolei] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Inst Bioengn, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Zhou, Xiaolei] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Inst Mat Sci & Engn, Lausanne, Switzerland",Karolinska Institutet; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Selivanova, G (corresponding author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Microbiol Tumour & Cell Biol, Stockholm, Sweden.",galina.selivanova@ki.se,"Zhou, Xiaolei/KBB-1673-2024; Peuget, Sylvain/AAB-4730-2022","Zhou, Xiaolei/0000-0002-7293-4641; Peuget, Sylvain/0000-0002-3315-1935; Selivanova, Galina/0000-0002-8698-4332",Swedish Cancer Society; Swedish Research Council; Swiss Bridge Foundation; Karolinska Institutet,Swedish Cancer Society(Swedish Cancer Society); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Swiss Bridge Foundation; Karolinska Institutet(Karolinska Institutet),"This study has been supported by Swedish Cancer Society grants to G.S. and S.P., grants from the Swedish Research Council to G.S. and from the Swiss Bridge Foundation to S.P., as well as support from the Karolinska Institutet.",231,118,131,32,125,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1474-175X,1474-1768,NAT REV CANCER,Nat.

Orchids have tens of thousands of members in nature. Many of them have promising application potential in the extension and conservation of the ecological chain, the horticultural use of ornamental blossoms, and the utilization of botanical medicines. However, a large-scale gene knockout mutant library and a sophisticated genetic transformation system are still lacking in the improvement of orchid germplasm resources. New gene editing tools, such as the favored CRISPR-Cas9 or some base editors, have not yet been widely applied in orchids. In addition to a large variety of orchid cultivars, the high-precision, high-throughput genome sequencing technology is also required for the mining of trait-related functional genes. Nowadays, the focus of orchid genomics research has been directed to the origin and classification of species, genome evolution and deletion, gene duplication and chromosomal polyploidy, and flower morphogenesis-related regulation. Here, the progressing achieved in orchid molecular biology and genomics over the past few decades have been discussed, including the evolution of genome size and polyploidization. The frequent incorporation of LTR retrotransposons play important role in the expansion and structural variation of the orchid genome. The large-scale gene duplication event of the nuclear genome generated plenty of recently tandem duplicated genes, which drove the evolution and functional divergency of new genes. The evolution and loss of the plastid genome, which mostly affected genes related to photosynthesis and autotrophy, demonstrated that orchids have experienced more separate transitions to heterotrophy than any other terrestrial plant. Moreover, large-scale resequencing provide useful SNP markers for constructing genetic maps, which will facilitate the breeding of novel orchid varieties. The significance of high-throughput sequencing and gene editing technologies in the identification and molecular breeding of the trait-related genes in orchids provides us with a representative trait-improving gene as well as some mechanisms worthy of further investigation. In addition, gene editing has promise for the improvement of orchid genetic transformation and the investigation of gene function. This knowledge may provide a scientific reference and theoretical basis for orchid genome studies.","[Song, Cheng; Wang, Yan; Wei, Peipei; Zhu, Fucheng] West Anhui Univ, Coll Biol & Pharmaceut Engn, Luan, Peoples R China; [Manzoor, Muhammad Aamir] Anhui Agr Univ, Sch Life Sci, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Mao, Di] Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst Agr & Hort Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Cao, Yunpeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Plant Germplasm Enhancement & Specialty Ag, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan, Peoples R China","West Anhui University; Anhui Agricultural University; Humboldt University of Berlin; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wuhan Botanical Garden, CAS","Zhu, FC (corresponding author), West Anhui Univ, Coll Biol & Pharmaceut Engn, Luan, Peoples R China.;Cao, YP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Plant Germplasm Enhancement & Specialty Ag, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",xfcypeng@126.com; fucheng323@163.com,"Song, Cheng/AAD-5614-2022; Cao, Yunpeng/ITU-7999-2023; Manzoor, Muhammad Aamir/GXN-0012-2022","Song, Cheng/0000-0001-6274-330X; Cao, Yunpeng/0000-0001-5976-2382; Manzoor, Muhammad Aamir/0000-0002-4277-5483",Anhui Province Postdoctoral Fund; High-level Talents Research Initiation Fund of West Anhui University; Postdoctoral Fund of West Anhui University; Anhui Provincial Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine Project; [2020B454]; [WGKQ2022025]; [WXBSH2019001]; [2020zcyb09],Anhui Province Postdoctoral Fund; High-level Talents Research Initiation Fund of West Anhui University; Postdoctoral Fund of West Anhui University; Anhui Provincial Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine Project; ; ; ;,"Funding This work was supported by Anhui Province Postdoctoral Fund (2020B454), High-level Talents Research Initiation Fund of West Anhui University (WGKQ2022025), Postdoctoral Fund of West Anhui University (WXBSH2019001), and Anhui Provincial Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine Project (2020zcyb09).",162,22,24,7,92,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Food waste is an important concern for human well-being and the ecosystem, as well as the hidden opportunity for value-added product conversion. Various parameters of food supply chains and waste management systems contribute to the social, environmental, and economic aspects. Thus, valorization and utilization of food waste is an emerging field focused on converting waste to valuable products such as biofuels, platform chemicals, energy, and carbon materials. As reported in previous studies, food waste is a potential source of valuable bioactive molecules and bioenergy. Earlier studies indicate that the advanced valorization processes of food waste are not applied in developing countries, leading to underutilization of food waste in these regions due to limited research initiatives. This comprehensive review examines several vital and advanced options for the sustainable valorization of food waste, emphasizing its prospects and challenges. Given the inevitable waste generated during handling, transportation, and food processing, the sustainable valorization of food waste is a promising option for the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This review aims to promote the adoption of sustainable technologies to convert waste into wealth of valuable products through biorefinery approaches and integrated valorization approaches, leading to the efficient recycling of global food waste. Herein, biorefinery approaches especially focusing on advanced hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and potential applications of bioproducts derived from food waste have been investigated succinctly. Other conventional valorization approaches such as incineration, landfilling, etc. are described briefly. Additionally, the general comparison and in-depth discussion regarding the sustainability and feasibility of food waste valorization techniques and their technological, economic, and environmental assessments from state-of-the-art perspectives have been discussed. Food waste derived from HTC process has great potential to produce biobased carbon materials for environmental and energy applications. This can significantly contribute to reducing environmental pollution and addressing the shortage of energy crisis. Finally, knowledge gaps and potential risks in the synthesis of bioproducts especially focusing on hydrochar derived from food waste are pointed out, with highlights of the challenges and prospects of this study.","[Hayder, Aneela; Mazhkoo, Shahin; Patel, Vidhi; Norouzi, Omid; Santos, Rafael M.; Dutta, Animesh] Univ Guelph, Sch Engn, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Dutta, A (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Sch Engn, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",adutta@uoguelph.ca,"Santos, Rafael/G-1657-2011; Dutta, Animesh/I-5035-2014; Norouzi, Omid/AAJ-6286-2021; Mazhkoo, Shahin/IYS-3986-2023","Dutta, Animesh/0000-0002-9995-807X;","NSERC; NSERC Discovery grant [ASC-16]; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA), Biomass Canada of BiofuelNet Canada Network","NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); NSERC Discovery grant(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA), Biomass Canada of BiofuelNet Canada Network","The authors appreciate the financial support from the NSERC Discovery grant.

This literature review aims to provide a scientifically comprehensive overview of HG within the context of the emergency room (ER) setting. This review aims to enhance understanding and improve the management of HG cases presented to the ER by synthesizing current knowledge and evidence-based practices.This literature review encompasses a systematic analysis of relevant scientific literature, encompassing original research studies, review articles, and clinical guidelines. An extensive search of electronic databases was conducted, covering the period from January 2003 to January 2023. Keywords related to HG, pregnancy -related complications, emergency medicine, and ER management were employed to identify pertinent publications.Through the literature review, we found the incidence of HG-related ER admission to be 0.8%. Although the etiology of HG remains to be unknown, a strong association was found between developing HG in pregnant females and a history of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, use of cannabis, and pregnancies conceived through artificial reproductive technology (ART). Furthermore, overweight females were more likely to develop HG. Maternal smoking was found to be protective against HG. The symptoms of HG mainly include intractable nausea and vomiting occurring usually between four and nine weeks of gestational age with a significant aversion to food and loss of weight. Diagnosis is done through a strong clinical suspicion, a history of HG in previous pregnancies, and a basic metabolic panel. Treatment includes intravenous (IV) fluids, antiemetic therapy, corticoids, thiamine supplements, and laxatives. In our review, we highlight a few complications that can be seen in HG through a synopsis of unique case reports found during our literature search.In conclusion, through this review, we wish to highlight HG as an obstetrical emergency. We aim to improve understanding, enhance early recognition, and promote evidence-based management strategies for HG in the emergency room. We hope that the findings presented herein will serve as a valuable resource for healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers involved in the care of pregnant females experiencing HG in the ER.","[Joshi, Arushi] Sri Ramachandra Inst Higher Educ & Res, Med, Chennai, India; [Chadha, Garima] Sri Ramachandra Inst Higher Educ & Res, Emergency Med, Chennai, India; [Narayanan, Palaniappan] Sri Ramachandra Inst Higher Educ & Res, Obstet & Gynecol, Chennai, India",Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education & Research; Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education & Research; Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education & Research,"Joshi, A (corresponding author), Sri Ramachandra Inst Higher Educ & Res, Med, Chennai, India.",arujo1630@gmail.com,,"Joshi, Arushi/0000-0003-2410-9927",,,,35,1,2,0,3,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2168-8184,CUREUS J MED SCIENCE,Cureus J Med Sci,AUG 23,2023,15.0,8,,,,,,e44004,10.7759/cureus.44004,0.0,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),General & Internal Medicine,R5YJ5,37746494.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001065104700025,0

All of the databases were searched using a combination of the following search terms: psychological intervention nursing, psychological nursing, psychotherapy, breast loss, radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, and quality of life. The quality of the included literature was assessed using RevMan 5.3 provided by the Cochrane system Results: A total of 12 articles were included, and the meta-analysis results showed that the quality of life questionnaire core 30 (QLQ-C 30) was evaluated, and there was heterogeneity among the studies (P<0.00001, I-2=92%). There was no statistical difference between the intervention group and the control group [standardized mean difference (SMD) =0.58,95% confidence interval (CI): -0.11-1.27, P=0.10]. Short Form 36 Questionnaire (SF-36) was evaluated, and there was no heterogeneity among the studies (P=0.40, I-2=0%). The fixed effect model was used for Meta-analysis. There were statistical differences between the intervention group and the control group [mean difference (MD) =6.12, 95% CI: 5.17-7.06, P<0.00001]. According to the evaluation of functional assessment of cancer therapy (FACT), there is heterogeneity among the studies (P=0.003, I-2=83%). There were statistical differences between the intervention group and the control group (MD =12.74, 95% CI: 6.34-19.14, P<0.0001). Discussion: Psychological nursing intervention can significantly improve the quality of life of patients with missing breasts undergoing radical mastectomy, which has certain guiding significance for the formulation of clinically effective nursing measures.","[Li, Hanbing; Wang, Xiaoqing; Lin, Shuai; Yang, Wen; Cai, Hui] North Sichuan Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp, Thyroid & Breast Surg Dept, Nanchong, Peoples R China; [Li, Junfeng] Nanchong City Cent Hosp, Cardiothorac Surg, Nanchong, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Feng, Xiaofen] North Sichuan Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp, Burn Plast Surg Dept, Nanchong, Peoples R China",North Sichuan Medical University; North Sichuan Medical University,"Feng, XF (corresponding author), North Sichuan Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp, Nanchong, Peoples R China.",1823237062@qq.com,,,,,,38,10,11,3,28,AME PUBLISHING COMPANY,SHATIN,"FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",2227-684X,2227-8575,GLAND SURG,Gland Surg.,MAY,2022,11.0,5,,,,882,891,,10.21037/gs-22-206,0.0,APR 2022,10,Surgery,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Surgery,2F8OM,35694086.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:000798802600001,0

With the number of cybercrimes increasing year after year and the financial losses escalating, law enforcement must advance its capacity to identify cybercriminals, collect probative evidence, and bring cybercriminals before the courts. Arguably to date, the approach to combatting cybercrime has been technologically centric (e.g., anti-virus, anti-spyware). Cybercrimes, however, are the result of human activities based on human motives. It is, therefore, important that any comprehensive law enforcement strategy for combatting cybercrime includes a deeper understanding of the hackers that sit behind the keyboards. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the state of the literature relating to the application of a human-centric investigative tool (i.e., profiling) to cybercrime by conducting a qualitative meta-synthesis. Adhering to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, this systematic review focuses specifically on cybercrime where a computer is the target (e.g., hacking, DDoS, distribution of malware). Using a comprehensive search strategy, this review used the following search terms: cybercrime, computer crime, internet crime, cybercriminal, hacker, black hat, profiling, criminal profiling, psychological profiling, offender profiling, criminal investigative analysis, behavioral profiling, behavioral analysis, personality profiling, investigative psychology, and behavioral evidence analysis in all combinations to identify the relevant literature in the ACM Digital Library, EBSCOhost databases, IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, Scopus, PsychInfo, and Google Scholar. After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a total of 72 articles were included in the review. This article utilizes a systematic review of the current literature on cyber profiling as a foundation for the development of a comprehensive framework for applying profiling techniques to cybercrime-described as cyber behavioral analysis (CBA). Despite decades of research, our understanding of cybercriminals remains limited. A lack of dedicated researchers, the paucity of research regarding human behavior mediated by technology, and limited access to datasets have hindered progress. The aim of this article was to advance the knowledge base in cyber behavioral sciences, and in doing so, inform future empirical research relating to the traits and characteristics of cybercriminals along with the application of profiling techniques and methodologies to cybercrime.","[Martineau, Melissa; Aiken, Mary] Capitol Technol Univ, Cyberpsychol Dept, Laurel, MD 20708 USA; [Spiridon, Elena] Edge Hill Univ, Dept Psychol, Ormskirk L39 4QP, England",Capitol Technology University; Edge Hill University,"Martineau, M (corresponding author), Capitol Technol Univ, Cyberpsychol Dept, Laurel, MD 20708 USA.",mmartineau@captechu.edu; spiridoe@edgehill.ac.uk; mpaiken@captechu.edu,,"Aiken, Mary/0000-0001-9800-3952",,,,101,14,16,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2673-6756,FORENSIC SCI-BASEL,Forensic Sci.,JUL 22,2023,3.0,3,,,,452,477,,10.3390/forensicsci3030032,0.0,,26,"Medicine, Legal",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Legal Medicine,2OL8I,,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001487510900001,0

Traditional assessment methods, including HbA1c checks and self-monitoring of blood glucose, can be unreliable and inaccurate. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) offers a non-invasive and more detailed alternative. Availability of this technology is increasing worldwide. However, there is no current comprehensive evidence on the acceptability and feasibility of these devices. This is a protocol for a mixed-methods systematic review of qualitative and quantitative evidence about acceptability and feasibility of CGM in people with diabetes. MethodsWe will search MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL for qualitative and quantitative evidence about the feasibility and acceptability of CGM in all populations with diabetes (any type) using search terms for continuous glucose monitoring  and diabetes . We will not apply any study-type filters. Searches will be restricted to studies conducted in humans and those published from 2011 onwards. We will not restrict the search by language. Study selection and data extraction will be carried out by two reviewers independently using Rayyan and Eppi-Reviewer, respectively, with disagreements resolved by discussion. Data extraction will include key information about each study, as well as qualitative evidence in the form of participant quotes from primary studies and themes and subthemes based on the authors' analysis. Quantitative data relating to acceptability and feasibility including data loss, adherence, and quantitative ratings of acceptability will be extracted as means and standard deviations or n/N as appropriate. Qualitative evidence will be analysed using framework analysis informed by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Where possible, quantitative evidence will be combined using random-effects meta-analysis; otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be performed. The most appropriate method for integrating qualitative and quantitative findings will be selected based on the data available. DiscussionOngoing assessment of the acceptability of interventions has been identified as crucially important to scale-up and implementation. This review will provide new knowledge with the potential to inform a programme theory of CGM as well as future roll-out to potentially vulnerable populations, including those with severe mental illness.

Although its incidence has declined due to vaccines, outbreaks still occur among children. In addition, it can lead to severe complications, so it has a certain perniciousness. Pudilan Xiaoyan oral liquid (PDL), a Chinese patent medicine, commonly treats children with mumps. However, its safety, efficacy, and specific mechanisms lack relevant evaluation and analysis. Therefore, we did a meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials combined with a network pharmacology analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of PDL in relieving symptoms of mumps in children and investigate its pharmacological mechanisms. Methods: This study systematically searched the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang Data Knowledge Service Platform, VIP Database, Sinomed, Chinese Medical Journal Full-text Database, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for the published randomized controlled trials (date up to 3 March 2022; studies in both English and Chinese) comparing PDL and antiviral drug combination treatment to standalone antiviral drug treatment. The primary outcomes in this study were the effective rate and duration of five characteristic symptoms of children's mumps. We assessed the pooled data by using a fix-effect or random-effect model. We illustrated an odds ratio (OR) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Stata 15 software. In network pharmacology, active components of PDL were collected from the traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology technology platform and the CNKI studies, while mumps' targets were collected from databases of the Genecards and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), and then we constructed a drug-component-target  network and a protein-protein interaction network using Cytoscape 3.9.0 for screening the core components and targets. Next, we ran Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of intersection targets of PDL and mumps. Finally, molecular docking was performed between core components and targets. Results: Of 70 identified studies, 12 were eligible and included in our analysis (N = 1,307 participants). Compared with the antiviral drug treatments, combination treatment using PDL and antiviral drugs provided higher effective rates (OR = 5.94), shorter symptom durations for fever (SMD = -1.05), headache (SMD = -0.69), parotid gland swelling (SMD = -1.30), parotid gland pain (SMD = -2.53), and loss of appetite (SMD = -0.56) with fewer reported side effects. Of the 113 active components of PDL and 57 mumps' targets, 11 core components like quercetin, isoetin, and seven core targets such as albumin (ALB) and interleukin-6 were obtained. Moreover, the potential pathways identified included cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and T helper cell 17 (Th17 cell) differentiation. Molecular docking results revealed that most core components and targets could form stable structures. The core components, including isoetin, quercetin, and luteolin, and core targets involving heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha (HSP90AA1), estrogen receptor (ESR1), and ALB showed the best affinities. Conclusion: The combined use of PDL and antiviral drugs could effectively improve the efficacy of mumps among children and rapidly alleviate mumps-related symptoms. This efficacy may be associated with the anti-inflammatory and antiviral mechanisms by which PDL acts using multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways. However, these results should be confirmed by further studies.","[Liu, Yi; Cui, Xin; Xi, Junyu; Xie, Yanming] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Inst Basic Res Clin Med, Beijing, Peoples R China","China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences; Institute of Basic Research In Clinical Medicine, CACMS","Xie, YM (corresponding author), China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Inst Basic Res Clin Med, Beijing, Peoples R China.",ktzu2018@163.com,"; Liu, Yi/IUN-4144-2023","刘, 毅/0000-0002-1344-3340; Cui, Xin/0000-0003-2257-6724","National Key Research and Development Program of The Ministry of Science and Technology of China in 2018, Research on Modernization of TCM project, Demonstration Study on Evidence-based Evaluation and Effect mechanism of Ten Chinese patent Medicines and [2018YFC1707400]; Qihuang scholar support project in 2021; Scientific and technological innovation project of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences [CI2021B003]","National Key Research and Development Program of The Ministry of Science and Technology of China in 2018, Research on Modernization of TCM project, Demonstration Study on Evidence-based Evaluation and Effect mechanism of Ten Chinese patent Medicines and; Qihuang scholar support project in 2021; Scientific and technological innovation project of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences","The study is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of The Ministry of Science and Technology of China in 2018, Research on Modernization of TCM project, Demonstration Study on Evidence-based Evaluation and Effect mechanism of Ten Chinese patent Medicines and Classic Famous Prescriptions in the Treatment of Major Diseases after Marketed (No. 2018YFC1707400); Qihuang scholar support project in 2021; Scientific and technological innovation project of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (No:CI2021B003).",77,4,4,1,45,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1663-9812,FRONT PHARMACOL,Front.

However, there is a knowledge gap in the role and impact of corruption within the context of the global food system. We aimed to systematically review empirical literature focused on corruption in the global food system to examine how it is characterized, the actors involved, its potential impacts, and the solutions that have been proposed to address corruption in the food system.Methods We used a systematic scoping review methodology. Terms combining corruption and the food system were searched in Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycInfo and Econlit, in October 2021. Two screeners applied a priori selection criteria to screen the articles at the title and abstract and full-text levels. Data was extracted into a charting form and thematically synthesized to describe the types of corruption in the food system, the actors involved, how corruption impacts the food system, and potential solutions. Sankey diagrams and narrative summaries were developed to summarize the included studies and findings.Results From the 238 included records, five main types of corruption were identified in the global food system: bureaucratic corruption, fraud, bribery, organized crime, and corporate political activity. These different types of corruption spanned across various food system areas, from policy and governance structures to food environments, and involved a wide range of actors. More powerful actors like those in public and private sectors tended to instigate corruption in the food system, while community members and primary producers tended to be impacted by it. The impacts of corruption were mostly negative and corruption was found to undermine food system governance and regulatory structures; threaten health, safety, and food security; and lead or contribute to environmental degradation, economic loss, erosion of trust, social inequities, and decreased agricultural productivity. While solution-oriented literature was limited, the essential role of strong governance, use of technology and predictive modelling methods to improve detection of corruption, and organizational approaches to problem solving were identified.Conclusion Our review findings provide researchers and policymakers with a comprehensive overview of corruption in the global food system, providing insights to inform a more holistic approach to addressing the issue. Addressing corruption in the food system is an essential element of supporting the transition to a more healthy, equitable and sustainable global food system.","[Demeshko, Anastassia; Astbury, Chloe Clifford; Lee, Kirsten M.; Clarke, Janielle; Penney, Tarra L.] York Univ, Sch Global Hlth, Global Food Syst & Policy Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Astbury, Chloe Clifford; Lee, Kirsten M.; Penney, Tarra L.] York Univ, Dahdaleh Inst Global Hlth Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Cullerton, Katherine] Univ Queensland, Sch Publ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",York University - Canada; York University - Canada; University of Queensland,"Penney, TL (corresponding author), York Univ, Sch Global Hlth, Global Food Syst & Policy Res, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Penney, TL (corresponding author), York Univ, Dahdaleh Inst Global Hlth Res, Toronto, ON, Canada.",tpenney@yorku.ca,"Clifford Astbury, Chloe/IXN-4349-2023; Cullerton, Katherine/I-1921-2019",,York University,York University,No Statement Available,149,6,7,10,27,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1744-8603,GLOBALIZATION HEALTH,Global.

Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) systems have emerged as a promising technology that combines renewable energy generation with the infra-structure of buildings. This paper comprehensively reviews the BIPV system for EV charging, focusing on its technology, application, and performance. The review identifies the gaps in the existing literature, emphasizing the need for a thorough examination of BIPV systems in the context of EV charging. A detailed review of BIPV technology and its application in EV charging is presented, covering aspects such as the generation of solar cell technology, BIPV system installation, design options and influencing factors. Furthermore, the review examines the performance of BIPV systems for EV charging, focusing on energy, economic, and environmental parameters and their comparison with previous studies. Additionally, the paper explores current trends in energy management for BIPV and EV charging, highlighting the need for effective integration and recommending strategies to optimize energy utilization. Combining BIPV with EV charging provides a promising approach to power EV chargers, enhances building energy efficiency, optimizes the building space, reduces energy losses, and decreases grid dependence. Utilizing BIPV-generated electricity for EV charging provides electricity and fuel savings, offers financial incentives, and increases the market value of the building infrastructure. It significantly lowers greenhouse gas emissions associated with grid and vehicle emissions. It creates a closed-loop circular economic system where energy is produced, consumed, and stored within the building. The paper underscores the importance of effective integration between Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) and Electric Vehicle (EV) charging, emphasizing the necessity of innovative grid technologies, energy storage solutions, and demand-response energy management strategies to overcome diverse challenges. Overall, the study contributes to the knowledge of BIPV systems for EV charging by presenting practical energy management, effectiveness and sustainability implications. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers working towards sustainable transportation and energy systems. This study explores the synergy between sustainable transportation and electric vehicle (EV) charging through integration of Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) systems.

Intensification practices can be resource demanding for micro and macronutrients, dedicated feeds, fossil fuels, chemotherapeutics, and water. Water replaces evaporative losses and may be used to dilute nutrient-rich wastewater. As an alternative to wastewater discharge, biofloc technology (BFT) uses microbes to manage nutrient levels in production systems. A microbial community grown at high densities can assimilate waste metabolites for growth. This is promoted by increasing the carbon-nitrogen (C:N) ratio using a combination of aquafeed fed to the fish and an additional carbohydrate source, for example, starch, molasses, or bran. The microbial biomass offers a continuous and additional food source to the farmed animal, thus reducing the need for finished aquafeeds and lowering the feed conversion ratio. Although the approach relies on multiple interacting species, BFT can be deployed in relatively low technology settings. This review considers the basis of BFT and identifies areas for innovation and expansion. For example, control of light quantity and quality can influence the biofloc and hence the growth of cultured species. Research on biofloc aquaculture is dominated by studies using tilapia and shrimp, but the technology could be applied to other species, particularly species that are tolerant of biofloc conditions and not highly carnivorous. Biofloc may be a useful biosecurity tool for all or part of the life cycle, and meals made from dried biofloc may enhance the production of cultured species. The key benefits of BFT can potentially be seen in reduced water consumption, lower feed requirements, and improved fish health. This review differs from current review papers in proposing the use of a life cycle assessment in conjunction with BFT, which may be a useful tool for describing and communicating the relative benefits of biofloc systems and their wider environmental impact. This study will serve as a useful knowledge base of BFT information for students, researchers, and stakeholders alike, offering a central source of the main aspects around the culturing of biofloc, key parameters, common species used, areas of potential improvement, and a discussion on where the future of BFT may lie. This paper is a review paper based on biofloc technology (BFT). In this paper the current global status of BFT, the biology behind the technique and areas for future expansion are discussed.image","[Mccusker, Stephen; Davies, Simon J.; Valente, Cecilia de Souza; Johnson, Mark P.; Wan, Alex H.

The submitted study deals with the current state of sewage sludge treatment with a focus on assessing the advantages and disadvantages of selected technologies. The main objective of the review study is to evaluate the advantages and limitations of individual sewage sludge processing technologies. Based on the evaluation of the advantages and limitations, another objective of the study was to determine the most suitable, less suitable, or unsuitable technologies for sewage sludge processing. Another objective of the study was to evaluate innovative technologies (not only commonly used ones). The purpose of this objective was to monitor the most current trends in sewage sludge processing technologies and, by evaluating them, to expand knowledge in this scientific field. The presented analysis of sewage sludge treatment was carried out in accordance with current European directives. The main novelty of the review study is a comprehensive assessment of sludge processing technologies with a focus on their main advantages and limitations. Another novelty is the focus of the study on innovative methods of sewage sludge processing. As part of the analysis, the evaluated sludge treatment technologies were divided into three categories: conventional, alternative, and innovative. As a conventional method, composting is currently the dominant method of sewage sludge management in the Slovak Republic. Mono-incineration, which is one of the conventional methods, allows for an effective reduction of the volume of sewage sludge while removing all unwanted hazardous components at the same time. However, this sludge treatment technology causes simultaneously the loss of most of the valuable nutrients, contained in sewage sludge. Pyrolysis and gasification as alternative technologies are effective in terms of removing hazardous components, but they are complex technologies, and their economic viability depends on their ability to maximise efficiency and produce high-value energy carriers. Hydrothermal liquefaction has a major advantage over all other thermal sewage sludge treatment processes because it does not require sludge drying. Innovative methods of sewage sludge treatment such as bio-electrochemical system, supercritical water oxidation, and biodiesel production require a more detailed examination by the scientific community to implement these methods in practice due to the lack of information from operational experiments. Given the extensiveness of the sludge treatment issue, we plan to address the economic aspect of the technologies in a separate study in the future.","[Salva, Jozef; Seckar, Michal; Schwarz, Marian; Samesova, Dagmar; Mordacova, Martina; Ponist, Juraj] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Ecol & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Engn, T G Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia; [Veverkova, Darina] Tech Univ Zvolen, Inst Foreign Languages, T G Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96001, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen; Technical University Zvolen,"Ponist, J (corresponding author), Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Ecol & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Engn, T G Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia.",xponistj@is.tuzvo.sk,"Salva, Jozef/ABA-3195-2021; Samešová, Dagmar/CAF-4157-2022; Schwarz, Marian/G-7770-2015; Veverkova, Darina/MYR-2368-2025; Sečkár, Michal/OLP-5017-2025","Sečkár, Michal/0009-0006-9729-9708; Poništ, Juraj/0000-0002-6399-3308",ITMS [ITMS 313011 T721]; ERDF [1/0524/23],ITMS; ERDF(European Union (EU)),"The research presented in this paper is an outcome of project Comprehensive research of determinants for ensuring environmental health (ENVIHEALTH), ITMS 313011 T721 supported by the Operational Programme Integrated Infrastructure (OPII) funded by the ERDF.

RPW larvae feed on the palm tree trunk and can result in tree death, thus having a major impact on both wild and cultivated palm trees in several countries. The resulting economic and biodiversity losses caused by invasive populations of the RPW gave it a major pest status, and now governments, companies, and researchers across multiple countries are interested in developing effective control strategies to prevent further damage. Managing agricultural pests in the face of pressures such as climate change, rising levels of insecticide resistance, and increasing demands for food production will require advanced knowledge of pest biology. In this review, after presenting basic aspects of RPW biology and pest status, we gather information on the use of omics technologies, such as transcriptomics, genomics, and metagenomics, and explore their achievements and potentials to illuminate RPW biology and improve management. We finalize the review by exploring current opportunities and challenges in the use of these technologies for RPW management. The red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is the most devastating pest of palm trees worldwide. Mitigation of the economic and biodiversity impact it causes is an international priority that could be greatly aided by a better understanding of its biology and genetics. Despite its relevance, the biology of the RPW remains poorly understood, and research on management strategies often focuses on outdated empirical methods that produce sub-optimal results. With the development of omics approaches in genetic research, new avenues for pest control are becoming increasingly feasible. For example, genetic engineering approaches become available once a species's target genes are well characterized in terms of their sequence, but also population variability, epistatic interactions, and more. In the last few years alone, there have been major advances in omics studies of the RPW. Multiple draft genomes are currently available, along with short and long-read transcriptomes, and metagenomes, which have facilitated the identification of genes of interest to the RPW scientific community. This review describes omics approaches previously applied to RPW research, highlights findings that could be impactful for pest management, and emphasizes future opportunities and challenges in this area of research.","[Manee, Manee M.; Alqahtani, Fahad H.; Al-Shomrani, Badr M.] King Abdulaziz City Sci & Technol, Natl Ctr Bioinformat, Riyadh 11442, Saudi Arabia; [Manee, Manee M.; Alqahtani, Fahad H.; Al-Shomrani, Badr M.] King Abdulaziz City Sci & Technol, Inst Adv Agr & Food Technol, Riyadh 11442, Saudi Arabia; [El-Shafie, Hamadttu A.

Measures to increase soil carbon storage are suggested with the aim to compensate for agricultural emissions. In Norway, where soils have relatively high carbon content because of the cold climate, adapting management practices that prevent the loss of carbon to the atmosphere in response to climate change is also important. This work presents an overview of the potential for carbon sequestration in Norway from a wide range of agricultural management practices and provides recommendations based on certainty in the reported potential, availability of the technology, and likelihood for implementation by farmers. In light of the high priority assigned to increased food production and degree of self-sufficiency in Norway, the following measures were considered: (1) utilization of organic resources, (2) use of biochar, (3) crop diversification and the use of cover crops, (4) use of plants with larger and deeper root systems, (5) improved management of meadows, (6) adaptive grazing of productive grasslands (7) managing grazing in extensive grasslands, (8) altered tillage practices, and (9) inversion of cultivated peat with mineral soil. From the options assessed, the use of cover crops scored well on all criteria evaluated, with a higher sequestration potential than previously estimated (0.2 Mt CO2-equivalents annually). Biochar has the largest potential in Norway (0.9 Mt CO2-equivalents annually, corresponding to 20% of Norwegian agricultural emissions and 2% of total national emissions), but its readiness level is not yet achieved despite interest from industry to apply this technology at large scale. Extensive grazing and the use of deep-rooted plants also have the potential for increasing carbon storage, but there is uncertainty regarding their implementation and the quantification of effects from adapting these measures. Based on the complexities of implementation and the expected impacts within a Norwegian context, promising options with substantial payoff are few. This work sheds light on the knowledge gaps remaining before the presented measures can be implemented.

The burgeoning field of tissue engineering (TE) seeks to overcome the limitations of existing medical strategies through advanced biomaterial-based scaffolds fabricated using additive manufacturing (AM).MethodsThe systemic review investigates the use of polycaprolactone through AM as a polymeric material in the fabrication of carriers for the management of complications associated with skin tissue and bone regeneration.ResultsVarious polymeric materials have demonstrated efficacy and utility in tissue engineering. However, the versatility of PCL has gained significant interest and advancements with AM in the fabrication of scaffolds specifically for skin and bone regeneration. Three-dimensional (3D) printing can produce consumer-centric products that are highly desirable for bone tissue engineering. The enormous interest in using AM by science, engineering, and medical communities has led to various developments of the 3D printing technology along with biomedical products.ConclusionThis review discusses the use of PCL with different AM strategies for TE applications. Recent advancements in PCL-based scaffolds and inks, as well as the associated challenges and difficulties, are discussed along with distinctive design strategies and fabrication techniques employed to fabricate scaffolds with optimal properties for tissue regeneration. Moreover, clinical and preclinical studies have affirmed the effectiveness of PCL-based scaffolds and the advantages of AM.Lay SummarySkin tissue and bone regeneration stand as crucial research areas in regenerative medicine, where the integration of 3D printing technology with polymeric scaffold-based approaches shows immense potential. Skin tissue engineering aims to restore dermal and epidermal layers, fostering wound healing, barrier function, and aesthetic outcomes through the use of PCL. These AM-PCL-based scaffolds have gained attention due to advancements in TE, particularly for regenerative engineering. Moreover, PCL is favored for its excellent mechanical properties, low immunogenicity, and ability to support cell growth, while a modification inclusive of altering scaffold characteristics (porosity, surface chemistry, and mechanical property), which are crucial for effective cell-material interaction, and subsequent regeneration make it excellent polymeric materials in this class. Thus, this review provides an elaborative update on AM-PCL-based scaffold for TE application with updated information to fill the gap in knowledge.","[Shah, Sunny R.] Gujarat Technol Univ, Govt Pharm Coll, Gandhinagar 382028, Gujarat, India; [Modi, Chetna D.] Anand Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut, Anand 388001, Gujarat, India; [Singh, Sudarshan] Chiang Mai Univ, Off Res Adm, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Singh, Sudarshan] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Pharm, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Prajapati, Bhupendra G.] Ganpat Univ, Shree S K Patel Coll Pharmaceut Educ & Res, Kherva 384012, India; [Prajapati, Bhupendra G.] Silpakorn Univ, Fac Pharm, Nakhon Pathom 73000, Thailand; [Mori, Dhaval D.; Soniwala, Moinuddin M.] Gujarat Technol Univ, BK Mody Govt Pharm Coll, Rajkot 360003, Gujarat, India",Gujarat Technological University; Chiang Mai University; Chiang Mai University; Ganpat University; Silpakorn University; Gujarat Technological University,"Singh, S (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Off Res Adm, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.;Singh, S (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Pharm, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.;Prajapati, BG (corresponding author), Ganpat Univ, Shree S K Patel Coll Pharmaceut Educ & Res, Kherva 384012, India.;Prajapati, BG (corresponding author), Silpakorn Univ, Fac Pharm, Nakhon Pathom 73000, Thailand.",sudarshansingh@hotmail.com; bhupen27@gamil.com,"Prajapati, Bhupena/A-3088-2015; singh, sudarshan/AAX-1661-2020","Prajapati, Bhupena/0000-0001-8242-4541; singh, sudarshan/0000-0002-7929-3322","CMU Proactive Researcher Scheme [2023]; Faculty of Pharmacy, Silpakorn University, Thailand","CMU Proactive Researcher Scheme(Chiang Mai University); Faculty of Pharmacy, Silpakorn University, Thailand","This work was partially supported by CMU Proactive Researcher Scheme (2023), Chiang Mai University for Sudarshan Singh.

Thus, there is a huge demand for disaster risk management using digitalisation as a key enabler for effective and efficient disaster risk management systems. It is widely accepted that digital and intelligence technologies can help solve key aspects of disaster risk management such as disaster prevention and mitigation, and rescue and recovery. Digital Twin (DT) is one of the most promising technologies for multi-stage management which offers significant potential to advance disaster resilience. Smart Cities (SCs) use pervasive information and communications technology to monitor activities in the city. With increasingly large applications of DTs combined with big data generated from sensors in a SC, it is now possible to create Digital Twin Smart Cities (DTSCs). Despite the increasing prevalence of DTSC technologies and their profound impact on disaster risk management, a systematic and longitudinal view of the evolution to the current status of DTSC for disaster risk management does not exist. This review analyses 312 titles and abstracts and 72 full papers. To begin with, a scientific review of DT and SC is undertaken, where the evolution of DTSCs is reviewed. In addition, the intelligence technologies used in DTSCs for disaster risk management are assessed and their benefits are evaluated. Furthermore, the evolution and technical feasibility of DTSC-driven disaster risk management is evaluated by assessing current applications of DTSCs in disaster risk management. It was found that despite the significant potential benefits offered by DTSCs, they also add a new layer of complexities and challenges inherent to these technologies to the already complex web of complexities involved in disaster risk management. These challenges can be addressed by understanding how the process of utilising DTSCs in disaster risk reduction and sustainability is designed, which is essential for comprehending what DTSCs may offer, how it is implemented, and what it means to all involved stakeholders.

Data Sources: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cumulative index to Nursing and Allied Health Literuature (CINAHL) databases to identify studies using PRISMA guidelines. Study Selection: Qualitative, quantitative, quasi-experimental, randomized controlled studies or mixed methods studies in the English language with adults >= 18 years involving ULL/D from any cause were included. Studies were required to provide outcome measures, decision aids, discrete choice or other preference measurement methods, patient satisfaction, quality of life, cost, and choice characteristics of prostheses. Data Extraction: Characteristics were extracted from each study including study aim, author, publication year, country, sampling strategy, sample size, data collection methods, analysis, outcome or survey type, approach or discussion of prosthetic preference or choice, model or description of the prosthetic, results, and attributes or factors of decision-making. Two individuals assessed study quality using the 2018 validated Critical Appraisal Skills Program quali-tative studies checklist. Data Synthesis: Of the 1388 studies, 67 were included. Our findings reveal a variety of study types and purposes that together describe factors important to a complex decision-making pro-cess. We conceptualized 5 main themes to create our literature landscape: (1) adequacy of out-comes/measures used, (2) extent of preference research, (3) prosthesis type comparisons, (4) factors critical to decision-making, and (5) the prescription process. A personalized approach to decision-making was stressed but there were only 5 prosthetic preference studies. We identified a list of the major factors or attributes important when choosing a prosthetic to be used in pref-erence research; functionality, appearance, grip characteristics, durability, weight, and cost. We suggest a user complexity construct to integrate the studies on technology and users' choices. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first literature review to focus on prefer-ence measurements. Despite this lack of preference studies, there was consensus on the impor-tance of including the patient's voice into the prosthetic choice through the prescription process. Our findings synthesize a body of literature that is not well organized or generalizable enough to help individuals and prosthetists make prosthesis decisions. Our insights can guide shared decision-making and improve prosthetic prescription. (c) 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

We systematically review the literature on attitudes towards the use of AI in healthcare from patients, the general public and health professionals' perspectives to understand these issues from multiple perspectives. Methodology: A search for original research articles using qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods published between 1 Jan 2001 to 24 Aug 2021 was conducted on six bibliographic databases. Data were extracted and classified into different themes representing views on: (i) knowledge and familiarity of AI, (ii) AI benefits, risks, and challenges, (iii) AI acceptability, (iv) AI development, (v) AI implementation, (vi) AI regulations, and (vii) Human - AI relationship. Results: The final search identified 7,490 different records of which 105 publications were selected based on predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. While the majority of patients, the general public and health professionals generally had a positive attitude towards the use of AI in healthcare, all groups indicated some perceived risks and challenges. Commonly perceived risks included data privacy; reduced professional autonomy; algorithmic bias; healthcare inequities; and greater burnout to acquire AI-related skills. While patients had mixed opinions on whether healthcare workers suffer from job loss due to the use of AI, health professionals strongly indicated that AI would not be able to completely replace them in their professions. Both groups shared similar doubts about AI's ability to deliver empathic care. The need for AI validation, transparency, explainability, and patient and clinical involvement in the development of AI was emphasised. To help successfully implement AI in health care, most participants envisioned that an investment in training and education campaigns was necessary, especially for health professionals. Lack of familiarity, lack of trust, and regulatory uncertainties were identified as factors hindering AI implementation. Regarding AI regulations, key themes included data access and data privacy. While the general public and patients exhibited a willingness to share anonymised data for AI development, there remained concerns about sharing data with insurance or technology companies. One key domain under this theme was the question of who should be held accountable in the case of adverse events arising from using AI. Conclusions: While overall positivity persists in attitudes and preferences toward AI use in healthcare, some prevalent problems require more attention. There is a need to go beyond addressing algorithm-related issues to look at the translation of legislation and guidelines into practice to ensure fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics in AI.","[Vo, Vinh; Chen, Gang; Woode, Maame Esi] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Australia; [Aquino, Yves St James; Carter, Stacy M.] Univ Wollongong, Australian Ctr Hlth Engagement Evidence & Values, Sch Hlth & Soce, Wollongong, Australia; [Do, Quynh Nga] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Australia; [Woode, Maame Esi] Monash Data Futures Res Inst, Clayton, Australia; [Vo, Vinh] Ctr Hlth Econ, Caulfield, Australia",Monash University; University of Wollongong; Monash University,"Vo, V (corresponding author), Ctr Hlth Econ, Caulfield, Australia.",vinh.vo@monash.edu,"Aquino, Yves Saint James/AAJ-1757-2020; Carter, Stacy/A-6544-2011; Woode, Maame Esi/ABB-1374-2021; Chen, Gang/G-4214-2011","Aquino, Yves Saint James/0000-0003-0981-0029; Carter, Stacy/0000-0003-2617-8694; Woode, Maame Esi/0000-0001-9138-8853; Vo, Vinh/0000-0002-0154-1779; Chen, Gang/0000-0002-8385-5965",National Health and Medical Research Council,National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health & Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),"Funding for the study was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council grant The algorithm will see you now: ethical, legal and social implications of adopting machine learning systems for diagnosis and screening.

The outcome of visual acuity and refraction, safety, efficiency, predictability, stability, postoperative corneal thickness and endothelial cell count were measure. ]center dot RESULTS: A total of 1,647 eyes (836 LASIK, 811 LASIK Xtra) from 15 studies were included. LASIK demonstrated superior postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) compared to LASIK Xtra, with a mean difference (MD) of-0.03 (8 studies, n = 750 eyes; 95% CI:-0.04 to-0.01, P = .007) at 1 month and (7 studies, n = 672 eyes; MD =-0.01 95% CI:-0.02 to 0.00, P = .02) for long-term results ( >= 6 months). No significant differences were found in corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA; 6 studies, n = 530 eyes; MD = 0.00, 95% CI:-0.01, 0.00, P = .32), spherical equivalent (14 studies, n = 1639 eyes; MD = 0.03, 95% CI:-0.03, 0.08; P = .40), safety (8 studies, n = 779 eyes; odds ratios [OR] = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.39, 1.26; P = .23), efficiency (11 studies, n = 921 eyes; OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.54, 1.05, P = .10), predictability (11 studies, n = 971 eyes; OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.72, 1.47, P = .86), stability (3 studies, n = 90 eyes; OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.21, 2.28, P = .55). Subgroup analysis indicated a higher risk of postoperative CDVA loss in the Ectasia Risk Group undergoing LASIK-Xtra (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.97, P = .05). The 30 mW/cm2 for 90 seconds (2.7 J/cm2) irradiation protocol in LASIK Xtra may resulted in worse UDVA compared to LASIK (MD =-0.01, 95% CI:- 0.03 to-0.001, P = .05). The certainty of evidence for the outcomes ranged from low to very low. center dot CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that LASIK offers a statistically significant advantage in UDVA compared to LASIK Xtra, especially when LASIK Xtra irradiation protocol of 30 mW/cm2 for 90 seconds (2.7 J/cm2) is applied. However, given the low to very low certainty of evidence, these findings require cautious interpretation and further confirmation through long-term studies. (Am J Ophthalmol 2025;277: 395-412.

Every year, millions of tons of food are wasted, contributing to environmental degradation and resource inefficiency. This wasted food not only represents a loss of valuable resources but also contributes to significant greenhouse gas emissions when disposed of in landfills. In response to this pressing issue, food waste valorization biorefineries have emerged as a promising solution, transforming waste into valuable bioproducts through innovative biotechnological processes. This review critically examines recent trends in food waste biorefining, focusing on the latest advancements in microbial and enzymatic conversion technologies. Various valorization pathways that convert food waste into biofuels, biochemicals, and bio-based materials are explored, thereby integrating principles of the circular economy to minimize waste and maximize resource utilization. Key developments in the field include the optimization of microbial consortia for enhanced degradation and conversion efficiency, as well as the engineering of enzymes to improve specificity and activity. These advancements have led to significant improvements in the efficiency and feasibility of converting food waste into high-value products. The environmental benefits of these biorefineries are also discussed in depth, encompassing the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, decreased reliance on fossil fuels, and the mitigation of environmental pollution. By diverting food waste from landfills and transforming it into renewable resources, these biorefineries play a crucial role in promoting environmental sustainability. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. Feedstock variability affects process consistency, leading to fluctuations in product yield and quality. There is a need for process optimization to improve yield and cost-effectiveness, ensuring that biorefinery operations are economically viable at an industrial scale. Issues related to scalability and industrial implementation, such as the development of infrastructure and supply chains, also pose significant hurdles. By synthesizing current research, this review underscores the considerable potential of food waste biorefineries to contribute to sustainable agriculture and biocatalysis. Critical gaps in knowledge are identified, and areas for future research are proposed, such as developing robust and flexible biorefining systems capable of handling diverse feedstocks and integrating advanced biotechnological tools for process monitoring and control. The review also highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and public-private partnerships in driving innovation and commercialization in this field. Ultimately, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of food waste biorefining and to offer a roadmap for future research and industrial implementation. By highlighting the role of these biorefineries in achieving sustainable development goals, the review emphasizes the need for continued research, technological innovation, and supportive policy frameworks. Through these efforts, food waste valorization biorefineries can play a pivotal role in creating a sustainable and resilient future, addressing both environmental and economic challenges posed by food waste.","[Danya, U.] Nirmala Coll Women, Dept Bot, Coimbatore 641018, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kamaraj, M.] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Fac Sci & Humanities, Dept Biotechnol, Chennai 600089, Tamil Nadu, India; [Babu, P.

This highlights the need for CAR T treatments that are easier to tune, combine, and program with logic rules, in oncology and autoimmunity. Modular CAR T cells use a two-part system: the CAR on the T cell binds an adaptor molecule (AM), and that adaptor binds the tumour-associated antigen (TAA). This design separates recognition of the target antigen and activation of the T cells, resulting in a cellular therapy concept with better control, flexibility, and safety compared to established direct-targeting CAR T-cell systems. The key advantage of the system is the adaptor molecule, often an antibody-based reagent, that targets the TAA. Adaptors can be swapped or combined without re-engineering the T cells, enabling straightforward multiplexing and logic-gated control. The CAR itself is designed to recognise the AM via a unique tag on the adaptor. Only when the CAR, AM, and antigen-positive target cell assemble correctly is T-cell effector function activated, leading to cancer cell lysis. This two-component system has several features that need to be considered when designing a modular CAR: First, the architecture of the CAR, i.e., how the binding domain and the backbone are designed, can influence tonic signalling and activation/exhaustion parameters. Second, the affinity of CAR-AM and AM-TAA will mostly define the engagement kinetics of the system. Third, the valency of the AM has an impact on exhaustion and non-specific activation of CAR T cells. And lastly, the architecture of the AM, especially the size, defines the pharmacokinetics and, consequently, the dosing scheme of the AM. The research conducted on direct-targeting CAR T cells have generated in-depth knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of the technology in its current form, with remarkable clinical success in relapsed/refractory disease and long-term survival in otherwise difficult-to-treat patient populations. On the other hand, CAR T-cell therapy poses the risk of severe adverse events and antigen loss coupled with antigen-negative relapse which remains the main reason for failed therapies. Addressing these issues in the traditional setting of one CAR targeting one antigen will always be difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of most oncologic diseases, but the flexibility to change target antigens and the modulation of CAR T response by dosing the AM in a modular CAR system might be pivotal to mitigate these hurdles of direct CAR T cells. Since the first conception of modular CARs in 2012, there have been more than 30 constructs published, and some of those have been translated into phase I/II clinical trials with early signs of success, but whether these will progress into a late-stage clinical trial and gain regulatory approval remains to be seen.","[Joechner, Alexander Haide; Mach, Melanie; Li, Ziduo] Biosceptre Aust Pty Ltd, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia; [Mach, Melanie] Univ Sydney, Fac Med & Hlth, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Li, Ziduo] UNSW, Fac Med & Hlth, St George & Sutherland Clin Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Li, ZD (corresponding author), Biosceptre Aust Pty Ltd, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia.;Li, ZD (corresponding author), UNSW, Fac Med & Hlth, St George & Sutherland Clin Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",alex.joechner@biosceptre.com; melanie.mach@biosceptre.com; cindy.li@biosceptre.com,,"Li, Ziduo/0009-0002-3358-3524; , Melanie/0000-0001-8584-8104; Joechner, Alexander Haide/0009-0008-7039-5382",,,,114,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1661-6596,1422-0067,INT J MOL SCI,Int.

Even if H. somni is usually found as a commensal bacterium in the respiratory and reproductive tracts of cattle, some external conditions, such as stress related immunosuppression and previous action of other pathogens, can induce H. somni to become pathogenic. Even if there still is a lack in the knowledge about the precise mechanisms of its pathogenicity, several virulence factors have been identified that can explain its pathogenicity. The high variability in the genetic aspect of the antigens exposed on the bacterial surface, their ability to undergone to phase variation and to bind the antibodies, as well as its ability to form a biofilm, to acquire iron as a nutrient and to bind some of the host's immunoglobulins (IgGs) through the expression of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are some of the main virulence factors that can both trigger its pathogenicity and reduce the effectiveness of the immune defences and of some treatment options. Indeed, the treatment of symptomatic diseases caused by H. somni is difficult, due to both the high variability in the antigens expressed as well as due to the difficulty in intervening promptly at the onset of the first symptoms and in identifying affected animals early in the course of disease. In any case, the efficacy of the treatment with antimicrobial is scant and vague, even if it has a good susceptibility toward many antimicrobials in vitro. The use of prevention strategies such as specific vaccinations against H. somni, and against the main pathogens related to BRD, such as M. haemolytica or Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus, common cofactors for H. somni, may be beneficial as an approach to control H. somni outbreaks. Indeed, even if the mechanisms of protective immunity against H. somni are still not so well understood, antibodies are likely to be an important part of the protection system, and vaccination is thus used as the primary way to counteract H. somni. However, the high genetic variability of the antigens, as well as their ability to undergo to phase variation, and the intrinsic differences between specific respiratory or urogenital strains, can reduce the efficacy of the vaccines. Some improvements in the efficacy of vaccines can be done by using innovative technologies such as reverse vaccinology, to be able to find a higher number of target genes that encode for more surface proteins, that are more likely to be potential antigenic vaccine candidates.

These symptoms severely impair patients' quality of life, reduce treatment adherence, and may lead to premature therapy discontinuation. Aromatherapy, a complementary therapy using plant-derived essential oils, has shown potential benefits for alleviating CIGT symptoms; however, most existing systematic reviews focus solely on nausea and vomiting, leaving its effects on other CIGT symptoms under-studied. Moreover, the influence of essential oil types, intervention forms, and intervention durations on therapeutic outcomes remains unclear. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety of aromatherapy for the full spectrum of CIGT symptoms in patients with cancer and to clarify how essential oil types, intervention forms, and intervention durations influence treatment outcomes. Methods: Nine databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, Chinese Science and Technology Journal Database, and SinoMed); the World Health Organization (WHO) Trials Portal; and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry will be searched from inception to August 2025 to identify randomized controlled trials focusing on aromatherapy for CIGT management in patients with cancer. Data on participant characteristics, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and adverse effects will be extracted from included studies. Continuous outcomes will be synthesized using standardized mean differences with 95% CIs, and categorical outcomes will be summarized as odds ratios with 95% CIs. All analyses will adopt a random-effects model to account for expected clinical and methodological heterogeneity. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses will be conducted to examine differences across essential oil types, intervention forms, and intervention durations. The Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method will be used for random-effects estimation, and prediction intervals will be calculated where applicable to reflect real-world variation. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, and evidence certainty will be graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: This study was funded in February 2024. As of August 2025, the literature search and study selection have been completed, and 20 eligible randomized controlled trials have been identified. Data extraction and quantitative synthesis are expected to be completed in December 2025, and the final results are anticipated to be submitted for publication in March 2026. Conclusions: The anticipated findings will address key evidence gaps by evaluating aromatherapy's therapeutic potential for CIGT beyond nausea and vomiting and clarifying parameter-specific effects on CIGT management. These findings will support the development of evidence-based, standardized aromatherapy interventions, guide future mechanism-based research, and inform clinical decision-making in supportive cancer care.

Researchers are increasingly using multi-metal panels and innovative statistical methods to understand how exposure to real-world metal mixtures affects human health. Metals have both common and unique sources and routes of exposure, as well as biotransformation and elimination pathways. The development of multi-element analytical technology allows researchers to examine a broad spectrum of metals in their studies; however, their interpretation is complex as they can reflect different windows of exposure and several biomarkers have critical limitations. This review elaborates on more than 500 scientific publications to discuss major sources of exposure, biotransformation and elimination, and biomarkers of exposure and internal dose for 12 metals/metalloids, including 8 non-essential elements (arsenic, barium, cadmium, lead, mercury, nickel, tin, uranium) and 4 essential elements (manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc) commonly used in multi-element analyses.Recent FindingsWe conclude that not all metal biomarkers are adequate measures of exposure and that understanding the metabolic biotransformation and elimination of metals is key to metal biomarker interpretation. For example, whole blood is a good biomarker of exposure to arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, and tin, but it is not a good indicator for barium, nickel, and uranium. For some essential metals, the interpretation of whole blood biomarkers is unclear. Urine is the most commonly used biomarker of exposure across metals but it should not be used to assess lead exposure. Essential metals such as zinc and manganese are tightly regulated by homeostatic processes; thus, elevated levels in urine may reflect body loss and metabolic processes rather than excess exposure. Total urinary arsenic may reflect exposure to both organic and inorganic arsenic, thus, arsenic speciation and adjustment for arsebonetaine are needed in populations with dietary seafood consumption. Hair and nails primarily reflect exposure to organic mercury, except in populations exposed to high levels of inorganic mercury such as in occupational and environmental settings. When selecting biomarkers, it is also critical to consider the exposure window of interest. Most populations are chronically exposed to metals in the low-to-moderate range, yet many biomarkers reflect recent exposures. Toenails are emerging biomarkers in this regard. They are reliable biomarkers of long-term exposure for arsenic, mercury, manganese, and selenium. However, more research is needed to understand the role of nails as a biomarker of exposure to other metals. Similarly, teeth are increasingly used to assess lifelong exposures to several essential and non-essential metals such as lead, including during the prenatal window.As metals epidemiology moves towards embracing a multi-metal/mixtures approach and expanding metal panels to include less commonly studied metals, it is important for researchers to have a strong knowledge base about the metal biomarkers included in their research. This review aims to aid metals researchers in their analysis planning, facilitate sound analytical decision-making, as well as appropriate understanding and interpretation of results.","[Martinez-Morata, Irene; Sobel, Marisa; Navas-Acien, Ana; Sanchez, Tiffany R.] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, 722 West 168th St,1107, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Tellez-Plaza, Maria] Inst Salud Carlos III, Ctr Nacl Epidemiol, Madrid, Spain; [Howe, Caitlin G.] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Dept Epidemiol, Lebanon, NH USA",Columbia University; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia (CNE); Dartmouth College,"Martinez-Morata, I (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, 722 West 168th St,1107, New York, NY 10032 USA.",im2557@cumc.columbia.edu,"; Tellez-Plaza, Maria/AAL-9820-2021; n, a/HRA-1392-2023; Howe, Caitlin/ABF-3709-2020","Martinez-Morata, Irene/0000-0003-3165-4931; Tellez-Plaza, Maria/0000-0002-3850-1228;","National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [P42 ES033719]; NIEHS [P30ES009089]; La Caixa Foundation [LCF/BQ/AA20/11820032, R00ES030400]; [ID100010434]; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [P30ES009089, R00ES030400, P42ES033719] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)); NIEHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)); La Caixa Foundation(La Caixa Foundation); ; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)),"Research reported in this publication was supported by National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) grant P42 ES033719 (IMM, MS, ANA, TRS), NIEHS grant P30ES009089 (ANA, TRS), NIEHS grant R00ES030400 (CGH) and by a fellowship from La Caixa Foundation (ID100010434), fellowship code LCF/BQ/AA20/11820032 (IMM).

Mobile technologies present a promising approach to delivering behavioral interventions; however, little is known about the effectiveness and user perspectives on these technologies in the MENA region. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile interventions targeting physical activity and sedentary behaviors in the MENA region and explore users' perspectives on these interventions as well as any other outcomes that might influence users' adoption and use of mobile technologies (eg, appropriateness and cultural fit). Methods: A systematic search of 5 databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Global Index Medicus) was performed. Any primary studies (participants of all ages regardless of medical condition) conducted in the MENA region that investigated the use of mobile technologies and reported any measures of physical activity, sedentary behaviors, or user perceptions were included. We conducted a narrative synthesis of all studies and a meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The Cochrane risk -of -bias tool was used to assess the quality of the included RCTs; quality assessment of the rest of the included studies was completed using the relevant Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Results: In total, 27 articles describing 22 interventions (n=10, 37% RCTs) and 4 (15%) nonexperimental studies were included (n=6141, 46% women). Half (11/22, 50%) of the interventions included mobile apps, whereas the other half examined SMS. The main app functions were goal setting and self -monitoring of activity, whereas SMS interventions were primarily used to deliver educational content. Users in experimental studies described several benefits of the interventions (eg, gaining knowledge and receiving reminders to be active). Engagement with the interventions was poorly reported; few studies (8/27, 30%) examined users' perspectives on the appropriateness or cultural fit of the interventions. Nonexperimental studies examined users' perspectives on mobile apps and fitness trackers, reporting several barriers to their use, such as perceived lack of usefulness, loss of interest, and technical issues. The meta -analysis of RCTs showed a positive effect of mobile interventions on physical activity outcomes (standardized mean difference=0.45, 95% CI 0.17-0.73); several sensitivity analyses showed similar results. The trim -and -fill method showed possible publication bias. Only 20% (2/10) of the RCTs measured sedentary behaviors; both reported positive changes. Conclusions: The use of mobile interventions for physical activity and sedentary behaviors in the MENA region is in its early stages, with preliminary evidence of effectiveness. Policy makers and researchers should invest in high -quality studies to evaluate long-term effectiveness, intervention engagement, and implementation outcomes, which can inform the design of culturally and socially appropriate interventions for countries in the MENA region.

In recent years, rehabilitation strategies based on new technologies, such as MYO Armband (R), have been implemented to improve dexterity in people with upper limb impairment. Over the last few years, many studies have been published focusing on the accuracy of the MYO Armband (R) to capture electromyographic and inertial data, as well as the clinical effects of using it as a rehabilitation tool in people with loss of upper limb function. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there has been no systematic review of this subject. Methods: A systematically comprehensive literature search was conducted in order to identify original studies that answered the PICO question (patient/population, intervention, comparison, and outcome): What is the accuracy level and the clinical effects of the MYO Armband (R) in people with motor impairment of the upper limb compared with other assessment techniques or interventions or no intervention whatsoever? The following data sources were used: Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, and the Cochrane Library. After identifying the eligible articles, a cross-search of their references was also completed for additional studies. The following data were extracted from the papers: study design, disease or condition, intervention, sample, dosage, outcome measures or data collection procedure and data analysis and results. The authors independently collected these data following the CONSORT 2010 statement when possible, and eventually reached a consensus on the extracted data, resolving disagreements through discussion. To assess the methodological quality of papers included, the tool for the critical appraisal of epidemiological cross-sectional studies was used, since only case series studies were identified after the search. Additionally, the articles were classified according to the levels of evidence and grades of recommendation for diagnosis studies established by the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. Also, The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions was used by two independent reviewers to assess risk of bias, assessing the six different domains. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was followed to carry out this review. Results: 10 articles with a total 180 participants were included in the review. The characteristics of included studies, sample and intervention characteristics, outcome measures, the accuracy of the system and effects of the interventions and the assessment of methodological quality of the studies and risk of bias are shown. Conclusions: Therapy with the MYO Armband (R) has shown clinical changes in range of motion, dexterity, performance, functionality and satisfaction. It has also proven to be an accurate system to capture signals from the forearm muscles in people with motor impairment of the upper limb. However, further research should be conducted using bigger samples, well-defined protocols, comparing with control groups or comparing with other assessment or therapeutic tools, since the studies published so far present a high risk of bias and low level of evidence and grade of recommendation.","[Marcos-Anton, Selena] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Int Doctorate Sch, Madrid 28008, Spain; [Dolores Gor-Garcia-Fogeda, Maria; Cano-de-la-Cuerda, Roberto] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Phys Therapy Occupat Therapy Rehabil & Phys, Alcorcon 28922, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Cano-de-la-Cuerda, R (corresponding author), Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Phys Therapy Occupat Therapy Rehabil & Phys, Alcorcon 28922, Spain.",s.marcosa@alumnos.urjc.es; mariadolores.gor@urjc.es; roberto.cano@urjc.es,"; Gor, Maria Dolores/MYR-9138-2025; Cano de la Cuerda, Roberto/KDO-9312-2024; Marcos Antón, Selena/JZQ-2707-2024","Gor, María Dolores/0000-0001-6791-813X; Cano de la Cuerda, Roberto/0000-0002-1118-4234; Marcos Antón, Selena/0000-0003-1296-3296",,,,42,8,8,2,21,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0383,J CLIN MED,J.

Although postcombustion CO2 capture by absorption in aqueous amines is a mature technology, the required high regeneration energy, losses due to degradation and evaporation, and corrosion carry a high economic cost, precluding this technology to be used today at the scale required to mitigate climate change. Solid adsorbent-based systems with high CO2 capacities, high selectivity, and lower regeneration energy are becoming an attractive alternative for this purpose. Conscious of this opportunity, the search for optimal adsorbents for the capture of CO2 has become an urgent task. To accurately assess the performance of CO2 separation by adsorption at the needed scale, adsorbents should be synthesized and fully characterized under the required operating conditions, and the proper design and simulation of the process should be implemented along with techno-economic and environmental assessments. Several works have examined pure CO2 single-component adsorption or binary mixtures of CO2 with nitrogen for different families of adsorbents, primarily addressing their CO2 adsorption capacity and selectivity; however, very limited data is available under other conditions and/or with impurities, mainly due to the intensive experimental (modeling) efforts required for the large number of adsorbents to be studied, posing a challenge for their assessment under the needed conditions. In this regard, molecular simulations can be employed in synergy with experiments, reliably generating missing adsorption properties of mixtures while providing understanding at the molecular level of the mechanism of the adsorption process. This Account provides an outlook on strategies used for the rational design of materials for CO2 capture from different sources from the understanding of the adsorption mechanism at the molecular level. We illustrate with practical examples from our work and others' work how molecular simulations can be reliably used to link the molecular knowledge of novel adsorbents for which limited data exist for CO2 capture adsorption processes. Molecular simulation results of different adsorbents, including MOFs, zeolites, and carbon-based and silica-based materials, are discussed, focusing on understanding the role of physical and chemical adsorption obtained from simulations and quantifying the impact of impurities in the performance of the materials. Furthermore, simulation results can be used for screening adsorbents from basic key performance indicators, such as cycling the working capacity, selectivity, and energy requirement, or for feeding detailed dynamic models to assess their performance in swing adsorption processes on the industrial scale, additionally including monetized performance indicators such as operating expenses, equipment sizes, and compression cost. Moreover, we highlight the role of molecular simulations in guiding strategies for improving the performance of these materials by functionalization with amines or creating hybrid solid materials. We show how integrating models at different scales provides a robust and reliable assessment of the performance of the adsorbent materials under the required industrial conditions, rationally guiding the search for best performers. Trends in additional computational resources that can be used, including machine learning, and perspectives on practical requirements for leveraging CO2 capture adsorption technologies on the needed scale are also discussed.","[Vega, Lourdes F.; Bahamon, Daniel] Khalifa Univ, Res & Innovat Ctr CO2 & Hydrogen RICH, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Vega, Lourdes F.; Bahamon, Daniel] Khalifa Univ, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",Khalifa University of Science & Technology; Khalifa University of Science & Technology,"Vega, LF (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ, Res & Innovat Ctr CO2 & Hydrogen RICH, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.;Vega, LF (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",lourdes.vega@ku.ac.ae,"Bahamon, Daniel/C-1924-2017; Vega, Lourdes/L-4152-2017","Bahamon, Daniel/0000-0001-5473-1202; Vega, Lourdes/0000-0002-7609-4184","Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research [RC2-2019-007]; Khalifa University","Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research; Khalifa University(Khalifa University of Science & Technology)","Funding from Khalifa University through project RC2-2019-007 (RICH Center) and computational resources from the Almesbar HPC, Khalifa University, are gratefully acknowledged.

Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review (SLR) and a case study have been undertaken to explore the innovative ideas for a sustainable fashion supply chain developed after the COVID-19 outbreak. Having conducted a comprehensive literature search in electronic databases Google Scholar, Emerald Insight, ScienceDirect and ProQuest, 69 articles were selected and reviewed. A case of the Kering Group was used to explain the results. Findings This paper highlighted the basic concepts of a sustainable supply chain, reviewed the 10 principles of the United Nation Global Compact and their connections to promoting supply chain sustainability, as well as the three components of a sustainable supply chain: green supply chain, transparent supply chain and circular supply chain. Based on the results of a SLR and a real case of Kering Group, the paper identified 12 innovative ideas for a sustainable fashion supply chain: (1) biodegradable and natural materials, (2) textile recycling, (3) nearshoring, (4) artificial intelligence (AI), (5) robot, (6) 3D printing, (7) Internet of Things, (8) blockchain, (9) reverse resources; (10) bio-packaging, (11) augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) and (12) digital runway. Research limitations/implications The epidemiological situations of the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding innovative ideas for a sustainable supply chain may change over time. While this paper provides a comprehensive literature review and case study, further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of current efforts in the development of a sustainable fashion supply chain through collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. Practical implications Embracing the issues from the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of this study are further explained by the case of Kering Group in the fashion industry. The managerial implications of the results and discussion are the need to adopt innovative ideas for a more sustainable fashion supply chain in the future. The success of sustainable supply chains work by leveraging the best available technologies such as robot, 3D printing, AR and VR, setting consistent standards for sustainability such as Environmental Profit and Loss and Kering & Textile Exchange and communicating with all parties throughout the supply chain, such as blockchain and AI. Investment in developing technology and innovative ideas will be the key of future to supply chain sustainability. Nonetheless, the specific approach used by each organization must be tailored to its characteristics, goals and circumstances. Social implications Bringing upon unprecedented challenges, the pandemic has shown both companies and consumers just how fragile our planet is. Thus, to protect our planet in the long run, we need to not only make businesses more sustainable but also live more eco-friendly lifestyles. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that conducts a systemic review of the relevant academic journal articles addressed to the managerial audience on sustainable (fashion) supply chain. In addition, this paper also adds some consideration to this gap by exploring the innovative ideas for a sustainable fashion supply chain in the future and using a case to illustrate how these ideas can be put in a real-life context. This paper discusses the impact of COVID-19 on different stages of the supply chain and gives innovative ideas that can be used in response to the changing epidemiological situations of the pandemic.","[Tam, Fung Yi; Lung, Jane W.

Despite intensive research and advances in molecular biology, genomics, and modern neuroimaging techniques, the prognosis for patients with GBM remains extremely poor. Despite the implementation of multimodal treatment involving surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide, the average survival time of patients is only about 15 months. This is primarily due to the complex biology of this cancer, which involves numerous genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, as well as a highly heterogeneous tumor structure and the presence of glioblastoma stem cells with self renewal capacity. Mutations and abnormalities in genes such as IDH-wt, EGFR, PTEN, TP53, TERT, and CDKN2A/B are crucial in the pathogenesis of GBM. In particular, IDH-wt status (wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase) is one of the most important identification markers distinguishing GBM from other, more favorable gliomas with IDH mutations. Frequent EGFR amplifications and TERT gene promoter mutations lead to the deregulation of tumor cell proliferation and increased aggressiveness. In turn, the loss of function of suppressor genes such as PTEN or CDKN2A/B promotes uncontrolled cell growth and tumor progression. The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment also plays an important role, promoting immune escape and weakening the effectiveness of systemic therapies, including immunotherapy. The aim of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the epidemiology, classification, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, as well as to discuss the impact of recent advances in molecular and imaging diagnostics on clinical decision-making. A comprehensive review of recent literature (2018-2025) was conducted, focusing on WHO CNS5 classification updates, novel biomarkers (IDH, TERT, MGMT, EGFR), and modern diagnostic techniques such as liquid biopsy, radiogenomics, and next-generation sequencing (NGS). The results of the review indicate that the introduction of integrated histo-molecular diagnostics in the WHO 2021 classification has significantly increased diagnostic precision, enabling better prognostic and therapeutic stratification of patients. Modern imaging techniques, such as advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and radiomics and radiogenomics tools, allow for more precise assessment of tumor characteristics, prediction of response to therapy, and monitoring of disease progression. Contemporary molecular techniques, including DNA methylation profiling and NGS, enable in-depth genomic and epigenetic analysis, which translates into a more personalized approach to treatment. Despite the use of multimodal therapy, which is based on maximum safe tumor resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy, recurrence is almost inevitable. GBM shows a high degree of resistance to treatment, which results from the presence of stem cell subpopulations, dynamic clonal evolution, and the ability to adapt to unfavorable microenvironmental conditions. Promising preclinical and early clinical results show new therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy (cancer vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T therapies), oncolytic virotherapy, and Tumor Treating Fields (TTF) technology. Although these methods show potential for prolonging survival, their clinical efficacy still needs to be confirmed in large studies. The role of artificial intelligence in the analysis of imaging and molecular data is also increasingly being emphasized, which may contribute to the development of more accurate predictive models and therapeutic decisions. Despite these advancements, GBM remains a major therapeutic challenge due to its high heterogeneity and treatment resistance. The integration of molecular diagnostics, artificial intelligence, and personalized therapeutic strategies that may enhance survival and quality of life for GBM patients.","[Krolikowska, Kinga; Blaszczak, Katarzyna; Lawicki, Slawomir] Med Univ Bialystok, Fac Med, Dept Populat Med & Lifestyle Dis Prevent, PL-15269 Bialystok, Poland; [Zajkowska, Monika] Med Univ Bialystok, Dept Neurodegenerat Diagnost, Waszyngtona 15A St, PL-15269 Bialystok, Poland; [Gudowska-Sawczuk, Monika] Med Univ Bialystok, Dept Biochem Diagnost, Waszyngtona 15A St, PL-15269 Bialystok, Poland",Medical University of Bialystok; Medical University of Bialystok; Medical University of Bialystok,"Gudowska-Sawczuk, M (corresponding author), Med Univ Bialystok, Dept Biochem Diagnost, Waszyngtona 15A St, PL-15269 Bialystok, Poland.",k.krolikowska@gmail.com; katarzyna.blaszczak@sd.edu.pl; slawicki@umb.edu.pl; monika.zajkowska@umb.edu.pl; monika.gudowska-sawczuk@umb.edu.pl,"Zajkowska, Monika/Q-7837-2019; Gudowska-Sawczuk, Monika/AAL-9795-2021; Ławicki, Sławomir/S-8266-2018","Zajkowska, Monika/0000-0002-5179-0722; Gudowska-Sawczuk, Monika/0000-0003-4854-7155; Ławicki, Sławomir/0000-0001-6747-2123",Medical University of Bialystok [B.SUB.25.318],Medical University of Bialystok,The APC have been covered by Medical University of Bialystok (B.SUB.25.318).,88,0,0,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1661-6596,1422-0067,INT J MOL SCI,Int.

Autochthonous breeds of domestic animals are considered all breeds that have originated in a certain geographical area and are adapted to the living conditions of that area. The mentioned research is of great significance because animal genetic resources are exceptionally important for all countries and populations around the world due to the fact that they manifest productivity through important agricultural products, demonstrate adaptability, especially to climate change, and can be key contributors to food security for future generations. Therefore, it was extremely important to gather in one review the available knowledge about biodiversity and the possibilities of preserving the most important autochthonous species and breeds not only in Serbia but also in the Western Balkans, all with the aim of considering further directions for their sustainable use and continued existence.Abstract Preserving local autochthonous domestic animal populations and the products derived from them is a crucial aspect of managing human utilization of the biosphere. This management approach aims to ensure sustainable benefits for both present and future generations. The diversity of autochthonous domestic animal populations plays a vital role in the functionality and sustainability of the food production system. It encompasses both productive and non-productive aspects, contributing significantly to the overall health, nutrition, and food security of the landscape by providing a wide range of animal-derived food resources. Based on the data contained in the Draft Program of Rural Development, a significant presence of more than 44 autochthonous and local breeds of domestic animals has been noted in Serbia. In order to enable the sustainable preservation of local domestic animals, the competent Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Serbia has, through a number of projects, implemented models for the preservation of local breeds on farms (in situ), as well as provided technical assistance to small farms that keep animal collections. It also helps the local population to procure animals, conducts product quality research, and provides opportunities to integrate conservation programs through tourism. Given that molecular characterization is a key factor for the preservation of autochthonous breeds, in the Republic of Serbia, DNA markers are used for identification and to investigate the belonging to a specific breeds or strain. All the mentioned activities led to an immediate increase in the number of animals, which is especially true for the autochthonous breeds of cattle (Busha), sheep (Sjenicka, Svrljiska, and Vlach-vitohorn) and pigs (Mangalitsa, Moravka, and Resavka) that are discussed in this paper. In addition to the significant measures undertaken to preserve animal genetic resources (AnGR), it is necessary to continue to work primarily on ex situ conservation in order to prevent the loss of their gene pools. However, regardless of the evident effort that has been made to preserve autochthonous genetic resources in Serbia, we believe that there is still a lot of room for further improvement. This primarily refers to advanced technologies that have not been applied so far, mostly related to the identification of genomic regions associated with economic traits, resistance to diseases, and adaptability to emerging climate changes. In this way, the production capacity and functional characteristics of autochthonous species and breeds of domestic animals in Serbia will be improved.","[Djedovic, Radica; Radojkovic, Dragan; Stanojevic, Dragan; Savic, Radomir; Popovac, Mladen; Bogdanovic, Vladan; Gligovic, Nikolija; Mitrovic, Ivan] Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Dept Anim Sci, Nemanjina 6, Belgrade 11080, Serbia; [Vukasinovic, Natasha] Zoetis Vet Med Res & Dev VMRD, Kalamazoo, MI 49001 USA; [Radovic, Cedomir; Gogic, Marija] Inst Anim Husb, Belgrade 11080, Serbia; [Stojic, Petar] Inst Sci Applicat Agr, Bulevar Despota Stefana 68b, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Djedovic, R (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Dept Anim Sci, Nemanjina 6, Belgrade 11080, Serbia.",genrad@agrif.bg.ac.rs; radodrag@agrif.bg.ac.rs; stanojevic@agrif.bg.ac.rs; savic@agrif.bg.ac.rs; natascha.vukasinovic@zoetis.com; mlp@agrif.bg.ac.rs; vlbogd@agrif.bg.ac.rs; cedomirradovic.izs@gmail.com; gogic.marija@gmail.com; nikolija.gligovic@agrif.bg.ac.rs; pstojic@sbb.rs; ivanmitrovic98@gmail.com,"; Bogdanović, Vladan/B-6822-2009; Savic, Radomir/R-1762-2019; Radović, Čedomir/KHZ-4939-2024","Vukasinovic, Natascha/0000-0002-5514-826X; Djedovic, Radica/0000-0002-0779-0282; Bogdanović, Vladan/0000-0002-8345-1258; Stanojević, agan/0000-0003-0793-0107; Savic, Radomir/0000-0003-2131-5303; Stojić, Petar/0000-0001-9176-7335; Radojkovic, agan/0000-0002-7743-4726; Radović, Čedomir/0000-0002-1800-2448; Gogić, Marija/0000-0001-8121-4649","Ministry of Science, Technological Development; Innovation of the Republic of Serbia; Faculty of Agriculture, University of Belgrade [451-03-65/2024-03/200116]; Institute for Animal Husbandry [451-03-66/2024-03/200022]","Ministry of Science, Technological Development; Innovation of the Republic of Serbia; Faculty of Agriculture, University of Belgrade; Institute for Animal Husbandry","This paper has emerged as a result of research conducted within the framework of the Agreement on the Implementation and Financing of Scientific Research in 2024 between the Ministry of Science, Technological Development, and Innovation of the Republic of Serbia and the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Belgrade, contract registration number 451-03-65/2024-03/200116, as well as The Institute for Animal Husbandry, contract registration number 451-03-66/2024-03/200022.",107,5,5,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,JUL,2024,14.0,13,,,,,,1894,10.3390/ani14131894,0.0,,24,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,YP7S9,38998006.0,"Green Submitted, gold",2026-02-03,WOS:001269760300001,0

Successful fertilization and high-quality embryos are prerequisites for an ongoing pregnancy. Studies have proven that every stage in the human reproductive process is regulated by multiple genes and any problem, at any step, may lead to fertilization failure (FF) or early embryonic arrest (EEA). Doctors can diagnose the pathogenic factors involved in FF and EEA by using genetic methods. With the progress in the development of new genetic technologies, such as single-cell RNA analysis and whole-exome sequencing, a new approach has opened up for us to directly study human germ cells and reproductive development. These findings will help us to identify the unique mechanism(s) that leads to FF and EEA in order to find potential treatments.OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE The goal of this review is to compile current genetic knowledge related to FF and EEA, clarifying the mechanisms involved and providing clues for clinical diagnosis and treatment.SEARCH METHODS PubMed was used to search for relevant research articles and reviews, primarily focusing on English-language publications from January 1978 to June 2023. The search terms included fertilization failure, early embryonic arrest, genetic, epigenetic, whole-exome sequencing, DNA methylation, chromosome, non-coding RNA, and other related keywords. Additional studies were identified by searching reference lists. This review primarily focuses on research conducted in humans. However, it also incorporates relevant data from animal models when applicable. The results were presented descriptively, and individual study quality was not assessed.OUTCOMES A total of 233 relevant articles were included in the final review, from 3925 records identified initially. The review provides an overview of genetic factors and mechanisms involved in the human reproductive process. The genetic mutations and other genetic mechanisms of FF and EEA were systematically reviewed, for example, globozoospermia, oocyte activation failure, maternal effect gene mutations, zygotic genome activation abnormalities, chromosome abnormalities, and epigenetic abnormalities. Additionally, the review summarizes progress in treatments for different gene defects, offering new insights for clinical diagnosis and treatment.WIDER IMPLICATIONS The information provided in this review will facilitate the development of more accurate molecular screening tools for diagnosing infertility using genetic markers and networks in human reproductive development. The findings will also help guide clinical practice by identifying appropriate interventions based on specific gene mutations. For example, when an individual has obvious gene mutations related to FF, ICSI is recommended instead of IVF. However, in the case of genetic defects such as phospholipase C zeta1 (PLCZ1), actin-like7A (ACTL7A), actin-like 9 (ACTL9), and IQ motif-containing N (IQCN), ICSI may also fail to fertilize. We can consider artificial oocyte activation technology with ICSI to improve fertilization rate and reduce monetary and time costs. In the future, fertility is expected to be improved or restored by interfering with or supplementing the relevant genes. Identifying the unique genetic mechanisms underlying fertilization failure and early embryo arrest can facilitate the discovery of potential therapeutic approaches (created using Figdraw).

Holistic mobile health (mHealth) interventions-including at least three components: physical activity, diet, and mental health-could support both physical and mental health and be scaled to the population level. This review aims to describe the characteristics of holistic mHealth interventions and their effects on related behavioural and health outcomes among adults from the general population. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Google Scholar (first 200 records). The initial search covered January 1, 2011, to April 13, 2022, and an updated search extended from April 13, 2022 to August 30, 2023. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) were included if they (i) were delivered via mHealth technologies, (ii) included content on physical activity, diet, and mental health, and (iii) targeted adults (>= 18 years old) from the general population or those at risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) or mental disorders. Studies were excluded if they targeted pregnant women (due to distinct physiological responses), individuals with pre-existing NCDs or mental disorders (to emphasise prevention), or primarily utilised web, email, or structured phone support (to focus on mobile technologies without exclusive human support). Data (summary data from published reports) extraction and risk-of-bias assessment were completed by two reviewers using a standard template and Cochrane risk-of-bias tools, respectively. Narrative syntheses were conducted for all studies, and random-effects models were used in the meta-analyses to estimate the pooled effect of interventions for outcomes with comparable data in the RCTs. The study was registered in PROSPERO, CRD42022315166. Findings After screening 5488 identified records, 34 studies (25 RCTs and 9 pre-post NRSIs) reported in 43 articles with 5691 participants (mean age 39 years, SD 12.5) were included. Most (91.2%, n = 31/34) were conducted in high-income countries. The median intervention duration was 3 months, and only 23.5% (n = 8/34) of studies reported follow-up data. Mobile applications, short-message services, and mobile device-compatible websites were the most common mHealth delivery modes; 47.1% (n = 16/34) studies used multiple mHealth delivery modes. Of 15 studies reporting on weight change, 9 showed significant reductions (6 targeted on individuals with overweight or obesity), and in 10 studies reporting perceived stress levels, 4 found significant reductions (all targeted on general adults). In the meta-analysis, holistic mHealth interventions were associated with significant weight loss (9 RCTs; mean difference -1.70 kg, 95% CI -2.45 to -0.95; I2 = 89.00%) and a significant reduction in perceived stress levels (6 RCTs; standardised mean difference [SMD] -0.32; 95% CI -0.52 to -0.12; I2 = 14.52%). There were no significant intervention effects on self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (5 RCTs; SMD 0.21; 95% CI -0.25 to 0.67; I2 = 74.28%) or diet quality scores (5 RCTs; SMD 0.21; 95%CI -0.47 to 0.65; I2 = 62.27%). All NRSIs were labelled as having a serious risk of bias overall; 56% (n = 14/25) of RCTs were classified as having some concerns, and the others as having a high risk of bias. Interpretation Findings from identified studies suggest that holistic mHealth interventions may aid reductions in weight and in perceived stress levels, with small to medium effect sizes. The observed effects on diet quality scores and self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were less clear and require more research. High-quality RCTs with longer follow-up durations are needed to provide more robust evidence. To promote population health, future research should focus on vulnerable populations and those in middle-and low-income countries. Optimal combinations of delivery modes and components to improve efficacy and sustain long-term effects should also be explored.
