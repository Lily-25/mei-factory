OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of AI-assisted patient education integrating voice cloning and ChatGPT, to compare physician voice cloning with patient self-voice cloning, and to assess the reliability of ChatGPT as an automated evaluation tool for education outcomes.A prospective, three-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial.A total of 180 hospitalized patients requiring standardized health education were recruited from a tertiary hospital. Inclusion criteria were: age ≥18 years, clear diagnosis requiring health education, clear consciousness, and voluntary participation with informed consent. Exclusion criteria were: severe hearing impairment, severe cognitive impairment, expected hospitalization <3 days, or prior participation in similar studies.Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive (1) traditional education (control), (2) AI-assisted education using physician voice cloning, or (3) AI-assisted education using patient self-voice cloning. All groups received identical educational content with equal duration.The primary outcome was education content compliance, evaluated using ChatGPT-4 with validated prompts and verified by expert review. Secondary outcomes included knowledge retention, education satisfaction, treatment adherence, quality of life (SF-36), and psychological status (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).Participants were randomly allocated using a computer-generated random sequence.

In this scenario, educational hypermedia has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing interactive learning and developing clinical reasoning. This study evaluated the effectiveness of an educational hypermedia in teaching obstetric risk reception and classification among third-year undergraduate nursing students at a private university in northeastern Brazil. This was a cluster-randomized clinical trial with 2 parallel groups (intervention and control), each with 30 participants. The intervention group used educational hypermedia after theoretical and practical classes, whereas the control group followed only traditional strategies. The primary outcome was knowledge gain, measured by pre-intervention and post-intervention tests. Both groups showed an improvement in performance, but the intervention group obtained a significantly higher average in the post-test (P=.001), with a high effect size (Cohen d=1.131), in contrast to a small effect in the control group. In addition, the students' evaluation using the LORI scale showed high satisfaction with the quality of the hypermedia (mean=4.77). The results indicate that hypermedia is an effective and complementary tool to traditional teaching, promoting greater knowledge retention and stimulating clinical reasoning in the context of obstetrics.The lack of clinical skills in reception and obstetric risk classification among nursing students has prompted the use of innovative educational technologies.

Design/methodology/approach We collected data from 389 Chinese employees across three stages and used hierarchical regression analysis and the bootstrap method to test our hypotheses. Findings Communication visibility negatively affects knowledge sabotage, and the loss of knowledge power mediates the relationship between communication visibility and knowledge sabotage. Digital work connectivity strengthens the negative relationship between message transparency and loss of knowledge power but weakens the negative relationship between network translucence and loss of knowledge power. Therefore, digital work connectivity plays a dual role. Practical implications Managers can encourage employees to share their knowledge advantages through ESM and seek cross-disciplinary knowledge cooperation, which helps restrain knowledge sabotage from the source. At the same time, maintaining appropriate digital work connectivity enables employees to leverage their knowledge interaction advantages of ESM, thereby fostering their knowledge competitiveness. Originality/value This study is the first to reveal the internal mechanism (loss of knowledge power) through which ESM communication visibility affects knowledge sabotage and explores the boundary condition (digital work connectivity) impacting the effectiveness of communication visibility.

To prevent and manage technical knowledge loss in firms, this study proposes an invulnerability analysis model for the firms’ technical knowledge network (FTKN) is first proposed based on complex networks. Key invulnerability metrics such as network connectivity, average risk path, and network risk efficiency are defined according to the unique characteristics of FTKN. Besides, the invulnerability of FTKN is analyzed based on the simulation analysis of random attacks and deliberate attacks. Additionally, a node importance evaluation method is introduced, incorporating factors such as degree value, betweenness centrality, efficiency, and the contributions of adjacent nodes. To enhance the survivability of FTKN, the network structure is optimized through redundant design. Simulation results demonstrate that external deliberate attacks and technical blockades cause more damage to the system compared to attacks on strongly correlated technologies. From a short-term perspective, prioritizing the protection of nodes with high betweenness can greatly improve the invulnerability of the network. Conversely, from a long-term perspective, the protection strategy of firms for moderate technology nodes is more conducive to the connectivity of the entire technology evolution network.

To address this issue, this study introduces a systematic framework that integrates Bloom's learning taxonomy with VR safety training model development, named the VR Safety Training Goal Taxonomy Framework (VR-Safety-TGT). VR-Safety-TGT provides a comprehensive method for safety trainers and VR model developers to communicate and understand each other's perspectives. Specifically, it assists VR model developers in better-aligning safety training learning objectives. The efficacy of VR-Safety-TGT is examined through a pilot study involving a sample of 91 university students. The students were divided into three groups, each subjected to one of the following training modalities: slideshow-based training, traditional VR training, and VR-Safety-TGT training.

CBM has been shown to enhance self-assessment and metacognitive awareness. This study aimed to explore the implementation of CBM in multiple-choice assessments in physiology. The CBM assessment tool was developed with an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant, Claude 3.5, with prompts focused on functional rather than technical requirements. The assessment consisted of 15 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), which were administered as a pretest and posttest during a small group teaching session to first-year medical students. Following the assessment, students completed a survey to evaluate their perceptions regarding the format, knowledge-gap identification, and overall acceptability. Answers from 195 students were analyzed, and significant improvements were observed in performance measures and certainty indices from the pretest to the posttest. Most students (80.9%) found the certainty scale beneficial, and 78.3% changed their answers after reflecting on their certainty. CBM demonstrated metacognitive benefits, with 86.4% of students better recognizing their knowledge gaps and 85.8% feeling more aware of their learning progress. About 73% of students preferred the CBM format and expressed greater engagement (82.8%) than traditional MCQs. CBM implemented through a web-based platform functioned as an assessment tool and an instructional intervention that enhanced students' metacognitive awareness and self-monitoring skills in physiology education.

30,ECSA: Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting and Few-Shot Generalization in Medical Visual Question Answering,"Jia, Qinhao1; Liu, Shuxian1; Chen, Mingliang1; Li, Tianyi1; Yang, Jing11 School of Computer Science and Technology, Xinjiang University, Urumqi 830017, China","Objective: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA), a key technology that integrates computer vision and natural language processing to assist in clinical diagnosis, possesses significant potential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. However, its development is constrained by two major bottlenecks: weak few-shot generalization capability stemming from the scarcity of high-quality annotated data and the problem of catastrophic forgetting when continually learning new knowledge. Existing research has largely addressed these two challenges in isolation, lacking a unified framework. Methods: To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel Evolvable Clinical-Semantic Alignment (ECSA) framework, designed to synergistically solve these two challenges within a single architecture. ECSA is built upon powerful pre-trained vision (BiomedCLIP) and language (Flan-T5) models, with two innovative modules at its core. First, we design a Clinical-Semantic Disambiguation Module (CSDM), which employs a novel debiased hard negative mining strategy for contrastive learning. This enables the precise discrimination of ""hard negatives"" that are visually similar but clinically distinct, thereby significantly enhancing the model's representation ability in few-shot and long-tail scenarios. Second, we introduce a Prompt-based Knowledge Consolidation Module (PKC), which acts as a rehearsal-free non-parametric knowledge store. It consolidates historical knowledge by dynamically accumulating and retrieving task-specific ""soft prompts,"" thus effectively circumventing catastrophic forgetting without relying on past data. Results: Extensive experimental results on four public benchmark datasets, VQA-RAD, SLAKE, PathVQA, and VQA-Med-2019, demonstrate ECSA's state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance. Specifically, ECSA achieves excellent overall accuracies of 80.15% on VQA-RAD and 85.10% on SLAKE, while also showing strong generalization with 64.57% on PathVQA and 82.23% on VQA-Med-2019. More critically, in continual learning scenarios, the framework achieves a low forgetting rate of just 13.50%, showcasing its significant advantages in knowledge retention. Conclusions: These findings validate the framework's substantial potential for building robust and evolvable clinical decision support systems.Objective: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA), a key technology that integrates computer vision and natural language processing to assist in clinical diagnosis, possesses significant potential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. However, its development is constrained by two major bottlenecks: weak few-shot generalization capability stemming from the scarcity of high-quality annotated data and the problem of catastrophic forgetting when continually learning new knowledge. Existing research has largely addressed these two challenges in isolation, lacking a unified framework. Methods: To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel Evolvable Clinical-Semantic Alignment (ECSA) framework, designed to synergistically solve these two challenges within a single architecture. ECSA is built upon powerful pre-trained vision (BiomedCLIP) and language (Flan-T5) models, with two innovative modules at its core. First, we design a Clinical-Semantic Disambiguation Module (CSDM), which employs a novel debiased hard negative mining strategy for contrastive learning. This enables the precise discrimination of ""hard negatives"" that are visually similar but clinically distinct, thereby significantly enhancing the model's representation ability in few-shot and long-tail scenarios. Second, we introduce a Prompt-based Knowledge Consolidation Module (PKC), which acts as a rehearsal-free non-parametric knowledge store. It consolidates historical knowledge by dynamically accumulating and retrieving task-specific ""soft prompts,"" thus effectively circumventing catastrophic forgetting without relying on past data. Results: Extensive experimental results on four public benchmark datasets, VQA-RAD, SLAKE, PathVQA, and VQA-Med-2019, demonstrate ECSA's state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance. Specifically, ECSA achieves excellent overall accuracies of 80.15% on VQA-RAD and 85.10% on SLAKE, while also showing strong generalization with 64.57% on PathVQA and 82.23% on VQA-Med-2019.

31,The potential of human-machine collaborative learning in educational virtual environments for knowledge retention in science learners: A decade-long meta-analysis,"Chen, Gaoyu; Oubibi, Mohamed    ; Zhou, Yueliang; Li, Yunlu; Wang, Haijun; Gao, Yan","Educational virtual environments (EVEs), constructed through virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), serve as digital learning spaces that provide crucial support for applying human-machine collaborative learning in science education. In science education, knowledge retention is the foundation for students to understand complex scientific concepts and to conduct further inquiry-based practices, directly influencing the long-term development of scientific literacy. However, there remains academic debate regarding whether EVE-based human-machine collaborative learning can effectively enhance knowledge retention, and its core mechanisms have yet to be systematically clarified. This study employs a meta-analysis approach to synthesize 80 experimental and quasi-experimental studies (including 88 effect sizes) conducted between 2014 and 2024, examining the impact of EVEs-based human-machine collaborative learning on science learners' knowledge retention. The results indicate that compared with traditional learning methods, EVEs-based human-machine collaborative learning has significant potential to improve knowledge retention. Although no statistically significant differences were found across moderating variables such as educational level and technology type, environments built with VR technology, high school contexts, operational learning, and presentation-based instructional approaches demonstrated more pronounced effects on knowledge retention. Subgroup analysis of instructional methods further revealed that their effectiveness is moderated by factors such as testing formats and educational levels. Accordingly, researchers and educational practitioners are encouraged to adopt systematic thinking in designing instructional practices, explore effective teaching methods, and apply diversified assessments to continuously monitor long-term impacts. This study aims to provide both theoretical insights and practical guidance for science educators to optimize EVEs-based instructional strategies and enhance knowledge retention.

Email: mash@iitm.ac.in","Although virtual reality (VR) technology has been used for training in various aspects of construction, the evidence of its effectiveness in construction quality training has yet to be examined. The current study develops a novel high-fidelity VR-based defect identification training module using minute details of construction defects to assess participants’ learning experience for construction quality-related training vis-à-vis conventional classroom training. Actual quality-related defect data from two construction projects was classified, and selected defects were modeled to create three-dimensional (3D) objects in an interactive VR environment. A robust sample of 121 Indian civil engineering students were recruited and categorized into three cohorts: No Training, Classroom Training, and VR Training. The data from these participants—data from questionnaires on perceptions and conceptual knowledge and scores in an innovative VR-based defect identification testing module—were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. In a context with no previous empirical examination of VR-based education in construction quality, this study reveals that high-fidelity VR training improves participants’ conceptual knowledge of construction defects. However, VR does not show a specific advantage compared to classroom training for conceptual knowledge retention, a finding that is attributable to the similarity in training materials between VR and conventional methods. Based on a robust methodology in the current study, these results amplify a somewhat limited perspective in the literature on the effectiveness of VR-based training and cautions against the potential overestimation of the effectiveness of VR for improvements in conceptual knowledge among study participants. The most significant contributions of this study lie in advancing the VR training literature, of which only a handful of studies have focused on assessing the practical knowledge gained by training recipients. Notably, this study reveals a 32.8% improvement in VR-based practical learning outcomes for the VR cohort compared to the no-training cohort, suggesting that VR could provide hands-on skills for navigating quality-related challenges in the construction industry.",Journal of Construction Engineering and Management; New York,United States,Oct 2025,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.1061/JCEMD4.COENG-15493,"ProQuest One Applied & Life Sciences,SciTech Premium Collection",Journal Article,other,other,"The evidence of the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) technology for construction quality training has yet to be examined, with a lack of previous empirical examination in this specific context.","Developed a novel high-fidelity VR-based defect identification training module using classified defect data from two projects.

Engineering education integrates the latest technologies with gamification that fosters student engagement in innovative learning. Gamification involves incorporating game design elements, making learning more interactive and motivating. This paper explores gamification to transform engineering education, improving students' participation, understanding, and overall learning outcomes. Combining Edge computing with artificial intelligence will enhance the gamification of education by addressing two primary challenges: real‐time interaction and personalized service. An Edge‐AI‐driven gamification framework is proposed for improving student engagement through interactive tools like educational games, quizzes, and competitive learning environments. An algorithm related to the Edge‐AI Gamification Optimizer is proposed to improve the overall performance. Results show that the proposed framework improves student engagement by nearly 51%, performance by 30.7% and reduces cognitive load by 57%. A comparative study with traditional learning approaches shows that AI‐based gamification significantly enhances knowledge retention, boosts collaborative learning, increases student motivation, and, through statistical analysis, demonstrates a validated increase in student engagement over conventional methods. Future studies will investigate the extendability of this framework to different fields of engineering and learning environments.

Existing educational systems often fail to accommodate users relying on gestures, lack seamless integration across learning modalities, and provide limited adaptability to individual learning preferences. GEALP introduces a three-tier architecture combining 3D-CNN-based gesture recognition with attention-augmented temporal processing, bi-directional multi-modal content conversion, and dynamic learning adaptation supported by real-time feedback loops. Experiments with 1,000 users, 5,000 learning sessions, and 10,000 gestures demonstrate GEALP's superior performance. Results show improved gesture recognition accuracy (95.5%), user interaction (92.8%), and learning effectiveness (89.2%) compared to existing systems.

54,A Gamified Cardiometabolic Health Curriculum Utilizing a Student Response System for Internal Medicine Residents,"Ji-Cheng, Hsieh1; Bagha Zohaib1; Weintraub, Spencer2; Jnani Jack1; Block, Lauren11 Internal Medicine, Northwell Health, New Hyde Park, USA2 Northwell Cardiovascular Institute, Northwell Health, New Hyde Park, USA","Introduction: Cardiovascular disease is frequently addressed in primary care, and professional association guidelines dictating the standard of care frequently change. Teaching clinical practice guidelines to residents remains important to promote knowledge retention and subsequent implementation in patient care. Gamification utilizes social elements and technology to promote accessible and active learning that enhances learner confidence, engagement, and knowledge. Data assessing gamification in teaching guideline-based care remains limited. We evaluated a gamified cardiometabolic health curriculum utilizing a student response system (SRS) to assess the benefits of gamification in teaching guidelines to internal medicine residents.  Methods: We developed a gamified cardiometabolic health curriculum for categorical residents in internal medicine utilizing KAHOOT!® (Oslo, Norway). KAHOOT!® is an SRS where learners utilize their mobile devices to answer questions. Speed and accuracy contributed to placement on a digital leaderboard. Our curriculum consisted of one academic half-day with five 45-minute virtual didactics reviewing guideline-based management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic-associated fatty liver dysfunction (MAFLD), and weight management. KAHOOT!® was selected to promote ease of participation. The gamified format was compared to a traditional slide-based format. Residents are randomly assigned one of five clinic groups. Three groups received the gamified format, and two received the traditional format, without crossover. Residents were invited to complete anonymous pre- and post-surveys, which collected quantitative data such as Likert scale ratings of confidence and satisfaction with learning and test performance. Results: All residents (108 of 108) received the curriculum. Around 59% (64) received the gamified format, and 44 (41%) received the traditional format. Pre-post surveys were compared via a matched analysis. Anonymous surveys were matched via a code provided by each resident, and residents who completed only one of the two surveys were excluded. Likert scale ratings of confidence in management increased for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, MAFLD, and weight management, but not for T2DM, likely as T2DM had the lowest number of matched resident pairs analyzed. Comparing gamified and traditional formats, there was no difference in the post-curricular change in absolute score on board-style questions or increase in Likert scale ratings of confidence. A majority of residents (90.9%) who received the gamified format found it engaging, while a minority (14.2%) of residents who received the traditional format found it engaging. Analysis was limited by a low response rate of 21.6%. Anonymous pre-post surveys limited the assessment of non-response bias and whether respondent characteristics differed from those of non-respondents. Discussion: A gamified format was similar to a traditional format in increasing resident confidence in managing cardiometabolic health conditions and knowledge of guidelines. A gamified format was felt to be more engaging. Although the low response rate limits generalizability, we present initial data supporting the efficacy of a virtual gamified curriculum utilizing an SRS to teach clinical practice guidelines.

However, there is a need for further research to explore its impact on critical thinking disposition among nursing students.This quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study was conducted with a convenience sample of 190 nursing students from Damietta University's Faculty of Nursing. Participants were assessed on their critical thinking disposition and VR-related knowledge at three time points: before the intervention, immediately after, and two months post-intervention. METHODS This quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study was conducted with a convenience sample of 190 nursing students from Damietta University's Faculty of Nursing. Participants were assessed on their critical thinking disposition and VR-related knowledge at three time points: before the intervention, immediately after, and two months post-intervention.The VR-based educational program aimed to improve students' critical thinking disposition and assess their knowledge of virtual reality before, during, and after the program. AIM The VR-based educational program aimed to improve students' critical thinking disposition and assess their knowledge of virtual reality before, during, and after the program.A statistically significant improvement in students' mean scores for critical thinking disposition was observed across all evaluations (p < 0.001). The effect size (η²p ≥ 0.14) indicated a substantial impact, reinforcing the effectiveness of the VR-based educational program in fostering higher-order cognitive skills. Additionally, students demonstrated increased retention of VR-related knowledge when assessed immediately after the program and again after two months.

While gamification has been recognised as a potential solution, its application in AMT education remains underexplored, particularly in bridging theoretical knowledge with practical skill acquisition. This study investigates the effectiveness of Kahoot-based gamification in enhancing student engagement, motivation, knowledge retention, and practical skills development. A mixed-methods approach was employed, integrating quantitative surveys, pre- and post-assessments, and qualitative interviews with students and instructors. The study assessed 120 participants, revealing statistically significant improvements: engagement increased by 43.8%, motivation by 55.2%, knowledge retention by 41.2%, and practical skills by 51.6%. Qualitative findings supported these results, with students reporting higher participation, improved concept recall, and greater enthusiasm. Instructors observed enhanced confidence in applying theoretical knowledge. Despite these benefits, challenges such as internet connectivity issues, time constraints, and question format limitations were identified. The study recommends a blended learning approach integrating gamification with hands-on training, scenario-based exercises, and emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Beyond AMT, these findings highlight gamification’s potential in technical and vocational education, emphasising the need for future research on adaptive gamification models and AI-driven learning platforms.

The aim of this research is to determine student attitudes toward the use of Education 4.0 tools in the 7th-grade Science course Electrical Circuits unit. To achieve this, an attitude test was developed to evaluate the integration of Education 4.0 tools into the Science curriculum, and student attitudes were assessed using this test. A ""quasi-experimental design with pre-test and post-test control group,"" one of the quantitative research methods, was used in the study.

Here we investigated different teaching modalities on test performance and student satisfaction in the human gross anatomy laboratory at the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine (NYITCOM). The anatomy laboratory for first‐year osteopathic students at NYITCOM was divided into stations including radiology, case‐based learning, prosection, and dissection. Content covered at those stations was tested via anatomy laboratory examinations, comprised of computer‐based identification and multiple‐choice questions. Our data encompassed 459 first‐year medical students taking anatomy in 2022 at both NYITCOM campus sites (Arkansas and New York). We coded 355 exam questions by teaching modality used in the anatomy laboratory. Questions covered in multiple modalities were classified as ‘mixed’. Performance among modalities was analyzed using a three‐way ANOVA. Prosection‐based questions (mean = 75.6) performed significantly worse than dissection (mean = 83.4, p  < 0.01) and mixed‐modality (mean = 80.7, p  < 0.01). There was no significant difference in performance on material taught through dissection, radiology, case‐based activity and mixed modalities. In addition, we investigated the effect of an instructor at the case‐based activity station using repeated measures ANOVA. Our results indicate that case‐based activity stations performed better without an instructor present (mean = 77.4 v. 72.7; p  < 0.05).

This need is further underscored by the fact that non-obstetricians and non-midwives often serve as first responders in out-of-hospital and acute care settings where vaginal birth (VB) is imminent. Traditional mannequin-based simulations depend on in-person tutors with demands on time and physical space. In the absence of realistic clinical scenarios, they serve no better than low-fidelity task trainers. Capitalising on recent advancements in affordable virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display (HMD) technology, we developed and iteratively refined a VR-based childbirth training system between 2020 and 2025. Initial user studies demonstrated strong knowledge retention although participants expressed a preference for in-person mannequin-based simulations due to the lack of tactile feedback in VR. To address this limitation, we introduced a mixed reality (MR)-enhanced childbirth training system in 2024. This innovative approach integrates high-precision alignment of virtual elements with physical mannequins and introduces a tactile component to enhance skill acquisition. A pilot study involving 35 Year 4 undergraduate students yielded positive feedback with participants praising the system’s heightened realism and opportunities for peer-to-peer interaction. While both VR and MR have distinct advan-tages and limitations, the affordability and versatility of modern HMD make VR/MR-based training modules highly scalable and adaptable to diverse scenarios, surpassing the single-task limitations of traditional mannequins.

Learners engaged with the AR learning system for Japanese compound verb learning and utilized the LAD to monitor and reflect on their AR learning activities. Behavioral data were analyzed using Lag Sequential Analysis (LSA), while learning performance was evaluated through one-way repeated-measures ANOVA tests. The findings indicate that the use of the LAD significantly improves learning outcomes and metacognitive processes, such as knowledge of cognition and regulation of cognition. Additionally, there were different usage patterns of the dashboard among learners, which corresponded to significant differences in their learning outcomes and changes in metacognitive awareness. Learners who primarily focused on the learning process and social comparison components of the dashboard demonstrated improved knowledge retention. Conversely, those who mainly concentrated on personal learning data experienced the most significant gains in metacognitive awareness. This study also provides crucial design insights on the integration of dashboard components with cognitive efforts to maximize learning outcomes. Alternate abstract: Plain language summary Improving Language Learning Through a Dashboard: A Study on Japanese Learners Using Augmented Reality This study examined the effectiveness of a learning analytics dashboard (LAD) with three components (personal learning data, social comparison, and visualization of the learning process) in promoting the knowledge acquisition and metacognitive awareness of 31 non-native learners of Japanese in learning Japanese compound verbs. The results indicated that the use of LAD significantly improves learning outcomes and metacognitive processes, such as knowledge of cognition and regulation of cognition, and second, that students who concentrated on the learning process and social comparison showed the most improved performance in knowledge retention, while those who concentrated on personal learning data showed greater improvements in metacognitive awareness. This study contributes significantly to the field of LA by providing evidence that the integration of LAD into AR learning environments can meet the multifaceted challenges posed by concurrent multitasking, thus facilitating a more monitored and reflective learning experience. The research also highlights the benefits of combining dashboard components with cognitive efforts to ensure that metacognitive awareness is effectively harnessed to improve learning.",Sage Open; Thousand Oaks,United States,May 2025,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.1177/21582440251341675,"Publicly Available Content Database,Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts (LLBA),ProQuest One Social Sciences",Journal Article,other,other,"The multitasking nature of AR systems prevents learners from successfully reflecting and retaining knowledge, creating a gap in effective knowledge acquisition and metacognitive awareness in AR learning environments.","['Experimental design with pre-tests, post-tests, and a delayed test', 'Behavioral data analysis using Lag Sequential Analysis (LSA)', 'Learning performance evaluation using one-way repeated-measures ANOVA tests']","The use of the Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD) significantly improves learning outcomes and metacognitive processes (knowledge of cognition and regulation of cognition).

Traditional pedagogical approaches, such as cadaveric dissection, anatomical models, and textbook-based learning, have been the cornerstone of medical education for decades. However, these methods face challenges, including limited accessibility (e.g., resource-intensive setups), ethical concerns (e.g., participant privacy), and difficulties in visualizing complex three-dimensional structures (e.g., dynamic systems). Recent advancements in immersive technologies, particularly virtual reality (VR), present a transformative opportunity to enhance anatomy education by offering interactive, scalable, and engaging learning experiences. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of VR simulation in improving medical students' learning outcomes in anatomy education, comparing its effectiveness to conventional teaching methodologies. This systematic review was conducted in strict accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines to ensure methodological rigor. A comprehensive literature search was performed across six major medical databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science, encompassing studies published between January 2019 and February 2024. The search strategy employed a combination of MeSH terms and keywords related to ""virtual reality"", ""anatomy education"", and ""medical students"". Study selection was guided by the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Study (PICOS) framework, with inclusion criteria focusing on randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and comparative analyses evaluating VR-based anatomy instruction for medical students. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess study quality and potential bias. Due to significant heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures, a narrative synthesis approach was adopted to integrate findings thematically rather than through meta-analysis. The review included 14 studies with a total of 961 participants, predominantly medical students across various training stages. Among the included studies, 71% demonstrated statistically significant improvements in anatomy learning outcomes with VR compared to traditional methods, including enhanced spatial understanding, knowledge retention, and learner engagement; 21% of the studies reported no significant difference in learning efficacy between VR and conventional approaches, while only 7% found VR simulation only partially effective, citing technical limitations and a steep learning curve as barriers. Subgroup analyses suggested that VR was particularly beneficial for visualizing complex anatomical regions (e.g., neuroanatomy, musculoskeletal structures) and for students with limited prior exposure to cadaveric dissection. However, variability in VR platform design, assessment tools and instructional integration underscored the need for standardized implementation frameworks. The review generally indicated the benefits of VR simulation in anatomy education, but larger studies are needed to fully explore its potential in medical anatomy training. Future studies should rigorously evaluate VR implementation in anatomy education to provide more comprehensive evidence of its strengths and weaknesses for medical teaching.",Cureus; Palo Alto,Netherlands,2025,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.81893,"Publicly Available Content Database,ProQuest One Health & Nursing",Journal Article,other,other,"Traditional anatomy education methods face challenges including limited accessibility, ethical concerns, and difficulties in visualizing complex three-dimensional structures.","Systematic review conducted in accordance with PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines.

Other variables measured were immersion, extraneous cognitive load, and mental imagery. ANOVA and correlation analyses showed that the narrative media was found to be significantly more immersive and that it evoked mental imagery in individuals at higher levels than both the list and image media. Importantly, there was more decay in memory recall between immediate and delayed tests for those exposed to the list and the image than for those who read the narrative. This implies the utility of immersive narratives for spontaneous mental image generation, which leads to improved knowledge retention.

However, conventional training methods like live drills and tabletop exercises can require significant resources, limit participation, and disrupt hospital operations. In light of these challenges, Virtual Reality (VR) training has emerged as a modern solution, offering an innovative way to improve training efficiency without interfering with routine hospital activities. This study, therefore, examines how VR training compares to traditional methods in preparing hospital personnel for disasters, focusing specifically on effectiveness and cost. Methods: We reviewed studies concerning the effectiveness and economic assessments of VR compared to traditional methods. To answer the research questions, we followed the Canada Drug Agency's guides on conducting a health technology assessment. Articles were identified from both peer-reviewed and gray literature. Results: The review highlights eight pertinent studies demonstrating VR's advantages, including boosting knowledge retention, performance, and overall confidence among healthcare professionals in disaster preparedness. Furthermore, the economic analysis indicates that although the initial costs of VR synchronous training may be higher, the long-term savings from reduced ongoing training and maintenance can lead to greater cost efficiency. In addition, while VR training presents safety benefits, challenges such as cybersickness and accessibility concerns have also been observed. Conclusion: VR training offers considerable advantages over traditional disaster preparedness methods and significantly improves healthcare workers' confidence and skills. Despite the high upfront costs, the potential long-term financial benefits appear promising.

107,Problem-Based Learning and Case-Based Learning in Clinical Practical Teaching for Gynecology Residents: A Narrative Review,"Zhu, Y; Zhang, J; Fei, J; Fang, H; Zhang, Z","Background: Gynecology residency training necessitates a robust educational framework to cultivate clinical competency, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Traditional lecture-based teaching methods are deficient in fostering active learning and clinical decision-making. Problem-based learning (PBL) and case-based learning (CBL) have emerged as learner-centered approaches that enhance medical education by integrating theoretical knowledge with clinical practice. This review aims to explain the efficacy, implementation frameworks, challenges, and comparative value of PBL and CBL in gynecology residency education, and explores the role of instructional technology integration. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed, ERIC, Scopus, Embase, and EBSCO (January 2010–January 2025) using keywords: “problem-based learning”, “case-based learning”, “gynecology education”, “residency training”. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies on PBL/CBL interventions in gynecology residency with qualitative/quantitative outcomes. Ten articles met the criteria after screening. Results: Both PBL and CBL significantly outperform in enhancing clinical decision-making, differential diagnosis, knowledge retention, procedural planning, and long-term knowledge application. PBL utilizes open-ended problems to cultivate self-directed learning, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving (eg, managing complex AUB etiologies). CBL employs structured clinical cases to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, improving diagnostic reasoning and patient management skills. Key implementation frameworks involve careful pre-session preparation, facilitator-guided discussions on authentic cases, and structured feedback. Challenges include significant faculty time for case design/facilitation, resource intensity, and competency assessment. PBL fosters deep theoretical understanding, while CBL excels in clinical skill translation. Integrating both approaches creates a balanced curriculum. Augmenting PBL/CBL with simulation, flipped classrooms, mobile learning, and AI enhances accessibility, personalization, and procedural skill practice. Conclusion: PBL and CBL are transformative pedagogical strategies for gynecology residency training, effectively developing competencies needed for complex clinical practice. Successful implementation requires rigorously designed cases, faculty trained in facilitative guidance, and strategic technology integration. These approaches prepare residents not only as skilled technicians but as adaptable, patient-centered practitioners capable of navigating evolving healthcare challenges.

121,Evaluating the Benefits and Drawbacks of Visualizing Systems Modeling Lan guage (SysML) Diagrams in the 3D Virtual Reality Environment,"Mostafa, Lutfi    ; Valerdi Ricardo","Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) prioritizes system design through models rather than documents, and it is implemented with the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), which is the state-of-the-art language in academia and industry. Virtual Reality (VR), an immersive visualization technology, can simulate reality in virtual environments with varying degrees of fidelity. In recent years, the technology industry has invested substantially in the development of head-mounted displays (HMDs) and related virtual reality (VR) technologies. Various research has suggested that VR-based immersive design reviews enhance system issue/fault identification, collaboration, focus, and presence compared to non-immersive approaches. Additionally, several research efforts have demonstrated that the VR environment provides higher understanding and knowledge retention levels than traditional approaches. In recent years, multiple attempts have been made to visualize conventional 2D SysML diagrams in a virtual reality environment. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no empirical evaluation has been performed to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of visualizing SysML diagrams in a VR environment. Hence, the authors aimed to evaluate four key benefit types and drawbacks through experiments with human subjects. The authors chose four benefit types—Systems Understanding, Information Sharing, Modeling and Training Experience, and Digital Twin based on the MBSE value and benefits review performed by researchers and benefits claimed by the evaluations for similar visual formalism languages. Experiments were conducted to compare the understanding, interaction, and knowledge retention for 3D VR and conventional 2D SysML diagrams. The authors chose a ground-based telescope system as the system of interest (SOI) for system modeling. The authors utilized a standalone wireless HMD unit for a virtual reality experience, which enabled experiments to be conducted irrespective of location. Students and experts from multiple disciplines, including systems engineering, participated in the experiment and provided their opinions on the VR SysML implementation. The knowledge test, perceived evaluation results, and post-completion surveys were analyzed to determine whether the 3D VR SysML implementation improved these benefits and identified potential drawbacks.

125,Fluoride in Cultural and Literary Narratives: AI as a Tool for Enhancing Knowledge on Educational Platforms,"Yang, Liuxiuzi11 Jinan University School of Humanities; Guangdong Zhuhai; 519070, CHINA","Purpose: With an emphasis on the function of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated instructional content, the current study attempts to investigate the impact of fluoride-related cultural and literary tales on information retention. The study investigates the links between exposure to fluoride narratives, learners' attitudes about fluoride narratives, engagement with AI-based platforms, and perceived utility of AI-generated information by utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Additionally, the study looks at how AI involvement and attitudes affect knowledge retention through serial and mediating effects. Methods This study used a cross-sectional survey approach with students in China's Jiangxi and Henan provinces as its target population. The relationship between exposure to fluoride narratives in educational materials, perceptions of the value of AI-generated information, interaction with AI platforms, and knowledge retention was examined through the application of structural equation modeling, or SEM. The pathways in the Technology Acceptance Model were examined using cross-sectional and serial mediation analyses. Of particular interest was the effect of AI-driven educational material on attitudes and engagement that lead to knowledge retention. Results: The results show that learners' views regarding fluoride and their engagement with AI platforms are greatly impacted when they are exposed to fluoride narratives in instructional content. These elements also highly predict the memory of fluoride-related knowledge. The study shows that the association between knowledge retention and the perceived utility of AI-generated information is entirely mediated by positive sentiments regarding the narratives and involvement with AI-based learning platforms. The impact of AI-generated material on knowledge retention is contingent upon learners' attitudes and their degree of involvement with AI platforms, as demonstrated by serial mediation studies. Research Limitation/Implication: Since the cross-sectional methodology makes it difficult to determine causal linkages, further longitudinal research is required to fully comprehend the long-term impacts of AI-enhanced instructional content on knowledge retention. To improve the study's validity, more objective measures of engagement and information retention should be included in subsequent studies. Orginality: This work presents a unique use of TAM in the context of educational technology, focusing on how AI-generated material might support learning experiences that are narrative-driven and culturally rich.

132,The Impact of AI-Generated Instructional Videos on Problem-Based Learning in Science Teacher Education,"Pellas, Nikolaos","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained significant prominence in science education, yet its practical applications, particularly in teacher training, remain underexplored. Specifically, there is a lack of research on AI’s potential to support personalized professional development through automated analysis of classroom interactions and tailored feedback. As science teacher education requires skill development in complex scientific concepts within problem-based learning (PBL) contexts, there is a growing need for innovative, technology-driven instructional tools. AI-generated instructional videos are increasingly recognized as powerful tools for enhancing educational experiences. This study investigates the impact of AI-generated instructional videos, designed using established instructional design principles, on self-efficacy, task performance, and learning outcomes in science teacher education. Employing a within-subjects design, the current study included pre-test, post-test, and transfer assessments to evaluate learning durability and transferability, consistent with design-based research methodology. Moreover, this study compares the effectiveness of two AI-generated instructional video formats: one with an embedded preview feature allowing learners to preview key concepts before detailed instruction (video-with-preview condition) and another without this feature (video-without-preview condition). It specifically examines the role of preview features in enhancing these outcomes during training on scientific concepts with 55 Greek pre-service science teachers (n = 55; mean age 27.3 years; range 22–35). The results demonstrated that the videos effectively supported self-efficacy, task performance, and knowledge retention. However, no significant differences were observed between videos with and without preview features across all assessed metrics and tests. These findings also indicate that AI-generated instructional videos can effectively enhance knowledge retention, transfer, and self-efficacy, positioning them as promising assets in science teacher education. The limited impact of the preview feature highlights the need for careful design and evaluation of instructional elements, such as interactivity and adaptive learning algorithms, to fully realize their potential.",Education Sciences; Basel,Switzerland,2025,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci15010102,Publicly Available Content Database,Journal Article,other,other,"The practical applications of AI in teacher training, particularly for personalized professional development through automated analysis of classroom interactions and tailored feedback, remain underexplored.

Understanding this relationship is of critical importance as substantial evidence illustrates the malleability of spatial ability and that the effects of associated training interventions transfer to desirable STEM outcomes such as improved educational performance and reduced attrition rates. There currently exists a number of theories as to why spatial ability relates to STEM, such as that the nature of STEM activity is inherently spatial. However, there is a need to better understand this relationship from a cognitive perspective. This research examined the hypothesis that spatial ability is predictive of short-term retention for declarative technical information associated with engineering curricula. An original investigation in an authentic educational setting found that visualisation and interest in the lecture material were significant predictors of short-term knowledge retention. This effect was then replicated in two subsequent conceptual replication studies. Based on this predictive finding, it is theorised that increases in spatial ability may support the elongation of the knowledge forgetting curve which would have significant implications for instructional design.",European Journal of Engineering Education; Abingdon,United Kingdom,Dec 2024,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.1080/03043797.2024.2405860,"Education Research Index,ProQuest One Applied & Life Sciences,SciTech Premium Collection",Journal Article,other,other,"There is a need to better understand the relationship between spatial ability and STEM from a cognitive perspective, specifically its role in knowledge retention.","Original investigation in an authentic educational setting, followed by two conceptual replication studies.",Visualisation (a spatial ability) and interest in lecture material were significant predictors of short-term knowledge retention for declarative technical information in engineering.

Objectives This study examined the effectiveness of desktop‐based virtual reality (VR) social platforms compared to video conferencing (VC) platforms in enhancing students' learning gains and experiences in online synchronous learning. Methods The study used a within‐subject design, involving 34 college students in two online lecture modules, one via a VR social platform and another through a VC platform. Knowledge assessments occurred pre‐ and post‐modules and after 1 week. Students also completed post‐module questionnaires to evaluate their learning experience, in terms of social presence, easiness of use and perceived emotions. In‐depth interviews provided further insights into their experiences with both platforms. Results The study showed that using VR social platforms for online synchronous learning enhanced immediate knowledge, especially in students less interested in the content, yet it did not notably impact long‐term knowledge retention. Despite no significant findings in social presence from questionnaires, interviews indicated that the VR's heightened interactivity might be offset by the effect of not seeing others' real appearances in promoting social presence. Furthermore, the VC platform was found to be easier to use, attributed to its familiarity and user‐friendliness. Finally, students experienced increased fun, awe and interest, along with reduced boredom, when using the VR social platform. Conclusion The findings highlight the potential of VR to enrich online learning while underscoring the need for effective strategies facilitating a smooth integration into educational settings.

Besides various customized physical teaching aids, subject-specific information technology, such as Dynamic Geometry System (DGS), finds extensive use in mathematical inquiry activities. However, effects of DGS and physical manipulatives on inquiry-based math learning remain an open question. Hence, by adopting a quasi-experimental research design, this paper aims to empirically compare the immediate learning outcomes, knowledge retention, and learning interest of seventh-grade students who explore with virtual manipulatives (i.e., the DGS) and who explore with physical manipulatives. Specifically, 131 students participated in learning activities centered on exploring pyramids and prisms. During the inquiry process, Group A ( n  = 33) constructed pyramids and prisms in DGS, Group B ( n  = 34) observed pre-made virtual models in DGS, Group C ( n  = 32) observed physical models, and Group D ( n  = 32) made physical pyramids and prisms with polymer clay and small sticks. Moreover, pretest, post-test, and delayed post-test designed according to the Van Hiele model, as well as an adapted interest questionnaire, were employed to evaluate students’ performances; and collected data were analyzed by means of ANCOVA and t-test. Findings of the study revealed that in the context of construction, students employing the DGS exhibited superior immediate learning outcomes and greater knowledge retention compared to their peers who utilized physical manipulatives; while in the case of observation, the virtual and physical manipulatives yielded similar impacts on students’ immediate learning outcomes, but students who involved in the DGS demonstrated higher knowledge retention. Furthermore, regarding the DGS environment, students who engaged in constructive manipulation surpassed their peers who engaged in observing manipulation. In terms of interest, the DGS proved to be more effective in both stimulating and maintaining higher interest compared to the physical manipulatives, and constructive manipulation was more effective than observing manipulation. In summary, as compared to the physical manipulatives, DGS, particularly when employed with constructive strategy, has shown to encourage students to more actively engage in task-related cognitive behaviors, thereby supporting and enhancing inquiry-based math learning of students in junior high school.",Education and Information Technologies; New York,Netherlands,Nov 2024,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-024-12663-6,Education Research Index,Journal Article,Quantitative research; Surveys & questionnaires; Qualitative research; Quasi-experimental design,other,"Effects of Dynamic Geometry System (DGS) and physical manipulatives on inquiry-based math learning remain an open question, specifically comparing their impact on immediate learning outcomes, knowledge retention, and learning interest.","Quasi-experimental research design.

Online learning, an emerging educational paradigm, has garnered considerable attention for its accessibility and convenience. Although online education platforms offer learners a high degree of freedom, they lack personalized guidance, leading to challenges such as ""Information Overload"" and ""Knowledge Loss"". These challenges primarily manifest as learners struggling to identify resources that match their preferences and needs, adversely affecting their learning efficiency and outcomes. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an exercise recommendation algorithm that combines the emerging fields of reinforcement learning and recommendation systems to help learners find suitable exercise resources. Initially, we use a knowledge tracking model to assess the potential knowledge level of learners. Following this, the Deep Q Network algorithm is utilized to modify learners' exercise records by removing unsatisfactory exercises that learners may have mistakenly selected during the learning process. Based on the modified record of exercises and the knowledge levels of learners, the algorithm recommends appropriate exercises.

165,Spatial Ability Predicts Short-Term Retention of Declarative Technical Information in Authentic Engineering Educational Settings: An Original Study with Two Conceptual Replications,"Hyland, Tomás    ; Seery, Niall    ; Buckley, Jeffrey","An association between spatial ability, particularly visualisation, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has been repeatedly demonstrated over the past four decades. Understanding this relationship is of critical importance as substantial evidence illustrates the malleability of spatial ability and that the effects of associated training interventions transfer to desirable STEM outcomes such as improved educational performance and reduced attrition rates. There currently exists a number of theories as to why spatial ability relates to STEM, such as that the nature of STEM activity is inherently spatial. However, there is a need to better understand this relationship from a cognitive perspective. This research examined the hypothesis that spatial ability is predictive of short-term retention for declarative technical information associated with engineering curricula. An original investigation in an authentic educational setting found that visualisation and interest in the lecture material were significant predictors of short-term knowledge retention. This effect was then replicated in two subsequent conceptual replication studies. Based on this predictive finding, it is theorised that increases in spatial ability may support the elongation of the knowledge forgetting curve which would have significant implications for instructional design.",European Journal of Engineering Education,other,2024,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.1080/03043797.2024.2405860,Education Research Index,"Report, Article",other,other,"There is a need to better understand the relationship between spatial ability and STEM from a cognitive perspective, specifically whether spatial ability predicts retention of declarative technical information.","An original investigation in an authentic educational setting, followed by two subsequent conceptual replication studies.",Visualisation and interest in the lecture material were significant predictors of short-term knowledge retention.

166,Comparative Effects of Dynamic Geometry System and Physical Manipulatives on Inquiry-Based Math Learning for Students in Junior High School,"Guan, Hao; Li, Jing; Rao, Yongsheng    ; Chen, Ruxian; Xu, Zhangtao","Mathematical inquiry involving hands-on activities has received increasing attention in mathematics education. Besides various customized physical teaching aids, subject-specific information technology, such as Dynamic Geometry System (DGS), finds extensive use in mathematical inquiry activities. However, effects of DGS and physical manipulatives on inquiry-based math learning remain an open question. Hence, by adopting a quasi-experimental research design, this paper aims to empirically compare the immediate learning outcomes, knowledge retention, and learning interest of seventh-grade students who explore with virtual manipulatives (i.e., the DGS) and who explore with physical manipulatives. Specifically, 131 students participated in learning activities centered on exploring pyramids and prisms. During the inquiry process, Group A (n = 33) constructed pyramids and prisms in DGS, Group B (n = 34) observed pre-made virtual models in DGS, Group C (n = 32) observed physical models, and Group D (n = 32) made physical pyramids and prisms with polymer clay and small sticks. Moreover, pretest, post-test, and delayed post-test designed according to the Van Hiele model, as well as an adapted interest questionnaire, were employed to evaluate students' performances; and collected data were analyzed by means of ANCOVA and t-test. Findings of the study revealed that in the context of construction, students employing the DGS exhibited superior immediate learning outcomes and greater knowledge retention compared to their peers who utilized physical manipulatives; while in the case of observation, the virtual and physical manipulatives yielded similar impacts on students' immediate learning outcomes, but students who involved in the DGS demonstrated higher knowledge retention.

173,Adoption and Usage of Augmented Reality-Based Virtual Laboratories Tool for Engineering Studies,"Kulkarni, Radhika; Harne, Rajat","Aim/Purpose: The study seeks to utilize Augmented Reality (AR) in creating virtual laboratories for engineering education, focusing on enhancing teaching methodologies to facilitate student understanding of intricate and theoretical engineering principles while also assessing engineering students' acceptance of such laboratories. Background: AR, a part of next-generation technology, has enhanced the perception of reality by overlaying virtual elements in the physical environment. The utilization of AR is prevalent across different disciplines, yet its efficacy in facilitating Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is limited. Engineering studies, a part of STEM learning, involves complex and abstract concepts like machine simulation, structural analysis, and design optimization; these things would be easy to grasp with the help of AR. This restriction can be attributed to their innovative characteristics and disparities. Therefore, providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing the acceptance of these technologies by students -- the primary target demographic -- and examining the impact of these factors is essential to maximize the advantages of AR while refining the implementation processes. Methodology: The primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate a tool that enriches the educational experience within engineering laboratories. Utilizing Unity game engine libraries, digital content is meticulously crafted for this tool and subsequently integrated with geo-location functionalities. The tool's user-friendly interface allows both faculty and non-faculty members of the academic institution to establish effortlessly the virtual laboratory. Subsequently, an assessment of the tool is conducted through the application of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model, involving the administration of surveys to university students to gauge their level of adaptability. Contribution: The utilization of interactive augmented learning in laboratory settings enables educational establishments to realize notable savings in time and resources, thereby achieving sustainable educational outcomes. The study is of great importance due to its utilization of student behavioral intentions as the underlying framework for developing an AR tool and illustrating the impact of learner experience on various objectives and the acceptance of AR in Engineering studies. Furthermore, the research results enable educational institutions to implement AR-based virtual laboratories to improve student experiences strategically, align with learner objectives, and ultimately boost the adaptability of AR technologies. Findings: Drawing on practice-based research, the authors showcase work samples and a digital project of AR-based Virtual labs to illustrate the evaluation of the adaptability of AR technology. Adaptability is calculated by conducting a survey of 300 undergraduate university students from different engineering departments and applying an adaptability method to determine the behavioral intentions of students. Recommendations for Practitioners: Engineering institutions could leverage research findings in the implementation of AR to enhance the effectiveness of AR technology in practical education settings. Recommendation for Researchers: The authors implement a pragmatic research framework aimed at integrating AR technology into virtual AR-based labs for engineering education. This study delves into a unique perspective within the realm of engineering studies, considering students' perspectives and discerning their behavioral intentions by drawing upon previous research on technology utilization. The research employs various objectives and learner experiences to assess their influence on students' acceptance of AR technology. Impact on Society: The use of AR in engineering institutions, especially in laboratory practicals, has a significant impact on society, supported by the UTAUT2 model. UTAUT2 model assesses factors like performance, effort expectancy, social influence, and conditions, showing that AR in education is feasible and adaptable. This adaptability helps students and educators incorporate AR tools effectively for better educational results. AR-based labs allow students to interact with complex engineering concepts in immersive settings, enhancing understanding and knowledge retention. This interactive augmented learning for laboratories saves educational institutions significant time and resources, attaining sustainable learning.

Traditional teaching, which relies on theoretical classes and manuals, does not provide sufficient interactive or practical experience, hindering the comprehension and retention of knowledge. Understanding hardware is fundamental for computer science and related fields students, as it is the basis for building and maintaining computer systems. The lack of practical knowledge in this area can result in inadequate training, limiting students’ abilities to apply theoretical concepts in real-world situations, which can affect their academic performance and job market readiness. There have been initiatives that included the use of printed manuals, video tutorials, and software simulations to teach hardware. However, these methods failed to engage students sufficiently or provide a practical and realistic learning experience. These methods can become boring and disconnected from the practical experience necessary for properly assembling computer hardware. The proposed solution is the use of an augmented reality (AR) mobile application to create an interactive and practical learning experience. The application called Build_PC was designed, and it allows students to visualize and manipulate hardware components in a virtual environment superimposed on the real world, allowing practical learning of computer assembly and operation. The main results of the research, which used volunteer students associated with control and experimental groups, show that the use of Build_PC significantly improved the understanding and retention of knowledge about computer hardware. Students who used the application demonstrated a greater ability to understand the operation of hardware components compared to those who used traditional methods. In addition, students reported greater motivation and satisfaction with the learning process. Implementing a AR-powered application in hardware education has several important implications. Firstly, it provides an effective tool to enhance understanding and knowledge retention, which can lead to better academic and professional preparation for students.

In this paper, we proposed a deep learning framework integrating expert knowledge (E-Net) for the segmentation of GODH in fundus images. This E-Net consisted of a primary network for GODH segmentation and two auxiliary networks for extraction of optic disc (OD) and blood vessels. The segmentation probability maps from the two auxiliary networks were used to improve the segmentation accuracy of GODH, via expert knowledge loss functions and attention mechanism. Moreover, we designed a weighted segmentation accuracy loss function to balance the segmentation accuracy of the target and background region, thus fully mining the substantial information in the fundus images.

Thirty-seven studies compared 3DPAM to a reference model. Thirty-three articles investigated educational performance. The main advantages were visual and haptic qualities, effectiveness for teaching, reproducibility, customizability and manipulability, time savings, integration of functional anatomy, better mental rotation ability, knowledge retention, and educator/student satisfaction. The main disadvantages were related to the design: consistency, lack of detail or transparency, overly bright colours, long printing time, and high cost.

More realistic models require access to more expensive 3D printing technologies and substantially longer design time, which would greatly increase the overall cost. Choosing an appropriate image acquisition modality is key. From a pedagogical viewpoint, 3DPAMs are effective tools for teaching anatomy, positively impacting the learning outcomes and satisfaction level. The pedagogical effectiveness of 3DPAMs seems to be best when they reproduce complex anatomical areas, and they are used by students early in their medical studies.

Design/methodology/approach It applies the knowledge-based view of the firm to the notion of the Great Resignation, reviews the extant literature and relies on secondary data. Findings The Great Resignation has created numerous knowledge-related impacts on the individual, organizational and national levels. On the individual level, because of an accelerating adoption of freelancing, the future may witness an expansion of the category of the knowledge worker and a growing need for personal knowledge management methods and information technologies. Organizational effects include knowledge loss, reduced business process efficiency, damaged intra-organizational knowledge flows, lower relational capital, lost informal friendship networks, difficulty attracting the best human capital, undermined knowledge transfer processes and knowledge leakage to competition. Countries may also witness the depletion of national human capital. Practical implications Managers should learn how to use the available human capital more efficiently; realize the importance of universal succession planning programs; automate knowledge-centric business processes; facilitate knowledge-based IT initiatives by implementing self-functioning virtual communities, including enterprise social networks; restructure organizations to optimize intra-organizational knowledge flows; adjust strategies, products and target markets based on the available human capital; and create telecommuting conditions for people with disabilities who cannot be physically present.

212,Learning with Virtual Reality Simulations: Direct versus Vicarious Instructional Experience,"Dubovi, Ilana","As virtual reality (VR) technologies have been increasingly adopted in the educational field, careful consideration and evaluation of instructional modes to support learning with VR are needed. This study focuses on evaluation of two instructional modes: direct interaction and manipulation of the VR learning environment; and the vicarious approach of observing how a novice peer and an expert learn with VR. An experimental design was utilized with two comparison conditions: direct VR interaction (n = 72) and the vicarious approach (n = 69). Participants' knowledge and emotional engagement were evaluated via self-report questionnaires. Results showed that though learning with the direct VR condition was associated with more intense emotional engagement, there was no significant difference in knowledge gains between the two study conditions. The findings suggest that each of the two instructional modes has specific instructional affordances and that the cognitive and emotional components of learning via VR should be further explored. Since learning vicariously through observing the dialogue between an expert and a peer can have immediate knowledge gains comparable to the direct VR interaction, there is an effective and more accessible opportunity for VR-based learning.

Therefore, it is vital to evaluate how smart cities are in order to put these methods into practice. To offer advice on these matters, numerous reports are created, and one of which is Smart City Index (SCI). The Institute for Management Development (IMD) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design collaborate on SCI every year (SUTD). The report evaluates how locals view the buildings and technological applications that are available in their towns. Although the study offers a thorough examination of the cities for evaluation, the city clusters should be more sensitive and not be created using strict clustering techniques. In order to address this problem, the clustering algorithms namely K-Medoids, Fuzzy C-Means, and K-Means, which outperform hard clustering approaches in terms of robustness to vagueness and knowledge retention, are used. The main goal of this study is to categorize cities using a scientific manner (clustering algorithms) based on SCI data and to present how the chosen approaches work for dealing with the associated problems.

220,Learning Critical Thinking Skills Online: Can Precision Teaching Help?,"Tan, Angel J. Y.; Davies, Jean L.; Nicolson, Roderick I.; Karaminis, Themis","Critical thinking is identified as a key educational outcome in higher education curricula; however, it is not trivial to support students in building this multifaceted skill. In this study, we evaluated a brief online learning intervention focusing on informal fallacy identification, a hallmark critical-thinking skill. The intervention used a bite-sized video learning approach, which has been shown to promote student engagement. Video-based learning was implemented within a precision teaching (PT) framework, which modulates the exposure of individual learners to the learning material to enable them to build 'fluency' in the targeted skills. In one of the learning conditions, PT was applied synergistically with domain-general problem-based training to support generalisation. The intervention consisted of two learning episodes and was administered to three groups (learning conditions) of 19 participants each: a PT fluency-based training group; a PT + group, where PT was combined with problem-based training; and a self-directed learning control group. All three groups showed comparable improvements in fallacy identification on taught (post-episode tests) and unseen materials (post-intervention assessment), with lower-scoring participants showing higher gains than high-scoring participants. The results of the knowledge retention tests a week later were also comparable between groups. Importantly, in the domain-general fallacy-identification assessment (post-intervention), the two PT groups showed higher improvements than the control group. These findings suggest that the integration of bite-sized video learning technologies with PT can improve students' critical-thinking skills. Furthermore, PT, on its own or combined with problem-based training, can improve their skill to generalise learning to novel contexts. We discuss the educational implications of our findings.",Educational Technology Research and Development,other,2023,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-023-10227-y,Education Research Index,"Report, Article",other,other,"Supporting students in building critical-thinking skills, specifically informal fallacy identification, is not trivial in higher education, and there is a need for effective interventions to improve these skills and their generalization to novel contexts.","A brief online learning intervention using bite-sized video learning within a precision teaching (PT) framework was evaluated.

Background: This work is made possible via the model's focus on advancing knowledge and understanding of a range of digital resources, and the processes and production skills to teach and produce playable educational digital content, including classroom practice and applications. Methodology: Through practice-based learning and technology as an enabler, to inform the development of this model, we proposed a mixed-mode project-based approach of study within a transdisciplinary course for Higher Education students from the first year through to the post-graduate level. Contribution: An argument is also presented for the utility of this model for upskilling Pre-service Teachers' (PSTs) pedagogical content knowledge in Technologies, which is especially relevant to the Australian curriculum context and will be broadly applicable to various educative and non-Australian settings. Findings: Supported by practice-based research, work samples and digital projects of Simulation Learning and XR developed by the authors are demonstrated to ground the discussion in examples; the discussion that is based around some of the challenges and the technical considerations, and the scope of teaching digital solutions creation is provided. Recommendations for Practitioners: We provide a flexible technologies teaching and learning model for determining content for inclusion in a course designed to provide introductory Simulation Learning and XR solution creation skills and knowledge. Recommendation for Researchers: The goal was to provide key criteria and an outline that can be adapted by academic researchers and learning designers in various higher education-based contexts of teaching and inclusive learning design focused on XR. Impact on Society: We explore how educators work with entities in various settings and contexts with different priorities, and how we recognise expertise beyond the institutional interests, beyond discipline, and explore 'what is possible' through digital technologies for social good and inclusivity.

242,Virtual Reality simulation streamlines medical training for healthcare professionals,other,"Purpose According to World Health Organization, our planet will need more than 40 million new doctors, nurses, frontline healthcare workers, and other healthcare professionals by the year 2030, which is double the current medical workforce (1). The existing training model (a master teaching a limited number of apprentices over the course of several years) is unable to meet the level of healthcare professionals needed. Empirical evidence from other industries demonstrates virtual reality (VR) technology is an effective and efficient way of improving training. Methods VR technology allows users to interact with a computer-simulated environment. VR implementation in medicine focuses on the rapid acceleration of human learning in medical training. It aims to provide technology for medical staff to reskill and upskill more effectively, without a large time investment. The combination of cognitive training in an experience-based learning virtual environment enabled by advanced VR software and hardware provides several advantages: (1) unrestricted training time, increased training access during COVID-19 restrictions; (2) remote training access: growing demand for health professionals in countries with less developed infrastructure; (3) modernizing standards: during simulated training competency evaluations for residents are performed. Results (1) Increased trainee engagement and knowledge retention (70%) compared to videos (10%) or lecturing (5%) (2) Decreased training time, 29% less OR training time due to skill transfer from VR to OR (3) Decreased training costs.

Students were taught the steps of UAV data acquisition and processing through lectures and UAV simulation videos. Students applied this knowledge by completing a laboratory exercise that used previously collected UAV data. Student knowledge retention and understanding were evaluated using an online quiz to determine the effectiveness of the education module. The average quiz score was 92%, indicating that the UAV laboratory exercise effectively taught students about UAV data acquisition and processing for natural resource research. Overall, students expressed positive opinions about the UAV education module. Student feedback indicated that the laboratory exercise was engaging, but some students would have preferred a hands-on experience for some parts of the exercise. However, in-person UAV instruction may not be accessible for all educators because of UAV cost or lack of instructor training. This study provides educators with crucial recommendations for designing UAV exercises to improve access to UAV-related educational content. This study indicates that online training can effectively introduce students to UAVs. Given the wide range of UAV uses across STEM fields, students in many STEM disciplines would benefit from UAV education.",Education Sciences,other,2022,Scholarly Journal,Undefined,other,Education Research Index,"Report, Article",other,other,"The growing need to integrate UAV training into STEM education, particularly due to the inaccessibility of in-person, hands-on UAV instruction for some educators because of cost or lack of instructor training.","Development and evaluation of a UAV education module and laboratory exercise using reusable learning objects (RLOs), lectures, UAV simulation videos, and a laboratory exercise with previously collected UAV data.

253,Green Software Process Factors: A Qualitative Study,"Siti Rohana Ahmad Ibrahim    ; Yahaya, Jamaiah    ; Hasimi Sallehudin","In the twenty-first century, the use of software is growing due to many applications requiring large and complex software. Many people do not realise that the use of software has influenced the operation of computer hardware to move indirectly as it affects the hardware’s energy consumption and carbon emissions. Previous studies focused more on models and tools to measure the impact of power consumption and energy efficiency from hardware than on software development studies. Energy consumption can be optimised by the greening software process throughout all phases of development activity. Besides, the current green software process models are more focused on environmental and economic elements and do not integrate with the waste elements in the development phase. Integrating sustainability and waste elements is essential to ensure that the development process complies with green process standards. A qualitative method is used through interviews involving eight informants from Malaysia’s public and private sectors. The objectives of the empirical study are to reveal the current practices of the green software process in industry, identify software process waste and determine green factors associated with the software process. The analysis is guided by a thematic approach using Atlas.ti 8 software. This paper describes the results from the qualitative study that consists of three main themes: best practices of a software process, nine software wastes (building the wrong feature, rework, unnecessarily complex solutions, extraneous cognitive load, psychological distress, waiting, knowledge loss, ineffective communication, delay), and six green factors (resources, people, organisational, technical, environmental, technology). The analysis findings indicate that the software industry needs elements of best practices, green practices, and software technologies in each development phase to produce a green and sustainable software process. The advancement of computing today presents technology as an essential factor in green elements to ensure that the software process is constantly updated and always green.",Sustainability; Basel,Switzerland,2022,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.3390/su141811180,"Publicly Available Content Database,Coronavirus Research Database",Journal Article,other,other,"Previous studies focused more on measuring hardware's power consumption and energy efficiency, neglecting software development's impact.

However, the current building education generally adopts paper-based learning approaches that lack hands-on experiences. Furthermore, to achieve Industrial Revolution 4.0 in line with any unforeseen pandemic, the most optimum solution is to transition from physical to technological-based building education. This paper aims to address the problems by proposing a game-based virtual reality (GBVR) for building utility inspection training. Design/methodology/approach > The feasibility of the GBVR for building the utility inspection training approach is validated on a sample of undergraduate engineering students through user experience (survey) and performance-based comparisons against traditional paper-based training method. Findings > The results show that the developed GBVR training has higher system usability in terms of visual output and knowledge retention than paper-based training due to visualisation technologies. The GBVR training method has also higher user-friendliness because of the higher motivational and engagement factors through the adoption of virtual reality and game-based learning. Research limitations/implications > GBVR training required a longer training duration and achieved a lower performance score (effectiveness) but can be improved by transitioning into hands-on tasks. This study has the potentials to be extended to vocational training platforms for competency development in the construction workforce by using cutting-edge extended reality technologies.

255,The Moderating Effects of Firm's and Industrial Co-Inventive Networks on the Relationship Between R & D Employees’ Mobility and Firm Creativity,"Tang, Chaoying1; Zhang, Gupeng2    1 School of Economics and Management, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China2 School Public Policy and Management, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Knowledge is the primary factor for firm creativity that is mostly embedded in employees. Meanwhile, R&D employee mobility is quite frequently in high technology firms. This situation suggests a critical management task of firm creativity and innovation: how to retain the knowledge of the current R&D employee and benefit from the knowledge brought by new R&D employees to improve firm creativity. Based on extant studies which found that the collaboration network correlated with employees’ knowledge retention, knowledge flow, and cognitive lock-in this article proposed that the characteristics of a firm's co-inventive network and industrial co-inventive network moderate the influence of R&D employees’ mobility on firm creativity. Empirical results based on the Chinese firms’ invention patents in the information and communication technology industry demonstrate that the highly connected firm's co-inventive networks impair the damage of R&D employees’ outward mobility to firm creativity. Moreover, the firm's low degree of centrality in the industrial co-inventive network decreases the contribution of R&D employees’ inward mobility to firm creativity, and the firm's low betweenness centrality in the industrial co-inventive network helps it obtain the benefit from R&D employees’ inward mobility.

Often, students prefer those which are available via mobile devices because it can facilitate flexibility and autonomy with their learning, more so than with traditional modalities. Although the production value of resources may be appealing to users, those that work most effectively for education align well to existing pedagogies. One such pedagogy is the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. It is a framework that can be used to facilitate the construction of educational video, that can benefit learning gain through reducing the cognitive load.Although much research has been conducted on how information should be presented in video resources, there is very limited evidence within the subject of clinical anatomy and physiology or when applying different types of educational video, such as screencasts, or interactive video. In the field of anatomy education recent approaches have sought to standardize a robust methodology to evaluate digital resources. This procedure utilizes a combination of normalized learning gain and learner perceptions to gain an accurate picture of educational impact.The current study investigated the impact of both interactive educational videos and screencasts compared with traditional teaching techniques in the challenging subjects of histology and pain physiology. A quasi-randomized, cross-sectional study was conducted with 135 medical students enrolled at the University of Southampton. Sixty fourth- and fifth-year students assessed the histology resources, and 75 second-year students assessed the pain histology resources. Participants were randomly assigned to either a text-based resource, interactive video, or screencast group. Outcomes measured were: 1. Normalized knowledge gain (and retention) assessed using one-best-answer multiple choice question tests 2. Student perceptions using 1-10 Likert-scale style questionnaires.
