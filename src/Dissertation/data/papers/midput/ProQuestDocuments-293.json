    "Abstract": "Traditional patient education often lacks personalization and engagement, potentially limiting knowledge acquisition and treatment adherence[1]. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), including voice cloning technology and large language models such as ChatGPT, offer new opportunities to deliver personalized, scalable, and interactive health education[2-3]. However, evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of different AI-based voice cloning strategies and the reliability of automated AI evaluation tools remains limited[4-5]. BACKGROUND Traditional patient education often lacks personalization and engagement, potentially limiting knowledge acquisition and treatment adherence[1]. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), including voice cloning technology and large language models such as ChatGPT, offer new opportunities to deliver personalized, scalable, and interactive health education[2-3]. However, evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of different AI-based voice cloning strategies and the reliability of automated AI evaluation tools remains limited[4-5].To evaluate the effectiveness of AI-assisted patient education integrating voice cloning and ChatGPT, to compare physician voice cloning with patient self-voice cloning, and to assess the reliability of ChatGPT as an automated evaluation tool for education outcomes. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of AI-assisted patient education integrating voice cloning and ChatGPT, to compare physician voice cloning with patient self-voice cloning, and to assess the reliability of ChatGPT as an automated evaluation tool for education outcomes.A prospective, three-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial.A total of 180 hospitalized patients requiring standardized health education were recruited from a tertiary hospital. Inclusion criteria were: age ≥18 years, clear diagnosis requiring health education, clear consciousness, and voluntary participation with informed consent. Exclusion criteria were: severe hearing impairment, severe cognitive impairment, expected hospitalization <3 days, or prior participation in similar studies.Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive (1) traditional education (control), (2) AI-assisted education using physician voice cloning, or (3) AI-assisted education using patient self-voice cloning. All groups received identical educational content with equal duration.The primary outcome was education content compliance, evaluated using ChatGPT-4 with validated prompts and verified by expert review. Secondary outcomes included knowledge retention, education satisfaction, treatment adherence, quality of life (SF-36), and psychological status (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).Participants were randomly allocated using a computer-generated random sequence. Due to the nature of the intervention, participants were not blinded; outcome assessors and data analysts were blinded to group allocation.

Due to the nature of the intervention, participants were not blinded; outcome assessors and data analysts were blinded to group allocation.Of 180 randomized participants, 174 (96.7%) completed the trial. Both AI-assisted groups demonstrated significantly higher education content compliance immediately after education compared with the control group (physician voice: 86.7 ± 7.3; self-voice: 92.5 ± 6.8 vs control: 73.2 ± 8.5; P < 0.001). The patient self-voice group showed superior knowledge retention before discharge, higher education satisfaction, and greater treatment adherence compared with both the physician voice and control groups (all P ≤ 0.02). At one-month follow-up, the self-voice group maintained improved adherence (Cohen's d = 0.74) and exhibited significantly lower anxiety and depression scores (all P ≤0.02), along with improved SF-36 quality-of-life domains. ChatGPT-based evaluations demonstrated high reliability compared with expert assessments (weighted κ = 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.91).

ChatGPT-based evaluations demonstrated high reliability compared with expert assessments (weighted κ = 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.91).This study introduces an innovative patient education model integrating AI voice cloning and ChatGPT, representing a novel approach distinct from previous studies that primarily relied on standard text-to-speech or professionally recorded content. The key innovation lies in utilizing patients' own cloned voices for health education delivery, leveraging the self-reference effect to enhance learning outcomes. Compared with prior research focusing on clinician-narrated content, this study provides the first empirical evidence that self-voice education produces superior outcomes across multiple domains including compliance, satisfaction, and psychological well-being. These findings contribute to the field by establishing a theoretical and practical framework for personalized AI-driven patient education. In real-world clinical settings, this approach offers a scalable, cost-effective solution to enhance patient engagement, particularly valuable in resource-limited environments where individualized education is challenging to deliver.

    "Abstract": "Neurosurgical education relies on rigorous training to help learners develop technical proficiency and neuroanatomical comprehension. Traditional teaching methods, such as cadaveric dissections and live surgical observations, face limitations associated with accessibility, cost, and ethical concerns. Mixed reality (MR), an emerging technology within extended reality, offers an interactive and immersive approach to surgical training. This review examines the effectiveness of MR in neurosurgical education through established adult learning theories, aiming to determine the optimal integration model for enhancing trainee skill acquisition and knowledge retention. BACKGROUND Neurosurgical education relies on rigorous training to help learners develop technical proficiency and neuroanatomical comprehension. Traditional teaching methods, such as cadaveric dissections and live surgical observations, face limitations associated with accessibility, cost, and ethical concerns. Mixed reality (MR), an emerging technology within extended reality, offers an interactive and immersive approach to surgical training. This review examines the effectiveness of MR in neurosurgical education through established adult learning theories, aiming to determine the optimal integration model for enhancing trainee skill acquisition and knowledge retention.A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane databases was conducted. The search included studies of MR applications in neurosurgical education aligned with adult learning theories. A total of 341 articles were identified, with 18 meeting the inclusion criteria after screening. Studies were categorized based on their integration of adult learning theories, including experiential learning, constructivism, behaviorism, cognitivism, and self-directed learning. Data extraction focused on MR applications, assessment metrics, and performance improvements among trainees.

Studies were categorized based on their integration of adult learning theories, including experiential learning, constructivism, behaviorism, cognitivism, and self-directed learning. Data extraction focused on MR applications, assessment metrics, and performance improvements among trainees.The review found that MR-based neurosurgical training improved spatial understanding, procedural accuracy, and trainee engagement. Experiential learning was the most frequently applied model (18 studies), followed by constructivism (15 studies), behaviorism (7 studies), and cognitivism (6 studies). Studies on cranial procedures demonstrated enhanced spatial cognition and motor skills, whereas studies exploring spinal procedures, such as pedicle screw placement, showed increased precision and greater trainee confidence. Although no studies explicitly emphasized andragogy or connectivism, MR's integration of feedback mechanisms and real-time simulation was found to facilitate skill refinement and knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "The increasing adoption of digital education, including mobile learning (mLearning), is transforming the training of future health professionals, offering advantages such as improved accessibility, timeliness, and affordability. While mLearning enhances clinical training by providing flexible access to information and supporting practical skills development, challenges such as inadequate resources and resistance from staff and patients need to be addressed for successful integration. This review aims to explore the factors for successful adoption of mLearning in clinical placements, providing valuable insights to inform best practices in its implementation. A scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Arksey and O'Malley and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology was applied. Searching 6 electronic databases plus manual searching returned 5178 articles, with 76 articles included in analysis. All studies were published between 2008 and 2024, with a significant proportion originating from Canada (n = 12), the United States (n = 12), the United Kingdom (n = 11), and Australia (n = 11). The majority of the studies involved nursing (n = 47) and medical (n = 24) students. The analysis revealed 6 facilitators and 6 barriers. It identified positive attitudes toward mobile applications, highlighting their role in enhancing education in clinical environment, organizing training, and improving patient care. However, barriers such as the absence of regulations, ethical concerns, and technical issues were also noted, along with the need to address information literacy and skills. Mapping research regarding facilitators and barriers for introducing mobile learning technologies into undergraduate education in clinical environment has helped in creating a set of solutions which are capable to ensure the success and sustainability of mLearning. These solutions should be considered at the innovation's design, implementation, and post-implementation stages to guarantee its effectiveness in education in clinical environments. This may help to enhance the learning experience, improve knowledge retention, and develop clinical skills, while providing a cost-effective solution for clinical training programs for healthcare professions. This, in turn, has positive implications for quality of care provided.The increasing adoption of digital education, including mobile learning (mLearning), is transforming the training of future health professionals, offering advantages such as improved accessibility, timeliness, and affordability.

    "Abstract": "High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training, including both technical and non-technical skills, is essential for medical students. Virtual reality (VR) offers immersive learning environments that may enhance traditional teaching methods. This study investigates the impact of a single VR session prior to an Advanced Life Support (ALS) course on knowledge and performance of basic life support skills among medical students. Background High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training, including both technical and non-technical skills, is essential for medical students. Virtual reality (VR) offers immersive learning environments that may enhance traditional teaching methods. This study investigates the impact of a single VR session prior to an Advanced Life Support (ALS) course on knowledge and performance of basic life support skills among medical students.In this single blind randomized controlled trial, 126 fourth-year medical students with prior Basic Life Support (BLS) training were assigned to either an intervention group ( n  = 66) with an additional 3-part immersive VR session covering BLS theory and practice or a control group ( n  = 60) receiving standard preparation. All participants underwent a seminar based on advanced life support principles as dictated by the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) guidelines. Theoretical knowledge was assessed via multiple-choice questionnaires at three time points (baseline, post-course, 12 weeks later). Practical skills were evaluated through an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon tests, repeated-measures ANOVA, and linear mixed models. Student evaluations were used to gauge subjective satisfaction with the scenario during teaching.

    "Abstract": "Conventional medical education faces resource constraints, including limited access to cadavers, difficulties in safely replicating high-risk scenarios, and uneven distribution of training opportunities. Virtual and augmented reality technologies address these issues by providing immersive, interactive simulations that replicate medical environments with high fidelity. Through 3D modeling, real-time rendering, and multisensory feedback, these platforms allow trainees to practice complex procedures risk-free, enhancing skill development and decision-making. Innovations in AI-driven content generation, adaptive learning, and edge computing further improve scalability and effectiveness. By overcoming physical barriers, VR/AR democratizes access to specialized training, reshaping medical education for improved skill acquisition, knowledge retention, and global collaboration.",

    "Abstract": "The lack of clinical skills in reception and obstetric risk classification among nursing students has prompted the use of innovative educational technologies. In this scenario, educational hypermedia has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing interactive learning and developing clinical reasoning. This study evaluated the effectiveness of an educational hypermedia in teaching obstetric risk reception and classification among third-year undergraduate nursing students at a private university in northeastern Brazil. This was a cluster-randomized clinical trial with 2 parallel groups (intervention and control), each with 30 participants. The intervention group used educational hypermedia after theoretical and practical classes, whereas the control group followed only traditional strategies. The primary outcome was knowledge gain, measured by pre-intervention and post-intervention tests. Both groups showed an improvement in performance, but the intervention group obtained a significantly higher average in the post-test (P=.001), with a high effect size (Cohen d=1.131), in contrast to a small effect in the control group. In addition, the students' evaluation using the LORI scale showed high satisfaction with the quality of the hypermedia (mean=4.77). The results indicate that hypermedia is an effective and complementary tool to traditional teaching, promoting greater knowledge retention and stimulating clinical reasoning in the context of obstetrics.The lack of clinical skills in reception and obstetric risk classification among nursing students has prompted the use of innovative educational technologies.

Both groups showed an improvement in performance, but the intervention group obtained a significantly higher average in the post-test (P=.001), with a high effect size (Cohen d=1.131), in contrast to a small effect in the control group. In addition, the students' evaluation using the LORI scale showed high satisfaction with the quality of the hypermedia (mean=4.77). The results indicate that hypermedia is an effective and complementary tool to traditional teaching, promoting greater knowledge retention and stimulating clinical reasoning in the context of obstetrics.",

    "Abstract": "Advances in health professions education increasingly emphasize the use of digital technologies to enhance student engagement and support diverse learning needs. In physiotherapy training, particularly in technically complex subjects like electrotherapy, conventional instruction may fall short in fostering active learning and knowledge retention. Game-based platforms such as Ren'Py offer an opportunity to integrate interactive, scenario-based learning into the curriculum. This study aimed to assess the impact of Ren'Py-based digital materials on learning outcomes by comparing conventional, digital, and hybrid teaching models in an undergraduate electrotherapy course. BACKGROUND Advances in health professions education increasingly emphasize the use of digital technologies to enhance student engagement and support diverse learning needs. In physiotherapy training, particularly in technically complex subjects like electrotherapy, conventional instruction may fall short in fostering active learning and knowledge retention. Game-based platforms such as Ren'Py offer an opportunity to integrate interactive, scenario-based learning into the curriculum. This study aimed to assess the impact of Ren'Py-based digital materials on learning outcomes by comparing conventional, digital, and hybrid teaching models in an undergraduate electrotherapy course.This single-blind, three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted between October-December 2024 at the Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation. Eighty second-year physiotherapy students who had not previously taken the course were randomly assigned via computerized sequence to one of three groups: Conventional Education Group (CEG, n = 23), Digital Education Group (DEG, n = 29), or Conventional and Digital Education Group (CaDEG, n = 28). Instructional delivery included theoretical and practical sessions, followed by theoretical and practical exams. Outcomes included exam scores, the Cognitive Load Scale, the Attitude Scale Towards the Physiotherapy Profession, and the Educational Materials Motivation Survey. The data were analyzed using SPSS 27.0 package program. The parametric ANOVA test was used for normally distributed data, and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for nonnormally distributed data. Post-hoc analyses were performed using the Bonferroni test for normally distributed data and the Dunn-Bonferroni test for non-normally distributed data. A p < 0.05 level of significance was accepted for all findings.

Post-hoc analyses were performed using the Bonferroni test for normally distributed data and the Dunn-Bonferroni test for non-normally distributed data. A p < 0.05 level of significance was accepted for all findings.Theoretical exam scores were similar between groups (CI(95%) = 0.00 to 0.07; p = 0.616), but practical exam scores were significantly different (CI(95%) = 0.03 to 0.30; p < 0.001); both CEG and CaDEG performed better than DEG (CI(95%) = 2.22 to 18.01, p = 0.007 and CI(95%)=-18.51 to -3.52, p = 0.002, respectively). In ASTPP scores, no significant difference was observed between the groups in pre-training, post-training, post-pre-training differences, and in within-group comparisons in any of the CEG, DEG and CaDEG groups (CI(95%) = 130.13 to 136.16, p = 0.858; CI(95%) = 131.91 to 137.08, p = 0.511; CI(95%)=-1.27 to 3.97, p = 0.852; CI(95%)=-4.59 to 3.63, p = 0.987; CI(95%)=-7.31 to 5.10, p = 0.335; CI(95%)=-5.22 to 0.57, p = 0.075, respectively). Cognitive load was significantly higher in the CEG group compared to DEG and CaDEG (CI(95%)=-2.04 to 0.09, p = 0.020; CI(95%)=-0.01 to 2.11, p = 0.016, respectively). IMMS scores were significantly higher in the CaDEG group than in CEG (CI(95%) = 1.77 to 30.32, p = 0.022).

IMMS scores were significantly higher in the CaDEG group than in CEG (CI(95%) = 1.77 to 30.32, p = 0.022).Face-to-face and hybrid models were more effective than digital-only instruction for developing practical skills in physiotherapy education. The hybrid model also reduced cognitive load and increased motivation. These findings suggest that integrating tools like Ren'Py into conventional instruction may enhance learning when used as a complement. Further studies with larger samples and extended durations are recommended.

    "Abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming higher education by offering accessible tools that enhance comprehension and efficiency. While AI use in clinical decision-making is expanding, little research explores how Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) students use AI to support their academic learning. Objective: The aim of the study was to describe a DNP student's experience using a generative AI tool to supplement traditional study strategies and improve learning outcomes. Methods: This case narrative outlines how Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), an AI tool, was integrated into a first-year DNP student's daily study routines for concept simplification, reinforcement through repetition, and clarification of complex content. The approach is evaluated against academic performance, clinical feedback, and alignment with the American Association of Colleges of Nursing Essentials. Results: ChatGPT improved study efficiency, enhanced understanding of complex material, and supported academic and clinical performance. The tool aligned with core nursing competencies by promoting critical thinking, personalized learning, and ethical technology use. Conclusions: When used responsibly and verified against reliable sources, AI tools can supplement traditional learning methods in nursing education. Implications for Nursing: By using AI as a study tool, graduate-level nursing students can strengthen critical thinking, improve knowledge retention, and support the development of confident, self-directed advanced practice nurses who are prepared for modern clinical practice.Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming higher education by offering accessible tools that enhance comprehension and efficiency.

    "Abstract": "Effective visualisation is crucial for interpreting and disseminating data in both professional and public domains. This study investigates the impact of colour hue and visualisation modes – static maps, short videos, and augmented reality (AR) animations – on knowledge accuracy (KA), cognitive evaluation, and emotional response using January 2022 COVID-19 data from the continental U.S. Participants (N = 105) viewed maps depicting COVID-19 cases or vaccination rates in each mode and in either red or green hues. Results indicate that negative emotional impact was greater for static compared to video mode, but only in the green condition, while KA improved for static mode in both colour conditions and for AR in the red condition. Cognitive evaluations were not significantly affected by mode or colour. A second model with KA as outcome and including surprise and cognitive evaluation as mediators showed that static mode associated with improved KA, with surprise positively associated with KA scores, but only in video mode. The results suggest insights into effective health data visualisation strategies and the potential of AR technology for enhancing knowledge retention and engagement.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study explores the potential impact of enterprise social media (ESM) communication visibility on knowledge sabotage to reduce knowledge sabotage within organizations. Design/methodology/approach We collected data from 389 Chinese employees across three stages and used hierarchical regression analysis and the bootstrap method to test our hypotheses. Findings Communication visibility negatively affects knowledge sabotage, and the loss of knowledge power mediates the relationship between communication visibility and knowledge sabotage. Digital work connectivity strengthens the negative relationship between message transparency and loss of knowledge power but weakens the negative relationship between network translucence and loss of knowledge power. Therefore, digital work connectivity plays a dual role. Practical implications Managers can encourage employees to share their knowledge advantages through ESM and seek cross-disciplinary knowledge cooperation, which helps restrain knowledge sabotage from the source. At the same time, maintaining appropriate digital work connectivity enables employees to leverage their knowledge interaction advantages of ESM, thereby fostering their knowledge competitiveness. Originality/value This study is the first to reveal the internal mechanism (loss of knowledge power) through which ESM communication visibility affects knowledge sabotage and explores the boundary condition (digital work connectivity) impacting the effectiveness of communication visibility. It contributes to a deeper understanding of the inherent nature of knowledge sabotage from an information technology perspective and offers novel technical insights into its management.",

    "Abstract": "Power-FULL Biofilms is a 5-week, hands-on outreach workshop designed to introduce KS2 students (ages 7+) to microbiology, electricity, and renewable energy. Students build their own microbial fuel cells (MFCs) using inexpensive plastic components and then inoculate these with mud from their school playground. The MFCs are fed with a simple food source and monitored as an electroactive biofilm develops; they produce electrical current. In the final session, the MFCs are connected together to power a small electronic device, proving we can get power from the playground. This activity builds on previous outreach initiatives like Powerful Soil and Blast a Biofilm , adapting complex microbiological ideas into a fun, age-appropriate format. Sessions combine structured instruction with storytelling, vocabulary development, and hands-on experimentation. Conducting the workshop at a UK primary school showed high levels of engagement and knowledge retention. Teachers praised the balance between challenge and support, and students responded enthusiastically to using real scientific equipment and terms, a way to introduce foundational science, technology, engineering, and mathematics concepts through real-world experimentation.Power-FULL Biofilms is a 5-week, hands-on outreach workshop designed to introduce KS2 students (ages 7+) to microbiology, electricity, and renewable energy.

    "Abstract": "Background The integration of intelligent technologies in surgical nursing education offers opportunities to enhance learning outcomes and address challenges in mastering complex topics. Knowledge graphs serve as a visual and interactive learning tool. It represents a novel approach to improving systematic thinking and enhancing knowledge retention in blended teaching models. Aim This study explored nursing undergraduates’ experiences with a knowledge graph platform in surgical nursing education, focusing on perceptions of its usefulness and ease of use, factors influencing engagement, and suggestions for improvement. Methods A qualitative descriptive study approach was employed to investigate the experiences of 13 nursing students. Semi-structured interviews were conducted after completing a surgical nursing course. The interviews were guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis to identify key themes related to knowledge graph use. Results The analysis identified three main themes: (1) Developing conceptual clarity through knowledge integration, where knowledge graphs helped students build systematic thinking, discover learning pathways, and enhance post-class review efficiency; (2) Stimulating interest through enriched content, where enriched and well-organized content increased students’ interest and enthusiasm for independent study; and (3) Navigating challenges and envisioning opportunities, where participants reported technical and access limitations, a need for richer content, and requests for clearer usage guidance. Conclusion Knowledge graphs offer innovative intelligent technology integration within blended nursing education. These tools cultivate systematic thinking, enhance surgical nursing knowledge and skill development, and enrich the comprehensive learning experience. Future studies should explore sustained educational outcomes, broaden technological capabilities, and examine cross-contextual adaptability.",

Results 36 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Among them 34 reported significantly better objective learning outcomes and 29 showed more positive subjective feedback. The findings suggest that IVR is particularly effective in areas such as clinical surgery training, anatomy education, medical skill development, and nursing education. IVR demonstrates long-term effects in medical knowledge acquirement. Conclusions The systematic review reveals that IVR is particularly effective in practice-based medical education. It highlights that VR demonstrates superior long-term knowledge retention and knowledge enhancement. A comprehensive evaluation of IVR use in medical education requires additional perspectives from teachers, and consideration from the dark side of IVR, i.e., technology-induced stress and time. Future IVR implementation in medical education calls for more efforts to address challenges in user adaptability, cost, privacy and regulatory compliance.",

    "Abstract": "Background Virtual Simulation Experiments (VSE) are increasingly applied in medical education, yet their role in medical microbiology remains underexplored. This study evaluated a VSE system designed for the isolation, culture, and identification of enteric pathogens, framed by Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). Methods Ninety medical students were randomly assigned to either a VSE group or a traditional teaching group. Outcomes were assessed through operational skill and knowledge tests, supplemented by qualitative feedback. Results The VSE group achieved higher scores in operational skills (89.6 ± 5.2 vs. 81.8 ± 6.3, p  < 0.01) and knowledge retention (87.4 ± 4.4 vs. 81.8 ± 5.0, p  < 0.01). Students reported that VSE’ immersive environment and instant feedback enhanced satisfaction and autonomy, aligning with SDT. Conclusions VSE significantly improved learning outcomes in medical microbiology and promoted intrinsic motivation. These findings provide empirical support for integrating VSE into medical curricula and highlight the need for further research on its long-term and broader educational impact.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) in healthcare education offers innovative ways to enhance collaborative learning and improve patient safety. This narrative review examines the synergistic impact of AI-powered virtual reality (VR) simulations, such as those used in surgical training and patient communication, on knowledge acquisition, clinical skill development, and collaborative competencies among healthcare students. It also explores long-term knowledge retention, ethical considerations within virtual scenarios, and the psychological impact of high-stakes simulations on learner resilience. Methods This review is distinguished by its exhaustive literature search, which spanned PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, and other pertinent databases, to identify studies published between 2005 and 2024. The distinct focus on AI and VR interventions in healthcare education, particularly those with outcomes related to interdisciplinary learning or patient safety, distinguishes this review. Data were thematically analyzed across domains, including adaptive learning, technical skill development, teamwork, patient safety, and ethics. Results The findings of this review carry significant practical implications. Five key themes emerged: adaptive learning ( n  = 17), immersive skill development ( n  = 10), teamwork enhancement ( n  = 10), patient safety ( n  = 18), and ethical considerations ( n  = 21). These themes underscore the potential of AI and VR in healthcare education. AI-driven adaptive systems enabled personalized VR training, enhancing engagement and knowledge retention. Real-time AI feedback during simulations improved decision-making in safe, controlled environments. Interdisciplinary team simulations enhanced communication and collaboration, which are crucial for effective clinical care. Ethical modules embedded in VR scenarios promoted moral reasoning. Several studies also reported increased learner confidence in performing clinical procedures following VR training, suggesting enhanced preparedness for practice. Conclusion The integration of AI and VR holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare education, fostering personalized, immersive, and ethically informed learning. These technologies enhance technical proficiency and equip students with the complex demands of modern clinical practice. Strategic implementation can contribute to error reduction, improved patient outcomes, and a culture of safety. However, the journey is not over. Continued research is crucial for assessing the long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of these educational innovations, as well as for keeping pace with the rapidly evolving field of AI and VR in healthcare education.",

    "Abstract": "Background Active learning approaches that promote participation, critical thinking, and practical competency are becoming more and more necessary in medical and nursing education. Virtual reality (VR) and gamification, especially in the context of escape rooms, have become popular instructional technology in response to these issues. The interactive, scenario-based learning environments provided by these tools encourage motivation, teamwork, and decision-making. The impact and transformative possibilities of incorporating virtual reality and gamified escape rooms into medical and nursing education are examined in this paper. Methods The use of virtual reality (VR), gamification, and escape rooms in medical and nursing education was investigated using a thorough narrative literature review. In order to give a comprehensive and holistic overview of new subjects, this method was selected. Keywords like “escape room,” “digital escape room,” “online escape room,” “gamification,” “game-based education,” “virtual reality in medical education,” “medical student,” “nursing education,” “nursing student,” and “nursing staff” were used in the January 10, 2025, search across Web of Science, PubMed, ERIC, and Scopus. English-language publications from the past ten years that addressed virtual reality, gamification, or escape rooms in medical or nursing education were included in the inclusion criteria. Non-relevant papers, non-peer-reviewed literature, and research with unclear methodology or no empirical data were among the exclusion criteria. 25 studies were chosen for a thorough assessment after a rigorous screening process based on methodological rigor and relevance. Results The total number of retrieved articles in Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science on January 10, 2025, was 172. After removing 64 duplicate articles, 108 papers were screened by experts. After this investigation, 25 articles were extensively reviewed for the results section. The findings from the selected studies can be categorized into four main areas: enhancing clinical decision-making, improving teamwork and collaboration, increasing knowledge retention and engagement, and reducing stress in high-pressure scenarios. These studies, summarized in Table 1, highlight the effectiveness of escape rooms and VR-based training in medical and nursing education, particularly in emergency medicine, pharmacy, radiology, internal medicine, and psychiatry. Conclusion The integration of VR and gamified escape rooms in healthcare education presents a promising approach to improving clinical training and competency development among medical students, nursing students, and healthcare professionals. The findings underscore the need for further research and implementation of these tools to enhance experiential learning and optimize medical education outcomes. By leveraging gamification and VR simulations, medical training programs can bridge educational gaps and improve patient care delivery in both traditional and remote learning environments.

    "Abstract": "Background Generative AI technologies offer significant opportunities to enhance orthodontic education by improving knowledge retention, clinical decision-making, and skills training. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact of generative AI tools in orthodontic education, focusing on knowledge retention, decision-making, and practical skills. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, ERIC, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore from January 2010 to December 2023. Studies evaluating the integration of generative AI in dental and orthodontic education were included. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, with the GRADE approach used to evaluate evidence quality. Results Generative AI improved knowledge retention and clinical decision-making through adaptive learning pathways and real-time feedback. Barriers included limited faculty training, technical infrastructure deficits, and educator resistance. Conclusions Generative AI holds transformative potential for orthodontic education but requires addressing practical and ethical challenges. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to validate long-term impact and explore integration strategies.",

    "Abstract": "This study reviews the literature on board games for collaborative learning in science education, analysing 76 articles from 2000 to 2024. It examines research methodologies, data collection tools, sample sizes, and data analysis methods, focusing on subject areas and types of board games used. Key findings reveal a predominance of physical (paper‐based) board games. Research methodologies were primarily quantitative, with descriptive analysis being the most common approach, typically employing varied sample sizes (median 48.5 participants). Evidence suggests that board games can enhance scientific knowledge acquisition, improve student engagement, and foster collaborative skills. However, the review identifies critical limitations in the existing literature, including a prevalence of small sample sizes, a lack of long‐term effectiveness studies, and insufficient focus on specific game mechanisms. Future research should prioritise investigating game mechanisms, explicitly measuring collaborative learning outcomes, improving methodological rigour, and assessing long‐term impacts on knowledge retention. Context and implications Rationale for this study: This systematic review addresses a gap by synthesising empirical evidence on board games for collaborative learning in science education, providing a comprehensive overview of existing research. Why the new findings matter: Our findings quantify board games' positive impacts on science knowledge, engagement, and collaborative skills, while identifying methodological gaps and crucial future research directions. Implications for educational institutions, policymakers, educators and learners: This review highlights effective practices for integrating board games into science education, guiding the creation of more engaging and impactful collaborative learning experiences. For researchers: It identifies critical gaps in the literature, emphasising the need for studies on specific game mechanisms, long‐term effectiveness, enhanced methodological rigour (e.g. control groups, inferential statistics), and exploration across diverse populations and digital technologies. This provides a roadmap for future investigations to deepen our understanding and optimise the integration of board games.",

    "Abstract": "This study informs the design of VR-based training in technical education by demonstrating that high immersion can impose cognitive costs for novice learners. Educators and developers can apply these insights to sequence VR after foundational instruction and incorporate cognitive load-aware design features such as signaling and guided narration. The results support using VR as a complementary tool within blended learning frameworks, helping institutions and industry trainers enhance learner focus, retention, and practical skill development while minimizing cognitive overload. As immersive technologies increasingly permeate education and professional training, their cognitive implications for novice learners remain underexplored. This study examines the relative effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-based instruction compared with conventional teaching modalities in a controlled experimental setting. A total of 106 undergraduate medical students with no prior technical experience were randomly assigned to one of three instructional conditions: (1) PowerPoint-based presentation, (2) real-person demonstration, or (3) immersive VR simulation of a five-axis CNC machine. Participants’ cognitive ability was assessed using Raven’s Progressive Matrices, and their learning styles were measured via the Honey and Mumford questionnaire. Immediate knowledge retention was evaluated through a 20-item multiple-choice test. Results revealed a significant main effect of instructional method on post-test performance ( p < 0.001), with the real-person group achieving the highest mean score, followed by PowerPoint and VR groups. IQ was a significant predictor of performance across conditions but did not moderate the effect of instructional method. Gender and learning-style preferences showed no meaningful associations with learning outcomes. The findings suggest that, for novice learners engaging with complex technical content, immersive VR may impose additional cognitive demands that hinder immediate knowledge acquisition. These results contribute empirical support to Cognitive Load Theory and the Cognitive Affective Model of Immersive Learning, emphasizing the need for careful instructional design and cognitive scaffolding in VR-based education.",

    "Full text": "1. Introduction Technological advancements have revolutionized the way knowledge is delivered and acquired, with immersive virtual reality (VR) emerging as one of the most promising educational innovations. VR enables learners to interact with realistic 3D environments that replicate real-world contexts, potentially enhancing engagement, spatial understanding, and experiential learning [1,2,3]. In technical and engineering education, VR allows students to visualize complex machinery and processes that are otherwise difficult to access physically, such as manufacturing systems, medical equipment, or laboratory procedures [4].",
    "2.4. Individual Differences": "Cognitive Ability and Learning Styles 2.4.1. Cognitive Ability (IQ) Cognitive ability, particularly fluid intelligence, influences how learners process and retain new information [24]. In multimedia learning contexts, high-IQ learners tend to benefit more from complex, self-directed environments because they can allocate cognitive resources efficiently [25]. When applied to VR, this implies that IQ may moderate the impact of immersion—high-ability learners may thrive, while low-ability learners may experience cognitive overload. However, few VR studies have explicitly tested this moderation effect, leaving a significant empirical gap.",
    "Instructional phase": "Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three methods (VR, PowerPoint, or real-person). PowerPoint group: received collective instruction in a computer laboratory.",
    "Real-person group": "taught in groups of five in the engineering laboratory with the physical CNC machine.",
    "VR group": "instructed individually using the Meta Quest 3 headset.",
    "3. . Assessment phase": "Immediately following the instructional phase, all participants completed the 20-item knowledge test via Google Forms, administered concurrently for the three groups.",
    "4.3. Primary Analysis": "Effect of Instructional Method (RQ1) An omnibus one-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant main effect of the instructional method on immediate knowledge retention score: F(2, 103) = 49.08, p < 0.001. The effect size was large, with η p 2 = 0.49 and ω 2 = 0.48, indicating that the instructional method accounted for approximately 48% of the variance in test scores (Table 2).",
    "4.4. Covariate Analysis": "Controlling for IQ (RQ4) An ANCOVA controlling for IQ as a covariate was conducted. Results showed that the instructional method remained highly significant: F(2, 102) = 49.35, p < 0.001, with partial eta squared (ηp 2 ) = 0.49 and omega squared (ω 2 ) = 0.44. The covariate, IQ, was also a significant predictor of performance: F(1, 102) = 16.74, p < 0.001 (Table 4).",
    "PowerPoint": "adjusted M = 15.82",
    "VR": "adjusted M = 10.18",
    "4.5. Moderation Analysis": "Method × IQ Interaction (RQ4) To examine whether cognitive ability moderated the effect of the instructional method, a Method × IQ interaction term was added to the model. The interaction was not significant (F(2, 100) = 0.47, p = 0.628; Table 5), indicating that IQ did not differentially influence performance across instructional methods. The standardized regression coefficient for the interaction term (Method: PowerPoint × IQ) was β = −0.02 (95% CI: −0.23 to 0.19), and for the interaction term (Method: VR × IQ) was β = 0.07 (95% CI: −0.15 to 0.29). Both confidence intervals contained zero, supporting the conclusion that there was no significant interaction between instructional method and IQ. In other words, higher cognitive ability was associated with higher test scores generally, but the magnitude of this relationship was similar for all three instructional approaches.",
    "5.5. Individual Differences": "IQ and Learning Style Cognitive ability (IQ) emerged as a significant predictor of performance across all groups, consistent with prior research linking fluid intelligence to information processing efficiency [24]. However, the absence of a method × IQ interaction indicates that cognitive ability influenced outcomes similarly across instructional formats. Thus, while high-IQ learners performed better overall, they did not benefit disproportionately from immersive or traditional methods.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge resources are a critical element of firms’ core competitiveness. Many firms have suffered significant losses due to their failure to address the issue of knowledge loss, which has become a major challenge affecting their survival and development. To prevent and manage technical knowledge loss in firms, this study proposes an invulnerability analysis model for the firms’ technical knowledge network (FTKN) is first proposed based on complex networks. Key invulnerability metrics such as network connectivity, average risk path, and network risk efficiency are defined according to the unique characteristics of FTKN. Besides, the invulnerability of FTKN is analyzed based on the simulation analysis of random attacks and deliberate attacks. Additionally, a node importance evaluation method is introduced, incorporating factors such as degree value, betweenness centrality, efficiency, and the contributions of adjacent nodes. To enhance the survivability of FTKN, the network structure is optimized through redundant design. Simulation results demonstrate that external deliberate attacks and technical blockades cause more damage to the system compared to attacks on strongly correlated technologies. From a short-term perspective, prioritizing the protection of nodes with high betweenness can greatly improve the invulnerability of the network. Conversely, from a long-term perspective, the protection strategy of firms for moderate technology nodes is more conducive to the connectivity of the entire technology evolution network. Firms should adopt strategies such as redundancy backup of key technologies/equipment, classified protection of technical talents, and establishment of technical knowledge security early warning control mechanisms to enhance the survivability of firms’ technical systems.",

    "Abstract": "The traditional use of cadaveric dissection in Human Anatomy education for Physician Assistant students has been increasingly challenged by the need for greater clinical relevance, flexibility, and cost efficiency. In response, our program transitioned to a modernized anatomy curriculum incorporating virtual anatomy tools and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to enhance learning and better prepare students for clinical practice. INTRODUCTION The traditional use of cadaveric dissection in Human Anatomy education for Physician Assistant students has been increasingly challenged by the need for greater clinical relevance, flexibility, and cost efficiency. In response, our program transitioned to a modernized anatomy curriculum incorporating virtual anatomy tools and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to enhance learning and better prepare students for clinical practice.We replaced cadaveric dissection with a combination of the Virtual Human Dissector, Sectra Anatomy Table, and POCUS. Implementation strategies included structured faculty development workshops, hands-on training sessions, and early communication with incoming students. Anatomy instruction was redesigned to integrate clinical imaging and real-time ultrasound scanning to promote active learning and application of anatomical knowledge.

    "Abstract": "As an emerging technology, virtual reality (VR) is being widely used in the field of safety training. However, a potential drawback arises when the learning theory is weakly considered during the development of safety training models. This oversight may result in several defects, such as a lack of alignment with training priorities and needs, ultimately affecting trainees' learning outcomes and diminishing safety awareness. To address this issue, this study introduces a systematic framework that integrates Bloom's learning taxonomy with VR safety training model development, named the VR Safety Training Goal Taxonomy Framework (VR-Safety-TGT). VR-Safety-TGT provides a comprehensive method for safety trainers and VR model developers to communicate and understand each other's perspectives. Specifically, it assists VR model developers in better-aligning safety training learning objectives. The efficacy of VR-Safety-TGT is examined through a pilot study involving a sample of 91 university students. The students were divided into three groups, each subjected to one of the following training modalities: slideshow-based training, traditional VR training, and VR-Safety-TGT training. The experimental results reveal that the VR-Safety-TGT group exhibits a significant advantage compared to the other two groups. VR-Safety-TGT demonstrates superior outcomes in terms of knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, self-efficacy, and users’ acceptance of technology.",

    "Abstract": "Certainty-based marking (CBM) requires students to indicate their certainty levels alongside their answers. CBM has been shown to enhance self-assessment and metacognitive awareness. This study aimed to explore the implementation of CBM in multiple-choice assessments in physiology. The CBM assessment tool was developed with an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant, Claude 3.5, with prompts focused on functional rather than technical requirements. The assessment consisted of 15 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), which were administered as a pretest and posttest during a small group teaching session to first-year medical students. Following the assessment, students completed a survey to evaluate their perceptions regarding the format, knowledge-gap identification, and overall acceptability. Answers from 195 students were analyzed, and significant improvements were observed in performance measures and certainty indices from the pretest to the posttest. Most students (80.9%) found the certainty scale beneficial, and 78.3% changed their answers after reflecting on their certainty. CBM demonstrated metacognitive benefits, with 86.4% of students better recognizing their knowledge gaps and 85.8% feeling more aware of their learning progress. About 73% of students preferred the CBM format and expressed greater engagement (82.8%) than traditional MCQs. CBM implemented through a web-based platform functioned as an assessment tool and an instructional intervention that enhanced students' metacognitive awareness and self-monitoring skills in physiology education. Our study focused on a single physiology topic and showed improvements in knowledge retention and certainty calibration. However, further longitudinal studies across multiple topics are needed to determine whether students maintain these self-assessment skills over time.

    "Abstract": "The integration of intelligent technologies in surgical nursing education offers opportunities to enhance learning outcomes and address challenges in mastering complex topics. Knowledge graphs serve as a visual and interactive learning tool. It represents a novel approach to improving systematic thinking and enhancing knowledge retention in blended teaching models. BACKGROUND The integration of intelligent technologies in surgical nursing education offers opportunities to enhance learning outcomes and address challenges in mastering complex topics. Knowledge graphs serve as a visual and interactive learning tool. It represents a novel approach to improving systematic thinking and enhancing knowledge retention in blended teaching models.This study explored nursing undergraduates' experiences with a knowledge graph platform in surgical nursing education, focusing on perceptions of its usefulness and ease of use, factors influencing engagement, and suggestions for improvement. AIM This study explored nursing undergraduates' experiences with a knowledge graph platform in surgical nursing education, focusing on perceptions of its usefulness and ease of use, factors influencing engagement, and suggestions for improvement.A qualitative descriptive study approach was employed to investigate the experiences of 13 nursing students. Semi-structured interviews were conducted after completing a surgical nursing course. The interviews were guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis to identify key themes related to knowledge graph use. METHODS A qualitative descriptive study approach was employed to investigate the experiences of 13 nursing students. Semi-structured interviews were conducted after completing a surgical nursing course. The interviews were guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis to identify key themes related to knowledge graph use.The analysis identified three main themes: (1) Developing conceptual clarity through knowledge integration, where knowledge graphs helped students build systematic thinking, discover learning pathways, and enhance post-class review efficiency; (2) Stimulating interest through enriched content, where enriched and well-organized content increased students' interest and enthusiasm for independent study; and (3) Navigating challenges and envisioning opportunities, where participants reported technical and access limitations, a need for richer content, and requests for clearer usage guidance. RESULTS The analysis identified three main themes: (1) Developing conceptual clarity through knowledge integration, where knowledge graphs helped students build systematic thinking, discover learning pathways, and enhance post-class review efficiency; (2) Stimulating interest through enriched content, where enriched and well-organized content increased students' interest and enthusiasm for independent study; and (3) Navigating challenges and envisioning opportunities, where participants reported technical and access limitations, a need for richer content, and requests for clearer usage guidance.Knowledge graphs offer innovative intelligent technology integration within blended nursing education. These tools cultivate systematic thinking, enhance surgical nursing knowledge and skill development, and enrich the comprehensive learning experience. Future studies should explore sustained educational outcomes, broaden technological capabilities, and examine cross-contextual adaptability. CONCLUSION Knowledge graphs offer innovative intelligent technology integration within blended nursing education.

    "Abstract": "Immersive virtual reality (IVR) based on head-mounted displays (HMD), can construct virtual learning environments for medical education. This study aims to explore the application and effectiveness of IVR in medical education. INTRODUCTION Immersive virtual reality (IVR) based on head-mounted displays (HMD), can construct virtual learning environments for medical education. This study aims to explore the application and effectiveness of IVR in medical education.This review followed the PRISMA guidelines and searched the databases of Web of Science, Springer Link, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Science Direct for controlled experimental studies published between January 1 2017 and October 1, 2025 on the application of IVR to medical education. METHODS This review followed the PRISMA guidelines and searched the databases of Web of Science, Springer Link, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Science Direct for controlled experimental studies published between January 1 2017 and October 1, 2025 on the application of IVR to medical education.36 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Among them 34 reported significantly better objective learning outcomes and 29 showed more positive subjective feedback. The findings suggest that IVR is particularly effective in areas such as clinical surgery training, anatomy education, medical skill development, and nursing education. IVR demonstrates long-term effects in medical knowledge acquirement. RESULTS 36 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Among them 34 reported significantly better objective learning outcomes and 29 showed more positive subjective feedback. The findings suggest that IVR is particularly effective in areas such as clinical surgery training, anatomy education, medical skill development, and nursing education. IVR demonstrates long-term effects in medical knowledge acquirement.The systematic review reveals that IVR is particularly effective in practice-based medical education. It highlights that VR demonstrates superior long-term knowledge retention and knowledge enhancement. A comprehensive evaluation of IVR use in medical education requires additional perspectives from teachers, and consideration from the dark side of IVR, i.e., technology-induced stress and time. Future IVR implementation in medical education calls for more efforts to address challenges in user adaptability, cost, privacy and regulatory compliance. CONCLUSIONS The systematic review reveals that IVR is particularly effective in practice-based medical education.

    "Abstract": "This study examines the impact of Napkin AI, a generative artificial intelligence tool, on student learning outcomes and knowledge retention via creative mind mapping. The research model, which combines the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) with the Information Adoption Model (IAM), comprises six principal independent variables: Social Influence, Learning Support Environment, Ease of Use, Perceived Benefit, Information Quality of Mind Mapping, and Usefulness of Mind Mapping. Mediating variables comprise Behavioral Intention to Use, Actual Use of Mind Mapping, and Cognitive Engagement in Mind Mapping, while Knowledge Retention and Learning Outcome serve as dependent variables. The study employed a quantitative approach with a sample of 570 Vietnamese university students majoring in STEM. Data analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with IBM SPSS 25 and AMOS 24. The model exhibited a satisfactory fit ( χ ²/ df  = 1.906, GFI = 0.889, CFI = 0.935, TLI = 0.929, RMSEA = 0.040, PCLOSE = 1.000), with all direct routes being statistically significant ( p  < 0.001 to p  = 0.037). The findings underscore the significance of user perception and involvement in improving the educational efficacy of AI‐driven mind mapping tools, providing practical implications for technology integration in higher education.",

    "Abstract": "Sports injuries represent a growing global health challenge, placing substantial demands on healthcare systems and requiring multidisciplinary management. As orthopaedic sports trauma becomes increasingly complex, high-quality education and standardised training are essential to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes. This narrative review aims to analyse current educational models and training pathways in orthopaedic sports injury management worldwide, evaluate the role of technological innovations, and highlight opportunities for international collaboration to enhance clinical practice and education. A wide spectrum of training methods is currently employed, ranging from traditional time-based models to modern competency-based curricula. Innovations such as virtual and augmented reality, simulation-based learning, and e-learning have demonstrated promising results in surgical skill acquisition and knowledge retention. International fellowships and consensus frameworks further contribute to the harmonisation of training standards. However, disparities persist in access to educational resources, healthcare infrastructure, and implementation of new technologies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. To meet the demands of contemporary orthopaedic sports medicine, educational strategies must evolve through global collaboration, integration of emerging technologies, and commitment to equity. Standardised, multidisciplinary, and evidence-informed training models are needed to ensure optimal patient care and professional competence across diverse healthcare environments.Sports injuries represent a growing global health challenge, placing substantial demands on healthcare systems and requiring multidisciplinary management.

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates an AI-guided atomization sensing system designed to integrate adaptive health education into vocational physical education. A quasi-experimental design was conducted with 356 participants allocated to either an intervention group (n = 178) or a control group (n = 178). The system used wearable atomization sensors (monitoring respiratory patterns, ambient temperature, and motion) connected to an AI engine that applied rule-based and machine-learning logic to adjust instructional content in real time-for example, reducing complexity or switching to audiovisual demonstrations when signs of fatigue were detected. Sessions were delivered in classroom settings twice per week for six weeks, with surveys administered immediately before and after the intervention. Five outcomes were assessed using validated instruments: knowledge retention, engagement, behavioral intention, self-efficacy, and technology acceptance. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, paired-sample t-tests, Pearson correlations, and χ 2  tests, with results reported as F(df1, df2), p, η 2 , and 95% confidence intervals where applicable. The intervention group achieved significantly greater improvements than the control group in knowledge retention (Δ = +21.7 vs. +10.6; F(1, 354) = 46.21, p < 0.001, η 2  = 0.21), engagement (F(1, 354) = 39.87, p < 0.001, η 2  = 0.18), behavioral intention (F(1, 354) = 42.55, p < 0.001, η 2  = 0.19), self-efficacy (F(1, 354) = 27.63, p < 0.001, η 2  = 0.13), and technology acceptance (F(1, 354) = 35.12, p < 0.001, η 2  = 0.17).

    "Abstract": "Objective: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA), a key technology that integrates computer vision and natural language processing to assist in clinical diagnosis, possesses significant potential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. However, its development is constrained by two major bottlenecks: weak few-shot generalization capability stemming from the scarcity of high-quality annotated data and the problem of catastrophic forgetting when continually learning new knowledge. Existing research has largely addressed these two challenges in isolation, lacking a unified framework. Methods: To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel Evolvable Clinical-Semantic Alignment (ECSA) framework, designed to synergistically solve these two challenges within a single architecture. ECSA is built upon powerful pre-trained vision (BiomedCLIP) and language (Flan-T5) models, with two innovative modules at its core. First, we design a Clinical-Semantic Disambiguation Module (CSDM), which employs a novel debiased hard negative mining strategy for contrastive learning. This enables the precise discrimination of \"hard negatives\" that are visually similar but clinically distinct, thereby significantly enhancing the model's representation ability in few-shot and long-tail scenarios. Second, we introduce a Prompt-based Knowledge Consolidation Module (PKC), which acts as a rehearsal-free non-parametric knowledge store. It consolidates historical knowledge by dynamically accumulating and retrieving task-specific \"soft prompts,\" thus effectively circumventing catastrophic forgetting without relying on past data. Results: Extensive experimental results on four public benchmark datasets, VQA-RAD, SLAKE, PathVQA, and VQA-Med-2019, demonstrate ECSA's state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance. Specifically, ECSA achieves excellent overall accuracies of 80.15% on VQA-RAD and 85.10% on SLAKE, while also showing strong generalization with 64.57% on PathVQA and 82.23% on VQA-Med-2019. More critically, in continual learning scenarios, the framework achieves a low forgetting rate of just 13.50%, showcasing its significant advantages in knowledge retention. Conclusions: These findings validate the framework's substantial potential for building robust and evolvable clinical decision support systems.Objective: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA), a key technology that integrates computer vision and natural language processing to assist in clinical diagnosis, possesses significant potential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency and accuracy.

    "Abstract": "Educational virtual environments (EVEs), constructed through virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), serve as digital learning spaces that provide crucial support for applying human-machine collaborative learning in science education. In science education, knowledge retention is the foundation for students to understand complex scientific concepts and to conduct further inquiry-based practices, directly influencing the long-term development of scientific literacy. However, there remains academic debate regarding whether EVE-based human-machine collaborative learning can effectively enhance knowledge retention, and its core mechanisms have yet to be systematically clarified. This study employs a meta-analysis approach to synthesize 80 experimental and quasi-experimental studies (including 88 effect sizes) conducted between 2014 and 2024, examining the impact of EVEs-based human-machine collaborative learning on science learners' knowledge retention. The results indicate that compared with traditional learning methods, EVEs-based human-machine collaborative learning has significant potential to improve knowledge retention. Although no statistically significant differences were found across moderating variables such as educational level and technology type, environments built with VR technology, high school contexts, operational learning, and presentation-based instructional approaches demonstrated more pronounced effects on knowledge retention. Subgroup analysis of instructional methods further revealed that their effectiveness is moderated by factors such as testing formats and educational levels. Accordingly, researchers and educational practitioners are encouraged to adopt systematic thinking in designing instructional practices, explore effective teaching methods, and apply diversified assessments to continuously monitor long-term impacts. This study aims to provide both theoretical insights and practical guidance for science educators to optimize EVEs-based instructional strategies and enhance knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Alternate abstract: Purpose: Public awareness of fluoride, particularly regarding its presence and effects in cultural heritage and broader contexts, remains low. Digital communication is an increasingly vital approach for preserving, disseminating, and providing access to cultural heritage. Alternate abstract: Methods: This study develops an intangible cultural heritage visual narrative framework based on the digital communication of cultural heritage. Through the integration of multimodal technologies and immersive interactive design, it achieves accurate communication of fluoride knowledge. Alternate abstract: Results: The technical approach centered on 3D laser scanning, hyperspectral imaging, and multispectral analysis, models intangible cultural heritage items involving fluoride craftsmanship. Combining this with a database of material composition spectra, a digital correlation model is developed. This study significantly improves users' depth of process understanding (mean score of 4.26/5), average health risk identification accuracy (90.2%), and average knowledge retention (77.2%), while also promoting long-term health behavior change. Alternate abstract: Conclusions: Digital communication of cultural heritage can serve as an innovative tool for public health education, enhancing the comprehensibility of scientific knowledge and its effectiveness in behavioral transformation through cultural context.",

    "Abstract": "Multimedia learning effectiveness varies widely across cultural contexts and individual learner characteristics, yet existing educational technologies lack computational frameworks that predict and optimize these interactions. This study introduces the Multimedia Integration Impact Assessment Model (MIIAM), a machine learning framework integrating cognitive style detection, cultural background inference, multimedia complexity optimization, and ensemble prediction into a unified architecture. MIIAM was validated with 493 software engineering students from Zimbabwe and South Africa through the analysis of 4.1 million learning interactions. The framework applied Random Forests for automated cognitive style classification, hierarchical clustering for cultural inference, and a complexity optimization engine for content analysis, while predictive performance was enhanced by an ensemble of Random Forests, XGBoost, and Neural Networks. The results demonstrated that MIIAM achieved 87% prediction accuracy, representing a 14% improvement over demographic-only baselines ( p < 0.001). Cross-cultural validation confirmed strong generalization, with only a 2% accuracy drop compared to 11–15% for traditional models, while fairness analysis indicated substantially reduced bias (Statistical Parity Difference = 0.08). Real-time testing confirmed deployment feasibility with an average 156 ms processing time. MIIAM also optimized multimedia content, improving knowledge retention by 15%, reducing cognitive overload by 28%, and increasing completion rates by 22%. These findings establish MIIAM as a robust, culturally responsive framework for adaptive multimedia learning environments.",

    "Full text": "1. Introduction Machine learning has fundamentally transformed academic institutions worldwide, enabling sophisticated approaches to personalized learning and outcome prediction [1]. Institutions across diverse global settings increasingly rely on data-driven methods to understand student behavior and optimize learning experiences [2]. However, multimedia-enhanced eLearning environments continue to demonstrate inconsistent effectiveness across different settings, particularly when deployed in culturally diverse environments spanning developed and developing nations [3,4].",
    "Cultural Features ( C )": "Cultural values (e.g., individualism–collectivism, uncertainty avoidance), communication style (high vs. low cultural patterns), preferred modalities [49].",
    "Design Features ( M )": "Complexity (information density, cognitive load), modality mix (text, audio, video, interactive), temporal design (sequence, pacing), interactivity level [50].",
    "where": "L , C , M = input feature vectors representing learner, cultural, and design characteristics",
    "Objective": "Learn a predictive function f as defined in Equation (1) that: Maximizes accuracy and generalization across cultural backgrounds [51]",
    "Feature Engineering": "The success of boundary-aware prediction depends critically on effective feature engineering that captures both individual characteristics and their interactions [47]. The complete feature space can be expressed as: (5) X   =   L   ∪   C   ∪   M   ∪   I ( L , C , M )",
    "Interaction Modeling": "The prediction function must capture higher-order interactions between feature domains [48]. The interaction terms can be formally defined as: (6) I ( L , C , M )   =   { L   ×   C ,   L   ×   M ,   C   ×   M ,   L   ×   C   ×   M }",
    "Fairness Requirements": "The prediction system must maintain equitable performance across different cultural and demographic subgroups [25]. This requirement can be formalized as: (7) m i n i m i z e   L ( f )   +   λ   F ( f )",
    "H1": "Boundary-aware models (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) using the complete feature space from Equation (5) outperform baselines in R 2 , RMSE, F1-score.",
    "RQ2": "Cross-Cultural Generalization Which algorithms generalize best across diverse cultural datasets when using the feature framework from Equations (1)–(6)?",
    "H2": "Ensemble approaches with cultural feature weighting reduce algorithmic bias and improve subgroup parity metrics compared to models that ignore the interaction terms defined in Equation (6).",
    "RQ3": "Real-Time Adaptive Optimization: Can online optimization improve delivery in real time using the predictive framework established in Equation (1)?",
    "H3": "Reinforcement-based adaptive systems that dynamically update the function f from Equation (1) outperform static ones in efficiency, satisfaction, and cognitive load reduction.",
    "Behavioral Data Collection": "Management systems automatically captured interaction logs including click patterns, navigation sequences, session durations, content engagement metrics, and task completion patterns. Systems recorded 4.1 million discrete interactions across diverse content types including video lectures, interactive simulations, text-based resources, and assessment materials. Data collection employed privacy-preserving techniques with participant consent and institutional approval.",
    "Cultural Assessment Protocol": "Participants completed validated cultural assessment instruments including Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions Survey and technology adoption questionnaires. Additional behavioral cultural indicators were extracted from system usage patterns including collaboration frequency, help-seeking behaviors, and content selection strategies. The combined approach captured both explicit cultural values and implicit behavioral patterns that traditional surveys might miss.",
    "Outcome Measurement": "Multiple outcome variables were measured including task performance scores, engagement metrics (time-on-task, interaction frequency), satisfaction ratings, and cognitive load indicators. Assessments employed both objective measures (completion rates, accuracy scores) and subjective measures (self-reported satisfaction, perceived difficulty) to provide comprehensive effectiveness evaluation.",
    "Content Analysis": "All materials underwent systematic analysis across text complexity (readability scores, information density), visual complexity (spatial element density, color entropy), audio complexity (speech rate, vocabulary sophistication), and interaction complexity (navigation depth, control density). This analysis provided the feature vectors required for complexity optimization engine.",
    "Cross-Validation Strategy": "Primary validation employed 5-fold cross-validation within each cultural population followed by cross-cultural validation using geographic data splitting. Models trained on Zimbabwean data were tested on South African participants and vice versa to evaluate cross-cultural generalization capabilities. This approach directly addressed the critical challenge of algorithmic bias across different cultural circumstances.",
    "Baseline Comparison": "MIIAM performance was systematically compared against multiple baseline approaches including demographic-only models, individual algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Neural Networks), and traditional assessment methods. Comparisons employed standardized metrics including accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to enable direct performance evaluation.",
    "Fairness Evaluation Protocol": "Algorithmic fairness was assessed through multiple bias metrics including Statistical Parity Difference, Equalized Odds, and Calibration measures across cultural subgroups. The protocol specifically examined whether prediction accuracy remained consistent across different cultural backgrounds, addressing concerns about algorithmic bias in technology.",
    "Real-Time Performance Validation": "Deployment validation tested system performance under authentic conditions including response time measurements, concurrent user handling, and prediction accuracy maintenance during live operation. Testing confirmed sub-200 ms prediction latency and stable performance with up to 1000 concurrent users.",
    "Learning Outcome Validation": "Content complexity assessments were validated through direct correlation with actual effectiveness measures, demonstrating that algorithmic complexity scores successfully predicted outcomes across diverse content types and learner populations. This approach validated the automated analysis against real performance data rather than subjective expert opinions.",
    "5. MIIAM": "Framework Implementation 5.1. Framework Overview MIIAM (Multimedia Integration Impact Assessment Model) is a computational framework that operationalizes assessment through integrated machine learning algorithms. Unlike existing theoretical approaches that focus on pedagogical principles, MIIAM provides an implementable algorithmic pipeline that systematically processes learner interaction data, cultural indicators, and content characteristics to predict effectiveness and optimize content delivery.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores the evolving landscape of microlearning by synthesizing peer-reviewed literature and real-world insights from instructors and learners affiliated with the online learning platform GoSkills. Using a qualitative, exploratory design, it examines how microlearning is defined, delivered, and experienced across corporate and educational settings. A review of 13 academic sources highlights key dimensions such as brevity, adaptability, targeted instructional design, and emerging digital formats. Semi-structured interviews with three instructors and three learners complement this review, offering a grounded perspective on how these concepts take shape in practice. While microlearning offers clear advantages in flexibility, motivation, and knowledge retention, its conciseness may limit deeper learning unless supported by thoughtful scaffolding or contextual aids. By drawing on recent literature and practitioner experiences, this study contributes to a better understanding of microlearning's current strengths and challenges and outlines future research directions, including its integration into broader learning ecosystems and the evolving role of AI-powered learning technologies.",

This systematic review synthesizes existing evidence on the design, implementation, and effects of gamification as part of safety training, with a particular focus on its psychological consequences, including enhanced resilience and a decrease in burnout. Another area where the review highlights barriers to implementation is cognitive overload, as well as the varying contexts across workers' demographics and industries. The most prominent gaps identified are: long-term studies are needed; gamification approaches must be tailored on a case-by-case basis; and the scope of gamification itself must expand beyond serving established manufacturers to venture into other areas of popularized production, such as agriculture and small-scale manufacturing, which have yielded minimal study results so far. These gaps will allow organizations to optimize gamification and create healthier, more enjoyable, and efficient work environments.",

    "Abstract": "This paper develops an endogenous growth model that incorporates information carrier technology, highlighting that knowledge loss during storage and low communication efficiency hinder innovation. The model identifies a turning point: prior to it, economic stagnation prevails with unchanging production technology; afterward, research and development activity drives technological progress and economic growth. On the asymptotic balanced growth path, the growth rates of information carrier technology and population act as substitutes in determining the growth rate of per capita output and the fraction of labor allocated to research and development. This model offers novel insights into unified growth theory and the mechanisms underpinning the digital economy.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid integration of Generation Z (GenZ) into medical education has highlighted the need for a transformative shift in teaching methodologies, particularly in specialized fields like orthopedics. As digital natives, GenZ learners-born between 1995 and 2010-exhibit distinct preferences for interactive, technology-driven, and self-directed learning, rendering traditional lecture-based models increasingly obsolete. This scoping review explores the pedagogical implications of GenZ's learning traits and advocates for a generational shift in orthopedic education to align with their cognitive styles and career aspirations. GenZ students thrive in environments that use digital tools such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and gamified platforms, which provide immersive, risk-free surgical simulations and improve procedural mastery. Microlearning techniques, including bite-sized videos and infographics support their shorter attention spans and improve retention of complex topics like fracture classifications and biomechanics. Collaborative learning strategies, such as team-based problem-solving and peer-teaching models, resonate with their preference for social interaction and teamwork. Additionally, adaptive learning systems powered by artificial intelligence offer personalized study plans, addressing individual strengths and weaknesses. The review demonstrates the importance of early clinical exposure and simulation-based training to bridge theory and practice, encouraging pragmatic, career-ready professionals. Educators, particularly millennials, must embrace digital fluency and mentorship to create learner-centered environments. By integrating these innovations-flipped classrooms, gamification, and on-demand resources-orthopedic education can lead to engagement, knowledge retention, and clinical preparedness. Ultimately, this generational shift is imperative to equip future orthopedic surgeons with the skills demanded by modern healthcare. Embracing technology, interactivity, and personalized learning will redefine training approaches, ensuring optimal educational outcomes and patient care for the next generation of medical professionals.The rapid integration of Generation Z (GenZ) into medical education has highlighted the need for a transformative shift in teaching methodologies, particularly in specialized fields like orthopedics.

    "Abstract": "Although virtual reality (VR) technology has been used for training in various aspects of construction, the evidence of its effectiveness in construction quality training has yet to be examined. The current study develops a novel high-fidelity VR-based defect identification training module using minute details of construction defects to assess participants’ learning experience for construction quality-related training vis-à-vis conventional classroom training. Actual quality-related defect data from two construction projects was classified, and selected defects were modeled to create three-dimensional (3D) objects in an interactive VR environment. A robust sample of 121 Indian civil engineering students were recruited and categorized into three cohorts: No Training, Classroom Training, and VR Training. The data from these participants—data from questionnaires on perceptions and conceptual knowledge and scores in an innovative VR-based defect identification testing module—were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. In a context with no previous empirical examination of VR-based education in construction quality, this study reveals that high-fidelity VR training improves participants’ conceptual knowledge of construction defects. However, VR does not show a specific advantage compared to classroom training for conceptual knowledge retention, a finding that is attributable to the similarity in training materials between VR and conventional methods. Based on a robust methodology in the current study, these results amplify a somewhat limited perspective in the literature on the effectiveness of VR-based training and cautions against the potential overestimation of the effectiveness of VR for improvements in conceptual knowledge among study participants. The most significant contributions of this study lie in advancing the VR training literature, of which only a handful of studies have focused on assessing the practical knowledge gained by training recipients. Notably, this study reveals a 32.8% improvement in VR-based practical learning outcomes for the VR cohort compared to the no-training cohort, suggesting that VR could provide hands-on skills for navigating quality-related challenges in the construction industry.",

    "Abstract": "Improving student engagement in engineering education is crucial for better learning outcomes. Engineering education integrates the latest technologies with gamification that fosters student engagement in innovative learning. Gamification involves incorporating game design elements, making learning more interactive and motivating. This paper explores gamification to transform engineering education, improving students' participation, understanding, and overall learning outcomes. Combining Edge computing with artificial intelligence will enhance the gamification of education by addressing two primary challenges: real‐time interaction and personalized service. An Edge‐AI‐driven gamification framework is proposed for improving student engagement through interactive tools like educational games, quizzes, and competitive learning environments. An algorithm related to the Edge‐AI Gamification Optimizer is proposed to improve the overall performance. Results show that the proposed framework improves student engagement by nearly 51%, performance by 30.7% and reduces cognitive load by 57%. A comparative study with traditional learning approaches shows that AI‐based gamification significantly enhances knowledge retention, boosts collaborative learning, increases student motivation, and, through statistical analysis, demonstrates a validated increase in student engagement over conventional methods. Future studies will investigate the extendability of this framework to different fields of engineering and learning environments. The proposed framework has the potential to transform educational practices by providing personalized, interactive, and motivating learning experiences, leading to better educational outcomes. Future research could explore broader applications and long‐term impacts of Edge‐AI‐driven gamification.",

    "Abstract": "As health information systems (HIS) become a critical part of patient care, it is crucial to build an effective education strategy that facilitates the adoption and sustained use of these systems. The COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2023) has contributed to the rapid shift in virtual education and training for healthcare staff. INTRODUCTION As health information systems (HIS) become a critical part of patient care, it is crucial to build an effective education strategy that facilitates the adoption and sustained use of these systems. The COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2023) has contributed to the rapid shift in virtual education and training for healthcare staff.We sought to evaluate the efficacy and long-term sustainability of virtual training for using a HIS by examining opportunities and challenges. OBJECTIVE We sought to evaluate the efficacy and long-term sustainability of virtual training for using a HIS by examining opportunities and challenges.An exploratory, multimethods study was conducted with staff who had taken part in a virtual HIS training program as part of the clinical transformation journey at a large academic health science center in Canada. The study was guided by the Accelerating the Learning Cycle framework. Data were collected through pre- and post-training surveys, as well as semi-structured interviews. An iterative, inductive, constant comparative analysis approach, outlined by Braun and Clarke, was taken to thematically analyse the data. METHOD An exploratory, multimethods study was conducted with staff who had taken part in a virtual HIS training program as part of the clinical transformation journey at a large academic health science center in Canada. The study was guided by the Accelerating the Learning Cycle framework. Data were collected through pre- and post-training surveys, as well as semi-structured interviews. An iterative, inductive, constant comparative analysis approach, outlined by Braun and Clarke, was taken to thematically analyse the data.Of the 33 participants in this study, 13 were educational champions, and 20 were end-users. The pre- and post-training surveys yielded a total of 1479 responses in both groups. Three prominent themes emerged from this study: (1) fostering dynamic facilitation techniques to cultivate an inclusive culture and adapt to diverse learning needs; (2) integrating practical learning activities that contribute to knowledge retention; and (3) ensuring training resources are accessible and consistent for an optimal training experience.

    "Abstract": "Across the world, people are exploring fields where AI (Artificial Intelligence) and VR (Virtual Reality) can be harnessed to unlock new possibilities and drive innovation. The aim of this article was to review the potential and assess the feasibility of using virtual reality technology in soft skills training (including people management, stress management, communication, conflict resolution, and sales). A project was developed featuring an application that utilizes virtual reality and artificial intelligence to facilitate communication with a virtual coach. The application operates on Meta Quest 3 virtual reality goggles (Meta Platforms, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA). Tests of the presented solution confirm market trends, highlighting the potential for achieving positive training outcomes through immersive technologies. The conclusions outline opportunities for improvement and further development of such solutions. This study applied a quasi-experimental model with pretest, posttest, and four-week follow-up measurements. The effectiveness of VR training was evaluated using a knowledge test (0–100%), a self-assessment scale of soft skills (Likert 1–5), expert behavior observation (0–10 scale), and posttraining surveys. The VR group demonstrated significantly higher gains in knowledge, soft skills, and behavioral performance with knowledge retention reaching 89% after four weeks. These results confirm the effectiveness of immersive VR training and its alignment with current market trends in innovative professional development.",

Introduction Recent research findings published in recent years indicate that soft skills—such as communication, collaboration, emotional management, and adaptability to change—have become critical not only in social life but also in the labor market [1,2,3]. The outbreak of the pandemic in 2019 revealed new challenges and uncertainties faced by both employers and employees. These emerging global challenges and uncertainties have reshaped the perception of human skills and soft competencies, necessitating adaptation to dynamic changes in work execution, team management, and career development.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents Gesture-Enhanced Adaptive Learning and Personalization (GEALP), an educational platform that integrates cognitive bulking and AI technologies to address key challenges in inclusive education, such as gesture recognition deficiencies, modal conversion barriers, and personalization gaps. Existing educational systems often fail to accommodate users relying on gestures, lack seamless integration across learning modalities, and provide limited adaptability to individual learning preferences. GEALP introduces a three-tier architecture combining 3D-CNN-based gesture recognition with attention-augmented temporal processing, bi-directional multi-modal content conversion, and dynamic learning adaptation supported by real-time feedback loops. Experiments with 1,000 users, 5,000 learning sessions, and 10,000 gestures demonstrate GEALP's superior performance. Results show improved gesture recognition accuracy (95.5%), user interaction (92.8%), and learning effectiveness (89.2%) compared to existing systems. The system also achieves 13.2% higher processing efficiency compared than benchmark systems such as MALS (8.1%) and PELS IRT (6.0%). The system presents an innovative bi-directional conversion framework enables seamlessly transformation across textual, auditory, visual, and gestural modalities while leveraging temporal attention mechanisms for low-latency gesture interpretation (average response time of 150 ms). Platform accessibility scores (9.2/10), personalization accuracy (94.2%), and knowledge retention rates (87.5%) further confirm the robustness of GEALP, indicating its potential for shaping future personalized learning environments.

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Health education plays a vital role in training health professionals and caregivers, supporting both prevention and the promotion of self-care. In this context, technology serves as a valuable ally by enabling continuous and flexible learning. Among the various domains of health education, nutrition stands out as a key element in the management of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), helping to prevent malnutrition and enhance patient well-being. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching and learning processes within a learning pathway focused on food and nutrition in the context of ALS. Methods: This study adopted a longitudinal, quantitative design. The learning pathway, titled \"Food and Nutrition in ALS,\" consisted of four self-paced and self-instructional Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), offered through the Virtual Learning Environment of the Brazilian Health System (AVASUS). Participants included health professionals, caregivers, and patients from all five regions of Brazil. Participants had the autonomy to complete the courses in any order, with no prerequisites for enrollment. Results: Out of 14,263 participants enrolled nationwide, 182 were included in this study after signing the Informed Consent Form. Of these, 142 (78%) completed at least one course and participated in the educational intervention. A significant increase in knowledge was observed, with mean pre-test scores rising from 7.3 (SD = 1.8) to 9.6 (SD = 0.9) on the post-test across all courses ( p < 0.001). Conclusions: The self-instructional, technology-mediated continuing education model proved effective in improving participants' knowledge about nutrition in ALS. Future studies should explore knowledge retention, behavior change, and the impact of such interventions on clinical outcomes, especially in multidisciplinary care settings.Background/Objectives: Health education plays a vital role in training health professionals and caregivers, supporting both prevention and the promotion of self-care.

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Cardiovascular disease is frequently addressed in primary care, and professional association guidelines dictating the standard of care frequently change. Teaching clinical practice guidelines to residents remains important to promote knowledge retention and subsequent implementation in patient care. Gamification utilizes social elements and technology to promote accessible and active learning that enhances learner confidence, engagement, and knowledge. Data assessing gamification in teaching guideline-based care remains limited. We evaluated a gamified cardiometabolic health curriculum utilizing a student response system (SRS) to assess the benefits of gamification in teaching guidelines to internal medicine residents.  Methods: We developed a gamified cardiometabolic health curriculum for categorical residents in internal medicine utilizing KAHOOT!® (Oslo, Norway). KAHOOT!® is an SRS where learners utilize their mobile devices to answer questions. Speed and accuracy contributed to placement on a digital leaderboard. Our curriculum consisted of one academic half-day with five 45-minute virtual didactics reviewing guideline-based management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic-associated fatty liver dysfunction (MAFLD), and weight management. KAHOOT!® was selected to promote ease of participation. The gamified format was compared to a traditional slide-based format. Residents are randomly assigned one of five clinic groups. Three groups received the gamified format, and two received the traditional format, without crossover. Residents were invited to complete anonymous pre- and post-surveys, which collected quantitative data such as Likert scale ratings of confidence and satisfaction with learning and test performance. Results: All residents (108 of 108) received the curriculum. Around 59% (64) received the gamified format, and 44 (41%) received the traditional format. Pre-post surveys were compared via a matched analysis. Anonymous surveys were matched via a code provided by each resident, and residents who completed only one of the two surveys were excluded. Likert scale ratings of confidence in management increased for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, MAFLD, and weight management, but not for T2DM, likely as T2DM had the lowest number of matched resident pairs analyzed. Comparing gamified and traditional formats, there was no difference in the post-curricular change in absolute score on board-style questions or increase in Likert scale ratings of confidence. A majority of residents (90.9%) who received the gamified format found it engaging, while a minority (14.2%) of residents who received the traditional format found it engaging. Analysis was limited by a low response rate of 21.6%. Anonymous pre-post surveys limited the assessment of non-response bias and whether respondent characteristics differed from those of non-respondents. Discussion: A gamified format was similar to a traditional format in increasing resident confidence in managing cardiometabolic health conditions and knowledge of guidelines. A gamified format was felt to be more engaging. Although the low response rate limits generalizability, we present initial data supporting the efficacy of a virtual gamified curriculum utilizing an SRS to teach clinical practice guidelines. Future avenues for study include assessments of long-term knowledge retention and whether engagement translates to increased learner participation.",

    "Full text": "Introduction This article was previously presented as a meeting abstract at the 2024 American College of Cardiology Annual Scientific Session on April 7th, 2024. Cardiovascular disease prevention and management are commonly addressed in primary care [1]. Given that professional association guidelines dictating standards of care in promoting cardiovascular health frequently change, developing and evaluating novel educational modalities, such as gamification, remain important to developing effective educational curricula for residents. Gamification broadly encompasses a variety of systems, including social elements (team competition), technology integration (novel devices, virtual reality), and systems (point-based scoring or a fictional world) that promote engagement and accessible and active learning [2,3]. Social learning theory emphasizes that observation and imitation serve as a foundation of learning, and the framework of peer-to-peer competition established by gamification promotes this imitation among peers [4]. Student response systems (SRS) are a type of gamification described as a quiz-based system utilizing mobile devices, where speed and accuracy contribute to placement on a digital leaderboard [5].",

Background The current information and communication technologies, digital literacy, and ease of access to communication and information devices by nurses provide them with new ways and intention to access information for technical-scientific updating, ensuring the quality and safety of health care. Mobile learning (m-learning) offers a flexible and accessible alternative for continuing professional education, overcoming barriers such as time constraints and financial burden.This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of m-learning in nurses' knowledge retention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease self-management, using a Massive Open Online Course with integrated virtual clinical simulation. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of m-learning in nurses' knowledge retention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease self-management, using a Massive Open Online Course with integrated virtual clinical simulation.A quasi-experimental pre- and posttest study was conducted, with no control group, among 168 nurses from a Portuguese hospital. The intervention included an asynchronous online course with 13 modules. Knowledge retention was assessed by comparing the mean scores before and after the course. Methods A quasi-experimental pre- and posttest study was conducted, with no control group, among 168 nurses from a Portuguese hospital. The intervention included an asynchronous online course with 13 modules. Knowledge retention was assessed by comparing the mean scores before and after the course.The results indicated a significant increase in knowledge retention. The participants' average score increased from 59.97% in the initial assessment to 84.05% in the final assessment (P<.001).

INTRODUCTION The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) in healthcare education offers innovative ways to enhance collaborative learning and improve patient safety. This narrative review examines the synergistic impact of AI-powered virtual reality (VR) simulations, such as those used in surgical training and patient communication, on knowledge acquisition, clinical skill development, and collaborative competencies among healthcare students. It also explores long-term knowledge retention, ethical considerations within virtual scenarios, and the psychological impact of high-stakes simulations on learner resilience.This review is distinguished by its exhaustive literature search, which spanned PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, and other pertinent databases, to identify studies published between 2005 and 2024. The distinct focus on AI and VR interventions in healthcare education, particularly those with outcomes related to interdisciplinary learning or patient safety, distinguishes this review.

METHODS This review is distinguished by its exhaustive literature search, which spanned PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, and other pertinent databases, to identify studies published between 2005 and 2024. The distinct focus on AI and VR interventions in healthcare education, particularly those with outcomes related to interdisciplinary learning or patient safety, distinguishes this review. Data were thematically analyzed across domains, including adaptive learning, technical skill development, teamwork, patient safety, and ethics.The findings of this review carry significant practical implications. Five key themes emerged: adaptive learning (n = 17), immersive skill development (n = 10), teamwork enhancement (n = 10), patient safety (n = 18), and ethical considerations (n = 21). These themes underscore the potential of AI and VR in healthcare education. AI-driven adaptive systems enabled personalized VR training, enhancing engagement and knowledge retention. Real-time AI feedback during simulations improved decision-making in safe, controlled environments. Interdisciplinary team simulations enhanced communication and collaboration, which are crucial for effective clinical care. Ethical modules embedded in VR scenarios promoted moral reasoning. Several studies also reported increased learner confidence in performing clinical procedures following VR training, suggesting enhanced preparedness for practice.

We propose a dual-stream neural network architecture that simultaneously models students' knowledge states and cognitive load levels to optimize learning trajectories.

A dual-objective optimization algorithm balances knowledge acquisition with cognitive load management to generate paths that maintain optimal challenge levels. Experimental evaluations across multiple educational domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy (87.5%), path quality (4.4/5), and learning efficiency (24.6% improvement). The implemented system supports real-time adaptation based on performance and cognitive state, resulting in reduced frustration, higher engagement, and improved knowledge retention.

Background With the continuous advancement of medical technology and the frequent occurrence of disaster events, the training of health care workers in disaster nursing has become increasingly significant. However, traditional training methods often struggle to engage learners' interest and enthusiasm, making it challenging to simulate emergencies in real-life scenarios effectively. Gamification, as an innovative pedagogical approach that enhances the enjoyment and practicality of learning through the incorporation of game elements, has garnered considerable attention in the realm of disaster nursing education for health care workers in recent years. This review systematically evaluates its effectiveness and explores its advantages in improving training outcomes.This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of gamified teaching methodologies in disaster nursing education and to identify the outcome of 16 indicators used in existing studies. Objective This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of gamified teaching methodologies in disaster nursing education and to identify the outcome of 16 indicators used in existing studies.This study was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, using the PICO-SD framework (Population, Intervention, Control, Outcome, Study Design) to establish the inclusion criteria. The researchers systematically searched 8 databases on February 10, 2025, including the Cochrane Library, PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and SCOPUS. Ultimately, 16 quasi-experimental studies investigating the application of gamified teaching in disaster nursing education were included in the analysis. For randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (RoB 2.0) was used for quality assessment; for quasi-experimental studies, the Joanna Briggs Institute Risk of Bias Tool for Non-Randomized Intervention Studies was used for methodological quality evaluation. Given the heterogeneity of study designs and the diversity of study indicators, this study used a narrative synthesis to integrate the findings.

However, data on long-term retention were limited.Gamification teaching methods have shown significant potential to enhance core competencies such as emergency response, decision-making, and teamwork in disaster nursing education and have been effective in reinforcing learning engagement through elements such as cooperation, competition, scoring, and scenario simulation. However, there is a lack of standardized assessment frameworks for skill acquisition, longitudinal studies tracking behavior in real-life scenarios, and rigorous RCTs comparing it with traditional instruction. Although the existing evidence has not systematically confirmed its full effectiveness, based on the findings, this paper provides practical recommendations for developing and implementing gamified teaching strategies in disaster nursing education to enhance students' knowledge acquisition and practice.

    "Abstract": "Education has continuously evolved to keep pace with advancements in information technology. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an innovative and effective learning approach that enhances student engagement, particularly in developing problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Since its introduction in the early 1980s, VR has gained increasing attention in nursing education due to its potential to improve learning outcomes and skill acquisition. However, there is a need for further research to explore its impact on critical thinking disposition among nursing students. BACKGROUND Education has continuously evolved to keep pace with advancements in information technology. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an innovative and effective learning approach that enhances student engagement, particularly in developing problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Since its introduction in the early 1980s, VR has gained increasing attention in nursing education due to its potential to improve learning outcomes and skill acquisition. However, there is a need for further research to explore its impact on critical thinking disposition among nursing students.This quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study was conducted with a convenience sample of 190 nursing students from Damietta University's Faculty of Nursing. Participants were assessed on their critical thinking disposition and VR-related knowledge at three time points: before the intervention, immediately after, and two months post-intervention. METHODS This quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study was conducted with a convenience sample of 190 nursing students from Damietta University's Faculty of Nursing. Participants were assessed on their critical thinking disposition and VR-related knowledge at three time points: before the intervention, immediately after, and two months post-intervention.The VR-based educational program aimed to improve students' critical thinking disposition and assess their knowledge of virtual reality before, during, and after the program. AIM The VR-based educational program aimed to improve students' critical thinking disposition and assess their knowledge of virtual reality before, during, and after the program.A statistically significant improvement in students' mean scores for critical thinking disposition was observed across all evaluations (p < 0.001). The effect size (η²p ≥ 0.14) indicated a substantial impact, reinforcing the effectiveness of the VR-based educational program in fostering higher-order cognitive skills. Additionally, students demonstrated increased retention of VR-related knowledge when assessed immediately after the program and again after two months. RESULTS A statistically significant improvement in students' mean scores for critical thinking disposition was observed across all evaluations (p < 0.001). The effect size (η²p ≥ 0.14) indicated a substantial impact, reinforcing the effectiveness of the VR-based educational program in fostering higher-order cognitive skills. Additionally, students demonstrated increased retention of VR-related knowledge when assessed immediately after the program and again after two months.This study highlights the transformative potential of VR as an educational tool in nursing. VR-based learning promotes active engagement, knowledge retention, and skill development in a safe and controlled environment. By integrating VR programs into nursing education, institutions can enhance students' critical thinking, collaboration, and communication skills, ultimately preparing them for real-world clinical practice. Given these findings, educational institutions should consider incorporating VR technology to support the continuous development of essential nursing competencies.

    "Abstract": "Traditional teaching methods in Aircraft Maintenance Technology (AMT) often struggle to maintain student engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention. While gamification has been recognised as a potential solution, its application in AMT education remains underexplored, particularly in bridging theoretical knowledge with practical skill acquisition. This study investigates the effectiveness of Kahoot-based gamification in enhancing student engagement, motivation, knowledge retention, and practical skills development. A mixed-methods approach was employed, integrating quantitative surveys, pre- and post-assessments, and qualitative interviews with students and instructors. The study assessed 120 participants, revealing statistically significant improvements: engagement increased by 43.8%, motivation by 55.2%, knowledge retention by 41.2%, and practical skills by 51.6%. Qualitative findings supported these results, with students reporting higher participation, improved concept recall, and greater enthusiasm. Instructors observed enhanced confidence in applying theoretical knowledge. Despite these benefits, challenges such as internet connectivity issues, time constraints, and question format limitations were identified. The study recommends a blended learning approach integrating gamification with hands-on training, scenario-based exercises, and emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Beyond AMT, these findings highlight gamification’s potential in technical and vocational education, emphasising the need for future research on adaptive gamification models and AI-driven learning platforms.

Three groups received the gamified format, and two received the traditional format, without crossover. Residents were invited to complete anonymous pre- and post-surveys, which collected quantitative data such as Likert scale ratings of confidence and satisfaction with learning and test performance.All residents (108 of 108) received the curriculum. Around 59% (64) received the gamified format, and 44 (41%) received the traditional format. Pre-post surveys were compared via a matched analysis. Anonymous surveys were matched via a code provided by each resident, and residents who completed only one of the two surveys were excluded. Likert scale ratings of confidence in management increased for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, MAFLD, and weight management, but not for T2DM, likely as T2DM had the lowest number of matched resident pairs analyzed. Comparing gamified and traditional formats, there was no difference in the post-curricular change in absolute score on board-style questions or increase in Likert scale ratings of confidence. A majority of residents (90.9%) who received the gamified format found it engaging, while a minority (14.2%) of residents who received the traditional format found it engaging. Analysis was limited by a low response rate of 21.6%. Anonymous pre-post surveys limited the assessment of non-response bias and whether respondent characteristics differed from those of non-respondents.

    "Abstract": "Education 4.0 represents a visionary approach to the future of education, aiming to enhance teaching and learning through advanced technologies. The aim of this research is to determine student attitudes toward the use of Education 4.0 tools in the 7th-grade Science course Electrical Circuits unit. To achieve this, an attitude test was developed to evaluate the integration of Education 4.0 tools into the Science curriculum, and student attitudes were assessed using this test. A \"quasi-experimental design with pre-test and post-test control group,\" one of the quantitative research methods, was used in the study. The research involved 41 seventh-grade students from one public secondary schools in Turkey, with 21 students in the experimental group and 20 in the control group. The \"Attitude Scale toward the Use of Education 4.0 Tools in Science Teaching,\" developed by the researchers, was used as the data collection instrument. The experimental phase lasted four weeks (16 lesson hours), during which the experimental group engaged in activities involving Education 4.0 tools, while the control group followed the curriculum-prescribed activities. The t-test results of the collected data revealed a statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of the experimental and control groups, with the experimental group showing more favorable outcomes. The research findings reveal that students exhibit a positive attitude toward the use of Education 4.0 tools in science education. These results suggest that the integration of Education 4.0 into science education enhances students’ understanding of abstract electrical concepts such as electric current, potential difference, resistance, and Ohm’s Law, improves knowledge retention, and transforms the learning process into an interactive and discovery-oriented experience. Furthermore, Education 4.0 tools have contributed to the improvement of learning outcomes by promoting student engagement and make learning processes more efficient by improving students’ ability to use technology effectively.",

    "Abstract": "Active learning approaches that promote participation, critical thinking, and practical competency are becoming more and more necessary in medical and nursing education. Virtual reality (VR) and gamification, especially in the context of escape rooms, have become popular instructional technology in response to these issues. The interactive, scenario-based learning environments provided by these tools encourage motivation, teamwork, and decision-making. The impact and transformative possibilities of incorporating virtual reality and gamified escape rooms into medical and nursing education are examined in this paper. BACKGROUND Active learning approaches that promote participation, critical thinking, and practical competency are becoming more and more necessary in medical and nursing education. Virtual reality (VR) and gamification, especially in the context of escape rooms, have become popular instructional technology in response to these issues. The interactive, scenario-based learning environments provided by these tools encourage motivation, teamwork, and decision-making. The impact and transformative possibilities of incorporating virtual reality and gamified escape rooms into medical and nursing education are examined in this paper.The use of virtual reality (VR), gamification, and escape rooms in medical and nursing education was investigated using a thorough narrative literature review. In order to give a comprehensive and holistic overview of new subjects, this method was selected. Keywords like \"escape room,\" \"digital escape room,\" \"online escape room,\" \"gamification,\" \"game-based education,\" \"virtual reality in medical education,\" \"medical student,\" \"nursing education,\" \"nursing student,\" and \"nursing staff\" were used in the January 10, 2025, search across Web of Science, PubMed, ERIC, and Scopus. English-language publications from the past ten years that addressed virtual reality, gamification, or escape rooms in medical or nursing education were included in the inclusion criteria. Non-relevant papers, non-peer-reviewed literature, and research with unclear methodology or no empirical data were among the exclusion criteria. 25 studies were chosen for a thorough assessment after a rigorous screening process based on methodological rigor and relevance.

    "Abstract": "Online and hybrid pediatric oncology training programs, such as the St. Jude Global Academy's Neuro-Oncology Training Seminar (NOTS), aim to address gaps in educational opportunities. This study examined the online components of the 2022 and 2023 NOTS, using mixed methods to assess strengths, limitations, and areas for improvement specific to the distance learning components. NOTS participants are required to complete 9 weeks of online modules. Participants were invited to evaluate their online learning experience which included both quantitative and qualitative measures related to participant perceptions of the course. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze quantitative results, and qualitative responses underwent thematic analysis. A total of 153 participants from 30 institutions participated in the online modules of the 2022 and 2023 NOTS. Among all participants, 106 (69.1%) completed the online course with a passing score of 70% or higher, and 83 completed the online evaluation. Pre-recorded lectures, rated highly by 73.5% of respondents, were appreciated for their content quality and flexibility. Live meetings were also of importance, with many participants requesting an expansion of interactive online sessions in future iterations of NOTS. Participants also felt the online learning activities (e.g., research projects and case discussions) were important and recommended more frequent knowledge assessments throughout the online modules and long-term follow-up. While most participants found the course duration of online components appropriate, some suggested adjustments to pacing and improved access to content. This study expands on the potential of technology-facilitated pediatric hematology-oncology education in LMICs by offering flexible and accessible learning formats. The findings suggest that blended learning models, interactive content, and incorporating peer and expert feedback can enhance knowledge retention and learner satisfaction among online participants.Online and hybrid pediatric oncology training programs, such as the St. Jude Global Academy's Neuro-Oncology Training Seminar (NOTS), aim to address gaps in educational opportunities.

    "Abstract": "Generative AI technologies offer significant opportunities to enhance orthodontic education by improving knowledge retention, clinical decision-making, and skills training. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact of generative AI tools in orthodontic education, focusing on knowledge retention, decision-making, and practical skills. BACKGROUND Generative AI technologies offer significant opportunities to enhance orthodontic education by improving knowledge retention, clinical decision-making, and skills training. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact of generative AI tools in orthodontic education, focusing on knowledge retention, decision-making, and practical skills.A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, ERIC, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore from January 2010 to December 2023. Studies evaluating the integration of generative AI in dental and orthodontic education were included. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, with the GRADE approach used to evaluate evidence quality. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, ERIC, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore from January 2010 to December 2023. Studies evaluating the integration of generative AI in dental and orthodontic education were included. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, with the GRADE approach used to evaluate evidence quality.Generative AI improved knowledge retention and clinical decision-making through adaptive learning pathways and real-time feedback. Barriers included limited faculty training, technical infrastructure deficits, and educator resistance. RESULTS Generative AI improved knowledge retention and clinical decision-making through adaptive learning pathways and real-time feedback. Barriers included limited faculty training, technical infrastructure deficits, and educator resistance.Generative AI holds transformative potential for orthodontic education but requires addressing practical and ethical challenges. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to validate long-term impact and explore integration strategies. CONCLUSIONS Generative AI holds transformative potential for orthodontic education but requires addressing practical and ethical challenges. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to validate long-term impact and explore integration strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: This study examines the effectiveness of a methodological proposal that employs playful strategies through digital tools in the learning process of chemistry to improve the academic performance of first -semester students. Theoretical Framework: This research is grounded in theories of playful learning, gamification, and educational technology, highlighting the role of interactive and immersive methodologies in enhancing student motivation, knowledge retention, and overall academic success. Method: A quasi-experimental design with pre-test, post-test, and control group was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodological proposal. The General Linear Model (GLM) for repeated measures was used for data analysis, with intra-subject factors (pre-test and post-test) and an inter-subject factor (experimental group vs. control group). Results and Discussion: The implementation of playful strategies positively influenced students' academic performance in certain areas of the course. However, not all units showed significant improvement, suggesting that the impact of these methodologies may vary depending on the content and context of the learning material. Research Implications: The study highlights the potential of playful strategies to promote not only better learning outcomes but also a more positive attitude toward education. Originality/Value: This research demonstrates the adaptability and effectiveness of playful learning and gamification in higher education settings, offering valuable insights for designing immersive learning experiences tailored to students' specific needs. Alternate abstract: Objetivo: Este estudo examina a eficácia de uma proposta metodológica que utiliza estratégias lúdicas por meio de ferramentas digitais no processo de aprendizagem de química para melhorar o desempenho acadêmico dos estudantes do primeiro semestre. Marco Teórico: Esta pesquisa baseia-se em teorias de aprendizagem lúdica, gamificação e tecnologia educacional, destacando o papel de metodologias interativas e imersivas em aumentar a motivação dos estudantes, a retenção do conhecimento e o sucesso acadêmico geral. Método: Foi utilizado um desenho quase-experimental com pré-teste, pós-teste e grupo de controle para avaliar a eficácia da proposta metodológica. O Modelo Linear Geral (MLG) para medidas repetidas foi empregado na análise dos dados, com fatores intra-sujeitos (pré-teste e pós-teste) e um fator inter-sujeitos (grupo experimental vs. grupo de controle). Resultados e Discussão: A implementação de estratégias lúdicas influenciou positivamente o desempenho acadêmico dos estudantes em algumas áreas do curso. No entanto, nem todas as unidades apresentaram melhora significativa, sugerindo que o impacto dessas metodologias pode variar dependendo do conteúdo e do contexto do material de aprendizagem. Implicações da Pesquisa: O estudo destaca o potencial das estratégias lúdicas para promover não apenas melhores resultados de aprendizagem, mas também uma atitude mais positiva em relação à educação. Originalidade/Valor: Esta pesquisa demonstra a adaptabilidade e a eficácia da aprendizagem lúdica e da gamificação em ambientes de ensino superior, oferecendo insights valiosos para projetar experiências de aprendizagem imersivas que atendam às necessidades específicas dos estudantes.

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a game-based mobile application on nursing students’ skills in administering subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) injections. Nursing education traditionally involves both theoretical and practical components. With the advent of digital technologies, innovative methods such as game-based learning have been introduced to enhance practical skills and knowledge retention in nursing education. This study explores the use of a mobile application designed to improve students’ competence in SC and IM drug administration. This was an experimental study conducted during the 2021–2022 academic year. It involved a study group of 64 students who received training through a simulation game system and a control group of 65 students who underwent traditional training methods. Data were collected using the Self-Demonstration Form, the Study Process Questionnaire, and the Skills Performance List for Subcutaneous and Intramuscular Administration. The study focused on assessing the impact of game-based learning on students’ performance and learning approaches. The study group showed significantly greater improvements in learning approaches and medication administration skills compared to the control group. Deep learning scores increased from 31.39 ± 6.23 to 45.05 ± 5.46 in the study group, versus 31.78 ± 5.68 to 37.02 ± 4.17 in the control group ( p  < 0.01). SC and IM administration scores improved significantly in the study group (SC: 22.50 ± 15.46 to 42.45 ± 11.66, p  = 0.015; IM: 27.75 ± 15.98 to 59.45 ± 12.95, p  < 0.001) compared to the control group. Scenario-based analyses also showed significant performance gains in the study group across all scenarios ( p  < 0.05). The HEM-SC-IM game-based mobile application proved effective in improving nursing students’ skills in administering SC and IM injections. The interactive and engaging nature of game-based learning provides a valuable educational experience, promoting deeper understanding and practical skills development. This study supports the integration of educational technology in nursing curricula to enhance learning outcomes.",

Methodology: The study involved 300 sample population, including 152 Year 1 and 148 Year 2 students. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted, with a sample size of 184 with a 95% confidence level. Data were collected through online surveys and analysis using Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS version 23.0.Result: All 184 preclinical students used Al tools in their medical education, mainly relying on ChatGPT.

The effectiveness of Al in improving learning was rated from 1 to 3, with most students scoring Al as 4 or 5 in problem-solving, decision-making, critical thinking, and inspiring new ideas, indicating a high perception of its effectiveness. Many believe AI supports traditional teaching. However, concerns exist about over-reliance on technology (83.2%) and loss of critical thinking skills (77.7%). Also, 42.9% rated their worries about Al's impact on clinical decision-making skills as a 3. Conclusion: Most preclinical students know about Al in medical education and believe it helps improve learning. Al assists students in solving problems, making decisions, encouraging critical thinking, and generating new ideas. However, concerns felt about much dependence on technology and weaken critical thinking skills in medical education. Students believe that AI will not entirely harm clinical decision-making skills. In summary, Al offers both advantages and disadvantages in medical education.",

    "Abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, integrating smart classroom technology (SCT) is a transformative force, reshaping traditional paradigms and redefining the dynamics of teaching and learning. The study aims to investigate the transformative impact of SCT on educational practices, focusing on its effectiveness in enhancing student engagement, learning outcomes, and overall educational experience. The study analyzes the implementation of a smart classroom (SMR) system to enhance overall satisfaction and foster positive perceptions among students and faculty concerning the learning environment. The study employed a quantitative methodology and utilized the random sampling technique. The data were collected from 420 college students at different levels from junior level to senior category who received SMR education. The collected data were analyzed by using SPSS software. The findings indicate that incorporation of SCT systems positively impacts student engagement and participation levels in academic activities.

    "Abstract": "As the world becomes more technology focused, emerging technologies such as extended reality (XR) have been incorporated into medical education over the past few decades. Now that XR is more accessible to physician assistant (PA) education, educators must determine the extent to which XR can improve knowledge retention over current modalities. The purpose of this article was to perform a review of what XR pedagogical approaches are being used in PA education and what value they provide to learning. INTRODUCTION As the world becomes more technology focused, emerging technologies such as extended reality (XR) have been incorporated into medical education over the past few decades. Now that XR is more accessible to physician assistant (PA) education, educators must determine the extent to which XR can improve knowledge retention over current modalities. The purpose of this article was to perform a review of what XR pedagogical approaches are being used in PA education and what value they provide to learning.A thorough literature database search conducted by a research librarian identified 228 unique articles published between 2012 and August 2023. These articles were further categorized by date, language, study method, and population sample and further screened for relevance and eligibility. Of the 228 unique articles identified, 8 met the eligibility criteria for this review. METHODS A thorough literature database search conducted by a research librarian identified 228 unique articles published between 2012 and August 2023. These articles were further categorized by date, language, study method, and population sample and further screened for relevance and eligibility. Of the 228 unique articles identified, 8 met the eligibility criteria for this review.The focus of research ranged from XR integration to proof of concept of XR in educational environments. Selected studies used both qualitative and quantitative data. General impressions of XR in PA education reflect its potential to supplement current methods; however, the authors also admit the need for additional critical analysis. RESULTS The focus of research ranged from XR integration to proof of concept of XR in educational environments. Selected studies used both qualitative and quantitative data. General impressions of XR in PA education reflect its potential to supplement current methods; however, the authors also admit the need for additional critical analysis.While there is a paucity of research into this specific topic, multiple studies showed that using XR principles in medical education led to better confidence among students and improved their perception of learning. While there currently is no direct statistically significant evidence to show a superiority of XR over traditional didactic learning, it is important to consider that not all educational tools need to improve outcomes; rather, they can improve student perception, which opens the door to further learning. Future studies should continue to longitudinally evaluate integrating XR into PA programs with a specific focus on knowledge retention.

    "Abstract": "ENG English eng Simulation-based training is a vital tool in obstetrics and gynaecology education, addressing challenges such as limited clinical exposure during short rotation periods and gender-related sensitivities. This need is further underscored by the fact that non-obstetricians and non-midwives often serve as first responders in out-of-hospital and acute care settings where vaginal birth (VB) is imminent. Traditional mannequin-based simulations depend on in-person tutors with demands on time and physical space. In the absence of realistic clinical scenarios, they serve no better than low-fidelity task trainers. Capitalising on recent advancements in affordable virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display (HMD) technology, we developed and iteratively refined a VR-based childbirth training system between 2020 and 2025. Initial user studies demonstrated strong knowledge retention although participants expressed a preference for in-person mannequin-based simulations due to the lack of tactile feedback in VR. To address this limitation, we introduced a mixed reality (MR)-enhanced childbirth training system in 2024. This innovative approach integrates high-precision alignment of virtual elements with physical mannequins and introduces a tactile component to enhance skill acquisition. A pilot study involving 35 Year 4 undergraduate students yielded positive feedback with participants praising the system’s heightened realism and opportunities for peer-to-peer interaction. While both VR and MR have distinct advan-tages and limitations, the affordability and versatility of modern HMD make VR/MR-based training modules highly scalable and adaptable to diverse scenarios, surpassing the single-task limitations of traditional mannequins. This promises to improve training efficiency and expand access to VB training for a broader range of healthcare professionals.",

Methods: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Six databases (SCOPUS, Web of Science, ERIC, DIALNET, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) were searched up to December 2024. Eligible studies were quasi-experimental or observational, involved students aged 11-18, and focused on first aid instruction within Physical Education. Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. Results: Eleven studies with a total of 3069 students aged 11-18 were included. Active and technology-based methodologies outperformed traditional approaches, improving knowledge acquisition (10.2-30.5%) and practical skill development (18.6-42.3%). Long-term retention ranged from 14.2% to 45.8%, with longer interventions yielding better outcomes. Gamification, simulations, and peer learning improved CPR quality and boosted student confidence. However, most studies assessed only short-term outcomes, limiting conclusions about sustained learning. Conclusions: Active methodologies, particularly gamification, simulation, and cooperative learning, enhance knowledge retention, practical skills, and confidence in providing first aid. Although the results were consistently positive, methodological heterogeneity and limited long-term follow-up reduce their generalizability. Further high-quality, longitudinal research is needed to identify the most effective and sustainable strategies. These findings support integrating first aid training into Physical Education as a public health initiative to strengthen emergency preparedness in schools.",

    "Abstract": "Research on the educator-learner homophily effect in influencing educator credibility, learner attitudes, knowledge retention, and behavior change remains limited and inconclusive. This study investigated how educator-learner homophily influences small-scale farmers' willingness to adopt agricultural technologies. Using a multi-case study approach, focus groups and key informant interviews were conducted with 60 small-scale farmers in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic who received agricultural training from U.S. volunteers. Farmers' perceptions of learning and educator credibility were analyzed. Guided by the Moscarelli Model (2023), which theorizes that perceived educator credibility comprises subject matter expertise and trustworthiness-moderated by educator-learner homophily-findings revealed an unexpected dynamic. Farmers rated U.S. volunteers as more credible and reliable than local extension agents, despite lower sociodemographic homophily between the farmers and U.S. volunteers. These findings challenge traditional assumptions about the role of homophily in international extension systems. By illuminating how educator-learner homophily influences knowledge transfer and behavior change, this study offers insights for designing more effective extension programs. Volunteer program funders, administrators, and educators can leverage these insights to enhance program outcomes. This research advances the understanding of homophily's role in educator credibility and learner outcomes, calling for a reevaluation of its traditional conceptualization in international education contexts. It supports the conceptualization that homophily may shape the effectiveness of knowledge transfer and behavior change, particularly within programs relying on international volunteers.",

    "Abstract": "The development of information and communication technologies has created limitless prospects for using augmented reality (AR) in various fields. Unfortunately, the multitasking nature of AR systems prevents learners from successfully reflecting and retaining knowledge. This study developed and designed a learning analytics dashboard (LAD) with three components: personal learning data, social comparison, and visualization of the learning process, to promote knowledge acquisition and metacognitive awareness among AR learners. A total of 31 intermediate-level Japanese learners participated in an experiment involving pre-tests, post-tests, and a delayed test to assess the LAD. Learners engaged with the AR learning system for Japanese compound verb learning and utilized the LAD to monitor and reflect on their AR learning activities. Behavioral data were analyzed using Lag Sequential Analysis (LSA), while learning performance was evaluated through one-way repeated-measures ANOVA tests. The findings indicate that the use of the LAD significantly improves learning outcomes and metacognitive processes, such as knowledge of cognition and regulation of cognition. Additionally, there were different usage patterns of the dashboard among learners, which corresponded to significant differences in their learning outcomes and changes in metacognitive awareness. Learners who primarily focused on the learning process and social comparison components of the dashboard demonstrated improved knowledge retention. Conversely, those who mainly concentrated on personal learning data experienced the most significant gains in metacognitive awareness. This study also provides crucial design insights on the integration of dashboard components with cognitive efforts to maximize learning outcomes. Alternate abstract: Plain language summary Improving Language Learning Through a Dashboard: A Study on Japanese Learners Using Augmented Reality This study examined the effectiveness of a learning analytics dashboard (LAD) with three components (personal learning data, social comparison, and visualization of the learning process) in promoting the knowledge acquisition and metacognitive awareness of 31 non-native learners of Japanese in learning Japanese compound verbs. The results indicated that the use of LAD significantly improves learning outcomes and metacognitive processes, such as knowledge of cognition and regulation of cognition, and second, that students who concentrated on the learning process and social comparison showed the most improved performance in knowledge retention, while those who concentrated on personal learning data showed greater improvements in metacognitive awareness. This study contributes significantly to the field of LA by providing evidence that the integration of LAD into AR learning environments can meet the multifaceted challenges posed by concurrent multitasking, thus facilitating a more monitored and reflective learning experience. The research also highlights the benefits of combining dashboard components with cognitive efforts to ensure that metacognitive awareness is effectively harnessed to improve learning.",

BACKGROUND Palestinian higher education institutions face limitations in providing interactive practical training for medical education. Extended reality (XR), which encompasses virtual reality and augmented reality, is increasingly recognized for addressing these challenges by offering immersive learning experiences.This study investigates the factors influencing the acceptance and adoption of XR in health care education within Palestinian universities, exploring its potential to transform traditional teaching methods. OBJECTIVE This study investigates the factors influencing the acceptance and adoption of XR in health care education within Palestinian universities, exploring its potential to transform traditional teaching methods.A qualitative approach was used in this study to collect data through semistructured interviews and artifacts from the participants. The participants of the study were 25 faculty members from 2 large Palestinian universities who teach in the field of medical sciences. METHODS A qualitative approach was used in this study to collect data through semistructured interviews and artifacts from the participants. The participants of the study were 25 faculty members from 2 large Palestinian universities who teach in the field of medical sciences.Three primary categories-external, internal, and design-related factors-emerged as pivotal in influencing XR adoption. Professional development, technical support, and infrastructure were key external enablers. Internally, prior experience with digital tools and positive attitudes had a significant impact on the adoption of XR. Design factors, including ease of use and interactivity, played a crucial role but also posed challenges for less tech-savvy educators. Despite barriers such as cost and technical issues, XR demonstrated notable benefits, including enhanced learning outcomes, improved knowledge retention, and the ability to simulate complex medical scenarios.

    "Abstract": "AI education is essential to facilitate seamless clinical integration. The HCPC in the UK requires all radiographers to have some level of digital skills to maintain safety of clinical practice. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a dedicated AI seminar on radiography students. INTRODUCTION AI education is essential to facilitate seamless clinical integration. The HCPC in the UK requires all radiographers to have some level of digital skills to maintain safety of clinical practice. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a dedicated AI seminar on radiography students.A dedicated 1.5-h in-person seminar was delivered by an AI vendor to final year undergraduate diagnostic radiography students at a UK University. The course consisted of both theory and practice training. An online survey was built and piloted, consisting of both closed and open-ended questions, to explore their level of knowledge, skills and confidence in AI, before (pre-test) and after the delivery (post-test) of the seminar using a 10-point scale. Pre-test was distributed two weeks before the seminar and post-test was open two weeks after. METHODS A dedicated 1.5-h in-person seminar was delivered by an AI vendor to final year undergraduate diagnostic radiography students at a UK University. The course consisted of both theory and practice training. An online survey was built and piloted, consisting of both closed and open-ended questions, to explore their level of knowledge, skills and confidence in AI, before (pre-test) and after the delivery (post-test) of the seminar using a 10-point scale. Pre-test was distributed two weeks before the seminar and post-test was open two weeks after.A total of 68 students answered the pre-test and 31 the post-test survey. Students' theoretical knowledge (Mean = 6.57 vs Mean = 3.85), skills (Mean = 5.39 vs Mean = 3.44) and confidence (Mean = 5.47 vs Mean = 3.43) on AI were all significantly improved after the seminar. Their responses became more focused and specific in the post-test survey. In both surveys students expressed concerns around reliability and accountability of AI, data management and security, patient confidentiality and overreliance on technology in the open-ended questions. They also requested more AI training with hands-on options in their undergraduate degree. RESULTS A total of 68 students answered the pre-test and 31 the post-test survey. Students' theoretical knowledge (Mean = 6.57 vs Mean = 3.85), skills (Mean = 5.39 vs Mean = 3.44) and confidence (Mean = 5.47 vs Mean = 3.43) on AI were all significantly improved after the seminar. Their responses became more focused and specific in the post-test survey. In both surveys students expressed concerns around reliability and accountability of AI, data management and security, patient confidentiality and overreliance on technology in the open-ended questions. They also requested more AI training with hands-on options in their undergraduate degree.This study confirms the importance of even brief, but customised educational interventions relating to AI for radiographers. The learning needs to be customised to maximise knowledge retention and applicability and to include both theoretical and practical aspects for consolidation of skills. CONCLUSION This study confirms the importance of even brief, but customised educational interventions relating to AI for radiographers. The learning needs to be customised to maximise knowledge retention and applicability and to include both theoretical and practical aspects for consolidation of skills.These findings will help radiography educators build more focused, tailored AI courses for future students. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE These findings will help radiography educators build more focused, tailored AI courses for future students.",

    "Abstract": "Anatomy education serves as a foundational pillar in medical training, equipping students with critical knowledge of human structure and function essential for clinical practice. Traditional pedagogical approaches, such as cadaveric dissection, anatomical models, and textbook-based learning, have been the cornerstone of medical education for decades. However, these methods face challenges, including limited accessibility (e.g., resource-intensive setups), ethical concerns (e.g., participant privacy), and difficulties in visualizing complex three-dimensional structures (e.g., dynamic systems). Recent advancements in immersive technologies, particularly virtual reality (VR), present a transformative opportunity to enhance anatomy education by offering interactive, scalable, and engaging learning experiences. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of VR simulation in improving medical students' learning outcomes in anatomy education, comparing its effectiveness to conventional teaching methodologies. This systematic review was conducted in strict accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines to ensure methodological rigor. A comprehensive literature search was performed across six major medical databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science, encompassing studies published between January 2019 and February 2024. The search strategy employed a combination of MeSH terms and keywords related to \"virtual reality\", \"anatomy education\", and \"medical students\". Study selection was guided by the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Study (PICOS) framework, with inclusion criteria focusing on randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and comparative analyses evaluating VR-based anatomy instruction for medical students. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess study quality and potential bias. Due to significant heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures, a narrative synthesis approach was adopted to integrate findings thematically rather than through meta-analysis. The review included 14 studies with a total of 961 participants, predominantly medical students across various training stages. Among the included studies, 71% demonstrated statistically significant improvements in anatomy learning outcomes with VR compared to traditional methods, including enhanced spatial understanding, knowledge retention, and learner engagement; 21% of the studies reported no significant difference in learning efficacy between VR and conventional approaches, while only 7% found VR simulation only partially effective, citing technical limitations and a steep learning curve as barriers. Subgroup analyses suggested that VR was particularly beneficial for visualizing complex anatomical regions (e.g., neuroanatomy, musculoskeletal structures) and for students with limited prior exposure to cadaveric dissection. However, variability in VR platform design, assessment tools and instructional integration underscored the need for standardized implementation frameworks. The review generally indicated the benefits of VR simulation in anatomy education, but larger studies are needed to fully explore its potential in medical anatomy training. Future studies should rigorously evaluate VR implementation in anatomy education to provide more comprehensive evidence of its strengths and weaknesses for medical teaching.",

    "Full text": "Introduction and background Rationale and context of the study",
    "Theoretical Frameworks Underlying VR's Impact": "From Cognition to Clinical Application",
    "Embodied cognition and anatomical mastery": "The theory of embodied cognition helps explain VR's superiority in spatial tasks through its emphasis on kinesthetic learning [32]. When students in the mediastinal anatomy and surgery study [16] could physically walk around virtual esophageal structures, their ability to mentally reconstruct anatomical relationships improved by 41% compared to the textbook study. This \"body ownership\" effect extends to procedural training as well. Although VR users who practiced virtual mastoidectomies with hand-tracked instruments developed more accurate mental models of drill angles, leading to 23% fewer errors in subsequent cadaver trials [17], the absence of true haptic feedback created a critical gap. Participants consistently overestimated force application by 300% during initial VR-to-real transitions, underscoring the need for hybrid training approaches.",
    "Dual coding and multimodal learning": "VR's capacity to simultaneously engage multiple sensory pathways amplifies its educational impact when properly designed. The most successful implementations, as seen in a Pakistani study [25], combined visual 3D models with spatial audio descriptions, yielding 38% better retention than visual-only programs. Conversely, systems relying solely on visual immersion showed 22% faster skill decay [20], highlighting the importance of integrated multimodal design. This principle extends to clinical applications; the cardiac module paired anatomical exploration with auscultation sounds, enabling students to correlate structural defects with pathological murmurs in ways impossible with cadavers [23].",
    "Global Implementation": "Balancing Innovation and Accessibility",
    "Connectivity solutions": "The German model [18] shows how localized servers with periodic cloud synchronization (weekly) can virtually eliminate downtime (99.8% availability). Contrastingly, the Pakistani USB program achieved similar educational outcomes through quarterly offline updates, proving internet access is not mandatory for core anatomical training [25]. This bifurcated approach suggests VR can be adapted to any infrastructure level without sacrificing foundational learning objectives.",
    "Training scalability": "The stark faculty preparation differences highlight resource-dependent pathways. While US schools employ dedicated VR educators (1 per 40 students) to maintain quality [7], Mexico's peer-cascade model achieved 84% instructor competency within six months through just 12 initial trainees [23]. This demonstrates that with proper train-the-trainer frameworks, even severely resource-constrained programs can achieve rapid VR adoption.",
    "Addressing Limitations": "From Identification to Solution",
    "Critical research priorities": "It is seen that three gaps demand immediate attention. In standardized assessment protocols, current studies use inconsistent metrics [17,25]. A unified framework measuring both traditional competencies and VR-specific metrics, like gaze tracking, is needed [23]. In longitudinal studies, only 3 of the 14 included studies tracked retention beyond three months [21,23,28]. The fetal development study revealed VR's latent value, with no initial difference but 19% better retention at three months, suggesting many benefits may be underestimated in short-term evaluations [21]. In cost-effectiveness analyses, no study conducted formal return on investment (ROI) comparisons between VR and conventional methods across institution types. This leaves administrators without evidence to support investment decisions.",

In France, veterinary education follows a competency-based framework that includes investigating food chain contamination and participating in multidisciplinary crisis management. To address the challenge of teaching practical public health skills, a food safety escape game was developed at the National Veterinary School of Toulouse. This teaching sequence simulates the management of a food-borne outbreak, using gamification to engage students in problem-solving through a realistic scenario. This study details the game's development, implementation, and efficacy evaluation. Student progress was assessed using a pretest and post-test survey, and perceptions were gathered through qualitative feedback. Results showed significant improvements in students' understanding of food-borne outbreak management and increased engagement with the subject. A debriefing session following the game further enhanced knowledge retention and reflection. The findings highlight the effectiveness of gamification and small-group problem-solving exercises, such as serious games, in veterinary public health education. In particular, the results of student questionnaires suggest that teaching health crisis management through an escape game linked to a real-life situation, along with the game's constraints (e.g., competition between groups, time limits), is highly valued and can improve the quality of teaching. This study provides valuable insights for educators aiming to enhance student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Furthermore, it demonstrates that escape games offer an innovative approach to teaching complex public health subjects, helping students grasp key concepts in an interactive way. Future efforts will focus on expanding the game's scope, adjusting difficulty levels, and refining mechanics to better meet the diverse needs of veterinary students and professionals.Veterinary training programs in Europe must equip future professionals with essential knowledge and skills in food hygiene and technology to assess, promote, and monitor food safety, as outlined by the World Organization for Animal Health, Directive 2005/36/EC, and the European Association of Establishments for Veterinary Education standards.

    "Abstract": "Anatomy education serves as a foundational pillar in medical training, equipping students with critical knowledge of human structure and function essential for clinical practice. Traditional pedagogical approaches, such as cadaveric dissection, anatomical models, and textbook-based learning, have been the cornerstone of medical education for decades. However, these methods face challenges, including limited accessibility (e.g., resource-intensive setups), ethical concerns (e.g., participant privacy), and difficulties in visualizing complex three-dimensional structures (e.g., dynamic systems). Recent advancements in immersive technologies, particularly virtual reality (VR), present a transformative opportunity to enhance anatomy education by offering interactive, scalable, and engaging learning experiences. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of VR simulation in improving medical students' learning outcomes in anatomy education, comparing its effectiveness to conventional teaching methodologies. This systematic review was conducted in strict accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines to ensure methodological rigor. A comprehensive literature search was performed across six major medical databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science, encompassing studies published between January 2019 and February 2024. The search strategy employed a combination of MeSH terms and keywords related to \"virtual reality\", \"anatomy education\", and \"medical students\". Study selection was guided by the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Study (PICOS) framework, with inclusion criteria focusing on randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and comparative analyses evaluating VR-based anatomy instruction for medical students. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess study quality and potential bias. Due to significant heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures, a narrative synthesis approach was adopted to integrate findings thematically rather than through meta-analysis. The review included 14 studies with a total of 961 participants, predominantly medical students across various training stages. Among the included studies, 71% demonstrated statistically significant improvements in anatomy learning outcomes with VR compared to traditional methods, including enhanced spatial understanding, knowledge retention, and learner engagement; 21% of the studies reported no significant difference in learning efficacy between VR and conventional approaches, while only 7% found VR simulation only partially effective, citing technical limitations and a steep learning curve as barriers. Subgroup analyses suggested that VR was particularly beneficial for visualizing complex anatomical regions (e.g., neuroanatomy, musculoskeletal structures) and for students with limited prior exposure to cadaveric dissection. However, variability in VR platform design, assessment tools and instructional integration underscored the need for standardized implementation frameworks. The review generally indicated the benefits of VR simulation in anatomy education, but larger studies are needed to fully explore its potential in medical anatomy training. Future studies should rigorously evaluate VR implementation in anatomy education to provide more comprehensive evidence of its strengths and weaknesses for medical teaching.Anatomy education serves as a foundational pillar in medical training, equipping students with critical knowledge of human structure and function essential for clinical practice.

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives : Informed consent is a crucial part of the clinical trial enrollment process in which patients are asked to understand and provide approval for medical interventions. Consent forms can be complex and hinder patient comprehension, highlighting the need for novel tools to improve the patient enrollment experience. This feasibility study aimed to develop an immersive technology to enroll human subjects in oncology clinical trials and provide 3D avatar-based informed consent in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Methods : Clinical feasibility and the effects of head-mounted VR devices on motion sickness and educational quality were evaluated in adult oncology patients enrolled in an intravenous (IV) port placement intervention study. Participants received before- and after-questionnaires to measure their understanding of the information received in VR. A follow-up questionnaire was given four weeks post-consent to measure knowledge retention. Results : Clinical staff reported that VR technology was manageable to use. Among 16 adult participants, all reported that VR was well tolerated with no motion sickness. The mean pre-intervention knowledge score was 64.6%, with an immediate post-intervention knowledge score of 97.9%. A mean knowledge score of 93.3% four-weeks post-consent was observed among 10/16 participants who completed a follow-up questionnaire. Conclusions : These findings support that VR is well tolerated and effective at delivering information during the informed consent process for oncology clinical trials. Key limitations include the small sample size and single clinical population. Further trials are warranted to compare efficacy over traditional consenting mechanisms and include more diverse clinical populations among a wider participant pool.Background/Objectives: Informed consent is a crucial part of the clinical trial enrollment process in which patients are asked to understand and provide approval for medical interventions.

    "Abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents novel approaches to enhance motivation, curriculum structure and development, and learning and retrieval processes for both learners and instructors. Though a focus for this emerging technology is academic misconduct, we sought to leverage GenAI in curriculum structure to facilitate educational outcomes. For instructors, GenAI offers new opportunities in course design and management while reducing time requirements to evaluate outcomes and personalizing learner feedback. These include innovative instructional designs such as flipped classrooms and gamification, enriching teaching methodologies with focused and interactive approaches, and team-based exercise development among others. For learners, GenAI offers unprecedented self-directed learning opportunities, improved cognitive engagement, and effective retrieval practices, leading to enhanced autonomy, motivation, and knowledge retention. Though empowering, this evolving landscape has integration challenges and ethical considerations, including accuracy, technological evolution, loss of learner's voice, and socioeconomic disparities. Our experience demonstrates that the responsible application of GenAI's in educational settings will revolutionize learning practices, making education more accessible and tailored, producing positive motivational outcomes for both learners and instructors. Thus, we argue that leveraging GenAI in educational settings will improve outcomes with implications extending from primary through higher and continuing education paradigms.

    "Abstract": "To investigate long-term effectiveness of immersive virtual reality (VR) compared with traditional learning methods in a radiography education program through a comparative longitudinal analysis. PURPOSE To investigate long-term effectiveness of immersive virtual reality (VR) compared with traditional learning methods in a radiography education program through a comparative longitudinal analysis.For 3 years, educational outcomes, such as student engagement and knowledge retention, were assessed to determine the effects of hybrid simulation methods incorporating immersive VR. The study used Virtual Medical Coaching's X-Ray Pro VR software to integrate VR into the curriculum. METHODS For 3 years, educational outcomes, such as student engagement and knowledge retention, were assessed to determine the effects of hybrid simulation methods incorporating immersive VR. The study used Virtual Medical Coaching's X-Ray Pro VR software to integrate VR into the curriculum.The data and graphical analyses substantiate the effectiveness of the hybrid learning model over traditional physical methods in terms of academic and practical performance metrics, affective measures, and career preparedness. Students using a hybrid of VR and physical simulations had significantly higher mean posttest scores, mean practical exam scores, career readiness, internship performance, mean motivation level, and mean engagement level compared with the students who only used physical simulation machines (P < .001). RESULTS The data and graphical analyses substantiate the effectiveness of the hybrid learning model over traditional physical methods in terms of academic and practical performance metrics, affective measures, and career preparedness. Students using a hybrid of VR and physical simulations had significantly higher mean posttest scores, mean practical exam scores, career readiness, internship performance, mean motivation level, and mean engagement level compared with the students who only used physical simulation machines (P < .001).The significant improvements in student engagement and retention observed in this study suggest that VR can effectively address some of the limitations of traditional learning methods. The immersive nature of VR might provide a more engaging and interactive learning environment, leading to better educational outcomes. These findings support the potential for VR to be a valuable tool in higher education, particularly in fields that benefit from simulation-based training. However, further research is needed to explore the practical challenges of implementing VR at scale and to evaluate its effectiveness across various educational disciplines. DISCUSSION The significant improvements in student engagement and retention observed in this study suggest that VR can effectively address some of the limitations of traditional learning methods. The immersive nature of VR might provide a more engaging and interactive learning environment, leading to better educational outcomes. These findings support the potential for VR to be a valuable tool in higher education, particularly in fields that benefit from simulation-based training. However, further research is needed to explore the practical challenges of implementing VR at scale and to evaluate its effectiveness across various educational disciplines.This study uniquely contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence of the sustained benefits of VR in educational settings, highlighting its potential to transform learning experiences and outcomes. The implications of these results suggest the need for educational institutions to consider integrating VR technologies strategically into their curricula to optimize teaching and learning effectiveness.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to address the challenges faced by the cheese industry, particularly concerning the preservation and transfer of traditional cheesemaking knowledge. It emphasises the need for innovative solutions in sustainably managing knowledge and skills amidst changing demographic and technological landscapes. Design/methodology/approach Our approach consists of developing and implementing a digital tool, the cheese eK-Book, which is designed to capture, structure and disseminate cheesemaking knowledge. This tool is based on a semantic network and is accessible via smartphones and tablets and aims to facilitate continuous learning, knowledge transfer and collaboration across diverse stakeholders in the cheese production sector. Findings The study highlights several critical findings. Traditional cheesemaking knowledge is currently at risk due to a number of factors, including the ageing of skilled workers, a lack of succession planning and pressures from globalisation and industrialisation. The European dairy sector is evolving towards more specialised and automated production, requiring a skilled workforce capable of adapting to these changes. There is a significant gap between traditional cheese makers and research institutions, hindering the adoption of new technologies and best practices. The cheese eK-Book offers a promising solution to these challenges by preserving knowledge, supporting continuous learning and enhancing collaboration between industry stakeholders and educational/research institutions. The tool facilitates access to scientific knowledge, promotes work–life balance by offering a range of flexible learning opportunities and supports tailored training programmes based on individual users’ needs. Originality/value This article contributes original insights by proposing a comprehensive digital solution tailored to the specific, current needs of the cheese industry. By integrating modern technology with traditional knowledge, the cheese eK-Book not only preserves expertise but also fosters innovation and sustainability within the sector. It bridges the gap between practical cheesemaking skills and contemporary scientific understanding, addressing critical challenges such as knowledge retention, succession planning and workforce development in a rapidly evolving industry landscape. The strength of the Cheese eK-Book lies in its capacity to communicate knowledge, traditions and teachings across generations. This transfer of knowledge and skills plays a crucial role in preserving heritage and fostering connections across different generations within a community.",

    "Abstract": "Immersive learning is predominantly constrained to technology-based interventions but has the potential for more diverse applications. This study reports on an experiment investigating the learning affordances of psychological immersion evoked by narrative absorption. A total of 228 participants were randomly assigned to one of three forms of media, an image, a word list, and a narrative, all of which contained identical items to be memorized for immediate and delayed free recall memory tests. Other variables measured were immersion, extraneous cognitive load, and mental imagery. ANOVA and correlation analyses showed that the narrative media was found to be significantly more immersive and that it evoked mental imagery in individuals at higher levels than both the list and image media. Importantly, there was more decay in memory recall between immediate and delayed tests for those exposed to the list and the image than for those who read the narrative. This implies the utility of immersive narratives for spontaneous mental image generation, which leads to improved knowledge retention. Other implications for immersive learning theory are discussed, and practical solutions for incorporating narrative immersion in learning are also suggested.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional classroom training sessions can negatively impact participants’ engagement and knowledge retention. In response, several organisations are moving towards innovative and more engaging approaches, such as virtual reality (VR). By using VR, participants can immerse in a simulated environment, acquiring experiences in rare and hazardous situations that cannot be experienced in the natural environment without risk to the participants. VR has been applied in several areas, and this study aims to understand the applicability and impact of VR simulators on human training and perspectives of this emergent area. Drawn on a rigorous systematic literature review of 82 articles, the study presents findings from the thematic analysis. First, descriptive results outline the VR literature and its applications as an innovative training and learning tool. Second, a prescriptive thematic analysis has identified emerging themes related to behavioural, technological, and organisational benefits. The results also show the VR challenges related to technological limitations, restricted resources, and academic research. This study demonstrates the development of VR in human training, presenting contributions to theory and practice. The study presents some limitations related to the scope and focus of the study, and future pathways to address these limitations are suggested. For instance, the research protocol did not consider conference papers or articles that were not in English, and it was limited to a search period. Furthermore, emergent topics such as artificial intelligence and VR technology's physiological-emotional and sensory aspects in training should be addressed. Therefore, future studies should address these topics and use the research agenda suggested in this study.",

    "Abstract": "While quantitative measures regarding the progress of students with intellectual developmental disorders are important, it is also desirable to understand teachers’ perspectives on the value of these tools, as they are the ones who will design educational activities using them. This research explores the perspectives of special education teachers on the benefits of using technology for students with moderate intellectual and developmental disabilities. Nineteen special education teachers participated in semi-structured interviews, and a thematic analysis was conducted based on the transcripts. The findings indicate that, according to the teachers, technologies are valuable tools for students with moderate intellectual and developmental disabilities offering numerous advantages beyond traditional teaching methods. They are both motivating and engaging for students, as it makes learning more enjoyable and less stressful, particularly when it comes to handling mistakes. By adapting to students’ abilities and offering immediate feedback, it helps develop key skills such as reading, writing, and planning. The study highlights that, according to teacher technologies are essential tools in special education for students with moderate intellectual and developmental disabilities, offering innovative, engaging, and supportive learning experiences that foster motivation, improve skill development, and enhance knowledge retention while addressing the individual needs of each student.

    "Abstract": "In an era of rapid scientific advancement, the need for engaging educational tools is critical. DEGRADATOR, a 2D computer game, bridges this gap by immersing players in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a key pathway in cellular protein degradation. Designed for players aged 12 and above, DEGRADATOR introduces the molecular mechanics of targeted protein degradation, including PROTAC drugs. Through 10 levels of gameplay combined with educational quizzes, it represents the first-ever resource of its kind to make this advanced topic accessible and amusing. The game was evaluated by 97 high school students (age 15–19) during biology classes.

    "Abstract": "Background: The utilization of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in healthcare presents an innovative and effective approach for the delivery of emergency medical supplies to rural communities. Providing healthcare students with opportunities to work with UAS prepares them to embrace novel technologies in their future careers. Caring for individuals living in rural communities and those with substance abuse disorders are critical components of current healthcare education. Intervention: This simulation ready-to-use describes an innovative simulation learning exercise (SLE) developed using UAS technologies to address an unexpected opioid overdose in a rural setting. Methods: Students received pre-simulation instruction on the concepts of addiction, emergency management of an opioid overdose, and rural healthcare. Students participated in an unfolding, two-part SLE. Results: The first scenario simulated emergency management of the opioid overdose in which a UAS delivered rescue medications. This was followed by a second scenario simulating continuing care after initial stabilization. Debriefing of the simulation and reflection activities were completed. Discussion: The integration of UAS in healthcare education provides a valuable opportunity for students to increase their knowledge of innovative technologies. The UAS provides educators with a novel resource to expand simulation experiences, increase student engagement, and promote knowledge retention of difficult concepts.

    "Abstract": "Immersive learning is predominantly constrained to technology-based interventions but has the potential for more diverse applications. This study reports on an experiment investigating the learning affordances of psychological immersion evoked by narrative absorption. A total of 228 participants were randomly assigned to one of three forms of media, an image, a word list, and a narrative, all of which contained identical items to be memorized for immediate and delayed free recall memory tests. Other variables measured were immersion, extraneous cognitive load, and mental imagery. ANOVA and correlation analyses showed that the narrative media was found to be significantly more immersive and that it evoked mental imagery in individuals at higher levels than both the list and image media. Importantly, there was more decay in memory recall between immediate and delayed tests for those exposed to the list and the image than for those who read the narrative. This implies the utility of immersive narratives for spontaneous mental image generation, which leads to improved knowledge retention. Other implications for immersive learning theory are discussed, and practical solutions for incorporating narrative immersion in learning are also suggested.

    "Abstract": "The Productive Failure (PF) technique is an educational strategy that uses collaborative problem-solving to facilitate resident physicians' understanding of new concepts. A novel implementation of this approach is PF simulation, in which they engage in simulation before receiving comprehensive teaching on the involved aspects. PF commences with the generation and consolidation phases, where resident physicians develop and analyze the advantages and constraints of various Representations and Solution Methods. These are followed by the knowledge assembly phases, respectively. Wherein physicians gain essential concepts by organizing their representations and thoughts in alignment with established responses. PF is deliberately designed to induce failure in problem-solving; however, in the following review, this process of failure can help resident physicians better acquire target ideas. The crucial aspect of PF design is that throughout the problem-solving phase, physicians receive no instructional support or scaffolding. Explicit failure-driven scaffolding is an alternative method for enhancing the efficacy of preparatory problem-solving. This narrative review examines the theoretical foundation of PF and its role in collaboration, clinical reasoning development, stress management, and knowledge retention among resident physicians. Using cognitive psychology, clinical reasoning theories, and reflective practice, we examined how PF helps people learn from failure, shift from traditional teaching to retain knowledge long-term, and develop flexible skills in complex clinical settings. Highlighting these components underscores the significance of practical simulations, varied information sources, and systematic feedback in cultivating these competencies. The role of PF in medical education policy suggests ways to integrate it into future training models to address current curriculum gaps. Future directions for PF in medical education include individualized learning, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the integration of future technologies such as virtual reality (VR). PF constitutes a viable educational approach for augmenting the clinical and cognitive competencies of resident physicians, equipping them with the intricacies of contemporary medical practices.The Productive Failure (PF) technique is an educational strategy that uses collaborative problem-solving to facilitate resident physicians' understanding of new concepts.

    "Abstract": "The growing impacts of climate change on water resources demand innovative monitoring and management strategies. This paper presents SW3T-IoT, an innovative water monitoring system leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to enhance water resource management under dynamic conditions. The system adopts a three-tier architecture—edge, fog, and cloud—integrating a custom-designed LoRa-WDS node optimized for low power consumption and long-term autonomous operation. These nodes collect real-time data on water level, flow, pressure, temperature, and quality from distribution networks and reservoirs. Data are locally processed at the edge, then transferred to the cloud for advanced analysis and visualization. A Geographic Information System (GIS) enhances spatial awareness and decision-making. To ensure adaptability, SW3T-IoT integrates a continual learning (CL) framework for Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) forecasting. The CL mechanism allows models to incrementally update with new environmental data without catastrophic forgetting, maintaining accuracy and robustness as water quality dynamics evolve. A hybrid CNN–BiLSTM–Attention model, reinforced with PER, AER, LwF, and EWC strategies, supports adaptive prediction and knowledge retention. The system delivers intuitive dashboards for engineers and water managers, providing a holistic, scalable, and intelligent solution for sustainable water resource management.",

    "Abstract": "Background Virtual Simulation Experiments (VSE) are increasingly applied in medical education, yet their role in medical microbiology remains underexplored. This study evaluated a VSE system designed for the isolation, culture, and identification of enteric pathogens, framed by Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). Methods Ninety medical students were randomly assigned to either a VSE group or a traditional teaching group. Outcomes were assessed through operational skill and knowledge tests, supplemented by qualitative feedback. Results The VSE group achieved higher scores in operational skills (89.6 ± 5.2 vs. 81.8 ± 6.3, p  < 0.01) and knowledge retention (87.4 ± 4.4 vs. 81.8 ± 5.0, p  < 0.01). Students reported that VSE’ immersive environment and instant feedback enhanced satisfaction and autonomy, aligning with SDT. Conclusions VSE significantly improved learning outcomes in medical microbiology and promoted intrinsic motivation. These findings provide empirical support for integrating VSE into medical curricula and highlight the need for further research on its long-term and broader educational impact.",

However, limitations include its potential dependency on stable internet connectivity and limited complex assessment features. Google Forms, a versatile survey tool integrated with the Google ecosystem, offers flexibility in creating surveys, quizzes, and assessments. Its strengths include ease of use, data management through Google Sheets, and customizable question formats. However, while suitable for basic assessments, it may lack some advanced features required for complex evaluations and interactive learning. Socrative provides a platform for formative assessment, enabling teachers to create quizzes, assessments, and exit tickets. Its strengths lie in its instant grading, diverse question types, and the ability to track individual student progress. However, its interface might be less intuitive for some users, and its interactive features may be limited compared to other tools. Kahoot is a game-based learning platform that gamifies quizzes and assessments, promoting engagement and motivation among students. Its strengths include its gamified approach, competitive atmosphere, and ease of use. However, its design might favor rote memorization over deeper learning, and it may not be suitable for all types of educational content or assessment formats. This comparative analysis highlights the distinct advantages and limitations of each tool, offering insights for educators and institutions seeking to leverage technology for effective teaching and learning strategies in higher education. Understanding these strengths and weaknesses can aid educators in making informed decisions about selecting and integrating appropriate educational technologies to enhance student engagement, participation, and learning outcomes. Further research and practical implementations can delve deeper into optimizing the use of these tools to cater to diverse educational needs and contexts in higher education.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional teaching methods in Aircraft Maintenance Technology (AMT) often struggle to maintain student engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention. While gamification has been recognised as a potential solution, its application in AMT education remains underexplored, particularly in bridging theoretical knowledge with practical skill acquisition. This study investigates the effectiveness of Kahoot-based gamification in enhancing student engagement, motivation, knowledge retention, and practical skills development. A mixed-methods approach was employed, integrating quantitative surveys, pre- and post-assessments, and qualitative interviews with students and instructors. The study assessed 120 participants, revealing statistically significant improvements: engagement increased by 43.8%, motivation by 55.2%, knowledge retention by 41.2%, and practical skills by 51.6%. Qualitative findings supported these results, with students reporting higher participation, improved concept recall, and greater enthusiasm. Instructors observed enhanced confidence in applying theoretical knowledge. Despite these benefits, challenges such as internet connectivity issues, time constraints, and question format limitations were identified. The study recommends a blended learning approach integrating gamification with hands-on training, scenario-based exercises, and emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Beyond AMT, these findings highlight gamification's potential in technical and vocational education, emphasising the need for future research on adaptive gamification models and AI-driven learning platforms.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The demand for effective disaster preparedness training in hospitals is steadily increasing, as healthcare staff need to handle emergencies efficiently while providing patient care. However, conventional training methods like live drills and tabletop exercises can require significant resources, limit participation, and disrupt hospital operations. In light of these challenges, Virtual Reality (VR) training has emerged as a modern solution, offering an innovative way to improve training efficiency without interfering with routine hospital activities. This study, therefore, examines how VR training compares to traditional methods in preparing hospital personnel for disasters, focusing specifically on effectiveness and cost. Methods: We reviewed studies concerning the effectiveness and economic assessments of VR compared to traditional methods. To answer the research questions, we followed the Canada Drug Agency's guides on conducting a health technology assessment. Articles were identified from both peer-reviewed and gray literature. Results: The review highlights eight pertinent studies demonstrating VR's advantages, including boosting knowledge retention, performance, and overall confidence among healthcare professionals in disaster preparedness. Furthermore, the economic analysis indicates that although the initial costs of VR synchronous training may be higher, the long-term savings from reduced ongoing training and maintenance can lead to greater cost efficiency. In addition, while VR training presents safety benefits, challenges such as cybersickness and accessibility concerns have also been observed. Conclusion: VR training offers considerable advantages over traditional disaster preparedness methods and significantly improves healthcare workers' confidence and skills. Despite the high upfront costs, the potential long-term financial benefits appear promising. To maximize results, funding for VR initiatives must emphasize demonstrated effectiveness alongside ongoing research to explore broader applications and address the challenges posed by these emerging technologies.",

    "Abstract": "In the evolving landscape of digital cultural heritage, the integration of advanced computational models into immersive virtual environments has become essential for enriching user engagement and fostering more meaningful interpretative experiences. As digital heritage platforms increasingly adopt interactive technologies, there is a growing need to move beyond static presentations and introduce intelligent, responsive systems that adapt to individual users’ interests and behaviors. Traditional virtual museum systems often suffer from rigid content structures, limited adaptability, and a lack of personalized storytelling, all of which constrain user immersion and diminish the potential for impactful learning experiences. To overcome these challenges, our approach integrates semantic-topological modeling with adaptive interaction mechanisms, forming a dynamic and personalized digital museum experience. The proposed framework features a hybrid computational architecture that unites symbolic knowledge representations with algorithmic spatial layout generation. This integration enables the creation of flexible narrative trajectories that are contextually relevant and customized according to each user’s cognitive and behavioral profile. Furthermore, the system incorporates reinforcement-driven semantic planning to interpret and respond to user interactions in real time, ensuring a continuously evolving and coherent interpretative journey. Experimental results reveal substantial improvements in user satisfaction, engagement levels, and knowledge retention when compared to traditional virtual museum platforms. These outcomes highlight the scalability and transformative potential of the model, reinforcing its capacity to enhance accessibility, personalization, and educational value across diverse digital heritage applications.",

    "Abstract": "Education 4.0 represents a visionary approach to the future of education, aiming to enhance teaching and learning through advanced technologies. The aim of this research is to determine student attitudes toward the use of Education 4.0 tools in the 7th-grade Science course Electrical Circuits unit. To achieve this, an attitude test was developed to evaluate the integration of Education 4.0 tools into the Science curriculum, and student attitudes were assessed using this test. A \"quasi-experimental design with pre-test and post-test control group,\" one of the quantitative research methods, was used in the study. The research involved 41 seventh-grade students from one public secondary schools in Turkey, with 21 students in the experimental group and 20 in the control group. The \"Attitude Scale toward the Use of Education 4.0 Tools in Science Teaching,\" developed by the researchers, was used as the data collection instrument. The experimental phase lasted four weeks (16 lesson hours), during which the experimental group engaged in activities involving Education 4.0 tools, while the control group followed the curriculum-prescribed activities. The t-test results of the collected data revealed a statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of the experimental and control groups, with the experimental group showing more favorable outcomes. The research findings reveal that students exhibit a positive attitude toward the use of Education 4.0 tools in science education. These results suggest that the integration of Education 4.0 into science education enhances students' understanding of abstract electrical concepts such as electric current, potential difference, resistance, and Ohm's Law, improves knowledge retention, and transforms the learning process into an interactive and discovery-oriented experience. Furthermore, Education 4.0 tools have contributed to the improvement of learning outcomes by promoting student engagement and make learning processes more efficient by improving students' ability to use technology effectively.",

Introduction The integration of technology in medical education has led to the adoption of hybrid teaching methods, combining online lectures with traditional face-to-face clinical practice. While this approach offers flexibility and safety, it raises questions about the impact of potential time lapses between theoretical learning and hands-on experience. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the time interval between online lectures and on-site clinical practice on medical students' performance in orthopedic rotation.A retrospective study was conducted on 116 fifth-year medical students who completed their orthopedic rotation during the 2021/2022 academic year. Students underwent a one-week online course followed by three weeks of on-site clinical practice, with varying time lapses (0-38 weeks) between these periods. Performance was assessed through examinations including key features test (KF), multiple-choice questions (MCQ), multiple-essay questions (MEQ), objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), and long case examination. Spearman's rank correlation was used to analyze the relationship between time lapse and examination scores.

Results The analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between the time lapse duration and KF scores (p 0.05).This study demonstrates that the time lapse between online lectures and clinical rotation in orthopedic education significantly impacts students' performance in key features tests. However, other examination scores remained unaffected. These findings highlight the need for careful scheduling and potential interventions to mitigate the effects of extended time lapses on specific aspects of medical knowledge retention and application in orthopedic education.

    "Abstract": "Background: Gynecology residency training necessitates a robust educational framework to cultivate clinical competency, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Traditional lecture-based teaching methods are deficient in fostering active learning and clinical decision-making. Problem-based learning (PBL) and case-based learning (CBL) have emerged as learner-centered approaches that enhance medical education by integrating theoretical knowledge with clinical practice. This review aims to explain the efficacy, implementation frameworks, challenges, and comparative value of PBL and CBL in gynecology residency education, and explores the role of instructional technology integration. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed, ERIC, Scopus, Embase, and EBSCO (January 2010–January 2025) using keywords: “problem-based learning”, “case-based learning”, “gynecology education”, “residency training”. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies on PBL/CBL interventions in gynecology residency with qualitative/quantitative outcomes. Ten articles met the criteria after screening. Results: Both PBL and CBL significantly outperform in enhancing clinical decision-making, differential diagnosis, knowledge retention, procedural planning, and long-term knowledge application. PBL utilizes open-ended problems to cultivate self-directed learning, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving (eg, managing complex AUB etiologies). CBL employs structured clinical cases to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, improving diagnostic reasoning and patient management skills. Key implementation frameworks involve careful pre-session preparation, facilitator-guided discussions on authentic cases, and structured feedback. Challenges include significant faculty time for case design/facilitation, resource intensity, and competency assessment. PBL fosters deep theoretical understanding, while CBL excels in clinical skill translation. Integrating both approaches creates a balanced curriculum. Augmenting PBL/CBL with simulation, flipped classrooms, mobile learning, and AI enhances accessibility, personalization, and procedural skill practice. Conclusion: PBL and CBL are transformative pedagogical strategies for gynecology residency training, effectively developing competencies needed for complex clinical practice. Successful implementation requires rigorously designed cases, faculty trained in facilitative guidance, and strategic technology integration. These approaches prepare residents not only as skilled technicians but as adaptable, patient-centered practitioners capable of navigating evolving healthcare challenges. Investment in faculty development and technology-enhanced PBL/CBL models is crucial for advancing gynecologic education globally.",

    "Full text": "Background",
    "Case Introduction": "Woman presents with irregular menstrual cycles and heavy bleeding for the past six months. Introduce AUB as the overarching clinical topic. Briefly explain that AUB encompasses a variety of causes, ranging from benign conditions like fibroids and polyps to more serious conditions such as endometrial cancer. Clarify that the learners will focus on understanding the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management of AUB.",
    "Guiding questions": "a) Etiology: How do age, medical history, and risk factors inform the differential diagnosis (eg, structural lesion vs ovulatory dysfunction?) b) Diagnostic work-up: Rationale for selection of tests (transvaginal ultrasound, endometrial biopsy, hysteroscopy). c) Management: Indications/risks of hormone therapy, or hysterectomy. d) Complications: Risks of anemia, endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma, and effects on fertility.",
    "Group Discussion": "Learners propose evidence-based management plans that address: a) Interpretation of pathology findings (eg, endometrial hyperplasia). b) Personalized therapy selection (eg, LNG IUD vs surgery).",
    "Prompt Initial Questions": "Encourage learners to think about the following questions ahead of the case discussion: What are the common causes of AUB in women of reproductive age? How would you approach the differential diagnosis of AUB in a patient like the one described? What diagnostic steps would you take first in evaluating a case of AUB? Clarify Roles and Expectations: If students are working in groups, clarify the roles each member will play (eg, leader, recorder, presenter). Set expectations for collaboration, including active participation and respect for diverse opinions.",
    "Group Discussion and Clinical Decision-Making": "Allow the group to discuss their findings, diagnostic steps, and management plans. Encourage students to justify their decisions with evidence-based guidelines or literature. Guide the discussion to ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant topics and steer learners toward evidence-based conclusions. Resolve the case by discussing the final diagnosis (eg, fibroids causing AUB) and the recommended management plan (eg, medical management with progesterone or surgical intervention). Reflect on the case to reinforce key learning points, such as the importance of considering a broad differential diagnosis and tailoring management to individual patient needs.",

    "Abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a transformative technology in education, enabling immersive simulations that foster student engagement and improve knowledge retention. This study presents a bibliometric analysis of global trends, research patterns, and challenges related to the integration of VR in educational contexts. Data were collected from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), and Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) within the Web of Science Core Collection, including only articles also indexed in Scopus to ensure high-quality and comprehensive coverage. Of the 1220 articles published between 2010 and 2024, 97 met the inclusion criteria based on relevance, accessibility, and methodological rigor. We performed keyword analysis, citation analysis, and thematic mapping using RStudio and the Bibliometrix package. The findings indicate that the United States, China, and the United Kingdom are the most active contributors to VR research in education. VR has been applied across diverse learning modalities, enriching both formal and informal educational environments. However, its widespread adoption faces several barriers, including high implementation costs, health and safety concerns, limited curricular integration, and insufficient educator training. Proposed solutions include strategic partnerships with technology providers and the use of cloud-based infrastructures to reduce costs and complexity. This study offers actionable insights for educators, policymakers, and developers, providing a robust, data-driven foundation for the effective and equitable integration of VR in education.",

    "Abstract": "The development of information and communication technologies has created limitless prospects for using augmented reality (AR) in various fields. Unfortunately, the multitasking nature of AR systems prevents learners from successfully reflecting and retaining knowledge. This study developed and designed a learning analytics dashboard (LAD) with three components: personal learning data, social comparison, and visualization of the learning process, to promote knowledge acquisition and metacognitive awareness among AR learners. A total of 31 intermediate-level Japanese learners participated in an experiment involving pre-tests, post-tests, and a delayed test to assess the LAD. Learners engaged with the AR learning system for Japanese compound verb learning and utilized the LAD to monitor and reflect on their AR learning activities. Behavioral data were analyzed using Lag Sequential Analysis (LSA), while learning performance was evaluated through one-way repeated-measures ANOVA tests. The findings indicate that the use of the LAD significantly improves learning outcomes and metacognitive processes, such as knowledge of cognition and regulation of cognition. Additionally, there were different usage patterns of the dashboard among learners, which corresponded to significant differences in their learning outcomes and changes in metacognitive awareness. Learners who primarily focused on the learning process and social comparison components of the dashboard demonstrated improved knowledge retention. Conversely, those who mainly concentrated on personal learning data experienced the most significant gains in metacognitive awareness. This study also provides crucial design insights on the integration of dashboard components with cognitive efforts to maximize learning outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) in healthcare education offers innovative ways to enhance collaborative learning and improve patient safety. This narrative review examines the synergistic impact of AI-powered virtual reality (VR) simulations, such as those used in surgical training and patient communication, on knowledge acquisition, clinical skill development, and collaborative competencies among healthcare students. It also explores long-term knowledge retention, ethical considerations within virtual scenarios, and the psychological impact of high-stakes simulations on learner resilience. Methods This review is distinguished by its exhaustive literature search, which spanned PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, and other pertinent databases, to identify studies published between 2005 and 2024. The distinct focus on AI and VR interventions in healthcare education, particularly those with outcomes related to interdisciplinary learning or patient safety, distinguishes this review. Data were thematically analyzed across domains, including adaptive learning, technical skill development, teamwork, patient safety, and ethics. Results The findings of this review carry significant practical implications. Five key themes emerged: adaptive learning ( n  = 17), immersive skill development ( n  = 10), teamwork enhancement ( n  = 10), patient safety ( n  = 18), and ethical considerations ( n  = 21). These themes underscore the potential of AI and VR in healthcare education. AI-driven adaptive systems enabled personalized VR training, enhancing engagement and knowledge retention. Real-time AI feedback during simulations improved decision-making in safe, controlled environments. Interdisciplinary team simulations enhanced communication and collaboration, which are crucial for effective clinical care. Ethical modules embedded in VR scenarios promoted moral reasoning. Several studies also reported increased learner confidence in performing clinical procedures following VR training, suggesting enhanced preparedness for practice. Conclusion The integration of AI and VR holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare education, fostering personalized, immersive, and ethically informed learning. These technologies enhance technical proficiency and equip students with the complex demands of modern clinical practice. Strategic implementation can contribute to error reduction, improved patient outcomes, and a culture of safety. However, the journey is not over. Continued research is crucial for assessing the long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of these educational innovations, as well as for keeping pace with the rapidly evolving field of AI and VR in healthcare education.",

Methods A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed, ERIC, Scopus, Embase, and EBSCO (January 2010-January 2025) using keywords: \"problem-based learning\", \"case-based learning\", \"gynecology education\", \"residency training\". Inclusion criteria encompassed studies on PBL/CBL interventions in gynecology residency with qualitative/quantitative outcomes. Ten articles met the criteria after screening.Both PBL and CBL significantly outperform in enhancing clinical decision-making, differential diagnosis, knowledge retention, procedural planning, and long-term knowledge application. PBL utilizes open-ended problems to cultivate self-directed learning, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving (eg, managing complex AUB etiologies). CBL employs structured clinical cases to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, improving diagnostic reasoning and patient management skills. Key implementation frameworks involve careful pre-session preparation, facilitator-guided discussions on authentic cases, and structured feedback. Challenges include significant faculty time for case design/facilitation, resource intensity, and competency assessment. PBL fosters deep theoretical understanding, while CBL excels in clinical skill translation. Integrating both approaches creates a balanced curriculum. Augmenting PBL/CBL with simulation, flipped classrooms, mobile learning, and AI enhances accessibility, personalization, and procedural skill practice.

    "Abstract": "To improve the effectiveness of English-Chinese bilingual learning, this study introduces an optimization model that combines semantic analysis with neural machine translation (NMT). A series of comprehensive experiments were conducted to evaluate its performance. The results demonstrated that the proposed model outperformed existing approaches across multiple key metrics, including reading comprehension, translation accuracy, and learning efficiency. Specifically, the optimized model achieved a reading comprehension score of 85.0, a grammar accuracy rate of 82.5%, and a vocabulary score of 80.1. For translation performance, it attained a sentence-level accuracy of 84.3%, paragraph coherence of 81.5%, and a cultural understanding score of 78.9. In terms of learning efficiency, the model reduced average learning time to 45.3 min, reached a knowledge retention rate of 80.2%, and improved autonomous learning ability to 78.5%. Learner satisfaction also improved, with an interest level score of 4.3, a teaching method satisfaction score of 4.0, and an overall satisfaction score of 4.2 (on a 5-point scale). Compared with rule-based translation systems and models using word embeddings or basic neural networks, the proposed model demonstrated clear advantages in all areas of evaluation. Overall, this study offers a valuable contribution to the advancement of computer-assisted language learning technologies.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The current information and communication technologies, digital literacy, and ease of access to communication and information devices by nurses provide them with new ways and intention to access information for technical-scientific updating, ensuring the quality and safety of health care. Mobile learning (m-learning) offers a flexible and accessible alternative for continuing professional education, overcoming barriers such as time constraints and financial burden. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of m-learning in nurses’ knowledge retention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease self-management, using a Massive Open Online Course with integrated virtual clinical simulation. Methods: A quasi-experimental pre- and posttest study was conducted, with no control group, among 168 nurses from a Portuguese hospital. The intervention included an asynchronous online course with 13 modules. Knowledge retention was assessed by comparing the mean scores before and after the course. Results: The results indicated a significant increase in knowledge retention. The participants’ average score increased from 59.97% in the initial assessment to 84.05% in the final assessment ( P <.001). Nurses with a master’s degree exhibited a higher level of basic knowledge than those with a bachelor’s degree. The course completion rate was 93.45%, reflecting significant engagement attributed to gamification and clinically relevant content. Conclusions: This study confirms the effectiveness of m-learning in improving knowledge retention in nursing. This strategy is a valuable approach to lifelong learning, promoting quality and safety in delivering health care. m-learning is useful in nurses’ lifelong learning, offering flexibility and more effective support for clinical practice. Integrating virtual simulation and gamification boosted motivation and reduced drop-out rates, highlighting the potential of m-learning in lifelong learning in health care.",

    "Abstract": "Tacit knowledge loss poses a significant challenge in the South African explosives manufacturing sector, where specialized expertise is critical for operational efficiency and safety. This study examines the role of Knowledge Management (KM) practices in mitigating tacit knowledge loss, employing a quantitative cross-sectional design with data from 350 respondents. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess the reliability and validity of critical success factors (CSFs) and KM enablers. Findings indicate that human-oriented factors—such as leadership, organizational culture, and mentoring—are essential for effective knowledge transfer, while technology-driven solutions, such as documentation and databases, support knowledge retention. This research provides empirical insights into KM strategies tailored for high-risk industries, contributing to both theory and practice. The study highlights the need for integrated KM approaches to sustain competitive advantage and proposes recommendations for future research on longitudinal KM effectiveness.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for personalized learning path generation by integrating deep knowledge tracing and cognitive load estimation within a unified framework. We propose a dual-stream neural network architecture that simultaneously models students’ knowledge states and cognitive load levels to optimize learning trajectories. The knowledge state tracking module employs a bidirectional Transformer with graph attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between knowledge components, while the cognitive load estimation module utilizes multimodal data analysis to dynamically assess mental effort during learning activities. A dual-objective optimization algorithm balances knowledge acquisition with cognitive load management to generate paths that maintain optimal challenge levels. Experimental evaluations across multiple educational domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy (87.5%), path quality (4.4/5), and learning efficiency (24.6% improvement). The implemented system supports real-time adaptation based on performance and cognitive state, resulting in reduced frustration, higher engagement, and improved knowledge retention. This research contributes to both theoretical understanding of learning processes and practical implementation of next-generation adaptive educational technologies.",

    "Abstract": "This article proposes a novel conceptual framework that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) to enhance Open Distance eLearning (ODeL) systems. By bridging the gap between traditional cognitive theories and cutting-edge AI technologies, this framework supports adaptive cognitive load management, AI-mediated schema creation, and human-AI collaborative learning. A refined critique of Twabu's (2023) PhD study, based on conceptual analysis of its theoretical scope and limitations, highlights the absence of AI integration. This article presents a unique contribution by synthesizing established cognitive theories with the dynamic potential of AI, a perspective underrepresented in current literature. Practical examples, policy recommendations, and ethical considerations are consolidated to offer a comprehensive path forward. The study proposes an expanded framework incorporating \"AI-enhanced cognitive load management,\" \"AI-mediated schema creation,\" and \"human-AI collaborative learning.\" The Literature review and theoretical framework emphasises AI's role in simplifying cognitive processes by dynamically adjusting content presentation based on learner needs and performance. This includes AI-mediated adjustments to manage cognitive load and enhance schema development through personalised feedback and tailored content delivery. Such integration promises to create a more effective learning environment by aligning multimedia content with individual learner profiles, thus addressing the challenge of cognitive overload and improving knowledge retention and understanding.",

    "Abstract": "Background Education has continuously evolved to keep pace with advancements in information technology. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an innovative and effective learning approach that enhances student engagement, particularly in developing problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Since its introduction in the early 1980s, VR has gained increasing attention in nursing education due to its potential to improve learning outcomes and skill acquisition. However, there is a need for further research to explore its impact on critical thinking disposition among nursing students. Methods This quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study was conducted with a convenience sample of 190 nursing students from Damietta University’s Faculty of Nursing. Participants were assessed on their critical thinking disposition and VR-related knowledge at three time points: before the intervention, immediately after, and two months post-intervention. Aim: The VR-based educational program aimed to improve students’ critical thinking disposition and assess their knowledge of virtual reality before, during, and after the program. Results A statistically significant improvement in students’ mean scores for critical thinking disposition was observed across all evaluations ( p  < 0.001). The effect size (η² p  ≥ 0.14) indicated a substantial impact, reinforcing the effectiveness of the VR-based educational program in fostering higher-order cognitive skills. Additionally, students demonstrated increased retention of VR-related knowledge when assessed immediately after the program and again after two months. Conclusions This study highlights the transformative potential of VR as an educational tool in nursing. VR-based learning promotes active engagement, knowledge retention, and skill development in a safe and controlled environment. By integrating VR programs into nursing education, institutions can enhance students’ critical thinking, collaboration, and communication skills, ultimately preparing them for real-world clinical practice. Given these findings, educational institutions should consider incorporating VR technology to support the continuous development of essential nursing competencies. Trial registration This study is formally registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier Code: NCT06622811; Registration Date: 01/10/2024).",

    "Abstract": "Background Active learning approaches that promote participation, critical thinking, and practical competency are becoming more and more necessary in medical and nursing education. Virtual reality (VR) and gamification, especially in the context of escape rooms, have become popular instructional technology in response to these issues. The interactive, scenario-based learning environments provided by these tools encourage motivation, teamwork, and decision-making. The impact and transformative possibilities of incorporating virtual reality and gamified escape rooms into medical and nursing education are examined in this paper. Methods The use of virtual reality (VR), gamification, and escape rooms in medical and nursing education was investigated using a thorough narrative literature review. In order to give a comprehensive and holistic overview of new subjects, this method was selected. Keywords like “escape room,” “digital escape room,” “online escape room,” “gamification,” “game-based education,” “virtual reality in medical education,” “medical student,” “nursing education,” “nursing student,” and “nursing staff” were used in the January 10, 2025, search across Web of Science, PubMed, ERIC, and Scopus. English-language publications from the past ten years that addressed virtual reality, gamification, or escape rooms in medical or nursing education were included in the inclusion criteria. Non-relevant papers, non-peer-reviewed literature, and research with unclear methodology or no empirical data were among the exclusion criteria. 25 studies were chosen for a thorough assessment after a rigorous screening process based on methodological rigor and relevance. Results The total number of retrieved articles in Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science on January 10, 2025, was 172. After removing 64 duplicate articles, 108 papers were screened by experts. After this investigation, 25 articles were extensively reviewed for the results section. The findings from the selected studies can be categorized into four main areas: enhancing clinical decision-making, improving teamwork and collaboration, increasing knowledge retention and engagement, and reducing stress in high-pressure scenarios. These studies, summarized in Table 1, highlight the effectiveness of escape rooms and VR-based training in medical and nursing education, particularly in emergency medicine, pharmacy, radiology, internal medicine, and psychiatry. Conclusion The integration of VR and gamified escape rooms in healthcare education presents a promising approach to improving clinical training and competency development among medical students, nursing students, and healthcare professionals. The findings underscore the need for further research and implementation of these tools to enhance experiential learning and optimize medical education outcomes. By leveraging gamification and VR simulations, medical training programs can bridge educational gaps and improve patient care delivery in both traditional and remote learning environments.

    "Abstract": "Outdoor experiences significantly enrich intangible cultural heritage tourism, yet limited interaction often restricts deep cultural learning. This research investigates how a mobile application, grounded in experiential learning theory, enhances tourists’ learning about Tang Sancai, a form of Chinese intangible cultural heritage, in the outdoor setting of Sancai Town, Luoyang. Employing a theory learning behavior design scenario framework, the application integrates activity-based exploration, reflective multimedia content, and immersive simulation scenarios to promote active participation, critical reflection, and context-rich outdoor learning experiences. Controlled experiments using pre- and post-tests and questionnaires revealed that participants using the application significantly outperformed those using conventional digital tools in knowledge retention, comprehension, and experiential learning outcomes. Technology acceptance analysis highlighted perceived usefulness as a critical driver of learning success. However, limited effects on behavioral progression suggest that short-term digital interactions may not sustain long-term behavioral change. This research offers a replicable mobile learning framework for outdoor cultural education, extends experiential learning theory to informal tourism contexts, and provides practical insights into using technology to enrich outdoor educational experiences, while supporting heritage preservation.",

    "Full text": "1. Introduction Cultural heritage encompasses the legacy of physical artifacts, sites, and intangible attributes inherited from past generations. Cultural heritage is broadly categorized into tangible and intangible forms. Tangible cultural heritage includes physical artifacts such as buildings, monuments, landscapes, artworks, and archeological sites preserved for their historical, cultural, or artistic significance (UNESCO, 1972). In contrast, intangible cultural heritage (ICH) refers to the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, and skills recognized by communities as part of their cultural heritage, such as oral traditions, performing arts, social practices, traditional craftsmanship, and knowledge concerning nature and the universe (UNESCO, 2003). However, ICH faces increasing challenges from globalization and modernization, including disrupted transmission and declining audiences. Traditional oral transmission and apprenticeship methods struggle to meet modern demands, necessitating innovative approaches to dissemination and education (Dagnino et al., 2018). UNESCO underscores that integrating ICH into formal and informal education enhances educational relevance and quality, ensuring its continuity among younger generations (Aziz et al., 2020; UNESCO, n.d.).",
    "3.3.1. Activity Scenario": "Seeking Challenging Tasks This scenario uses interactive features to encourage tourists to undertake moderately difficult, goal-oriented tasks, fostering intrinsic motivation and active participation. Three themed routes were created: “historical exploration”, “craft exploration”, and “integrated exploration”, each consisting of five to six connected attractions. Tourists choose a route based on their interests and complete interactive tasks at each stop. A step-by-step unlocking system grants access to the Sancai pottery simulation game upon completing a route (Figure 3), promoting deeper engagement and linking the exploration to hands-on learning.",
    "3.3.2. Information Scenario": "Critical Reflection This scenario fosters critical reflection on Tang Sancai culture through layered multimedia content and interactive feedback. A structured progression system ensures that tourists complete hands-on tasks before accessing deeper reflective content, preventing superficial engagement. After finishing tasks at each attraction, tourists access multimedia materials (images, videos, and audio) that explore the site’s significance and the cultural depth of Tang Sancai, accompanied by guided reflection prompts that encourage tourists to connect their hands-on experience with cultural meanings, prompting reflection immediately after the experience. An interactive commenting feature also allows tourists to share their thoughts, creating opportunities for dialog and a deeper exploration of Tang Sancai’s cultural value (Figure 4). This structured approach addresses ELT’s limitations in short-term contexts by ensuring that tourists have adequate time and structured guidance to achieve deeper reflective understanding.",
    "3.3.3. Interactive Scenario": "Immersive Engagement To support immersive engagement, this scenario features a touch-based simulation game that reconstructs the full Tang Sancai pottery-making process. Tourists follow guided steps—shaping, glazing, high-temperature bisque firing, and low-temperature re-firing—experiencing the craftsmanship virtually. Upon completion, users can share their pottery on a community platform, encouraging peer interaction and reinforcing cultural identity. This activity aligns with the “concrete experience” and “active experimentation” stages of Kolb’s experiential learning cycle (Figure 5).",
    "5.3. Technology Acceptance": "Perceived Usefulness and Ease of Use Table 6 presents the group differences in the two core dimensions of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The experimental group reported significantly higher scores in perceived usefulness (PU) (M = 5.90, SD = 0.66) compared with the control group (M = 4.81, SD = 0.84), with t = 6.55, p < 0.001 and a large effect size (Cohen’s d = 1.44). In perceived ease of use (PEOU), the experimental group also scored higher (M = 5.66, SD = 0.79) than the control group (M = 5.32, SD = 0.67), with t = 2.12, p < 0.05 and a moderate effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.46). These results indicate that the application received more favorable evaluations across both TAM dimensions, particularly in perceived usefulness.",

    "Abstract": "Immersive tools are being adopted as an alternative to traditional education methods, especially in engineering curricula, where it is common to integrate various disciplines such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of immersive tools and serious games in improving student engagement and knowledge retention in engineering education. This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, analyzing 31 articles published between 2020 and 2025 across four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Dimensions, and ScienceDirect). Articles were included if they complied with the following inclusion criteria: using (any) immersive tools, carrying out evaluation methods, and participation of students in STEM-related engineering courses. The data extracted encompassed sample characteristics, game attributes, evaluation methods, and results. The findings suggest that immersive tools positively impact students’ engagement and motivation. However, challenges such as potential motion sickness, complexity of serious games (SGs), and high implementation costs exist. SG design must balance engagement, immersion and pedagogical effectiveness to ensure viability. Future research should assess long-term impacts and promote methodological consistency across studies, particularly in subject areas and sample demographics, while determining a way to reduce motion sickness and alleviating SG complexity and difficulty.",

    "Full text": "1. Introduction 1.1. Context of Engineering Education Engineering education is inherently interdisciplinary, encompassing a wide range of knowledge areas, such as mathematics, technology, and science, that prepare students to take on complex challenges. Throughout their academic journey, engineering students engage in diverse subjects varying from fundamental courses such as math and physics to more complex and specific ones, such as thermodynamics, machine learning, or control systems. Each is designed to enhance their proficiency across different knowledge domains and develop essential skill sets and problem-solving. Engineering curricula go beyond traditional subjects, integrating science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) elements to develop analytical, problem-solving, and technical skills [1]. As STEM education aims to strengthen students’ competencies in those four core areas, the increasing enrollment in STEM-related courses is a testament to its growing importance. Between 2007 and 2017, university enrollment in STEM fields across Europe rose from 22% to 28%, with notable increases in countries such as Germany, Greece, Finland, Estonia, Romania, and Portugal, reflecting the expanding emphasis on interdisciplinary education [2].",

    "Abstract": "The rapid emergence of Industry 4.0 technologies has transformed manufacturing, requiring a workforce skilled in automation, data-driven decision-making, and process optimisation. While traditional education includes structured formats such as lectures and tutorials, it may not always equip graduates with the hands-on expertise demanded by modern industrial challenges. This study presents a Mixed Reality (MR)-based educational framework that promotes interactive experiences to enhance students’ engagement with and understanding of Industry 4.0 concepts, aiming to bridge the skills gap through immersive Virtual Learning Factories (VLFs). The framework was developed using a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative feedback with quantitative benchmarking. A proof-of-concept MR application was developed and tested at the (Anonymised), simulating Industry 4.0 scenarios in an engineering education context to validate the framework. The findings indicate that MR-based learning improved students’ engagement with the academic content, leading to better knowledge retention and deeper conceptual understanding. The students also demonstrated enhanced problem-solving, process optimisation, and adaptability compared to traditional methods. The immersive nature of MR provided an interactive, context-rich environment that fostered active learning. This research highlights MR’s potential as a transformative educational tool, aligning academic training with industry needs. Future research is recommended to evaluate the framework’s scalability and long-term effectiveness.",

    "Full text": "1. Introduction Industry 4.0 is reshaping modern manufacturing. The sector is undergoing a fundamental transformation, driven by intelligent automation and data-driven decision-making [1]. McKinsey’s 2024 The State of AI report [2] highlights the strategic advantage of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing, where the seamless integration of digital processes enhances efficiency and competitiveness [2]. According to the report [2], 40% of surveyed organisations attribute more than 5% of their Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) to these advancements, while top-performing firms, namely those deriving at least 20% of their EBIT from Industry 4.0, are 1.6 times more likely to increase their investment in these technologies by over 50% in the next three years [2]. This pattern underscores how early adopters consolidate market leadership through continuous innovation. Companies that delay adoption risk falling behind, facing competitive disadvantages and long-term sustainability challenges. However, technological advancement alone is insufficient; manufacturing success depends on a well-integrated socio-technical system that aligns innovation with workforce development. While Industry 4.0 offers substantial economic benefits, its full potential relies on equipping workers with the skills to operate and optimise these systems [1,3]. Without this dual investment in technology and human capital, the transformative impact of Industry 4.0 will remain limited.",

    "Abstract": "Immersive learning is predominantly constrained to technology-based interventions but has the potential for more diverse applications. This study reports on an experiment investigating the learning affordances of psychological immersion evoked by narrative absorption. A total of 228 participants were randomly assigned to one of three forms of media, an image, a word list, and a narrative, all of which contained identical items to be memorized for immediate and delayed free recall memory tests. Other variables measured were immersion, extraneous cognitive load, and mental imagery. ANOVA and correlation analyses showed that the narrative media was found to be significantly more immersive and that it evoked mental imagery in individuals at higher levels than both the list and image media. Importantly, there was more decay in memory recall between immediate and delayed tests for those exposed to the list and the image than for those who read the narrative. This implies the utility of immersive narratives for spontaneous mental image generation, which leads to improved knowledge retention. Other implications for immersive learning theory are discussed, and practical solutions for incorporating narrative immersion in learning are also suggested.",

    "Abstract": "Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) prioritizes system design through models rather than documents, and it is implemented with the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), which is the state-of-the-art language in academia and industry. Virtual Reality (VR), an immersive visualization technology, can simulate reality in virtual environments with varying degrees of fidelity. In recent years, the technology industry has invested substantially in the development of head-mounted displays (HMDs) and related virtual reality (VR) technologies. Various research has suggested that VR-based immersive design reviews enhance system issue/fault identification, collaboration, focus, and presence compared to non-immersive approaches. Additionally, several research efforts have demonstrated that the VR environment provides higher understanding and knowledge retention levels than traditional approaches. In recent years, multiple attempts have been made to visualize conventional 2D SysML diagrams in a virtual reality environment. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no empirical evaluation has been performed to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of visualizing SysML diagrams in a VR environment. Hence, the authors aimed to evaluate four key benefit types and drawbacks through experiments with human subjects. The authors chose four benefit types—Systems Understanding, Information Sharing, Modeling and Training Experience, and Digital Twin based on the MBSE value and benefits review performed by researchers and benefits claimed by the evaluations for similar visual formalism languages. Experiments were conducted to compare the understanding, interaction, and knowledge retention for 3D VR and conventional 2D SysML diagrams. The authors chose a ground-based telescope system as the system of interest (SOI) for system modeling. The authors utilized a standalone wireless HMD unit for a virtual reality experience, which enabled experiments to be conducted irrespective of location. Students and experts from multiple disciplines, including systems engineering, participated in the experiment and provided their opinions on the VR SysML implementation. The knowledge test, perceived evaluation results, and post-completion surveys were analyzed to determine whether the 3D VR SysML implementation improved these benefits and identified potential drawbacks. The authors utilized a few VR scenario efficacy measures, namely the Simulation Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and System Usability Scale (SUS), to avoid evaluation design-related anomalies.",

    "Full text": "1. Introduction Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a formalized methodology that employs digital models for the design and analysis of systems and is utilized throughout the entire lifecycle of a system, from initial conception to eventual decommissioning. Contemporary systems engineers operate in an era characterized by the escalating complexity of modern systems [1,2]. To manage the complexities inherent in various Systems of Interest(SOI), researchers have proposed MBSE as an effective solution [3,4,5,6]. In the traditional document-centric systems engineering approach, any change in a requirement specification will mandate changes in multiple documents, where the specification parameter is utilized or mentioned. In a similar scenario, the responsible systems engineer will update the requirement specification once within the MBSE tool and propagate the change throughout the system model with less effort than in the document-centric approach. In addition, MBSE standardizes how system engineering artifacts should be defined for a system of interest, such as requirements, operational concepts, use cases, architecture, and behaviors. This standardization of systems engineering practice reduces the cost and effort required to develop a project or system by eliminating inconsistencies and waste early in the design process.",

    "Abstract": "The integration of technology into physical education (PE) has grown significantly in recent years, aiming to enhance student engagement, learning outcomes, and long-term adherence to physical activity. This study aims to critically examine the impact of technology-enhanced pedagogy in PE by reviewing the latest research on digital tools used in teaching and learning. Specifically, it explores how these technologies affect student engagement, knowledge retention, motor skill development, and self-regulated learning. Additionally, it seeks to identify potential barriers and strategies for optimizing their implementation in PE curricula. This study conducts a literature review, applying thematic analysis to categorize findings into key areas such as wearable technology, gamification, virtual and augmented reality, and artificial intelligence in physical education. Focused on the literature published between 2010 and 2025, it was conducted using academic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Finally, 151 articles were selected involving data extraction and qualitative synthesis of findings. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed empirical studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that investigated the application of technology in PE. The findings suggest that integrating technology into PE enhances motivation, engagement, motor skills, tactical understanding, and cognitive learning. However, issues such as digital inequality, lack of teacher training, and ethical concerns regarding student data collection pose significant challenges to widespread adoption. Also, this review identifies critical gaps and ethical considerations in the use of technology in PE, offering practical recommendations for its effective integration. Technology-enhanced pedagogy in PE offers numerous advantages, but its success depends on proper implementation, adequate teacher training, and equitable access to resources. However, this study is limited by the variability of methodologies across the reviewed studies, which may impact the generalizability of the findings.",

Introduction From 1990 to 2024, according to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2024), the prevalence of overweight among adolescents and children, including obesity, has risen from 8% to 22% by 2024 (WHO, 2024; World Obesity Federation, 2024). Regarding the adult population, 43% of people aged 18 and older were overweight, an increase of 18% since 1990 (WHO, 2024). The imbalance between calorie intake and expenditure leads to health problems that, in some cases, lead to more serious problems, including death. This is one of the reasons why physical education has become a fundamental subject in the different educational curricula in many countries.",

    "Abstract": "The integration of Extended Reality (XR) technologies into Industry 5.0 offers innovative solutions for industrial training by overcoming the limitations of traditional methods, such as high costs, inefficiencies, and production disruptions. These technologies enable immersive and scalable training environments, providing workers with hands-on experience while minimizing risks and resource constraints. This study presents an XR-based training platform designed to enhance workforce skills in health and safety, robotic system operations, and maintenance through immersive Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) scenarios. Evaluated by 22 participants from diverse professional backgrounds, the platform achieved a 50% reduction in training time compared to conventional methods, while significantly improving skill acquisition and task efficiency. Participants rated immersive VR environments highly (4.4/5) for engagement and knowledge retention, with usability and instructions also scoring positively (4/5). Scenario-based performance showed the average scores in health and safety tasks (72 points), while robotic system operations (60 points) and maintenance (54 points) reflected increasing task complexity. Despite moderate cognitive demands, the platform effectively balanced mental effort with engagement, providing an accessible and effective training experience. These findings underscore the potential of XR technologies to transform industrial training by enhancing efficiency, safety, and scalability, aligning with the evolving needs of Industry 5.0.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: With an emphasis on the function of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated instructional content, the current study attempts to investigate the impact of fluoride-related cultural and literary tales on information retention. The study investigates the links between exposure to fluoride narratives, learners' attitudes about fluoride narratives, engagement with AI-based platforms, and perceived utility of AI-generated information by utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Additionally, the study looks at how AI involvement and attitudes affect knowledge retention through serial and mediating effects. Methods This study used a cross-sectional survey approach with students in China's Jiangxi and Henan provinces as its target population. The relationship between exposure to fluoride narratives in educational materials, perceptions of the value of AI-generated information, interaction with AI platforms, and knowledge retention was examined through the application of structural equation modeling, or SEM. The pathways in the Technology Acceptance Model were examined using cross-sectional and serial mediation analyses. Of particular interest was the effect of AI-driven educational material on attitudes and engagement that lead to knowledge retention. Results: The results show that learners' views regarding fluoride and their engagement with AI platforms are greatly impacted when they are exposed to fluoride narratives in instructional content. These elements also highly predict the memory of fluoride-related knowledge. The study shows that the association between knowledge retention and the perceived utility of AI-generated information is entirely mediated by positive sentiments regarding the narratives and involvement with AI-based learning platforms. The impact of AI-generated material on knowledge retention is contingent upon learners' attitudes and their degree of involvement with AI platforms, as demonstrated by serial mediation studies. Research Limitation/Implication: Since the cross-sectional methodology makes it difficult to determine causal linkages, further longitudinal research is required to fully comprehend the long-term impacts of AI-enhanced instructional content on knowledge retention. To improve the study's validity, more objective measures of engagement and information retention should be included in subsequent studies. Orginality: This work presents a unique use of TAM in the context of educational technology, focusing on how AI-generated material might support learning experiences that are narrative-driven and culturally rich. This work contributes to the understanding of how technology acceptance affects information retention within the context of fluoride-related cultural and literary tales by mapping the intermediary processes of learner attitudes and Al engagement.",

    "Abstract": "The transition to sustainable energy systems presents a critical challenge for the 21st century, necessitating both technological advancements and transformative educational strategies to foster awareness and knowledge. Hydrogen technologies are pivotal for decarbonization, yet public understanding and acceptance remain limited. This study introduces and evaluates a novel gamified educational framework, uniquely integrating simulation-based learning, collaborative problem-solving, and adaptive instructional scaffolding to enhance hydrogen literacy and sustainability awareness. Unlike traditional pedagogical approaches, this method actively engages learners in real-world decision-making scenarios, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications. This study involved adolescents aged 13–15 from two distinct educational and cultural contexts, one in Europe and one in the Middle East. A pre–post study design assessed knowledge acquisition, gamification engagement, and environmental awareness shifts. Findings reveal statistically significant improvements in technical knowledge and strong positive perceptions of gamified learning as an effective sustainability education tool across both cultural groups (Europe and the Middle East). Variations in engagement across cultural contexts suggest the need for adaptive, context-sensitive educational frameworks. While the findings indicate significant short-term knowledge gains, this study does not assess long-term knowledge retention, which remains an important area for future research. This research contributes to sustainability education by demonstrating how strategically designed gamification can foster behavioral engagement, enhance environmental literacy, and support the global energy transition agenda. This study offers a pioneering perspective on integrating interactive learning methodologies to cultivate sustainability competencies among younger generations.",

    "Full text": "1. Introduction Climate change and the transition to more sustainable energy sources represent two of the most critical global challenges. Addressing these challenges requires innovative solutions, including educational approaches to equip younger generations with the knowledge and skills to tackle complex technological and environmental issues. Sustainability education plays a crucial role in fostering environmental literacy, energy awareness, and responsible decision-making, aligning with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 4 (quality education) and SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy).",
    "- Points-based reinforcement": "participants earn points and rewards for completing tasks, reinforcing positive learning behaviors.",
    "- Collaborative learning": "teams work to solve problems, aligning with Vygotsky’s (1978) [57] social learning theory.",
    "- Competitive elements": "the Grand Prix finale and bonus seconds drive engagement through friendly competition.",
    "- Scaffolded learning": "challenges progressively increase in complexity, allowing participants to build on prior knowledge and skills.",
    "The Goal": "The goal of the H2Student game is for teams to assemble a functioning car model from LEGO bricks, which is connected to a mobile application to test its operability. After successfully testing their vehicles, teams design the car’s appearance and prepare a promotional campaign to simulate real-world challenges of introducing hydrogen-based mobility solutions to the public. This step allows participants to apply their knowledge of hydrogen technologies in a broader context, reinforcing their understanding of key concepts such as efficiency, sustainability, and commercialization. The game is designed to ensure that all teams successfully build a vehicle and compete in the final “Grand Prix” challenge.",
    "Bonus Seconds": "During the game, teams earn bonus seconds, which improve their starting position in the final competition. Bonus seconds are awarded for completing tasks such as answering quiz questions, creating the best marketing presentation, designing the most esthetically pleasing car, and assembling the car quickly. The marketing presentation task evaluates participants’ ability to communicate key hydrogen-related concepts using predefined rubrics that assess factual accuracy, persuasiveness, and clarity. Similarly, the car esthetics task follows structured criteria that focus on innovation, thematic consistency with sustainability, and functional design choices. To ensure fairness and minimize subjectivity, these tasks were evaluated by expert moderators with a background in hydrogen technologies and sustainable design using a standardized scoring system. These tasks incorporate knowledge of hydrogen properties, its advantages and disadvantages, and key elements of the hydrogen supply chain. Quiz questions are adapted to the participants’ age group and prior knowledge, covering essential topics such as hydrogen properties, production methods, electrolysis, fuel cells, and aspects of transportation, storage, safety, and sustainability. Example questions include the following:",
    "Team Organization": "The game allows multiple teams (at least two), each consisting of four to six members. The number of teams depends on the space and the availability of car assembly kits. Each team selects a company name symbolizing hydrogen vehicle production and sets up a designated workspace representing their “factory”.",

    "Abstract": "Theoretical background: Occupational safety training is crucial for reducing workplace risks, but traditional approaches often struggle to fully engage participants or guarantee effective knowledge retention. Over the past decade, interest in using technology-based active learning strategies has grown, with active learning focusing on practical approaches that actively engage workers in the learning process. Objective: The research aims to identify the active learning strategies currently employed in OS training and assess the benefits and challenges of these approaches. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted in line with the PRISMA guidelines. After a rigorous selection process based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 24 eligible articles were identified from the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. Results: Technology-based active learning strategies, especially serious games, enhance the comprehension of safety procedures. Simulating risk scenarios and providing immediate feedback facilitates knowledge transfer to real-world environments. However, limitations are evident, such as technical complexity, high implementation costs, and difficulties in acceptance by less experienced users. Conclusions: The study concludes by emphasizing the need for targeted research to overcome the identified challenges, such as improving simulation realism, reducing costs through collaborative partnerships, and addressing usability issues for different worker populations.",

    "Full text": "1. Introduction Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in attention to occupational safety (OS), accompanied by a steady rise in legislation and regulations aimed at safeguarding occupational health and safety (OHS).",
    "3.2.1. Descriptive Results Population": "The analysis of the populations examined in the 24 studies included in this systematic literature review reveals that in most instances (n = 17), workers were involved. In two studies, both workers and students participated (n = 2). Additionally, in five cases (n = 5), the studies focused on university students, while in one case (n = 1), interns were included.",
    "Occupational sector": "Regarding the occupational sectors, most studies came from the construction sector (n = 11), followed by educational (n = 4), mining (n = 2), and chemical (n = 2). Other contexts represented included electrical substations (n = 1), aviation (n = 1), maritime navigation (n = 1), and healthcare (n = 1).",
    "Methods": "This systematic literature review identified three primary methods used to evaluate the effectiveness of training programs: post-training questionnaires (n = 22) to capture user perceptions and feedback on their active learning experience [18,19,20,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,45], pre- and post-training questionnaires (n = 8) to compare engagement and satisfaction levels before and after training [20,36,37,38], and interviews (n = 2) to gather detailed participant insights on training impacts [18,27].",
    "Active learning": "Most studies (n = 22) utilized serious games (SGs) as the primary strategy for active learning. Specifically, within the construction and mining sectors (n = 13), some SGs were based on Building Information Modeling (BIM) (n = 3), a design and project management methodology that integrates all the relevant data and information for construction projects. Additionally, SGs focused on guiding users in the correct selection and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) on construction sites (n = 4). These games enable players to interact with virtual PPE, learn about its proper application, and recognize the risks associated with neglecting safety gear. By immersing users in realistic scenarios, these SGs enhance PPE knowledge and reinforce adherence to safety protocols on the job. Fire safety and emergency response training (n = 3) is another critical area where SGs are applied, especially in preparing workers for fire-related incidents. In these games, players simulate emergency response actions—such as locating fire extinguishers, following evacuation routes, and practicing fire suppression techniques—offering a practical means for workers to develop the necessary skills to handle emergencies in high-risk construction environments. Furthermore, ergonomics and physical safety (n = 2) are addressed through SGs designed to teach safe lifting techniques and correct posture. These games use digital human models to simulate safe postures for common construction tasks, allowing trainees to practice the safe handling of heavy objects, which reduces the risk of injury. In one example, immersive simulations allow trainees to practice responding to hazardous scenarios and make critical safety decisions in a virtual job site. In another, virtual reality (VR) was integrated with simulation technology to enhance the realistic and interactive aspects of the training experience.",

Results indicate that students valued the experience, emphasizing its impact on digital competence, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Collaborative learning helped overcome initial technical challenges, and students recognized the practical applicability of escape room design in mediation contexts. However, they identified areas for improvement, such as the need for more initial training, extended development time, and better access to digital tools. This study contributes to game-based learning and AI-enhanced education research, positioning students as active designers rather than passive users. Future research should explore the long-term impact on knowledge retention and transferable skills in professional settings.",

    "Abstract": "Tools such as ALEKS and BYJU’S demonstrate that the combination of AI and gamification can identify knowledge gaps and provide targeted support, resulting in greater knowledge retention, improved academic performance and increased inclusion (Suresh Babu & Dhakshina Moorthy, 2024). [...]students facing difficulties can receive additional support, while more advanced learners are challenged with demanding tasks. [...]AI enables the creation of more inclusive experiences, accommodating different learning profiles and ensuring that everyone has equal opportunities for engagement and development (Suresh Babu & Dhakshina Moorthy, 2024). While the personalization enabled by AI and gamification can offer tailored and stimulating pathways, it is essential to ensure that these tools also foster critical thinking, complex problem-solving and collaboration – essential skills for the 21st century. [...]learning should go beyond the achievement of immediate goals, promoting curiosity, reflection and the practical application of knowledge in real-world contexts. The challenge lies in integrating these technologies in a way that not only improves academic and professional outcomes but also strengthens autonomy, intrinsic motivation and the holistic development of individuals. [...]the future of learning will depend on how we balance technological advancements with the need to develop ethical, creative citizens equipped to tackle the challenges of a constantly evolving world.",

    "Abstract": "This systematic review analyzed the role of microlearning in basic education, identifying the most widely used Digital Information and Communication Technologies, relevant learning theories, and the role of social technologies from a Science, Technology, Society, and Environment (STSE) perspective. Following PRISMA 2020, searches were conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC, and IEEE Xplore databases. Studies on microlearning were selected based on previously defined eligibility criteria. The review process in Rayyan involved deduplication, screening, and full-text analysis. Data were qualitatively analyzed using content analysis, and methodological quality was assessed with CASP and the Downs and Black. The findings highlight that microlearning, integrated with digital tools such as online platforms, mobile apps, and short videos, significantly enhances student motivation, performance, and interaction; content in short modules facilitates knowledge retention and connects concepts to real-life situations. Promising trends include mobile technologies and gamification, which foster active, meaningful learning. Grounded in theories like Self-Determination, Constructionism, and Constructivism, microlearning personalizes teaching and promotes engagement, critical thinking, and accessibility, contributing to inclusive and sustainable education. From a STSE perspective, social technologies enhance autonomy, social interaction, and ethical–environmental awareness. In Brazil, further research on digital platforms and gamified strategies is needed to drive innovative educational practices.",

    "Full text": "1. Introduction Basic education plays a fundamental role in developing essential skills for the future, especially in a scenario marked by the rapid technological and social transformations of the 21st century. In today’s knowledge society, education is decisive in transferring scientific and technological knowledge and analytical and professional skills (Gylfason, 2001). In this context, education is widely recognized for placing the student at the center of the learning process, valuing the development of skills such as creativity, communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and cultural awareness (Nasution, 2022; Tan et al., 2022). The advance of the digital age has brought to light the need to incorporate digital technologies into the educational environment to keep up with new learning demands (González-Salamanca et al., 2020).",

    "Abstract": "Anatomy education faces challenges in providing engaging, interactive, and collaborative learning experiences, particularly in understanding complex three-dimensional structures and maintaining long-term knowledge retention. Although virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in addressing spatial comprehension challenges, questions remain regarding its effectiveness in supporting collaborative learning and sustained knowledge retention. This longitudinal study examined Collaborative Immersive Virtual Anatomy Laboratory (C-IVAL), an innovative VR platform designed to enhance traditional anatomy learning through integrated collaborative features, immersive technology, and serious game elements. We conducted an experimental study with 65 medical students to evaluate their knowledge acquisition and technology acceptance compared to its non-collaborative predecessor, the Immersive Virtual Anatomy Laboratory (IVAL). Our evaluation framework combined quantitative assessments (knowledge tests, comprising pre-test, immediate post-test, and delayed post-test) with Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) analysis. Knowledge assessment revealed significant cognitive improvements, with mean knowledge scores increasing from 2.48 to 3.94 in the immediate post-tests, while long-term retention of anatomy knowledge showed sustained engagement for over two months. Importantly, C-IVAL demonstrated significantly higher scores across all TAM dimensions than the non-collaborative IVAL system, particularly for perceived usefulness and intention to use. Post-session feedback analysis showed 73.8% positive responses, highlighting enhanced social presence, immersive engagement, and effective collaboration, with 26.2% of constructive feedback focusing on system refinement and feature enhancement. This study contributes to the understanding of the effectiveness of collaborative features in virtual reality education by offering insights into designing and implementing virtual learning environments that enhance both knowledge retention and user acceptance.",

    "Abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained significant prominence in science education, yet its practical applications, particularly in teacher training, remain underexplored. Specifically, there is a lack of research on AI’s potential to support personalized professional development through automated analysis of classroom interactions and tailored feedback. As science teacher education requires skill development in complex scientific concepts within problem-based learning (PBL) contexts, there is a growing need for innovative, technology-driven instructional tools. AI-generated instructional videos are increasingly recognized as powerful tools for enhancing educational experiences. This study investigates the impact of AI-generated instructional videos, designed using established instructional design principles, on self-efficacy, task performance, and learning outcomes in science teacher education. Employing a within-subjects design, the current study included pre-test, post-test, and transfer assessments to evaluate learning durability and transferability, consistent with design-based research methodology. Moreover, this study compares the effectiveness of two AI-generated instructional video formats: one with an embedded preview feature allowing learners to preview key concepts before detailed instruction (video-with-preview condition) and another without this feature (video-without-preview condition). It specifically examines the role of preview features in enhancing these outcomes during training on scientific concepts with 55 Greek pre-service science teachers (n = 55; mean age 27.3 years; range 22–35). The results demonstrated that the videos effectively supported self-efficacy, task performance, and knowledge retention. However, no significant differences were observed between videos with and without preview features across all assessed metrics and tests. These findings also indicate that AI-generated instructional videos can effectively enhance knowledge retention, transfer, and self-efficacy, positioning them as promising assets in science teacher education. The limited impact of the preview feature highlights the need for careful design and evaluation of instructional elements, such as interactivity and adaptive learning algorithms, to fully realize their potential.",

    "Full text": "1. Introduction The digital transformation of education has redefined how knowledge is delivered, absorbed, and applied. In science teacher education, the challenge is imparting theoretical knowledge and cultivating essential skills, reflecting on critical thinking, collaborative problem-solving, and the ability to translate complex scientific concepts into engaging teaching practices (Koumi, 2013). Among the most impactful pedagogical strategies, problem-based learning (PBL) is still of great importance for its student-centered, inquiry-driven approach, encouraging learners to engage deeply in real-world problems (Akçay, 2009). PBL empowers future (pre-service) science teachers to experience firsthand the dynamic interplay between scientific inquiry and practical problem-solving, making it a cornerstone of effective science teacher training (Gumisirizah et al., 2024).",
    "- Introduction": "Videos can introduce essential background knowledge and concepts necessary for understanding the problem context.",

    "- Conversational style": "The narrative should be engaging and easy to follow, resembling a conversation.",
    "- Introduction of key concepts": "Critical or novel concepts should be briefly introduced, priming learners for deeper understanding during the demonstration.",
    "- RQ1": "Do AI-generated instructional videos, with and without a preview feature, affect pre-service science teachers’ ability to apply scientific concepts?",
    "- RQ2": "Do AI-generated instructional videos, with and without a preview feature, influence pre-service science teachers’ immediate and delayed problem-solving performance?",
    "- RQ3": "Do AI-generated instructional videos, with and without a preview feature, impact pre-service science teachers’ self-efficacy in addressing complex scientific problems?",
    "- Pre-test": "Participants completed the pre-test, which assessed their baseline knowledge of Newtonian mechanics and related problem-solving skills. They also completed the PrSSES, measuring their perceived self-efficacy in problem-solving.",
    "- Post-test": "Administered immediately after the intervention, the post-test used a parallel format with reworded or scenario-based questions assessing the same concepts.",
    "- Transfer test": "Scores in the transfer test are consistent across conditions, suggesting that the intervention equally prepared both groups for applying learned concepts to new contexts.",
    "A. Instructional AI-generated videos": "This study integrates AI-generated instructional videos into PBL for science teacher education, leveraging the IDEA (Interpret, Design, Evaluate, Articulate) framework by Lin et al. (2025) to enhance the effectiveness of training materials. Each of the four treatment phases has been restructured to align with the IDEA principles, ensuring a comprehensive, pedagogically grounded approach to developing pre-service science teachers’ skills.",
    "Treatment phase 1": "Observing and explaining natural phenomena",
    "- Interpret": "The main researcher guides students to understand the importance of using digital tools for effective learning. The interactive features of the AI-generated videos, such as pausing, rewinding, and adjusting playback, are demonstrated to help students optimize their learning experience. Videos include real-time examples of Newton’s laws in action to reinforce understanding.",
    "- Design": "Participants design their learning schedules and practices around these interactive features. AI provides personalized suggestions, such as recommending specific playback settings for segments illustrating complex Newtonian principles.",
    "- Evaluate": "Participants reflect on the utility of the interactive features in improving their comprehension and retention of Newton’s laws. Peer feedback and self-assessment help identify which features are most effective for different learning styles.",
    "- Articulate": "Participants articulate their experiences with the interactive features through written or verbal feedback, supported by AI prompts. This phase encourages how these tools enhance their learning of fundamental physics concepts.",
    "Treatment phase 2": "Conducting Experiments and Analyzing Results",
    "Treatment phase 3": "Advanced PBL in science education contexts",
    "Treatment phase 4": "Interactive features and technical considerations",
    "- Preview videos": "The preview videos provide concise overviews of the scientific phenomena or experimental techniques covered in each chapter. The narration begins conversationally, posing a problem or question to engage learners (e.g., “Have you ever wondered why a rolling ball eventually stops?” or “What happens when you push a stationary object?” ). These videos include brief demonstrations of critical steps, enhanced by animations and zooming to emphasize key details. For example, a preview video might show a ball rolling across different surfaces (carpet vs. smooth floor) to illustrate the concept of friction and how it relates to Newton’s First Law (inertia). Another example could show a brief animation of a rocket launching to introduce the concept of action-reaction pairs (Newton’s Third Law). The average duration of preview videos is 1.30 min, with a five-second pause at the end to help students process the information (range 1.15−1.60). These previews served as initial exposure to the concepts tested in the pre- and post-tests.",
    "- Demonstration videos": "Demonstration videos deliver detailed step-by-step instructions for conducting experiments or solving scientific problems. Narration is structured to explain both actions and outcomes (e.g., “We will now measure the acceleration of a cart as we apply different forces, demonstrating Newton’s Second Law. First, we’ll measure the mass of the cart…” or “Observe how the force applied to the cart directly affects its acceleration.” ). These videos incorporate AI-enhanced visuals, such as showing force vectors acting on an object or graphing the relationship between force and acceleration, to reinforce learning. For instance, a video could demonstrate how changing the mass of an object affects its acceleration when a constant force is applied. Another example could showcase the collision of two objects, demonstrating the conservation of momentum and Newton’s Third Law. Each step is followed by a brief pause to allow reflection, and the entire video concludes with a five-second pause. Demonstration videos have an average length of 1.77 min. These demonstrations directly addressed the content assessed in the post-test and provided concrete examples that aided in conceptual understanding relevant to the transfer task.",
    "- Final video files": "Accompanying the video tutorials are practice files, designed to replicate the scenarios presented in the videos. These files include step-by-step instructions for conducting experiments, paired with before-and-after images or data tables to guide learners through each task. For example, a file might provide instructions for calculating the force required to accelerate an object at a given rate (applying Newton’s Second Law) or analyzing the forces acting on an object on an inclined plane. Another example could involve analyzing the motion of a projectile, calculating its trajectory based on initial velocity and launch angle (incorporating concepts from Newton’s laws). These tasks allow students to apply what they have learned from the videos, with the option of re-visiting the segments for guidance. These practice files offered opportunities for applying learned concepts, reinforcing learning and preparing participants for the application-focused aspects of the post-test and the transfer task.",
    "Pre-self-efficacy questionnaire (PrSSES)": "The PrSSES, administered before the intervention, consisted of seven items adapted from the original SSES. These items were designed to assess baseline self-efficacy related to basic understanding and application of Newton’s Laws, such as interpreting motion graphs, understanding force vectors, and calculating basic forces. The PrSSES demonstrated strong reliability with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.83. These items established a baseline for participants’ confidence in applying the foundational concepts of Newtonian mechanics. Examples of PrSSES items (relating to Newton’s Laws) are the following: - “ I interpret a graph of velocity versus time to determine the acceleration of an object. ” (Relates to understanding motion and Newton’s First Law/Inertia if the velocity is constant, and to Newton’s Second Law if the velocity changes).",
    "Post-self-efficacy questionnaire (PsSSES)": "The PsSSES, administered after the intervention, also consisted of seven items adapted from the original SSES. These items were designed to assess self-efficacy related to more complex applications of Newton’s Laws, such as analyzing forces on an inclined plane, predicting projectile motion, and understanding the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration within the context of designing a roller coaster . The PsSSES also demonstrated strong reliability with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.81. These items measured participants’ confidence in applying Newton’s Laws in more complex scenarios, similar to those encountered in the PBL activity. Examples of PsSSES items (relating to Newton’s Laws and the Roller Coaster Context) are the following: - “ I analyze the forces acting on a roller coaster car as it moves along an inclined track, including gravity, normal force, and friction. ” (Combines Newton’s First and Second Laws in a realistic scenario).",
    "- B. . Transfer test": "The transfer test evaluated participants’ ability to apply their knowledge and skills to science phenomena that were not explicitly addressed in the AI-generated instructional videos. This test aimed to measure adaptability, critical thinking, and independent problem-solving skills. The transfer test included a separate instruction file and four new tasks: - Adjusting environmental variables in a simulation to observe changes in system behavior.",
    "- Evaluating existing tools": "Analyzing the effectiveness of current AI-powered educational applications like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to identify areas for improvement.",
    "- Designing integration frameworks": "Developing frameworks for seamlessly integrating AI into existing digital literacy curriculums.",
    "- Interactive multimedia content": "Designing and developing educational videos and images enriched with interactive digital elements to enhance learners’ digital literacy across various subjects.",
    "- AI-generated video production": "Utilizing platforms like Sudowrite ( https://www.sudowrite.com , accessed on 8 December 2024), Visla ( https://www.visla.us , accessed on 8 December 2024), or Jasper ( https://www.jasper.ai , accessed on 8 December 2024) for creating engaging educational video content through AI assistance.",
    "- Intervention (Video conditions)": "Participants were exposed randomly to two conditions of AI-generated instructional videos:",
    "- Condition 1": "Video with preview: Participants watched AI-generated instructional videos on Newtonian mechanics with an embedded preview feature (video-with-preview condition).",
    "- Condition 2": "Video without preview: Participants watched the same AI-generated instructional videos on Newtonian mechanics without the embedded preview feature (video-without-preview condition).",
    "- Immediate post-test": "After viewing both video conditions, participants completed the immediate post-test, which assessed their understanding and application of the concepts presented in the videos. They also completed the PrSSES again to measure any changes in self-efficacy.",
    "- Delayed post-test": "Seven days after the intervention, participants completed the delayed post-test to assess retention of the learned material over time.",
    "- Consistency in self-efficacy perceptions": "Despite differences in baseline performance, the PrSSES scores were comparable across the video-with-preview and video-without-preview conditions. This finding suggests that the AI-generated instructional videos were perceived similarly in terms of their ability to support self-efficacy across conditions, regardless of the order in which participants experienced the videos.",
    "- Implications for instructional design": "The significant difference in pre-test scores suggests that the preview feature alone may not be sufficient to ensure equivalent learning conditions. It is important, therefore, to incorporate additional scaffolding strategies or tailored previews to accommodate the diverse starting points of learners, as observed in the baseline performance differences.",
    "- Generalizability of AI-generated tutorials": "Participants showed similar levels of self-efficacy across both conditions, highlighting the broad potential of AI-generated instructional tools to enhance participant confidence, regardless of specific instructional design elements, such as the inclusion or exclusion of a preview feature.",
    "- Initial confidence": "The pre-training self-efficacy scores were already above average, suggesting that the task was perceived as relatively manageable.",
    "- Condition comparison": "No significant difference between instructional video-without-preview and video-with-preview conditions, implying both benefited similarly from the training.",
    "- Pre-test comparison of participants": "(a) the pre-test scores are the lowest overall, showing significant room for improvement before the intervention and (b) the participants in video-without-preview conditions scored higher than the video-with-preview group in the pre-test, indicating an initial disparity in baseline performance.",
    "- Post-test insights": "Participants in both conditions show improvement from the pre-test to the immediate post-test, but those in video-with-preview conditions’ delayed post-test scores surpass their counterparts, suggesting a longer-term benefit of the preview condition.",
    "- Improvement across all tests": "The immediate post-test, delayed post-test, and transfer test scores were all significantly higher than the pre-test scores. This suggests that the intervention (AI-generated video tutorial) had a positive impact on participant task performance, improving their ability to complete both tasks immediately and overtime. Specifically, the large effect sizes in the delayed post-test (d = 1.65) and the moderate effect size in the transfer test (d = 0.67) emphasize the sustained benefits of the intervention. These results confirm that the video tutorial facilitated learning and retention of knowledge, extending beyond the immediate learning phase.",

    "Abstract": "This study aims to examine the combination of educational data mining and learning analytics with virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and the metaverse, its role in education, and its impact on teaching and learning. Therefore, a systematic literature review, a bibliometric and scientific mapping analysis, and a content analysis are carried out based on 70 relevant documents identified from six databases, namely, ACM, ERIC, IEEE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) following the PRISMA framework. The documents were separated into the following three categories, (i) Theoretical and Review studies, (ii) Proposal and Showcase studies, and (iii) Experimental and Case studies and were examined from different dimensions through an in-depth content analysis using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The documents were further analyzed using scientometric tools, such as Bibliometrix and VOSviewer and topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The most prominent topics, areas, and themes were revealed and the outcomes regarding the influence of this combination on learning and teaching were summarized. Based on the results, this combination can effectively enrich education, positively affect learning and teaching, offer deep and meaningful learning, and support both students and teachers. Additionally, it can support different educational approaches and strategies, various learning styles, and special education and be utilized in both formal and informal learning environments. The real-time identification, tracking, monitoring, analysis, and visualization of multimodal learning data of students’ behavior, emotions, cognitive and affective states and the overall learning and teaching processes emerged as a significant benefit that contributes greatly to the realization of adaptive and personalized learning. Finally, it was revealed that the combination of extended reality technologies with learning analytics and educational data mining can support collaborative learning and social learning, improve students’ self-efficacy and self-regulated learning, and increase students’ learning gains, academic achievements, knowledge retention, motivation, and engagement.",

    "Full text": "1. Introduction There is an ever increasing need to integrate data science into educational contexts to further enhance learning and teaching [1]. Via educational data science, educational processes can be tailored to each individual’s requirements, needs, and preferences [2]. Among the various methods and approaches used in the domain of data science in education, learning analytics and educational data mining are the most widely used [3,4]. Educational data hold a lot of value and meaning [5] and can be used in many ways, including analyzing students’ performance [6]. Therefore, and due to the potential benefits that they can bring in the educational domain, research into educational data mining [7] and learning analytics [8] is continuously increasing. It should be noted that despite their sharing similarities and their being applied at all educational levels, there are distinct differences between the two [2,9]. Specifically, learning analytics evaluate the educational process and learning theories using existing models in a top–down approach, while educational data mining strives to create new models and identify new patterns in data in a bottom–up approach [10,11]. Additionally, there are several other differences regarding the methods, adaptations, techniques, personalization strategies, origins, and approaches used between the two [12,13]. As a result, it can be inferred that learning analytics put an emphasis on addressing educational challenges, while educational data mining puts an emphasis on the technical ones [14].",

    "Abstract": "This narrative review assesses the effectiveness of hand gesture analogy teaching in clinical medical education, addressing the growing demand for innovative pedagogical strategies. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, it evaluates the theoretical foundations, implementation strategies, and practical applications of this method across various domains of medical education. Hand gesture analogy teaching significantly enhances student learning by improving engagement, spatial reasoning, and procedural knowledge retention more effectively than conventional instructional methods. The integration of modern educational technologies and standardized implementation frameworks further amplifies its effectiveness. Despite challenges in standardization and faculty development, this method shows promising potential for transforming medical education by bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical practice. Evidence-based recommendations are provided for incorporating hand gesture analogy teaching into clinical training programs, supporting its adoption as an innovative pedagogical tool in contemporary medical education.This narrative review assesses the effectiveness of hand gesture analogy teaching in clinical medical education, addressing the growing demand for innovative pedagogical strategies.

    "Abstract": "Unlike other medical specialties, surgery is primarily learned through apprenticeship, by observing surgeons in action during operations. However, the increasing number of medical students and work-hour restrictions limit opportunities for learning in the operating room (OR). These circumstances call for novel technologies, such as immersive video. The objective of this study is to compare knowledge retention, preparedness, and content engagement for surgical learning when watching a surgical video in 3D through a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) versus in 2D video on a conventional screen. BACKGROUND Unlike other medical specialties, surgery is primarily learned through apprenticeship, by observing surgeons in action during operations. However, the increasing number of medical students and work-hour restrictions limit opportunities for learning in the operating room (OR). These circumstances call for novel technologies, such as immersive video. The objective of this study is to compare knowledge retention, preparedness, and content engagement for surgical learning when watching a surgical video in 3D through a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) versus in 2D video on a conventional screen.This randomized controlled trial includes 231 fourth-year medical students. Participants watched the same 12 min surgical video, narrated by an expert, presented either in immersive 3D form through an HMD, or in 2D form through a conventional screen. The students completed three questionnaires (previewing, postviewing, and 1 month later), which included questions on knowledge retention, expected preparedness, content engagement, tool engagement, and self-assessment. Statistical analyses were adjusted by including the confounding factors. MATERIEL AND METHODS This randomized controlled trial includes 231 fourth-year medical students. Participants watched the same 12 min surgical video, narrated by an expert, presented either in immersive 3D form through an HMD, or in 2D form through a conventional screen. The students completed three questionnaires (previewing, postviewing, and 1 month later), which included questions on knowledge retention, expected preparedness, content engagement, tool engagement, and self-assessment. Statistical analyses were adjusted by including the confounding factors.Immediately after the video, the 3D immersive video group showed a significantly lower knowledge retention score compared to the classic video group (P<0.01). Nonetheless, the 3D immersive video group demonstrated better-expected preparedness as a future resident (P=0.019), greater satisfaction (P=0.033), better stimulation (P<0.001), higher involvement (P<0.001), and a greater perceived ability to identify anatomical structures (P<0.001). After 1 month, participants in the immersive video group reported feeling more prepared (P=0.016), more self-confident (P=0.020), more at ease (P=0.023), and less overwhelmed (P<0.01) than those in the 2D video group. RESULTS Immediately after the video, the 3D immersive video group showed a significantly lower knowledge retention score compared to the classic video group (P<0.01). Nonetheless, the 3D immersive video group demonstrated better-expected preparedness as a future resident (P=0.019), greater satisfaction (P=0.033), better stimulation (P<0.001), higher involvement (P<0.001), and a greater perceived ability to identify anatomical structures (P<0.001).

For early medical school students where access to the OR is limited, this tool appears to a significant step forward in surgical pedagogy. However, the precise understanding of its pedagogical value required further investigation and refinement.

    "Abstract": "Effective healthcare relies on well-trained professionals, and the quality of their training is dependent on appropriate learning methods and assessment techniques. Gamification, the use of game mechanics in non-game environments, has emerged as a promising strategy in medical education. This review explores the applicability and effectiveness of gamification in obstetrics and gynecology education. Background Effective healthcare relies on well-trained professionals, and the quality of their training is dependent on appropriate learning methods and assessment techniques. Gamification, the use of game mechanics in non-game environments, has emerged as a promising strategy in medical education. This review explores the applicability and effectiveness of gamification in obstetrics and gynecology education.Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Medline databases from January to March 2023. The search terms included \"medical students OR residents OR physicians OR midwives AND games OR educational games OR serious games AND gynecology OR obstetrics\". The inclusion criteria encompassed studies published in English or German from 1990 to March 2023, focusing on gamification in gynecology and obstetrics education. Data extraction and analysis were structured using the PICOS framework.

    "Abstract": "An association between spatial ability, particularly visualisation, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has been repeatedly demonstrated over the past four decades. Understanding this relationship is of critical importance as substantial evidence illustrates the malleability of spatial ability and that the effects of associated training interventions transfer to desirable STEM outcomes such as improved educational performance and reduced attrition rates. There currently exists a number of theories as to why spatial ability relates to STEM, such as that the nature of STEM activity is inherently spatial. However, there is a need to better understand this relationship from a cognitive perspective. This research examined the hypothesis that spatial ability is predictive of short-term retention for declarative technical information associated with engineering curricula. An original investigation in an authentic educational setting found that visualisation and interest in the lecture material were significant predictors of short-term knowledge retention. This effect was then replicated in two subsequent conceptual replication studies. Based on this predictive finding, it is theorised that increases in spatial ability may support the elongation of the knowledge forgetting curve which would have significant implications for instructional design.",

    "Abstract": "Over the past two decades, the use of Metaverse-enhanced simulations in medical education has witnessed significant advancement. These simulations offer immersive environments and technologies, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence that have the potential to revolutionize medical training by providing realistic, hands-on experiences in diagnosing and treating patients, practicing surgical procedures, and enhancing clinical decision-making skills. This scoping review aimed to examine the evolution of simulation technology and the emergence of metaverse applications in medical professionals' training, guided by Friedman's three dimensions in medical education: physical space, time, and content, along with an additional dimension of assessment.

This scoping review aimed to examine the evolution of simulation technology and the emergence of metaverse applications in medical professionals' training, guided by Friedman's three dimensions in medical education: physical space, time, and content, along with an additional dimension of assessment.In this scoping review, we examined the related literature in six major databases including PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and ERIC. A total of 173 publications were selected for the final review and analysis. We thematically analyzed these studies by combining Friedman's three-dimensional framework with assessment. METHODS In this scoping review, we examined the related literature in six major databases including PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and ERIC. A total of 173 publications were selected for the final review and analysis. We thematically analyzed these studies by combining Friedman's three-dimensional framework with assessment.Our scoping review showed that Metaverse technologies, such as virtual reality simulation and online learning modules have enabled medical education to extend beyond physical classrooms and clinical sites by facilitating remote training. In terms of the Time dimension, simulation technologies have made partial but meaningful progress in supplementing traditional time-dependent curricula, helping to shorten learning curves, and improve knowledge retention. As for the Content dimension, high-quality simulation and metaverse content require alignment with learning objectives, interactivity, and deliberate practice that should be developmentally integrated from basic to advanced skills. With respect to the Assessment dimension, learning analytics and automated metrics from metaverse-enabled simulation systems have enhanced competency evaluation and formative feedback mechanisms. However, their integration into high-stakes testing is limited, and qualitative feedback and human observation remain crucial.

    "Abstract": "Background Online synchronous learning in higher education frequently struggles to overcome the social presence gap, resulting in dissatisfaction and poor learning outcomes. Objectives This study examined the effectiveness of desktop‐based virtual reality (VR) social platforms compared to video conferencing (VC) platforms in enhancing students' learning gains and experiences in online synchronous learning. Methods The study used a within‐subject design, involving 34 college students in two online lecture modules, one via a VR social platform and another through a VC platform. Knowledge assessments occurred pre‐ and post‐modules and after 1 week. Students also completed post‐module questionnaires to evaluate their learning experience, in terms of social presence, easiness of use and perceived emotions. In‐depth interviews provided further insights into their experiences with both platforms. Results The study showed that using VR social platforms for online synchronous learning enhanced immediate knowledge, especially in students less interested in the content, yet it did not notably impact long‐term knowledge retention. Despite no significant findings in social presence from questionnaires, interviews indicated that the VR's heightened interactivity might be offset by the effect of not seeing others' real appearances in promoting social presence. Furthermore, the VC platform was found to be easier to use, attributed to its familiarity and user‐friendliness. Finally, students experienced increased fun, awe and interest, along with reduced boredom, when using the VR social platform. Conclusion The findings highlight the potential of VR to enrich online learning while underscoring the need for effective strategies facilitating a smooth integration into educational settings. Alternate abstract: Lay Description What is currently known about this topic Social presence is crucial in online learning. VC platforms may fail to efficiently bridge the social presence gap. VR social platforms can enhance students' experience in online education. What does this paper add Compares VR and VC effects on learning gains and experiences. Highlights VR's potential to boost immediate knowledge gains. Reveals VR's benefits for emotional engagement. Implications for practice or policy Suggests integrating VR for more engaging online education. Underlines the need for user‐friendly VR technology. Advocates for training to maximize VR's educational benefits.",

    "Abstract": "Course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) exposes an entire class of students to scientific research and is thought to increase students’ knowledge retention in science, technology, engineering and mathematics education. Microbial engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that combines science and engineering. We transformed a microbial engineering course into a CURE-type course by adopting an interest-oriented case teaching approach. Based on an investigation of the interest of students, which showed that the topics related to food and health were students’ favourites, we selected beer brewing, glutamate fermentation and Monascus cultivation as teaching topics. To simulate the reality of industrial fermentation, pilot-scale fermentation equipment was selected and installed. The course focused on fermentation research; most of the time was spent on performing experiments, and theoretical lectures were held at the intervals. To complete the course in 10 days, three series of experiments were alternatively carried out, and students took turns to conduct fermentation control and process analyses in groups. A questionnaire survey showed that students were satisfied with the CURE-type course, their fermentation knowledge and engineering skills were improved, their research abilities were developed, and their scientific attitudes were cultivated. CURE-type courses are worth popularising in biology teaching.",

    "Abstract": "This systematic review evaluates the impact of trauma care and emergency preparedness training programs on prehospital primary survey effectiveness. A comprehensive search strategy was employed across multiple databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and the Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), focusing on studies involving healthcare professionals such as paramedics, nurses, and emergency medical technicians (EMTs). The review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), clinical trials, and cohort studies that assessed various training modalities like virtual reality (VR) simulations, case-based learning (CBL), and hands-on workshops. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) tool for randomized trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for clinical trials, ensuring methodological rigor and consistency. The findings suggest that CBL significantly improves knowledge retention and prehospital primary survey skills, outperforming other methods such as simulation exercises, which showed mixed results. VR training increased confidence levels but did not demonstrate significant improvements in objective skills compared to traditional methods. The use of supplementary triage assistance teams (physician-nurse supplementary triage team (MDRNSTAT)) was found to be effective during high patient volume hours, though not cost-effective as a daytime strategy. While the review highlights the importance of interactive and scenario-based training programs, limitations such as variability in study designs, publication bias, and language bias were noted, suggesting that caution should be exercised in generalizing the results. Future research should focus on long-term effectiveness, the integration of emerging technologies, and larger, well-designed trials across diverse healthcare settings to strengthen the evidence base.This systematic review evaluates the impact of trauma care and emergency preparedness training programs on prehospital primary survey effectiveness.

    "Abstract": "Mathematical inquiry involving hands-on activities has received increasing attention in mathematics education. Besides various customized physical teaching aids, subject-specific information technology, such as Dynamic Geometry System (DGS), finds extensive use in mathematical inquiry activities. However, effects of DGS and physical manipulatives on inquiry-based math learning remain an open question. Hence, by adopting a quasi-experimental research design, this paper aims to empirically compare the immediate learning outcomes, knowledge retention, and learning interest of seventh-grade students who explore with virtual manipulatives (i.e., the DGS) and who explore with physical manipulatives. Specifically, 131 students participated in learning activities centered on exploring pyramids and prisms. During the inquiry process, Group A ( n  = 33) constructed pyramids and prisms in DGS, Group B ( n  = 34) observed pre-made virtual models in DGS, Group C ( n  = 32) observed physical models, and Group D ( n  = 32) made physical pyramids and prisms with polymer clay and small sticks. Moreover, pretest, post-test, and delayed post-test designed according to the Van Hiele model, as well as an adapted interest questionnaire, were employed to evaluate students’ performances; and collected data were analyzed by means of ANCOVA and t-test. Findings of the study revealed that in the context of construction, students employing the DGS exhibited superior immediate learning outcomes and greater knowledge retention compared to their peers who utilized physical manipulatives; while in the case of observation, the virtual and physical manipulatives yielded similar impacts on students’ immediate learning outcomes, but students who involved in the DGS demonstrated higher knowledge retention. Furthermore, regarding the DGS environment, students who engaged in constructive manipulation surpassed their peers who engaged in observing manipulation. In terms of interest, the DGS proved to be more effective in both stimulating and maintaining higher interest compared to the physical manipulatives, and constructive manipulation was more effective than observing manipulation. In summary, as compared to the physical manipulatives, DGS, particularly when employed with constructive strategy, has shown to encourage students to more actively engage in task-related cognitive behaviors, thereby supporting and enhancing inquiry-based math learning of students in junior high school.",

    "Abstract": "The operating room is a high-risk environment where proper patient positioning is crucial for minimizing injury and ensuring optimal access to surgical sites. This process requires effective collaboration among surgical team members, particularly operating room nurses who play a vital role in patient safety. Despite advancements in technology, challenges such as pressure injuries persist, with a significant incidence rate. Video-based training (VBT) emerges as a promising educational tool, enhancing knowledge retention and fostering a learner-centered approach. This study aims to evaluate the impact of VBT on adherence to surgical positioning standards, highlighting its potential to improve safety protocols in the operating room. BACKGROUND The operating room is a high-risk environment where proper patient positioning is crucial for minimizing injury and ensuring optimal access to surgical sites. This process requires effective collaboration among surgical team members, particularly operating room nurses who play a vital role in patient safety. Despite advancements in technology, challenges such as pressure injuries persist, with a significant incidence rate. Video-based training (VBT) emerges as a promising educational tool, enhancing knowledge retention and fostering a learner-centered approach. This study aims to evaluate the impact of VBT on adherence to surgical positioning standards, highlighting its potential to improve safety protocols in the operating room.In this clinical trial, 62 qualified operating room nurses (50 women, 12 men, average age: 28.90 ± 3.75 years) were randomly divided into control and intervention group (n = 31 in each group). The control group only received positioning recommendations, but in the intervention group, in addition to the recommendations, video-based surgical positioning training was performed for 1 month, at least 3 times a week. The performance of nurses in both groups was evaluated through a researcher-made checklist at baseline and post-intervention. METHODS In this clinical trial, 62 qualified operating room nurses (50 women, 12 men, average age: 28.90 ± 3.75 years) were randomly divided into control and intervention group (n = 31 in each group). The control group only received positioning recommendations, but in the intervention group, in addition to the recommendations, video-based surgical positioning training was performed for 1 month, at least 3 times a week. The performance of nurses in both groups was evaluated through a researcher-made checklist at baseline and post-intervention.Based on findings, there was no significant difference between the two groups in compliance with surgical positioning standards at baseline (p = 0.07). However, after the intervention, compliance scores significantly improved in the VBT group compared to the control group (p < 0.001). The VBT group showed a mean improvement of 62.12 points, while the control group improved by 10.77 points (p < 0.001). RESULTS Based on findings, there was no significant difference between the two groups in compliance with surgical positioning standards at baseline (p = 0.07).

The VBT group showed a mean improvement of 62.12 points, while the control group improved by 10.77 points (p < 0.001).This preliminary study demonstrated a notable improvement in compliance with surgical positioning standards among operating room nurses following VBT intervention. Despite the promising results, the small sample size and preliminary nature of the research necessitate further studies to confirm these findings and assess long-term outcomes. These initial insights highlight the potential of innovative training methods in enhancing surgical practices.

    "Abstract": "Abstract-In recent years, the rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, data mining, and mobile internet has significantly transformed educational methodologies. Online learning, an emerging educational paradigm, has garnered considerable attention for its accessibility and convenience. Although online education platforms offer learners a high degree of freedom, they lack personalized guidance, leading to challenges such as \"Information Overload\" and \"Knowledge Loss\". These challenges primarily manifest as learners struggling to identify resources that match their preferences and needs, adversely affecting their learning efficiency and outcomes. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an exercise recommendation algorithm that combines the emerging fields of reinforcement learning and recommendation systems to help learners find suitable exercise resources. Initially, we use a knowledge tracking model to assess the potential knowledge level of learners. Following this, the Deep Q Network algorithm is utilized to modify learners' exercise records by removing unsatisfactory exercises that learners may have mistakenly selected during the learning process. Based on the modified record of exercises and the knowledge levels of learners, the algorithm recommends appropriate exercises. Finally, extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.",

    "Abstract": "In today’s world, technology plays a significant role in shaping our daily interactions and how we connect with the world. The rapid advancements in technology have influenced many sectors, particularly education, where integrating technology is now seen as essential rather than just a luxury. As a result, the education field has adapted over time to keep up with innovations and their potential to improve the teaching and learning environment. The incorporation of technology into education has evolved from introducing computer systems in classrooms to the adoption of smartboards, tablets, and e-learning platforms. The rise of Virtual Reality (VR) technology has also opened up possibilities for hands-on learning experiences that allow students to explore and practice skills in ways that traditional teaching methods cannot. VR technology enables students to interact with content in a way that fosters a sense of presence and immersion, which can improve knowledge retention. In fields, like science, engineering, medicine, arts, and language learning, VR applications have shown promise in boosting student engagement and enhancing skills within a controlled learning environment. However, the widespread adoption of VR technology in education faces challenges. One significant obstacle is the cost of acquiring VR equipment and software which can strain budgets. Additionally, the availability of high- quality content for VR platforms poses a barrier for educators seeking to integrate VR into their teaching practices. This article delves into the use of Virtual Reality in education, and how VR can influence student learning outcomes in applications such as medicine, science, arts and language learning. Apart from the advantages of VR, the article also discusses the obstacles that are impeding the use of VR in education including concerns about costs, standardizing content and the necessity for training and support for educators. As VR technology advances and becomes widely available, it stands ready to revolutionize the landscape by offering learning opportunities that were previously beyond imagination. Through this technology, education can introduce a world of possibilities that nurture curiosity, creativity and a lifelong enthusiasm for learning.

    "Abstract": "In today’s world, technology plays a significant role in shaping our daily interactions and how we connect with the world. The rapid advancements in technology have influenced many sectors, particularly education, where integrating technology is now seen as essential rather than just a luxury. As a result, the education field has adapted over time to keep up with innovations and their potential to improve the teaching and learning environment. The incorporation of technology into education has evolved from introducing computer systems in classrooms to the adoption of smartboards, tablets, and e-learning platforms. The rise of Virtual Reality (VR) technology has also opened up possibilities for hands-on learning experiences that allow students to explore and practice skills in ways that traditional teaching methods cannot. VR technology enables students to interact with content in a way that fosters a sense of presence and immersion, which can improve knowledge retention. In fields, like science, engineering, medicine, arts, and language learning, VR applications have shown promise in boosting student engagement and enhancing skills within a controlled learning environment. However, the widespread adoption of VR technology in education faces challenges. One significant obstacle is the cost of acquiring VR equipment and software which can strain budgets. Additionally, the availability of high-quality content for VR platforms poses a barrier for educators seeking to integrate VR into their teaching practices. This article delves into the use of Virtual Reality in education, and how VR can influence student learning outcomes in applications such as medicine, science, arts and language learning. Apart from the advantages of VR, the article also discusses the obstacles that are impeding the use of VR in education including concerns about costs, standardizing content and the necessity for training and support for educators. As VR technology advances and becomes widely available, it stands ready to revolutionize the landscape by offering learning opportunities that were previously beyond imagination. Through this technology, education can introduce a world of possibilities that nurture curiosity, creativity and a lifelong enthusiasm for learning.",

Integrating games with educational animations offers significant benefits, including the enhancement of spatial memory, problemsolving skills, and understanding of real-world scenarios. This approach is a valuable tool for educators aiming to create enjoyable and effective learning environments. By leveraging the combined power of animation and gaming, teachers can facilitate students' learning engagingly and enjoyably, fostering a more of the material within an immersive educational framework. Embedded animation can be helpful in teaching and learning while promoting analytical/cognitive skill games (Vagg, Balta, Bolger, et al. 2020; Reddy, Singh, Kapoor, et al. 2020). In a study, online gaming was included in teaching undergraduate students about literacy skills and found advantageous, including such innovative services (Markey, Swanson, Jenkins, et al. 2008). Parents need help to make their children teach at home as students are often interested in playing. Suppose the library includes curriculum-based/storytelling (Weng, Kuo, and Tseng 2011) and game-embedded academic animations as a resource in the form of service. Students enjoy learning while playing, and the library will be the place for fun learning (Rahayuningtyas, Pramono, Hidajat, et al. 2020). The focus and drive to learn by introducing games and animations in the classroom make it less daunting and more entertaining.",

    "Abstract": "After the pandemic, research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the field of education has seen a significant increase global ly. However, a few studies conducted before the pandemic addressed the problem of supporting intrinsic motivation in students, crucial for the quality of learning and knowledge retention. This study explores how this topic is covered in recent research, by conducting a cross-disciplinary literature review and critical discourse analysis under the theoretical framework of Activity Theory (AT). It aims to identify the coverage extension of all types of relationships between nodes in the educational activity system, with special attention to Subject (students) and Object, as this central relationship embodies the motive-driven nature of human activity. The analysis incorporated 69 articles from Scopus published from 2020 until now. The results demonstrate the coverage about only some relationships like: Subject-Tools (students' interaction with AI technology), Tools-Object (AI technologies development), and Tools-Community (adapting AI within an educational community). The Subject-Object relationship remains unexplored. Practical implications include refocusing on intrinsic motivation, emphasising epistemological needs, meaning, and choice. This involves evaluating the benefits and risks of AI in specific educational cases. Theoretical implications involve exploring how to sustain students' intrinsic motivation in the context of AI implementation. Alternate abstract: Després de la pandèmia, la investigació sobre Intel.ligència Artificial (IA) en educació ha augmentat a nivell mundial. Pocs estudis abans de la pandèmia van abordar la motivació intrínseca als estudiants, crucial per a la retenció del coneixement. Aquest estudi analitza com es tracta aquest tema en investigacions recents, fent una revisió de la literatura i una anàlisi crítica del discurs sota el marc teòric de la Teoria de l'Activitat (AT). L'objectiu és identificar la cobertura de les relacions entre nodes al sistema d'activitat educativa, amb especial atenció al subjecte (estudiants) i l'objecte, que reflecteix la naturalesa motivada de l'activitat humana. L'anàlisi va incloure 69 articles de Scopus publicats des del 2020. Els resultats mostren la cobertura d'algunes relacions, com Subjecte-Eines (interacció dels estudiants amb IA), Eines-Objecte (desenvolupament d'IA) i Eines-Comunitat (adaptació de la IA) a la comunitat educativa). La relació Subjecte-Objecte roman inexplorada. Les implicacions pràctiques inclouen un reenfocament en la motivació intrínseca, emfatitzant necessitats epistemològiques, significat i elecció, avaluant els beneficis i els riscos de la IA en casos educatius específics. Les implicacions teòriques impliquen explorar com mantenir la motivació intrínseca dels estudiants en el context de la implementació de IA.

    "Abstract": "Education of patients prior to an invasive procedure is pivotal for good cooperation and knowledge retention. Virtual reality (VR) is a fast-developing technology that helps educate both medical professionals and patients. INTRODUCTION Education of patients prior to an invasive procedure is pivotal for good cooperation and knowledge retention. Virtual reality (VR) is a fast-developing technology that helps educate both medical professionals and patients.To prove non-inferiority of VR education compared to conventional education in patients prior to the implantation of a permanent pacemaker (PPM). OBJECTIVE To prove non-inferiority of VR education compared to conventional education in patients prior to the implantation of a permanent pacemaker (PPM).150 participants scheduled for an elective implantation of a PPM were enrolled in this prospective study and randomized into two groups: the VR group ( n = 75) watched a 360° video about the procedure using the VR headset Oculus Meta Quest 2, while the conventional group ( n = 75) was educated by a physician. Both groups filled out a questionnaire to assess the quality of education pre- and in-hospital, their knowledge of the procedure, and their subjective satisfaction. METHODS 150 participants scheduled for an elective implantation of a PPM were enrolled in this prospective study and randomized into two groups: the VR group (n = 75) watched a 360° video about the procedure using the VR headset Oculus Meta Quest 2, while the conventional group (n = 75) was educated by a physician. Both groups filled out a questionnaire to assess the quality of education pre- and in-hospital, their knowledge of the procedure, and their subjective satisfaction.There was no significant difference in the quality of education. There was a non-significant trend towards higher educational scores in the VR group. The subgroup with worse scores was older than the groups with higher scores (82 vs. 76 years, p = 0.025). Anxiety was reduced in 92% of participants. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the quality of education. There was a non-significant trend towards higher educational scores in the VR group. The subgroup with worse scores was older than the groups with higher scores (82 vs. 76 years, p = 0.025). Anxiety was reduced in 92% of participants.VR proved to be non-inferior to conventional education. It helped to reduce anxiety and showed no adverse effects. CONCLUSION VR proved to be non-inferior to conventional education. It helped to reduce anxiety and showed no adverse effects.",

    "Abstract": "Literature on technological decline and related concepts is growing. We aim to advance theorizations of the dynamics of technological decline by mobilizing the concept of sociotechnical configuration and a metaphor of its “unraveling.” We take as a case study the declined Soviet computer series Ural . Ural was once among the top three most used computers in the former Soviet Union, but went into decline and got lost even before the dissolution of the country. We find that technological decline is not a trivial process, it is not guaranteed to be gradual but can feature sudden shifts. These shifts can be drops of production and loss of knowledge, as well as efforts to push back. Policy could make use of ongoing processes of decline and try to replicate the effect of the decline of Ural via cessation of access to materials and competences and delegitimation of the technology.",

    "Abstract": "Gamification, which involves incorporating game-like elements in non-game contexts, has quickly become one of the most popular persuasive technologies. Its goal is to encourage users to change their behavior for the better. However, it still has empirical and theoretical challenges to overcome to show the benefits of its use and solidify the guiding principles for effective gamification designs. The goal of the current study is to synthesize and intellectualize, through a systematic literature review (SLR), the current state of gamification knowledge in human resource management, providing a road map for future research recommendations for both academician and practitioners The review examines the most influential writing on the application of gamification to association settings, portrays the fundamental concepts of gamification, and develops based on an effective writing survey of insightful articles available in the Scopus and Web of Science information bases. The study uses a systematic quantitative approach to review the evidence for the use of gamification in Human Resources management, focusing on the pertinent literature on gamification in organizations. The authors examined 244 papers published between 2013 and 2022 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) technique. One of the major goals of the study’s findings is to illustrate the value of gamification in the human resources field in relation to the analysis of employee performance, employee engagement, and training and development. These results suggest that there is more opportunity for research into the elements of gamification, which may be relate to knowledge retention, learning outcomes, learning motivation, employee efficacy, and employee productivity. Alternate abstract: Plain Language Summary Purpose- The present study’s goal is to amalgamate and intellectualize, through a systematic literature review (SLR), the modern state of gamification knowledge in Human Resource Management Management, providing a roadmap for future research recommendations for service research and practice. Methods- The research is based on a systematic literature review. It implements a systematic quantitative approach to review existing evidence on gamification usage in employee management, focusing on relevant literature on gamification in organizations. The authors analyzed 108 papers published between 2013 and 2022. Conclusion- The study’s findings is to illustrate the value of gamification in the human resources field in the analysis of employee performance, employee engagement, and training and development. These results suggest that there is more opportunity for research into gamification elements, which may relate to knowledge retention, learning outcomes, learning motivation, employee efficacy, and employee productivity. Limitations of study- several pilot searches in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases were conducted before obtaining the final dataset. Besides Science Direct, PubMed, Academia, and Google Scholars could have used other databases for this research. Since it is the most widely used product, uses rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria that are transparent and consistent, is publisher independent, and is a multidisciplinary global citation database, the author built the dataset from WoS and Scopus. Because of the limitations of using only two databases, we could not include in our dataset any high-caliber relevant works that weren’t indexed by WoS and Scopus.",

    "Abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to be used as a transformative tool in medical education—offering both interactive models and clinical simulations to enhance training. VR presents a space and cost-effective solution for remote education, combined with prospects of higher efficiency and interactivity than traditional training. This study aimed to explore the potential application and perception of VR in a focus group of medical students as an innovative tool for learning anatomy. Sixteen students underwent a structured VR lesson plan exploring concepts in anatomy. Pre- and post-surveys assessed participants’ exposure to VR, previous exposure to and preparedness in anatomy training, and attitudes toward VR. Results revealed that despite limited prior exposure to VR, participants found the technology both easy to navigate and comfortable to use. Notably, over 90% of students indicated that VR would enhance their anatomy learning experience and help them learn a topic better than traditional models. Furthermore, 94% of participants agreed that this learning modality should be offered to medical students, and if given access to this technology, most would utilize it for learning anatomy and potentially for other subjects as well. This study emphasizes VR’s potential to enhance medical education, particularly in anatomy instruction. VR’s adaptability, user-friendly interface, and positive student perceptions highlight its viability as a supplemental tool. Future research should explore specific anatomy applications, long-term impacts on knowledge retention, and the evolving role of VR in medical education.

    "Abstract": "This study examines the effects of implementing a Flipped Mobile-Based Microlearning (FMM) approach on postgraduate students’ accessibility, engagement, knowledge retention, overall learning experience and academic achievement. A quantitative multiple methods approach was employed, utilising a two-group quasi-experimental design and a survey questionnaire to gather data. The results suggest that the FMM approach may have positive effects on accessibility, engagement, knowledge retention, overall learning experience and final exam scores when compared to the traditional learning approach. The findings support the efficacy of integrating FMM, highlighting its potential for enhancing the learning process and academic outcomes. These results have implications for educational practice and research, emphasising the value of technology-enhanced learning approaches, active and interactive learning experiences and the promotion of student motivation and attitudes towards learning. This study underscores the broader applicability of FMM and suggests its potential for improving educational outcomes across different educational levels and subject areas.

    "Abstract": "Gamified learning creates authentic situations for students to solve tasks, provides students with active learning opportunities, and is an effective way to cultivate problem-solving ability, critical thinking, creativity, etc. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of gamified learning and learning behavior modeling technology, choose the Hidden Markov Model as the technical support of the study, adopt the Bayesian Information Criterion to select the optimal number of hidden states of the model, and combine the K-means algorithm with the model optimization in model parameter estimation, which to a certain extent improves the speed of convergence in the process of learning behavior modeling. The game elements and learning activity elements have been integrated and migrated, and proposed gamified learning activity elements. Activity theory and self-determination theory were used to design a gamified learning activity process for the educational field. The game-based learning activity process was continuously revised and optimized by iterating the process with actual teaching cases. Subsequently, we merged qualitative and quantitative research to examine students’ gamified learning and the changes in their learning effects. The results showed that gamified learning produced significant facilitation (p<0.001) in all four dimensions of mind-flow experience, intrinsic motivation, knowledge retention, and transfer performance, with effect values of 1.05, 1.65, 1.00, and 1.08, respectively. This indicates that the gamified learning model can enable students to stimulate and maintain good motivation for learning, and further demonstrates that the process of designing gamified learning activities has effectiveness.",

    "Abstract": "The wide application of virtual reality technology has brought opportunities for teaching ideology and politics, breaking traditional education’s time and space limitations. This paper proposes an automatic three-dimensional modeling technology model, combined with computer vision camera imaging principles, to optimize the amount of data and improve optimization efficiency. And on this basis, it further proposes the Civics virtual scene construction technology, combined with the improved QEM grid simplification algorithm of edge segmentation, to optimize the virtual scene by simplifying the complex three-dimensional grid model. The experimental group’s students have shown good acceptance of this teaching method when teaching Civics in VR venues. In the cognitive and knowledge level of Civics learning, there is a significant difference between the experimental group and the control group in the dimensions of value identity and knowledge retention (P<0.05), and the mean value in the dimension of value identity is as high as 4.55, which is a very significant difference from the control class (P<0.01). And in the experiential feedback of Civics learning, the students in the experimental group have a greater sense of scene realism than the students in the control group (P<0.01), a stronger sense of realism of the interactive experience in learning (P<0.05), a higher degree of concentration in learning (P<0.01), and a more minor degree of interference by the external environment (P<0.01).",

    "Abstract": "In the digital transformation era, higher education stands on the cusp of a revolution. This paper dives into the heart of this transformation, presenting a novel model of intelligent party building education that leverages digital technology to forge a new path for learning. Through the lens of ecological construction, we unveil the CFA model and a sophisticated deep knowledge tracking method aimed at enhancing student performance in Civic and Political Sciences. Our journey through empirical analysis and comparative experiments sheds light on the transformative power of digital education techniques. Despite the initial findings suggesting a modest impact of smart party building and teaching methods on knowledge retention (with significance levels of 0.6941 and 0.4963), a deeper exploration reveals a compelling narrative: the synergistic effect of these methods significantly boosts knowledge retention, as demonstrated by an F-value of 5.6941 and a P-value below 0.05. The prowess of Civics teachers, assessed across three dimensions, further narrates the success of this educational innovation, with scores reflecting their deep understanding of the curriculum and a robust theoretical knowledge base. The performance of 32 Civics teachers, with scores ranging from 12 to 24, underscores the efficacy of intelligent party building education in today’s colleges and universities.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The education of nursing students faces ongoing challenges in ensuring both high-quality learning and safe clinical practice. Traditional methods have been augmented by advanced simulation technologies, which enhance knowledge and skills in clinical settings. However, limitations such as high costs and space constraints persist. Clinical virtual simulation, an emerging approach, offers an interactive and immersive alternative that may address these challenges, but its impact on student satisfaction, self-efficacy, and knowledge retention remains unclear. Methods: This randomized controlled trial involved second-year nursing students (N=42) enrolled in a course on physiological responses. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group using clinical virtual simulation or a control group using low-fidelity simulation. Assessments were conducted at three time points: pretest (A0), immediately post-intervention (A1), and two months later (A2). Knowledge retention, satisfaction, and self-efficacy were measured using tailored instruments. Data analysis included t-tests, MANOVA, and Cohen’s d for effect size. Results: Significant differences were found between the groups in knowledge retention and learning satisfaction. The experimental group showed superior outcomes in both immediate and long-term knowledge retention (P = .001, P = .02) and higher satisfaction levels (P < .001). MANOVA indicated significant time-related changes influenced by group allocation. No significant differences were observed in self-efficacy between groups (P = .9), although group differences were noted across assessments (P = .003). Conclusion: Clinical virtual simulation significantly enhances knowledge retention and student satisfaction in nursing education. While its impact on self-efficacy was less pronounced, the findings underscore the potential of virtual simulation to improve clinical competence and contribute to safer healthcare training.",

    "Abstract": "Classroom Response System (CRS) is a promising educational tool that can create an interactive learning space. In high school, less is known about its impact on learning mathematics. Most studies on the integration of CRS in teaching and learning use internet-dependent tool. This paper aimed to determine the effectiveness of the CRS that uses Bluetooth technology in improving the mathematics achievement and knowledge retention of the students. A quasi-experimental design and longitudinal study with post-test and delayed post-test was employed in this study. The assessment and re-administered assessment results of the CRS and Traditional Classroom Instruction (TCI) groups were compared. Data were analyzed using an independent sample t-test and Welch t-test, and the Mean Percentage Scores (MPS) were calculated to determine the achievement level. Findings revealed that there was a significant difference between the assessment of the CRS and the TCI groups. Moreover, the re-administered assessment results suggest that students exposed to CRS have better knowledge retention compared to the TCI. Furthermore, the MPS showed that CRS exhibited higher mastery level of the learning competencies over the TCI group. This study provides valuable insights into the integration of CRS in mathematics teaching and its consequential effect on achievement and retention.",

    "Abstract": "Course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) exposes an entire class of students to scientific research and is thought to increase students' knowledge retention in science, technology, engineering and mathematics education. Microbial engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that combines science and engineering. We transformed a microbial engineering course into a CURE-type course by adopting an interest-oriented case teaching approach. Based on an investigation of the interest of students, which showed that the topics related to food and health were students' favourites, we selected beer brewing, glutamate fermentation and Monascus cultivation as teaching topics. To simulate the reality of industrial fermentation, pilot-scale fermentation equipment was selected and installed. The course focused on fermentation research; most of the time was spent on performing experiments, and theoretical lectures were held at the intervals. To complete the course in 10 days, three series of experiments were alternatively carried out, and students took turns to conduct fermentation control and process analyses in groups. A questionnaire survey showed that students were satisfied with the CURE-type course, their fermentation knowledge and engineering skills were improved, their research abilities were developed, and their scientific attitudes were cultivated. CURE-type courses are worth popularising in biology teaching.",

    "Abstract": "An association between spatial ability, particularly visualisation, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has been repeatedly demonstrated over the past four decades. Understanding this relationship is of critical importance as substantial evidence illustrates the malleability of spatial ability and that the effects of associated training interventions transfer to desirable STEM outcomes such as improved educational performance and reduced attrition rates. There currently exists a number of theories as to why spatial ability relates to STEM, such as that the nature of STEM activity is inherently spatial. However, there is a need to better understand this relationship from a cognitive perspective. This research examined the hypothesis that spatial ability is predictive of short-term retention for declarative technical information associated with engineering curricula. An original investigation in an authentic educational setting found that visualisation and interest in the lecture material were significant predictors of short-term knowledge retention. This effect was then replicated in two subsequent conceptual replication studies. Based on this predictive finding, it is theorised that increases in spatial ability may support the elongation of the knowledge forgetting curve which would have significant implications for instructional design.",

    "Abstract": "Mathematical inquiry involving hands-on activities has received increasing attention in mathematics education. Besides various customized physical teaching aids, subject-specific information technology, such as Dynamic Geometry System (DGS), finds extensive use in mathematical inquiry activities. However, effects of DGS and physical manipulatives on inquiry-based math learning remain an open question. Hence, by adopting a quasi-experimental research design, this paper aims to empirically compare the immediate learning outcomes, knowledge retention, and learning interest of seventh-grade students who explore with virtual manipulatives (i.e., the DGS) and who explore with physical manipulatives. Specifically, 131 students participated in learning activities centered on exploring pyramids and prisms. During the inquiry process, Group A (n = 33) constructed pyramids and prisms in DGS, Group B (n = 34) observed pre-made virtual models in DGS, Group C (n = 32) observed physical models, and Group D (n = 32) made physical pyramids and prisms with polymer clay and small sticks. Moreover, pretest, post-test, and delayed post-test designed according to the Van Hiele model, as well as an adapted interest questionnaire, were employed to evaluate students' performances; and collected data were analyzed by means of ANCOVA and t-test. Findings of the study revealed that in the context of construction, students employing the DGS exhibited superior immediate learning outcomes and greater knowledge retention compared to their peers who utilized physical manipulatives; while in the case of observation, the virtual and physical manipulatives yielded similar impacts on students' immediate learning outcomes, but students who involved in the DGS demonstrated higher knowledge retention. Furthermore, regarding the DGS environment, students who engaged in constructive manipulation surpassed their peers who engaged in observing manipulation. In terms of interest, the DGS proved to be more effective in both stimulating and maintaining higher interest compared to the physical manipulatives, and constructive manipulation was more effective than observing manipulation. In summary, as compared to the physical manipulatives, DGS, particularly when employed with constructive strategy, has shown to encourage students to more actively engage in task-related cognitive behaviors, thereby supporting and enhancing inquiry-based math learning of students in junior high school.",

    "Abstract": "Virtual and Augmented Reality technologies have emerged as promising tools in the education sector, offering new possibilities for immersive learning experiences. Many researchers have focused their research on examining the potential of these technologies in education from different perspectives. However, it was discovered that there are research gaps in current systematic reviews regarding the examination of the impact of Virtual, Augmented Reality and Learning Analytics utilization on various types of learners and educators across different educational systems, including K-12 Education, Higher Education, Vocational, and Industrial Training, in addition to the educational systems' research tendencies and their adoption of these technologies. Therefore, our study aims to address these gaps by searching various studies in Google Scholar, Scopus, and the IEEE Xplore databases. By following the PRISMA protocol, 150 research papers were selected for analysis, and our findings show that improving motivation and attention, improving learners' understanding & performance, and increasing knowledge retention are the most significant impacts on all types of learners. For educators, we found that these technologies have a prominent effect on assisting educators in teaching and training and reducing the burden. Furthermore, we discovered that Higher Education and Augmented Reality were the dominant educational system and the technology type in the selected studies. We also found that most Virtual and Augmented reality researchers preferred to use questionnaires and online surveys for data collection. We further identified that analyzing learners' traces when interacting with Virtual and Augmented Reality applications can improve learners' performance and learning experience.

    "Abstract": "This study examines the effects of implementing a Flipped Mobile-Based Microlearning (FMM) approach on postgraduate students' accessibility, engagement, knowledge retention, overall learning experience and academic achievement. A quantitative multiple methods approach was employed, utilising a two-group quasi-experimental design and a survey questionnaire to gather data. The results suggest that the FMM approach may have positive effects on accessibility, engagement, knowledge retention, overall learning experience and final exam scores when compared to the traditional learning approach. The findings support the efficacy of integrating FMM, highlighting its potential for enhancing the learning process and academic outcomes. These results have implications for educational practice and research, emphasising the value of technology-enhanced learning approaches, active and interactive learning experiences and the promotion of student motivation and attitudes towards learning. This study underscores the broader applicability of FMM and suggests its potential for improving educational outcomes across different educational levels and subject areas.",

    "Abstract": "Society today is struggling with various challenging phenomena. This manuscript aims to analyse two phenomena, ageing and digitalisation, in the context of education. Both phenomena are an important area of research: the complexity of an ageing population and the intersection of technology and education. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the opportunity to improve the educational experiences of older adults. AI-driven tools and educational initiatives can be tailored to the different learning preferences and cognitive abilities of this population, promoting engagement and knowledge retention. The adaptability of AI systems enables personalised learning pathways that address individual challenges and promote lifelong learning and cognitive health in older learners. This research will highlight the critical role of AI in reshaping educational paradigms and its potential to facilitate knowledge acquisition and empower an often-marginalised population. Finally, focusing on the role of international projects will allow us to understand the trends in EU research and funding. Understanding the impact of AI on education in the third age and EU funding invites a broader discussion on inclusivity and innovation in the educational landscape.",

    "Abstract": "Classroom Response System (CRS) is a promising educational tool that can create an interactive learning space. In high school, less is known about its impact on learning mathematics. Most studies on the integration of CRS in teaching and learning use internet-dependent tool. This paper aimed to determine the effectiveness of the CRS that uses Bluetooth technology in improving the mathematics achievement and knowledge retention of the students. A quasi-experimental design and longitudinal study with post-test and delayed post-test was employed in this study. The assessment and re-administered assessment results of the CRS and Traditional Classroom Instruction (TCI) groups were compared. Data were analyzed using an independent sample t-test and Welch t-test, and the Mean Percentage Scores (MPS) were calculated to determine the achievement level. Findings revealed that there was a significant difference between the assessment of the CRS and the TCI groups. Moreover, the re-administered assessment results suggest that students exposed to CRS have better knowledge retention compared to the TCI. Furthermore, the MPS showed that CRS exhibited higher mastery level of the learning competencies over the TCI group. This study provides valuable insights into the integration of CRS in mathematics teaching and its consequential effect on achievement and retention.",

    "Abstract": "In recent years, incorporating technology into education for students with disabilities has significantly improved learning experiences and academic achievement. However, there remains a need for a deeper understanding of the most effective methods for using these technologies, particularly in physics education. This systematic review aims to consolidate research on the use of technology to support learning for students with disabilities, assess its effectiveness in improving educational outcomes, and identify areas for further study. The review focuses on the constructs, technological interventions, research gaps, limitations, and key findings from selected articles. The PRISMA framework was used to analyze research from databases, including EBSCO Host, Elsevier Science Direct, Emerald Insight, ProQuest, Google Scholar, ERIC, and Clarivate Analytics Web of Science. Out of 892 articles initially identified, 13 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and validation from the experts. The most commonly studied disability was visual impairment, followed by intellectual disabilities. Most studies focused on learner achievement, with engagement and participation as secondary themes. The technologies used included assistive tools like web-based platforms, virtual and augmented reality (AR), and interactive learning systems. These adaptive technologies improved student involvement, social integration, and interest in science. Augmented reality, in particular, enhanced academic performance and knowledge retention, making it an effective tool for inclusive physics education. The findings indicate a growing trend towards integrating technology in inclusive education, emphasizing the role of personalized tools in improving accessibility and engagement for students with disabilities in physics. Alternate abstract: В останні роки впровадження технологій в освіту для студентів з обмеженими можливостями значно покращило їх навчання та академічну успішність. Однак залишається потреба ширшому застосуванні найбільш ефективних методів використання технологій, зокрема в навчанні фізики. Цей систематичний огляд має на меті консолідувати дослідження щодо використання технологій для підтримки навчання учнів з обмеженими можливостями, оцінити їхню ефективність з покращення результатів навчання та визначити напрями подальшого дослідження. Огляд зосереджується на конструкціях, впровадженні технологій, прогалинах у дослідженнях, обмеженнях і основних висновках з вибраних статей. Для аналізу досліджень з баз даних, як-от EBSCO Host, Elsevier Science Direct, Emerald Insight, ProQuest, Google Scholar, ERIC та Clarivate Analytics Web of Science був використаний метод PRISMA. З 892 відібраних статей, 13 відповідали критеріям включення та виключення, а також були схвалені експертами. Найбільш часто досліджуваними обмеженнями можливостей учнів були порушення зору та інтелектуальні порушення. Більшість досліджень зосереджувались на результатах навчання учнів, а залучення учнів до навчального процесу та участь їх у ньому були другорядними темами. Використовувані технології мали допоміжні інструменти, такі як вебплатформи, віртуальна і доповнена реальність (AR) та інтерактивні навчальні системи. Ці адаптивні технології сприяли залученню учнів до навчання, їх соціальній інтеграції та підвищенню їх інтересу до науки. Доповнена реальність, зокрема, покращила академічну успішність та сприяла збереженню знань, що робить її ефективним інструментом для інклюзивної освіти з фізики. Отримані результати свідчать про зростаючу тенденцію інтеграції технологій в інклюзивну освіту, завдяки важливій ролі персоналізованих інструментів у підвищенні доступності та залученості учнів з обмеженими можливостями до вивчення фізики.",

    "Abstract": "Background The use of immersive technology in healthcare education is on the rise, yet its impact on learner engagement, knowledge retention, and specifically in areas like hand hygiene training, remains underexplored. The aim of this scoping review was to summarize the existing studies of immersive technology in hand hygiene training of healthcare providers and health professions students. Methods A scoping review following the Levac et al. framework was conducted. The literature search was performed in databases PubMed, CINAHL Ultimate, ScienceDirect (Elsevier), Web of Science in addition to Google Scholar and ProQuest Dissertation & Theses. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis: Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRIMSA-ScR) guideline was used to report the results. We analysed data using tabular and descriptive summary. Results In the final analysis 11 studies from seven countries were included. Most of the studies ( n  = 10, 90,91%) used virtual reality in hand hygiene training of healthcare providers and health professions students. Most studies have found that immersive technology is useful in teaching hand hygiene ( n  = 6, 54,55%). There are some theories and concepts that support the teaching of hand hygiene with immersive technology, but most of the research is not supported by them. Theories or concepts were included in two studies (18,18%). Conclusion Immersive technology, especially virtual reality, enhances hand hygiene learning and engagement compared to traditional methods. However, most studies lack theoretical support. To advance this field, exploring immersive technology for further research and incorporating relevant theories is encouraged. Additionally, conducting a thorough cost-effectiveness analysis and establishing a robust evaluation framework, encompassing both short-term and long-term outcomes, will be beneficial for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of immersive technology in hand hygiene education.",

    "Abstract": "Aim/Purpose: The study seeks to utilize Augmented Reality (AR) in creating virtual laboratories for engineering education, focusing on enhancing teaching methodologies to facilitate student understanding of intricate and theoretical engineering principles while also assessing engineering students' acceptance of such laboratories. Background: AR, a part of next-generation technology, has enhanced the perception of reality by overlaying virtual elements in the physical environment. The utilization of AR is prevalent across different disciplines, yet its efficacy in facilitating Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is limited. Engineering studies, a part of STEM learning, involves complex and abstract concepts like machine simulation, structural analysis, and design optimization; these things would be easy to grasp with the help of AR. This restriction can be attributed to their innovative characteristics and disparities. Therefore, providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing the acceptance of these technologies by students -- the primary target demographic -- and examining the impact of these factors is essential to maximize the advantages of AR while refining the implementation processes. Methodology: The primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate a tool that enriches the educational experience within engineering laboratories. Utilizing Unity game engine libraries, digital content is meticulously crafted for this tool and subsequently integrated with geo-location functionalities. The tool's user-friendly interface allows both faculty and non-faculty members of the academic institution to establish effortlessly the virtual laboratory. Subsequently, an assessment of the tool is conducted through the application of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model, involving the administration of surveys to university students to gauge their level of adaptability. Contribution: The utilization of interactive augmented learning in laboratory settings enables educational establishments to realize notable savings in time and resources, thereby achieving sustainable educational outcomes. The study is of great importance due to its utilization of student behavioral intentions as the underlying framework for developing an AR tool and illustrating the impact of learner experience on various objectives and the acceptance of AR in Engineering studies. Furthermore, the research results enable educational institutions to implement AR-based virtual laboratories to improve student experiences strategically, align with learner objectives, and ultimately boost the adaptability of AR technologies. Findings: Drawing on practice-based research, the authors showcase work samples and a digital project of AR-based Virtual labs to illustrate the evaluation of the adaptability of AR technology. Adaptability is calculated by conducting a survey of 300 undergraduate university students from different engineering departments and applying an adaptability method to determine the behavioral intentions of students. Recommendations for Practitioners: Engineering institutions could leverage research findings in the implementation of AR to enhance the effectiveness of AR technology in practical education settings. Recommendation for Researchers: The authors implement a pragmatic research framework aimed at integrating AR technology into virtual AR-based labs for engineering education. This study delves into a unique perspective within the realm of engineering studies, considering students' perspectives and discerning their behavioral intentions by drawing upon previous research on technology utilization. The research employs various objectives and learner experiences to assess their influence on students' acceptance of AR technology. Impact on Society: The use of AR in engineering institutions, especially in laboratory practicals, has a significant impact on society, supported by the UTAUT2 model. UTAUT2 model assesses factors like performance, effort expectancy, social influence, and conditions, showing that AR in education is feasible and adaptable. This adaptability helps students and educators incorporate AR tools effectively for better educational results. AR-based labs allow students to interact with complex engineering concepts in immersive settings, enhancing understanding and knowledge retention. This interactive augmented learning for laboratories saves educational institutions significant time and resources, attaining sustainable learning. Future Research: Further research can employ a more comprehensive acceptance model to examine learners' adaptability to AR technology and try comparing different adaptability models to determine which is more effective for engineering students.",

    "Abstract": "The study was proposed to investigate the effect of a technology-integrated guided inquiry-based learning (TGIBL) and guided inquiry (GIBL) approach on preservice mathematics teachers' (PSMTs') plane geometry learning. For this purpose, pre-posttest non-equivalent quasi-experimental design was used. A total of 116 PSMTs within three intact groups: Group1 (48) treated with TGIBL, Group2 (38) with GIBL and Group3 (30) in conventional approach. A two-tiered geometry diagnostic test and a geometry procedural knowledge test were used to collect the data and their reliability were KR20 = 0.87 and ICC = 0.88, respectively. The data were analyzed through a paired sample t-test and a one-way MANOVA. According to the findings, there is statistically significant difference between the groups, that is PSMTs taught with technology-integrated guided inquiry significantly outperformed than other groups. Therefore, the integration of technology and guided inquiry must be considered by teachers' educators as a pedagogical strategy to enhance the learning experience and knowledge retention among pre-service teachers at college of teachers' education.",

    "Abstract": "Currently, students face difficulties in understanding and assembling desktop computer hardware. Traditional teaching, which relies on theoretical classes and manuals, does not provide sufficient interactive or practical experience, hindering the comprehension and retention of knowledge. Understanding hardware is fundamental for computer science and related fields students, as it is the basis for building and maintaining computer systems. The lack of practical knowledge in this area can result in inadequate training, limiting students’ abilities to apply theoretical concepts in real-world situations, which can affect their academic performance and job market readiness. There have been initiatives that included the use of printed manuals, video tutorials, and software simulations to teach hardware. However, these methods failed to engage students sufficiently or provide a practical and realistic learning experience. These methods can become boring and disconnected from the practical experience necessary for properly assembling computer hardware. The proposed solution is the use of an augmented reality (AR) mobile application to create an interactive and practical learning experience. The application called Build_PC was designed, and it allows students to visualize and manipulate hardware components in a virtual environment superimposed on the real world, allowing practical learning of computer assembly and operation. The main results of the research, which used volunteer students associated with control and experimental groups, show that the use of Build_PC significantly improved the understanding and retention of knowledge about computer hardware. Students who used the application demonstrated a greater ability to understand the operation of hardware components compared to those who used traditional methods. In addition, students reported greater motivation and satisfaction with the learning process. Implementing a AR-powered application in hardware education has several important implications. Firstly, it provides an effective tool to enhance understanding and knowledge retention, which can lead to better academic and professional preparation for students. Furthermore, it can serve as a model for integrating emerging technologies in other educational areas, enhancing practical teaching and interactive learning. It also highlights the need to invest in innovative educational technologies to keep up with job market demands and student expectations.",

    "Abstract": "Gross anatomy provides essential knowledge about the structure and function of the human body. Understanding human anatomy requires specific skills from physiotherapy students to comprehend and memorize the location and relationships of anatomical structures. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on teaching methodologies in anatomy education for undergraduate physiotherapy students. A scoping review was conducted consulting the PubMed, EBSCO, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases. By analyzing ten studies involving over 1380 students, we identified four primary pedagogical approaches: the use of technological tools, combined traditional methods (such as dissections and radiological imaging), interprofessional education, and the innovative use of animal dissections. The findings highlight that hands-on, practical activities, especially those integrating technology (e.g., virtual reality and interactive quizzes), significantly enhance student engagement and knowledge retention. Collaborative learning through interprofessional education was found to foster a deeper understanding of anatomical concepts and improve teamwork skills, which are crucial for clinical practice. Additionally, the inclusion of traditional methods like dissections and radiological imaging, when paired with modern tools, offers a comprehensive approach that bridges theoretical knowledge with practical application. The use of animal dissections also emerged as an innovative strategy to enhance anatomical comprehension. In conclusion, the literature underscores the importance of adopting diverse and innovative teaching strategies in gross anatomy education for physiotherapy students. Such approaches not only enrich the learning experience but also ensure that students are well prepared for the demands of professional practice.",

    "Full text": "1. Introduction Human anatomy is a fundamental branch of biological sciences that focuses on the structural organization of living organisms, particularly humans. This discipline is divided into several subfields, each concentrating on different aspects of bodily structures. Gross anatomy, or macroscopic anatomy, deals with the study of anatomical features visible to the naked eye, such as organs and tissues. In contrast, microscopic anatomy delves into structures requiring magnification, including cells and tissues. Developmental anatomy examines the morphological changes from conception through maturity, while clinical anatomy applies anatomical knowledge to clinical practice, enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities [1].",

    "Abstract": "In today's world, technology plays a significant role in shaping our daily interactions and how we connect with the world. The rapid advancements in technology have influenced many sectors, particularly education, where integrating technology is now seen as essential rather than just a luxury. As a result, the education field has adapted over time to keep up with innovations and their potential to improve the teaching and learning environment. The incorporation of technology into education has evolved from introducing computer systems in classrooms to the adoption of smartboards, tablets, and e-learning platforms. The rise of Virtual Reality (VR) technology has also opened up possibilities for hands-on learning experiences that allow students to explore and practice skills in ways that traditional teaching methods cannot. VR technology enables students to interact with content in a way that fosters a sense of presence and immersion, which can improve knowledge retention. In fields, like science, engineering, medicine, arts, and language learning, VR applications have shown promise in boosting student engagement and enhancing skills within a controlled learning environment. However, the widespread adoption of VR technology in education faces challenges. One significant obstacle is the cost of acquiring VR equipment and software which can strain budgets. Additionally, the availability of high-quality content for VR platforms poses a barrier for educators seeking to integrate VR into their teaching practices. This article delves into the use of Virtual Reality in education, and how VR can influence student learning outcomes in applications such as medicine, science, arts and language learning. Apart from the advantages of VR, the article also discusses the obstacles that are impeding the use of VR in education including concerns about costs, standardizing content and the necessity for training and support for educators. As VR technology advances and becomes widely available, it stands ready to revolutionize the landscape by offering learning opportunities that were previously beyond imagination. Through this technology, education can introduce a world of possibilities that nurture curiosity, creativity and a lifelong enthusiasm for learning.",

    "Abstract": "After the pandemic, research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the field of education has seen a significant increase globally. However, a few studies conducted before the pandemic addressed the problem of supporting intrinsic motivation in students, crucial for the quality of learning and knowledge retention. This study explores how this topic is covered in recent research, by conducting a cross-disciplinary literature review and critical discourse analysis under the theoretical framework of Activity Theory (AT). It aims to identify the coverage extension of all types of relationships between nodes in the educational activity system, with special attention to Subject (students) and Object, as this central relationship embodies the motive-driven nature of human activity. The analysis incorporated 69 articles from Scopus published from 2020 until now. The results demonstrate the coverage about only some relationships like: Subject-Tools (students' interaction with AI technology), Tools-Object (AI technologies development), and Tools-Community (adapting AI within an educational community). The Subject-Object relationship remains unexplored. Practical implications include refocusing on intrinsic motivation, emphasising epistemological needs, meaning, and choice. This involves evaluating the benefits and risks of AI in specific educational cases. Theoretical implications involve exploring how to sustain students' intrinsic motivation in the context of AI implementation.",

    "Abstract": "Contribution: This research explores the effectiveness of a proposed teaching strategy in blockchain education, finding that it enhances learning outcomes, cognitive well-being, and student engagement in tertiary education, ultimately resulting in a shallower learning curve for STEM knowledge. Background: In the context of Industry 4.0, blockchain technology has emerged as a key driver of transformation in data management and system automation across a range of industrial applications. Despite its significance, the intricate theories and concepts associated with blockchain often serve as a deterrent for novice learners, inhibiting their ability to appreciate the value of industrial blockchain. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop interactive teaching content that alleviates the steep learning curve. Intended Outcomes: The teaching strategy for the gamification in blockchain education is proposed, which positively influence students' cognitive well-being in terms of knowledge retention, cognitive curiosity, and heightened enjoyment. Application Design: Based on the experimental learning theory, the gamification of blockchain education, namely \"BlockTrainHK\", is implemented in the experimental learning cycle. Therefore, the gamified learning in experimental learning (GEL) strategy is proposed to examine the effectiveness of concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization and active experimentation by two case studies.

    "Abstract": "It is of great significance to study the effectiveness of knowledge transfer between the new and the veteran employees within enterprises for promoting sustainable innovation from the perspective of innovation quality management. However, few studies have examined the impact of innovation quality on the effectiveness of knowledge transfer between the new and veteran employees. In addition, knowledge of how reward and punishment incentives affect the effectiveness of knowledge transfer in innovation quality management remains insufficient. Since the amount of knowledge transfer is an important aspect of the effectiveness of knowledge transfer, this paper constructs a Stackelberg game model with an innovation-quality-oriented threshold of the knowledge transfer amount and investigates the amount of knowledge transfer between new and veteran employees in the collaborative innovation of research and development (R&D) projects within enterprises. A case study was used to reveal that the innovation-quality-oriented threshold for the knowledge transfer amount can effectively promote the amount of knowledge transfer between the new and the veteran employees in collaborative innovation. Moreover, reward is more effective than punishment in promoting the amount of knowledge transfer to exceed the innovation-quality-oriented threshold. This study enriches the theories of knowledge transfer games under quality management. By virtue of end-to-end project management strategies, modern multimedia technologies, and reward incentives this study can be used to conduct quality control during project execution, to promote knowledge retention in R&D projects, the innovation quality of projects, and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The research methodology employed in this paper was limited to a case study, and the data utilized are not empirical data.",

    "Abstract": "Contribution: This research explores the effectiveness of a proposed teaching strategy in blockchain education, finding that it enhances learning outcomes, cognitive well-being, and student engagement in tertiary education, ultimately resulting in a shallower learning curve for STEM knowledge.Background: In the context of Industry 4.0, blockchain technology has emerged as a key driver of transformation in data management and system automation across a range of industrial applications. Despite its significance, the intricate theories and concepts associated with blockchain often serve as a deterrent for novice learners, inhibiting their ability to appreciate the value of industrial blockchain. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop interactive teaching content that alleviates the steep learning curve.Intended Outcomes: The teaching strategy for the gamification in blockchain education is proposed, which positively influence students’ cognitive well-being in terms of knowledge retention, cognitive curiosity, and heightened enjoyment.Application Design: Based on the experimental learning theory, the gamification of blockchain education, namely “BlockTrainHK”, is implemented in the experimental learning cycle. Therefore, the gamified learning in experimental learning (GEL) strategy is proposed to examine the effectiveness of concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization and active experimentation by two case studies.Findings: The results of the two-year study on the gamified blockchain education are encouraging: test groups using the GEL strategy were better in the cognitive well-being, and students’ cognitive well-being is positively proportional to the level of individual technical knowledge and skills.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of the flipped classroom pedagogical approach on computer-based technology education in higher education. Grounded in Bloom’s revised taxonomy, this quasi-experimental study aimed to enhance students’ engagement, knowledge retention, and overall learning outcomes. Over thirteen weeks, a tailored program utilized prerecorded lectures and collaborative in-class activities. Pretest and posttest scores from computer skills tests were analyzed for instructional videos, with only one group of students using SPSS and Jamovi software. The experimental group showed a statistically significant increase in average scores compared to the control group. The research indicates that training significantly enhances the effectiveness of integrating flipped learning in classrooms. Furthermore, students who receive instruction using these tools demonstrate a stronger understanding of scientific concepts. The flipped classroom approach therefore has a positive influence. This study recommends further research in diverse educational contexts to highlight the potential applicability of this approach in fostering effective and dynamic learning environments.",

    "Abstract": "This study proposes the integration of change management with a knowledge management framework to address knowledge retention and successful change management in the context of Industry 5.0. Using the ADKAR model, it is suggested to implement strategies for training and user acceptance testing. The research highlights the importance of applying the human capital life cycle in knowledge and change management, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in adapting to Industry 5.0. The methodology includes a review of the state of the art in intangible asset management, change management models, and the integration of change and knowledge management. In addition, a case study is presented in a food production company that validates the effectiveness of the ADKAR model in implementing digital technologies, improving process efficiency and increasing employee acceptance of new technologies. The results show a significant improvement in process efficiency and a reduction in resistance to change. The originality of the study lies in the combination of the ADKAR model with intangible asset and knowledge management, providing a holistic solution for change management in the Industry 5.0 era. Future implications suggest the need to explore the applicability of the ADKAR model in different industries and cultures, as well as its long-term effects on organisational sustainability and innovation. This comprehensive approach can serve as a guide for other organisations seeking to implement successful digital transformations.",

    "Abstract": "- Virtual simulation technology, a cornerstone of modern innovation, revolutionizes the way we interact with virtual environments, offering immersive experiences across various fields. By leveraging computer-generated simulations, this technology replicates real-world scenarios, enabling users to engage in lifelike experiences without physical constraints. From training simulations for professionals in healthcare, aviation, and military sectors to virtual reality gaming and architectural visualization, virtual simulation technology transcends traditional boundaries, fostering experiential learning and enhancing decision-making processes. Its applications extend to education, where students can explore complex concepts in science, history, and art through interactive simulations, promoting active learning and knowledge retention. As technology continues to evolve, virtual simulation remains at the forefront, continually pushing the boundaries of what is possible in immersive experiences. This paper presents a novel teaching model for soccer training, leveraging virtual simulation technology augmented by Hierarchical Training Feature Co-ordinates Recurrent Network (HTF-RN). The proposed model aims to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of soccer training programs by providing immersive and interactive experiences in virtual environments. Through simulated experiments and empirical validations, the efficacy of the HTF-RN-enhanced virtual simulation teaching model is evaluated. Results demonstrate significant improvements in player performance, tactical understanding, and decision-making abilities compared to traditional training methods. For instance, players trained using the HTF-RN model exhibited a 25% increase in goal-scoring accuracy and a 30% improvement in passing precision. Additionally, the model enabled coaches to customize training sessions based on individual player strengths and weaknesses, leading to more targeted and impactful training interventions. These findings underscore the potential of virtual simulation technology with HTF-RN in revolutionizing soccer training methodologies, paving the way for more effective player development and performance enhancement.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Education of patients prior to an invasive procedure is pivotal for good cooperation and knowledge retention. Virtual reality (VR) is a fast-developing technology that helps educate both medical professionals and patients. Objective: To prove non-inferiority of VR education compared to conventional education in patients prior to the implantation of a permanent pacemaker (PPM). Methods: 150 participants scheduled for an elective implantation of a PPM were enrolled in this prospective study and randomized into two groups: the VR group ( n = 75) watched a 360° video about the procedure using the VR headset Oculus Meta Quest 2, while the conventional group ( n = 75) was educated by a physician. Both groups filled out a questionnaire to assess the quality of education pre- and in-hospital, their knowledge of the procedure, and their subjective satisfaction. Results: There was no significant difference in the quality of education. There was a non-significant trend towards higher educational scores in the VR group. The subgroup with worse scores was older than the groups with higher scores (82 vs. 76 years, p = 0.025). Anxiety was reduced in 92% of participants. Conclusion: VR proved to be non-inferior to conventional education. It helped to reduce anxiety and showed no adverse effects.",

    "Abstract": "This work investigates the design and usability of a novel eXtended Reality (XR) Vest, which combines two viewpoints for demonstration-based training (DBT). Traditional modalities for DBT, such as prerecorded videos and live instruction, are minimally engaging and potentially hazardous resulting in low motivation and knowledge retention. To combat this, works incorporate XR technology to improve training immersiveness, safety, and engagement. When worn by a trainer, our XR Vest enables trainees to have the first-person perspective of immersive XR environments on an integrated tablet while simultaneously watching the third-person motor movements. To test the XR Vest in DBT, 28 individuals completed three training sessions: 1) using an Oculus Quest 2 (baseline); 2) watching a DBT video on a desktop computer monitor (first-person perspective); and 3) viewing a DBT on the XR Vest (first-person and third-person perspectives). Following each session, the participants performed a memory aptitude test to evaluate their recall, a NASA Task Load Index questionnaire to investigate their perceived workload, and a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire to measure the usability of the systems. A linear mixed-effect analysis showed significant differences between the temporal demand, physical demand, and frustration in the NASA-TLX scores and the integration and learnability features in the SUS scores. The results suggest that incorporating XR technology in first- and third-person perspectives within the XR Vest decreased workload and improved system usability. Future works should evaluate the benefits of this XR design in other domains where DBT is used.",

    "Abstract": "In this article, we examine organizational resilience to research and development (R&D) productivity losses following knowledge loss (aka “forgetting”) using a long panel (1970–2007) of data on U.S. biotechnology research. In our model, knowledge and R&D productivity loss may occur through three mechanisms, scientist turnover, interference with knowledge retrieval, and scientist knowledge decay. Our model also proposes three means through which organizations may become resilient to the effects of knowledge loss on R&D productivity. First, managers may compensate for knowledge losses due to turnover by recruitment. Second, the effects of interference to knowledge retrieval due to the use of new technologies may be minimized if new technologies are introduced into organizations by members with little prior experience in using incumbent technologies or by scientists with little prior collaboration experience. Third, scientists may mitigate the effects of knowledge decay by relearning because the reacquisition of previously lost knowledge is easier than learning it was initially. Irrespective of their source, our results suggest that the agency plays a role in making an organization resist the negative effects of knowledge loss on its R&D productivity.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the effects of implementing a Flipped Mobile-Based Microlearning (FMM) approach on postgraduate students’ accessibility, engagement, knowledge retention, overall learning experience and academic achievement. A quantitative multiple methods approach was employed, utilising a two-group quasi-experimental design and a survey questionnaire to gather data. The results suggest that the FMM approach may have positive effects on accessibility, engagement, knowledge retention, overall learning experience and final exam scores when compared to the traditional learning approach. The findings support the efficacy of integrating FMM, highlighting its potential for enhancing the learning process and academic outcomes. These results have implications for educational practice and research, emphasising the value of technology-enhanced learning approaches, active and interactive learning experiences and the promotion of student motivation and attitudes towards learning. This study underscores the broader applicability of FMM and suggests its potential for improving educational outcomes across different educational levels and subject areas.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The study argues that managing tacit knowledge (TKM) would reduce small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operational discontinuity and knowledge loss in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, South Africa. Objectives: The article examined the strategies put in place by SMEs for tacit knowledge management (TKM) practices and to develop a framework that will promote TKM for SMEs. Method: The study adopted a quantitative research method and targeted 326 SMEs using Google Forms. One hundred and eighty (180; 55.2%) useful responses were obtained and analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Results: Most of the SME owners are aware and affirmed that there is a particular tacit knowledge that is of importance to business. The most common methods of capturing tacit knowledge among SMEs are monitoring, practical sessions, in-house training programmes, and brainstorming. Tacit knowledge is shared during meetings (such as project teams) and when dialoguing. The study also revealed that electronic files in computers are the major tools for storing the collected tacit knowledge. Conclusion: The study concluded that TKM among SMEs in KZN required improvement and recommended improving teams and informal networks and making information and communication technology tools available to preserve tacit knowledge. The SMEs that can afford it can consider employing the services of consultant knowledge management officers to conduct periodic knowledge audits to identify knowledge gaps for proactive solutions. Contribution: The study contributed to knowledge management, tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge, and TKM.",

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with pharmacy students in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, utilizing stratified random sampling for data collection. The study employed a validated questionnaire to gather information on students' use of technology, their preferences, and their perceived learning outcomes. The analysis was carried out using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, version 29) (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY), ensuring adherence to the ethical standards set by the institutional review board. Results The study, involving 508 pharmacy students from Saudi Arabia, revealed that a significant majority regularly use technology in their education, particularly online learning management systems and virtual labs, indicating a shift toward more accessible and efficient learning methods. A notable portion of the students acknowledged the beneficial impact of technology on their learning, with 86.3% reporting improved knowledge retention, 92% noting enhanced skills, and 87.1% observing better academic performance. However, the study also uncovered challenges, with about half of the students facing issues mainly related to distractions while finding technological complexity less problematic. The support from educational institutions in addressing these issues was found to be moderate. These findings underscore the crucial role of technology in enhancing pharmacy education while highlighting the need for more comprehensive institutional support and strategic planning to address the challenges faced by students. Conclusions Technology plays a vital role in the modernization of pharmacy education, significantly aiding in knowledge retention, skill development, and academic performance. Despite the widespread use of technology, the varied experiences and challenges encountered by students underscore the need for increased institutional support and strategic planning.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT As virtual reality (VR) technologies have been increasingly adopted in the educational field, careful consideration and evaluation of instructional modes to support learning with VR are needed. This study focuses on evaluation of two instructional modes: direct interaction and manipulation of the VR learning environment; and the vicarious approach of observing how a novice peer and an expert learn with VR. An experimental design was utilized with two comparison conditions: direct VR interaction ( n  = 72) and the vicarious approach ( n  = 69). Participants’ knowledge and emotional engagement were evaluated via self-report questionnaires. Results showed that though learning with the direct VR condition was associated with more intense emotional engagement, there was no significant difference in knowledge gains between the two study conditions. The findings suggest that each of the two instructional modes has specific instructional affordances and that the cognitive and emotional components of learning via VR should be further explored. Since learning vicariously through observing the dialogue between an expert and a peer can have immediate knowledge gains comparable to the direct VR interaction, there is an effective and more accessible opportunity for VR-based learning. Future research should evaluate this instructional effect on knowledge retention.",

O conhecimento adquirido ao longo do tempo, por meio de ações na busca de soluções para as mais diversas situações do dia a dia, necessita tornar-se acessível, compartilhado e armazenado, a fim de acessá-lo como fonte de pesquisa e contribuir com novas informações e novos saberes. As competências cognitivas dos membros de uma organização podem ser potencializadas, disseminadas entre todos se a cultura organizacional incentivar o uso de ferramentas de comunicação aliadas à tecnologia. O objetivo desta pesquisa foi de desenvolver um ambiente computacional para promover criatividade e inovação nas organizações, com foco no módulo de retenção do conhecimento. O ambiente foi idealizado para que os usuários sejam parte da estrutura organizacional, livre das barreiras psicológicas que podem frear a capacidade criativa e participarem ativamente em processos de aprendizagem. Desta forma, contribuindo efetivamente em um processo de desenvolvimento de ideias inovadoras. Para o desenvolvimento do ambiente computacional foi definido um modelo de processo, além da definição das tecnologias utilizadas e da estrutura do banco de dados, chegando ao resultado: a ferramenta IdeiaWare que armazena e retém todas as ideias advindas dos membros de uma organização e todas as contribuições feitas até chegar ao resultado final, produto dos colaboradores de organizações. Alternate abstract: New challenges permeate the organizational environment requiring management practices to be implemented to mitigate the damage that the loss of knowledge can represent for an organization. Management practices need to adapt to current requirements, using technology to their advantage and promoting learning actions in the organizational environment. The knowledge acquired over time, through actions in the search for solutions for the most diverse everyday situations, needs to become accessible, shared and stored, in order to access it as a source of research and contribute to new information and new knowledge. The cognitive skills of an organization's members can be enhanced and disseminated among everyone if the organizational culture encourages the use of communication tools combined with technology. The objective of this research was to develop a computational environment to promote creativity and innovation in organizations, focusing on the knowledge retention module. The environment was designed so that users are part of the organizational structure, free from psychological barriers that can hinder creative capacity and actively participate in learning processes. In this way, effectively contributing to a process of developing innovative ideas. For the development of the computational environment, a process model was defined, in addition to the definition of the technologies used and the structure of the database, reaching the result: the IdeiaWare tool that stores and retains all ideas coming from the members of an organization and all contributions made until reaching the final result, a product of organizations’ employees.",

    "Abstract": "As virtual reality (VR) technologies have been increasingly adopted in the educational field, careful consideration and evaluation of instructional modes to support learning with VR are needed. This study focuses on evaluation of two instructional modes: direct interaction and manipulation of the VR learning environment; and the vicarious approach of observing how a novice peer and an expert learn with VR. An experimental design was utilized with two comparison conditions: direct VR interaction ( n = 72) and the vicarious approach ( n = 69). Participants’ knowledge and emotional engagement were evaluated via self-report questionnaires. Results showed that though learning with the direct VR condition was associated with more intense emotional engagement, there was no significant difference in knowledge gains between the two study conditions. The findings suggest that each of the two instructional modes has specific instructional affordances and that the cognitive and emotional components of learning via VR should be further explored. Since learning vicariously through observing the dialogue between an expert and a peer can have immediate knowledge gains comparable to the direct VR interaction, there is an effective and more accessible opportunity for VR-based learning. Future research should evaluate this instructional effect on knowledge retention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "As we enter a world of blended learning in higher education, an increased need for adaptation of teaching strategies to enhance engagement has been recognised to amplify learning outcomes online. Gamification has been identified as a creative tool to engage the current cohort of learners who are also characteristically tech-savvy. To this end, escape room games have gained considerable traction in medical and pharmacy education to promote learning, critical thinking and teamwork. In this pilot study we describe the implementation of a 60-minute, web-based hepatitis-themed escape room game within a Year 3 Pharmacotherapy unit at Monash University. A total of 418 students participated in this activity. Students’ knowledge gain on the topic was assessed through a pre- and post-intervention assessment, whereby a statistically significant improvement was seen in the knowledge score following implementation of the gaming activity (58.66% pre-intervention vs. 72.05% post-intervention, p  < 0.05). The innovative learning activity was also well perceived by the students. Virtual escape room game is a viable pedagogical approach to teach and reinforce clinical concepts among pharmacy students. With the evolving landscape of education and learner demographics, investment in technology- enhanced game-based learning is a promising trajectory to support students’ growth in a learner-centered environment. A comparison between virtual escape room game and traditional teaching will further inform effectiveness of the gamification on long term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Glaucoma is a serious eye disease and glaucoma optic disc hemorrhage (GODH) is an important diagnostic indicator for glaucoma. Deep-learning-based medical image segmentation methods for automatic optic cup and disc segmentation have made tremendous progress. However, when it comes to the segmentation of GODH, classical deep learning technologies face two main challenges: the difficulties in distinguishing GODH from the end points or bending points of blood vessels, and the imbalance between the pixel classes of the target area and the background area. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning framework integrating expert knowledge (E-Net) for the segmentation of GODH in fundus images. This E-Net consisted of a primary network for GODH segmentation and two auxiliary networks for extraction of optic disc (OD) and blood vessels. The segmentation probability maps from the two auxiliary networks were used to improve the segmentation accuracy of GODH, via expert knowledge loss functions and attention mechanism. Moreover, we designed a weighted segmentation accuracy loss function to balance the segmentation accuracy of the target and background region, thus fully mining the substantial information in the fundus images. The proposed E-Net was verified on a GODH dataset from Beijing Tongren Hospital. The experiments showed that the proposed E-Net achieved state-of-the-art results on this dataset.",

    "Abstract": "Three-dimensional-printed anatomical models (3DPAMs) appear to be a relevant tool due to their educational value and their feasibility. The objectives of this review were to describe and analyse the methods utilised for creating 3DPAMs used in teaching human anatomy and for evaluating its pedagogical contribution. BACKGROUND Three-dimensional-printed anatomical models (3DPAMs) appear to be a relevant tool due to their educational value and their feasibility. The objectives of this review were to describe and analyse the methods utilised for creating 3DPAMs used in teaching human anatomy and for evaluating its pedagogical contribution.An electronic search was conducted on PubMed using the following terms: education, school, learning, teaching, learn, teach, educational, three-dimensional, 3D, 3-dimensional, printing, printed, print, anatomy, anatomical, anatomically, and anatomic. Data retrieved included study characteristics, model design, morphological evaluation, educational performance, advantages, and disadvantages. METHODS An electronic search was conducted on PubMed using the following terms: education, school, learning, teaching, learn, teach, educational, three-dimensional, 3D, 3-dimensional, printing, printed, print, anatomy, anatomical, anatomically, and anatomic. Data retrieved included study characteristics, model design, morphological evaluation, educational performance, advantages, and disadvantages.Of the 68 articles selected, the cephalic region was the most studied (33 articles); 51 articles mentioned bone printing. In 47 articles, the 3DPAM was designed from CT scans. Five printing processes were listed. Plastic and its derivatives were used in 48 studies. The cost per design ranged from 1.25 USD to 2800 USD. Thirty-seven studies compared 3DPAM to a reference model. Thirty-three articles investigated educational performance. The main advantages were visual and haptic qualities, effectiveness for teaching, reproducibility, customizability and manipulability, time savings, integration of functional anatomy, better mental rotation ability, knowledge retention, and educator/student satisfaction. The main disadvantages were related to the design: consistency, lack of detail or transparency, overly bright colours, long printing time, and high cost. RESULTS Of the 68 articles selected, the cephalic region was the most studied (33 articles); 51 articles mentioned bone printing. In 47 articles, the 3DPAM was designed from CT scans. Five printing processes were listed. Plastic and its derivatives were used in 48 studies. The cost per design ranged from 1.25 USD to 2800 USD.

The main disadvantages were related to the design: consistency, lack of detail or transparency, overly bright colours, long printing time, and high cost.This systematic review demonstrates that 3DPAMs are feasible at a low cost and effective for teaching anatomy. More realistic models require access to more expensive 3D printing technologies and substantially longer design time, which would greatly increase the overall cost. Choosing an appropriate image acquisition modality is key. From a pedagogical viewpoint, 3DPAMs are effective tools for teaching anatomy, positively impacting the learning outcomes and satisfaction level. The pedagogical effectiveness of 3DPAMs seems to be best when they reproduce complex anatomical areas, and they are used by students early in their medical studies.

    "Abstract": "This experiment utilized advanced visualization technology for the delivery of an introductory remote sensing lesson in an undergraduate geography course. Given the numerous immersive visualization solutions available, it is now possible to leverage the capabilities of augmented, mixed, and virtual reality (AR, MR, and VR) technology in a classroom learning environment. For instructors, it is important to understand how advanced visualization technologies can enhance the learning experience and enable greater knowledge retention. To validate the use of an AR sand table/sandbox in a group academic setting, approximately 400 participants were evaluated to assess the impact on students’ retention of both foundational and practical remote sensing concepts. This work represents a between-subjects design with two AR sand table experimental groups (instructor sand table interaction, and student sand table interaction) and one control group with no sand table exposure. The use of the AR sand table in a classroom environment was found to improve retention of foundational remote sensing knowledge and elevate the assessment performance for subjects identified as lower performers.",

    "Abstract": "In the disruptive environment, the supply chains are unpredictable, volatile, and complex. By effectively applying knowledge, information, data, human intelligence, and new technologies, businesses with knowledge-based supply chains may successfully navigate the disruptive environment. This study has made an attempt to identify and evaluate the challenging factors that essential for knowledge-based supply chains to attain resilience. Due to the high effectiveness in determining the relationship among the factors, the study used the Fuzzy DEMATEL methodology. A total of 25 factors from the literature review were explored and validated by expert’s judgement to be grouped as causal and effect group variables. The Fuzzy DEMATEL results exhibit that digital technologies-based supply chains, agility, green perspective, personalization, last mile delivery, e-Procurement, mentoring & coaching for knowledge retention are the significant causal factors to be considered by the knowledge-based supply chains. Furthermore, the strategic measures are investigated and evaluated using the Best-Worst Method (BWM) application, which reveals that the two most important strategic solutions that have the potential to improve resilience in knowledge-based supply chains are a focus on socially sustainable supply chains and Industry 4.0 technologies. The report can help businesses think through important methods for long-term resilience.",

    "Abstract": "The field of language education has experienced a rise in using virtual reality (VR) to support interactive, contextualized, and collaborative language learning in recent years. The current study investigates the effects of auditory, visual, and textual input on speaking and writing in English for Tourism Purposes (ETP) through immersive, scenery-based virtual reality (SBVR) dyadic learning. Adopting a framework on ETP sociocultural, linguistic, and formulaic competence, the researchers designed relevant learning content using audios, images, and verbatim onscreen text on EduVenture VR to create an interactive, simulated tour. Thirty-eight English as a foreign language undergraduates participated in this single-group quasi-experiment. Various data sources included speaking and writing pre-, post- and delayed post-tests, a post-intervention survey, and reflections about the VR learning experience. The study reported significant speaking gains in language accuracy, destination promotion, knowledge retention, and replication of ETP language, as well as significant writing improvement in using sophisticated vocabulary, knowledge retention, and replication of ETP language. The study concludes that SBVR warrants positive impact on improving productive ETP skills. Possible factors, limitations, and pedagogical implications for using scenery-based VR in dyadic learning for ETP are discussed. Finally, the study suggests future research directions to combine technology-enhanced language learning theories with multimodal input and material design supported by immersive VR to enhance language production for specific purposes.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this Real Impact Viewpoint Article is to analyze the phenomenon of the Great Resignation from the knowledge management perspective. Design/methodology/approach It applies the knowledge-based view of the firm to the notion of the Great Resignation, reviews the extant literature and relies on secondary data. Findings The Great Resignation has created numerous knowledge-related impacts on the individual, organizational and national levels. On the individual level, because of an accelerating adoption of freelancing, the future may witness an expansion of the category of the knowledge worker and a growing need for personal knowledge management methods and information technologies. Organizational effects include knowledge loss, reduced business process efficiency, damaged intra-organizational knowledge flows, lower relational capital, lost informal friendship networks, difficulty attracting the best human capital, undermined knowledge transfer processes and knowledge leakage to competition. Countries may also witness the depletion of national human capital. Practical implications Managers should learn how to use the available human capital more efficiently; realize the importance of universal succession planning programs; automate knowledge-centric business processes; facilitate knowledge-based IT initiatives by implementing self-functioning virtual communities, including enterprise social networks; restructure organizations to optimize intra-organizational knowledge flows; adjust strategies, products and target markets based on the available human capital; and create telecommuting conditions for people with disabilities who cannot be physically present. Knowledge management scholars are presented with a unique opportunity to convert the numerous theoretical insights accumulated within the boundaries of their discipline into practical application to facilitate the Great Knowledge Revolution. Originality/value This viewpoint offers managerial recommendations and inspires future Great Resignation investigations.",

The ability to communicate comprehensible information to patients has never been greater. Thus, the author's aim is to explore whether it is feasible and acceptable to deliver a digital health education intervention to patients undergoing endovenous thermal ablation (EVTA) to supplement the consent process.This is a prospective, single centre, randomised controlled, feasibility trial recruiting patients with chronic venous disease deemed suitable to undergo EVTA. Patients will be randomised to receive either standard consent (SC) or a newly developed digital health education tool (dHET). The primary outcome is feasibility; assessing the recruitment and retention rate of participants and assessing acceptability of the intervention. Secondary outcomes include knowledge retention, anxiety and satisfaction. This feasibility trial is designed to recruit 40 patients, which will allow for a moderate dropout rate. This pilot study will inform the authors of the appropriateness of an adequately powered multicentre trial.

    "Abstract": "Critical thinking is identified as a key educational outcome in higher education curricula; however, it is not trivial to support students in building this multifaceted skill. In this study, we evaluated a brief online learning intervention focusing on informal fallacy identification, a hallmark critical-thinking skill. The intervention used a bite-sized video learning approach, which has been shown to promote student engagement. Video-based learning was implemented within a precision teaching (PT) framework, which modulates the exposure of individual learners to the learning material to enable them to build ‘fluency’ in the targeted skills. In one of the learning conditions, PT was applied synergistically with domain-general problem-based training to support generalisation. The intervention consisted of two learning episodes and was administered to three groups (learning conditions) of 19 participants each: a PT fluency-based training group; a PT + group, where PT was combined with problem-based training; and a self-directed learning control group. All three groups showed comparable improvements in fallacy identification on taught (post-episode tests) and unseen materials (post-intervention assessment), with lower-scoring participants showing higher gains than high-scoring participants. The results of the knowledge retention tests a week later were also comparable between groups. Importantly, in the domain-general fallacy-identification assessment (post-intervention), the two PT groups showed higher improvements than the control group. These findings suggest that the integration of bite-sized video learning technologies with PT can improve students’ critical-thinking skills. Furthermore, PT, on its own or combined with problem-based training, can improve their skill to generalise learning to novel contexts. We discuss the educational implications of our findings.

    "Abstract": "As we enter a world of blended learning in higher education, an increased need for adaptation of teaching strategies to enhance engagement has been recognised to amplify learning outcomes online. Gamification has been identified as a creative tool to engage the current cohort of learners who are also characteristically tech-savvy. To this end, escape room games have gained considerable traction in medical and pharmacy education to promote learning, critical thinking and teamwork. In this pilot study we describe the implementation of a 60-minute, web-based hepatitis-themed escape room game within a Year 3 Pharmacotherapy unit at Monash University. A total of 418 students participated in this activity. Students' knowledge gain on the topic was assessed through a pre- and post-intervention assessment, whereby a statistically significant improvement was seen in the knowledge score following implementation of the gaming activity (58.66% pre-intervention vs. 72.05% post-intervention, p  < 0.05). The innovative learning activity was also well perceived by the students. Virtual escape room game is a viable pedagogical approach to teach and reinforce clinical concepts among pharmacy students. With the evolving landscape of education and learner demographics, investment in technology- enhanced game-based learning is a promising trajectory to support students' growth in a learner-centered environment. A comparison between virtual escape room game and traditional teaching will further inform effectiveness of the gamification on long term knowledge retention.As we enter a world of blended learning in higher education, an increased need for adaptation of teaching strategies to enhance engagement has been recognised to amplify learning outcomes online.

Quality concerns * Absence of EAC templates, procedures, or tools for sponsor review * Inadequate record keeping for EAC activities (i.e., manuals, charter, system training, site guidance, meeting minutes, spend reporting) * Inadequate EAC documentation * Poor metrics or EAC performance data * High volume of backlog events that require adjudication * Average adjudication time to reach decision exceeds 10 working days * Average time for EAC vendor to process EAC records exceeds 2.5 working days * No automation of EAC workflow or lack of EAC technology * Sponsor lacks access to EAC performance dashboard * EAC member turnover * High rate of discordance among EAC members * High rate of variability between EAC members uncovered during quality control re-read workflow 4.Event identification obstacles * Challenges with event reporting process * Inadequate event identification workflows * Manual event identification processes * Discovery of missed events * Inability to programmatically detect events or detect events that require re-adjudication * Duplicate events in adjudication output * Lack of clinical and medical oversight of event identification workflow Adjudication technology challenges The adjudication system plays a critical role in the entire adjudication management process and workflow and should be assessed from the perspective of each user on the platform.",

    "Abstract": "Computer-based learning applications and mobile technology have transformed many aspects of the educational experience over the last decade, producing software aimed at improving learning efficiency and streamlining the presentation of course materials. One such class of software, purpose-created to take advantage of spaced learning and spaced testing principles, are electronic flashcard applications. We provide a perspective on the novel use of the Quizlet flashcard application in a tertiary educational setting. To reduce cognitive load for international graduate dental students taking a pharmacology review course, we implemented Quizlet, which integrates both spaced learning and self-testing, to improve the student learning experience. This study assessed students’ perceptions of the Quizlet flashcard system in a student cohort comprised of two consecutive years’ classes (n = 51 students in total). Results indicated broad acceptance of Quizlet based on ease of use of the software and ease of study of the material. Our data provide insight into the use of this common software in a professional healthcare tertiary education setting and further demonstrate the successful application of electronic flashcards for a mixed international student cohort. Further research should include an assessment of the impact of flashcard on long-term knowledge retention in this setting.",

There is a shortage and deficiency in information about the uses and benefits of the Anatomage table. The aim of this article was to review and assess the current evidence about the advantages of the Anatomage virtual table in medical education and curricula of medical courses, and its utility in diagnosis. The current study is a comprehensive systematic review. A search was conducted on online medical and scientific databases. Twenty-nine articles relevant to the content of the current research topic were selected. Based on this review, the use of the Anatomage table is valuable for anatomy learning outcomes, and most of the research supported it as an important anatomy tool in addition to cadaveric dissection. The Anatomage table in association with human dissection can improve knowledge retention of anatomy. It is an important tool for understanding organ variation. Anatomage is now considered an important tool for the educational training programs of medical students and residents and for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Anatomage can make the curriculum more interesting and valuable. Utilizing the Anatomage table can help medical and paramedical students and residents by assisting them to understand anatomy in a better way. It will also improve radiological knowledge and facilitate pre-planning for surgeries.

    "Abstract": "As virtual reality (VR) technologies have been increasingly adopted in the educational field, careful consideration and evaluation of instructional modes to support learning with VR are needed. This study focuses on evaluation of two instructional modes: direct interaction and manipulation of the VR learning environment; and the vicarious approach of observing how a novice peer and an expert learn with VR. An experimental design was utilized with two comparison conditions: direct VR interaction (n = 72) and the vicarious approach (n = 69). Participants' knowledge and emotional engagement were evaluated via self-report questionnaires. Results showed that though learning with the direct VR condition was associated with more intense emotional engagement, there was no significant difference in knowledge gains between the two study conditions. The findings suggest that each of the two instructional modes has specific instructional affordances and that the cognitive and emotional components of learning via VR should be further explored. Since learning vicariously through observing the dialogue between an expert and a peer can have immediate knowledge gains comparable to the direct VR interaction, there is an effective and more accessible opportunity for VR-based learning. Future research should evaluate this instructional effect on knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Organisational learning drives tourism organisations towards more sustainable tourism. Digital transformation also provides opportunities for sustainable tourism development. This study aims to combine these perspectives and explore how digital transformation enables organisational learning to contribute to sustainable tourism, following organisational learning theory (OLT). Design/methodology/approach: Based on a critical realist paradigm, this study focuses on developing an in-depth understanding of organisational learning in tourism organisations. Thirty qualitative interviews with tourism organisations participating in an executive development programme (EDP) show how tourism organisations create, retain and transfer knowledge. Findings: This study demonstrates that the EDP initiates knowledge creation through content transmission and exchange, triggers knowledge retention through utilisation of digital technologies and reinforces digitalisation through data value creation. Furthermore, this study enables knowledge transformation as implementation, which contributes to the three pillars of sustainable tourism and facilitates the development of networks encouraging sustainable tourism. Originality/value: This study identifies approaches that enable economic, social and environmentally sustainable tourism development by facilitating collaborations via digital transformation, digital technologies that guide guest streams, online mobility offers and online environmental awareness campaigns that reduce environmental impacts. Thus, this study strengthens OLT and has implications for organisational learning and tourism policymakers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",

    "Abstract": "Introduction The integration of technology in pharmacy education has led to significant changes, making it essential to examine its impact on student learning outcomes. With the rise of emerging technologies, such as game-based learning and augmented reality, new pedagogical approaches have been introduced. However, these technologies also bring challenges that necessitate well-thought-out responses from educational institutions, especially considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on learning formats. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with pharmacy students in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, utilizing stratified random sampling for data collection. The study employed a validated questionnaire to gather information on students' use of technology, their preferences, and their perceived learning outcomes. The analysis was carried out using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, version 29) (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY), ensuring adherence to the ethical standards set by the institutional review board. Results The study, involving 508 pharmacy students from Saudi Arabia, revealed that a significant majority regularly use technology in their education, particularly online learning management systems and virtual labs, indicating a shift toward more accessible and efficient learning methods. A notable portion of the students acknowledged the beneficial impact of technology on their learning, with 86.3% reporting improved knowledge retention, 92% noting enhanced skills, and 87.1% observing better academic performance. However, the study also uncovered challenges, with about half of the students facing issues mainly related to distractions while finding technological complexity less problematic. The support from educational institutions in addressing these issues was found to be moderate. These findings underscore the crucial role of technology in enhancing pharmacy education while highlighting the need for more comprehensive institutional support and strategic planning to address the challenges faced by students. Conclusions Technology plays a vital role in the modernization of pharmacy education, significantly aiding in knowledge retention, skill development, and academic performance. Despite the widespread use of technology, the varied experiences and challenges encountered by students underscore the need for increased institutional support and strategic planning. Education must adapt alongside technological advancements to cater to the diverse needs of learners, highlighting the importance of further research into the long-term effects and optimal strategies for technology integration in pharmacy education.",

    "Abstract": "Preservation of knowledge by an organization is critical for ongoing success. The knowledge transfer between retirees and their entity's remaining employees offers a unique opportunity to retain knowledge. Employers that engage with employees prior to their retirement can allow for a longer and more productive knowledge transfer process. The aim of our research has been to learn how to make knowledge exchanges successful by considering methods. Managers should consider new efforts for knowledge-continuity management. Multiple surveys were designed to determine the extent of knowledge-loss risk associated with retirees, the prevalence of informal and formal knowledge-transfer practices and the effectiveness of knowledge transfer for knowledge continuity. Results showed that organizations perceive significant knowledge-loss risk with the impending wave of retirements from an aging workforce and that many are not proactively approaching this opportunity. Organizations are leveraging only a few knowledge-transfer approaches and not leveraging technology for tacit knowledge transfers to occur. The data indicate that there is considerable room for improvement in knowledge-transfer practices - and our research offers practical implications for effective knowledge-transfer activities.",

    "Abstract": "As we enter a world of blended learning in higher education, an increased need for adaptation of teaching strategies to enhance engagement has been recognised to amplify learning outcomes online. Gamification has been identified as a creative tool to engage the current cohort of learners who are also characteristically tech-savvy. To this end, escape room games have gained considerable traction in medical and pharmacy education to promote learning, critical thinking and teamwork. In this pilot study we describe the implementation of a 60-minute, web-based hepatitis-themed escape room game within a Year 3 Pharmacotherapy unit at Monash University. A total of 418 students participated in this activity. Students' knowledge gain on the topic was assessed through a pre- and post-intervention assessment, whereby a statistically significant improvement was seen in the knowledge score following implementation of the gaming activity (58.66% pre-intervention vs. 72.05% post-intervention, p < 0.05). The innovative learning activity was also well perceived by the students. Virtual escape room game is a viable pedagogical approach to teach and reinforce clinical concepts among pharmacy students. With the evolving landscape of education and learner demographics, investment in technology- enhanced game-based learning is a promising trajectory to support students' growth in a learner-centered environment. A comparison between virtual escape room game and traditional teaching will further inform effectiveness of the gamification on long term knowledge retention.",

    "Abstract": "Smart City is recognized as a potential approach to address serious urban issues such as traffic, pollution, energy use, and waste management. Therefore, it is vital to evaluate how smart cities are in order to put these methods into practice. To offer advice on these matters, numerous reports are created, and one of which is Smart City Index (SCI). The Institute for Management Development (IMD) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design collaborate on SCI every year (SUTD). The report evaluates how locals view the buildings and technological applications that are available in their towns. Although the study offers a thorough examination of the cities for evaluation, the city clusters should be more sensitive and not be created using strict clustering techniques. In order to address this problem, the clustering algorithms namely K-Medoids, Fuzzy C-Means, and K-Means, which outperform hard clustering approaches in terms of robustness to vagueness and knowledge retention, are used. The main goal of this study is to categorize cities using a scientific manner (clustering algorithms) based on SCI data and to present how the chosen approaches work for dealing with the associated problems. The primary innovation of the present study is the use of clustering techniques in reports where the indexes are used. The results indicate that grouping the cities on the basis of their smart indicators would not be as effective as using the three clustering techniques that are suggested in this paper. These results add to the analysis of the dynamic capacities of smart cities and highlight the sustainability of these tactics.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Organisational learning drives tourism organisations towards more sustainable tourism. Digital transformation also provides opportunities for sustainable tourism development. This study aims to combine these perspectives and explore how digital transformation enables organisational learning to contribute to sustainable tourism, following organisational learning theory (OLT). Design/methodology/approach Based on a critical realist paradigm, this study focuses on developing an in-depth understanding of organisational learning in tourism organisations. Thirty qualitative interviews with tourism organisations participating in an executive development programme (EDP) show how tourism organisations create, retain and transfer knowledge. Findings This study demonstrates that the EDP initiates knowledge creation through content transmission and exchange, triggers knowledge retention through utilisation of digital technologies and reinforces digitalisation through data value creation. Furthermore, this study enables knowledge transformation as implementation, which contributes to the three pillars of sustainable tourism and facilitates the development of networks encouraging sustainable tourism. Originality/value This study identifies approaches that enable economic, social and environmentally sustainable tourism development by facilitating collaborations via digital transformation, digital technologies that guide guest streams, online mobility offers and online environmental awareness campaigns that reduce environmental impacts. Thus, this study strengthens OLT and has implications for organisational learning and tourism policymakers.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge management is widely acknowledged as key to achieving competitive advantages and technological advancement in times of crisis. While a few studies have shown that COVID-19 affects the amount of knowledge loss, it also opens opportunities for new knowledge to be created and shared. This study investigated the effect that COVID-19 has on the loss of knowledge during a pandemic and the role of digital transformation has in the creation of new knowledge, which is essential as a reference for constructing a sustainable knowledge management system in times of crisis. A systematic methodological framework and bibliographic analysis on knowledge management and COVID-19 were employed from peer-reviewed journal papers published between 2019 and 2022 to highlight research trends and future directions. Results showed that knowledge creation and knowledge loss during pandemic have not been adequately studied, and the SECI model illustrated that knowledge creation can prevent and minimise knowledge loss. Effective governance, technology and digital transformation with the presence of social accountability and environmental sustainability are vital for producing innovative solutions from multiple perspectives sustainable knowledge management. Future research is needed to better assess how developing countries particularly manage knowledge creation, knowledge loss and digital transformation in times of crisis.",

    "Abstract": "Background Three-dimensional-printed anatomical models (3DPAMs) appear to be a relevant tool due to their educational value and their feasibility. The objectives of this review were to describe and analyse the methods utilised for creating 3DPAMs used in teaching human anatomy and for evaluating its pedagogical contribution. Methods An electronic search was conducted on PubMed using the following terms: education, school, learning, teaching, learn, teach, educational, three-dimensional, 3D, 3-dimensional, printing, printed, print, anatomy, anatomical, anatomically, and anatomic. Data retrieved included study characteristics, model design, morphological evaluation, educational performance, advantages, and disadvantages. Results Of the 68 articles selected, the cephalic region was the most studied (33 articles); 51 articles mentioned bone printing. In 47 articles, the 3DPAM was designed from CT scans. Five printing processes were listed. Plastic and its derivatives were used in 48 studies. The cost per design ranged from 1.25 USD to 2800 USD. Thirty-seven studies compared 3DPAM to a reference model. Thirty-three articles investigated educational performance. The main advantages were visual and haptic qualities, effectiveness for teaching, reproducibility, customizability and manipulability, time savings, integration of functional anatomy, better mental rotation ability, knowledge retention, and educator/student satisfaction. The main disadvantages were related to the design: consistency, lack of detail or transparency, overly bright colours, long printing time, and high cost. Conclusion This systematic review demonstrates that 3DPAMs are feasible at a low cost and effective for teaching anatomy. More realistic models require access to more expensive 3D printing technologies and substantially longer design time, which would greatly increase the overall cost. Choosing an appropriate image acquisition modality is key. From a pedagogical viewpoint, 3DPAMs are effective tools for teaching anatomy, positively impacting the learning outcomes and satisfaction level. The pedagogical effectiveness of 3DPAMs seems to be best when they reproduce complex anatomical areas, and they are used by students early in their medical studies.",

    "Abstract": "Critical thinking is identified as a key educational outcome in higher education curricula; however, it is not trivial to support students in building this multifaceted skill. In this study, we evaluated a brief online learning intervention focusing on informal fallacy identification, a hallmark critical-thinking skill. The intervention used a bite-sized video learning approach, which has been shown to promote student engagement. Video-based learning was implemented within a precision teaching (PT) framework, which modulates the exposure of individual learners to the learning material to enable them to build 'fluency' in the targeted skills. In one of the learning conditions, PT was applied synergistically with domain-general problem-based training to support generalisation. The intervention consisted of two learning episodes and was administered to three groups (learning conditions) of 19 participants each: a PT fluency-based training group; a PT + group, where PT was combined with problem-based training; and a self-directed learning control group. All three groups showed comparable improvements in fallacy identification on taught (post-episode tests) and unseen materials (post-intervention assessment), with lower-scoring participants showing higher gains than high-scoring participants. The results of the knowledge retention tests a week later were also comparable between groups. Importantly, in the domain-general fallacy-identification assessment (post-intervention), the two PT groups showed higher improvements than the control group. These findings suggest that the integration of bite-sized video learning technologies with PT can improve students' critical-thinking skills. Furthermore, PT, on its own or combined with problem-based training, can improve their skill to generalise learning to novel contexts. We discuss the educational implications of our findings.",

    "Abstract": "Aim/Purpose: This paper describes a technologies education model for introducing Simulation Learning and Extended Reality (XR) solution creation skills and knowledge to students at the tertiary education level, which is broadly applicable to higher education-based contexts of teaching and learning. Background: This work is made possible via the model's focus on advancing knowledge and understanding of a range of digital resources, and the processes and production skills to teach and produce playable educational digital content, including classroom practice and applications. Methodology: Through practice-based learning and technology as an enabler, to inform the development of this model, we proposed a mixed-mode project-based approach of study within a transdisciplinary course for Higher Education students from the first year through to the post-graduate level. Contribution: An argument is also presented for the utility of this model for upskilling Pre-service Teachers' (PSTs) pedagogical content knowledge in Technologies, which is especially relevant to the Australian curriculum context and will be broadly applicable to various educative and non-Australian settings. Findings: Supported by practice-based research, work samples and digital projects of Simulation Learning and XR developed by the authors are demonstrated to ground the discussion in examples; the discussion that is based around some of the challenges and the technical considerations, and the scope of teaching digital solutions creation is provided. Recommendations for Practitioners: We provide a flexible technologies teaching and learning model for determining content for inclusion in a course designed to provide introductory Simulation Learning and XR solution creation skills and knowledge. Recommendation for Researchers: The goal was to provide key criteria and an outline that can be adapted by academic researchers and learning designers in various higher education-based contexts of teaching and inclusive learning design focused on XR. Impact on Society: We explore how educators work with entities in various settings and contexts with different priorities, and how we recognise expertise beyond the institutional interests, beyond discipline, and explore 'what is possible' through digital technologies for social good and inclusivity. Future Research: The next step for this research is to investigate and explore how XR and Simulation Learning could be utilised to accelerate student learning in STEM and HASS disciplines, to promote knowledge retention and a higher level of technology-enhanced learning engagement.",

    "Abstract": "This experiment utilized advanced visualization technology for the delivery of an introductory remote sensing lesson in an undergraduate geography course. Given the numerous immersive visualization solutions available, it is now possible to leverage the capabilities of augmented, mixed, and virtual reality (AR, MR, and VR) technology in a classroom learning environment. For instructors, it is important to understand how advanced visualization technologies can enhance the learning experience and enable greater knowledge retention. To validate the use of an AR sand table/sandbox in a group academic setting, approximately 400 participants were evaluated to assess the impact on students' retention of both foundational and practical remote sensing concepts. This work represents a between-subjects design with two AR sand table experimental groups (instructor sand table interaction, and student sand table interaction) and one control group with no sand table exposure. The use of the AR sand table in a classroom environment was found to improve retention of foundational remote sensing knowledge and elevate the assessment performance for subjects identified as lower performers.",

    "Abstract": "The field of language education has experienced a rise in using virtual reality (VR) to support interactive, contextualized, and collaborative language learning in recent years. The current study investigates the effects of auditory, visual, and textual input on speaking and writing in English for Tourism Purposes (ETP) through immersive, scenery-based virtual reality (SBVR) dyadic learning. Adopting a framework on ETP sociocultural, linguistic, and formulaic competence, the researchers designed relevant learning content using audios, images, and verbatim onscreen text on \"EduVenture VR\" to create an interactive, simulated tour. Thirty-eight English as a foreign language undergraduates participated in this single-group quasi-experiment. Various data sources included speaking and writing pre-, post- and delayed post-tests, a post-intervention survey, and reflections about the VR learning experience. The study reported significant speaking gains in language accuracy, destination promotion, knowledge retention, and replication of ETP language, as well as significant writing improvement in using sophisticated vocabulary, knowledge retention, and replication of ETP language. The study concludes that SBVR warrants positive impact on improving productive ETP skills. Possible factors, limitations, and pedagogical implications for using scenery-based VR in dyadic learning for ETP are discussed. Finally, the study suggests future research directions to combine technology-enhanced language learning theories with multimodal input and material design supported by immersive VR to enhance language production for specific purposes.",

    "Abstract": "The recent explosion of technological innovations in mobile technology, virtual reality (VR), digital dissection, online learning platform, 3D printing, and augmented reality (AR) has provided new avenues for improving preclinical education, particularly in anatomy and histology education. Anatomy and histology are fundamental components of medical education that teach students the essential knowledge of human body structure and organization. However, these subjects are widely considered to be some of the most difficult disciplines for healthcare students. Students often face challenges in areas such as the complexity and overwhelming volume of knowledge, difficulties in visualizing body structures, navigating and identifying tissue specimens, limited exposure to learning materials, and lack of clinical relevance. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the situation by reducing face-to-face teaching opportunities and affecting the availability of body donations for medical education.To overcome these challenges, educators have integrated various educational technologies, such as virtual reality, digital 3D anatomy apps, 3D printing, and AI chatbots, into preclinical education. These technologies have effectively improved students' learning experiences and knowledge retention. However, the integration of technologies into preclinical education requires appropriate pedagogical approaches and logistics to align with educational theories and achieve the intended learning outcomes.The chapter provides practical guidance and examples for integrating technologies into anatomy, histology, and biochemistry preclinical education. The author emphasizes that every technology has its own benefits and limitations and is best suited to specific learning scenarios. Therefore, it is recommended that educators and students should utilize multiple modalities for teaching and learning to achieve the best outcomes. The chapter also acknowledges that cadaver-based anatomy education is essential and proposes that educational technologies can serve as a crucial complement for promoting active learning, problem solving, knowledge application, and enhancing conventional cadaver-based education.The recent explosion of technological innovations in mobile technology, virtual reality (VR), digital dissection, online learning platform, 3D printing, and augmented reality (AR) has provided new avenues for improving preclinical education, particularly in anatomy and histology education.

    "Abstract": "This study examines the effects of technology-enhanced interventions in hospitality curricula using an overarching research hypothesis -- Does a course that features multi-model inputs, web-based learning opportunities and interactive communications prepare students well for their internships? Through an exploration of various influences within blended learning, this study unpacks students' responses to the pedagogical design, technology-enhanced interactions and in turn, assess for their intercultural competencies. The theoretical framework informing this study confirms the hypothesis that these multifaceted classroom activities demonstrated pedagogical effectiveness for knowledge retention. The findings showed that students' intercultural competences were significantly promoted. Students' learning interactions also improved due to the processes of video-making, sharing and discussions in the classroom. Moreover, these classroom activities significantly raised students' intercultural awareness.

    "Abstract": "Introduction Doctors have a legal requirement and duty of care to ensure patients are enabled to make an informed decision about their treatment, including discussion of the benefits, risks and alternatives to a procedure. A patient-centred approach to consent has been firmly established in Ireland, and fundamental to this is the ability to engage in a dialogue that offers comprehensible information to patients. Telemedicine has revolutionised the way we can deliver care to patients in the modern era of computers, tablets, and smartphones, and its use has been rapidly expanded. Novel digital strategies to improve the informed consent process for surgical procedures have been increasingly under investigation over the last 10–15 years and may offer a low cost, accessible and tailored solution to consent for surgical interventions. Within vascular surgery, superficial venous interventions have been associated with a high number medicolegal claims and also represents an area within the specialty with rapidly evolving technology and techniques. The ability to communicate comprehensible information to patients has never been greater. Thus, the author’s aim is to explore whether it is feasible and acceptable to deliver a digital health education intervention to patients undergoing endovenous thermal ablation (EVTA) to supplement the consent process. Methods This is a prospective, single centre, randomised controlled, feasibility trial recruiting patients with chronic venous disease deemed suitable to undergo EVTA. Patients will be randomised to receive either standard consent (SC) or a newly developed digital health education tool (dHET). The primary outcome is feasibility; assessing the recruitment and retention rate of participants and assessing acceptability of the intervention. Secondary outcomes include knowledge retention, anxiety and satisfaction. This feasibility trial is designed to recruit 40 patients, which will allow for a moderate dropout rate. This pilot study will inform the authors of the appropriateness of an adequately powered multicentre trial. Discussion To examine the role of a digital consent solution for EVTA. This may improve and standardise the consent dialogue with patients and may have the potential to reduce claims related to poor consent processes and disclosure of risks. Ethical committee reference Ethical approval has been sought and received from both the Bon Secours Hospital and RCSI (202109017), on 14 May 2021 and 10 October 2021, respectively. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05261412, registered on 1 March 2022",

    "Intervention": "Participants randomised to the intervention dHET will receive the dHET followed by a verbal discussion (as above) and signing of their consent form. The dHET will be delivered on a tablet computer and facilitated by a research assistant who will ensure all technological issues are overcome but will not engage with the participant with regard facilitating better understanding of the content. The digital offering will be interactive; patients will be able to traverse through each section at their own pace with the ability to re-visit sections as many times as they wish. It also contains a short narrated animation of the procedure, which they can play, rewind or fast forward.

    "Abstract": "Purpose Virtual reality (VR) technologies have been gaining popularity in training and development in many fields to promote embodied training. However, its adoption in management has been slow and rigorous empirical research to understand its impact on learning and retention is scarce. Thus, this paper aims to examine the benefits of VR technologies for management training. Design/methodology/approach Through a longitudinal experiment comparing VR platforms and a traditional video platform, this study examines two as yet unexplored benefits of VR technologies vis-à-vis management training – the cognitive outcome and affective reaction of the training experience over time. Findings This study finds that, for cognitive outcomes, immediate gains are similar across video and VR platforms, but subsequent knowledge retention is significantly higher for VR platforms. In terms of affective reaction, VR platforms generate significantly more enjoyment, which carries over to two weeks later, and is partially associated with higher knowledge retention. Practical implications This study has implications for management and human resource trainers and system designers interested in integrating VR for training and development purposes. Originality/value This study makes a unique contribution by unpacking the long-term benefits of an embodied training system, as well as identify a possible link between cognitive outcomes and affective reaction.",

    "Full text": "Welcome to Volume 20 Issue 3 of the Organization Management Journal . This issue presents a striking blend of forward-looking research, shaping our understanding of the modern management landscape. Our featured articles revolve around three key themes: virtual reality (VR) in management training, the interplay of personality and universal design in management education and the exploration of disability-assistance animal stereotype bias in workplace practices.",
    "Finally, “Inclusive Workplace Practices": "Understanding Disability-Assistance Animal Stereotype-Bias Signals” by McPherson and Loafman (2023) explores a less-examined area of workplace inclusivity: disability-assistance animals. In shedding light on the stereotype bias associated with such animals in the workplace, McPherson and Loafman (2023) encourage organizations to foster a more comprehensive understanding and acceptance of this aspect of diversity. HR practitioners and hiring managers must be aware of the potential for implicit stereotype bias when accommodating requests for disability-assistance animals (disability-AAs) in the workplace. The study found a potential for positive stereotype bias, where all genuine assistance animals are presumed to be high functioning, and employees’ assistance animal requests for invisible disabilities without previous disclosure are presumed fraudulent until proven valid. This can lead to discrimination in the workplace. The study suggests the need to improve education about disability-AAs and the potential for unconscious bias for HR practitioners and hiring managers when accommodating requests, particularly when those assistance animals are not described as high functioning. The study also found that almost half of the HR practitioners were unprepared for a disability-AA encounter, indicating the need to improve inclusive policies and practices to mitigate the potential risk of implicit bias-based discrimination from positive stereotype bias when the individual with a disability-AA is not a high-functioning team.",

    "Abstract": "Computer-based learning applications and mobile technology have transformed many aspects of the educational experience over the last decade, producing software aimed at improving learning efficiency and streamlining the presentation of course materials. One such class of software, purpose-created to take advantage of spaced learning and spaced testing principles, are electronic flashcard applications. We provide a perspective on the novel use of the Quizlet flashcard application in a tertiary educational setting. To reduce cognitive load for international graduate dental students taking a pharmacology review course, we implemented Quizlet, which integrates both spaced learning and self-testing, to improve the student learning experience. This study assessed students' perceptions of the Quizlet flashcard system in a student cohort comprised of two consecutive years' classes (n = 51 students in total). Results indicated broad acceptance of Quizlet based on ease of use of the software and ease of study of the material. Our data provide insight into the use of this common software in a professional healthcare tertiary education setting and further demonstrate the successful application of electronic flashcards for a mixed international student cohort. Further research should include an assessment of the impact of flashcard on long-term knowledge retention in this setting.",

    "Abstract": "Studies on human anatomy mainly depend on cadaver dissection. New technology devices have progressed to improve anatomy teaching, such as the 3D Anatomage virtual dissection table. There is a shortage and deficiency in information about the uses and benefits of the Anatomage table. The aim of this article was to review and assess the current evidence about the advantages of the Anatomage virtual table in medical education and curricula of medical courses, and its utility in diagnosis. The current study is a comprehensive systematic review. A search was conducted on online medical and scientific databases. Twenty-nine articles relevant to the content of the current research topic were selected. Based on this review, the use of the Anatomage table is valuable for anatomy learning outcomes, and most of the research supported it as an important anatomy tool in addition to cadaveric dissection. The Anatomage table in association with human dissection can improve knowledge retention of anatomy. It is an important tool for understanding organ variation. Anatomage is now considered an important tool for the educational training programs of medical students and residents and for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Anatomage can make the curriculum more interesting and valuable. Utilizing the Anatomage table can help medical and paramedical students and residents by assisting them to understand anatomy in a better way. It will also improve radiological knowledge and facilitate pre-planning for surgeries. Finally, it has a crucial role during exceptional circumstances such as pandemics.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, the researchers report an experimental study on conceptual knowledge learning and application through embodied interactions, expecting that bodily movements would facilitate learning in a positive manner. The intervention was enabled by Unity3D and Kinect V2, and taught novice adult learners the concepts of and conversions between binary and decimal numbers. Fifty-three adult participants were recruited, and randomly assigned into the experimental and control groups. During the intervention, participants in the experimental group manipulated and interacted with the learning materials through their body movements enabled by Kinect; while those in the control group learned the same content but interacted using conventional mouse and keyboard. Pre- and posttests results indicated that embodied interactions facilitated conceptual learning for the participating adult learners. However, compared with the mouse interaction, the embodied interactions did not lead to significantly better knowledge retention and application results. The study outcome implies that embodied interactions do not necessarily lead to better learning performances over traditional mouse-based interactions, and the 'how' and 'how much' may play critical roles for such interventions. Suggestions and challenges in designing learning systems utilizing embodied interactions enabled by novel technologies are provided.",

    "Abstract": "Safety training effectively addresses the inexperience of and lack of knowledge among construction workers, which are some of the most significant contributors to workplace accidents on construction sites. This paper aims to understand the effectiveness of different extended reality (XR) technologies in imparting important construction safety training to construction workers in a virtual environment compared to conventional classroom training sessions. A group of experts were engaged to understand the most effective learning criteria and the impact of XR visualizations, and their responses were analysed using the interval type-2 fuzzy Delphi (IT2FD) method. Following this, a cohort of engineering students were subjected to construction safety training in traditional, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) environments. Their feedback was collected using an online questionnaire and the responses were analysed using the interval type-2 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (IT2F–AHP). The results revealed that addressing the virtual interface design of the training to maintain the attention of trainees and ensuring the virtual environment’s resemblance to the actual site and task were the most important factors in ensuring effective knowledge retention by the trainees. AR visualizations were most effective at imparting knowledge, and their interactive nature allowed trainees to retain the learned knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of different immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) technological approaches in teaching and learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Specifically, this paper explores the passive iVR and interactive iVR in a real authentic learning context as didactic possibilities compared to the conventional method of listening, consisting of audio-only listening exercises. The study was conducted using university students of B1 level EFL classes. The dependent variables considered in the study were Knowledge Retention, Presence, User Satisfaction, Cybersickness, and Preferred Technology. Results indicated that users showed significant satisfaction and preference for using this technology for learning, revealing enjoyment and motivation which are vital factors when learning a foreign language. However, no significant differences were found between learning via traditional listening exercises or the virtual system. Correlation tests were conducted between the questionnaire subscales to understand better which elements can influence learning. The study concludes that using iVR-based learning tools to learn a foreign language as an alternative to audio listening can only produce a broader positive impact and greater motivation. The results also suggest that iVR can be a valuable tool in the education field for knowledge transfer and motivation when learning foreign languages.",

    "Abstract": "The development of artificial intelligence in recent years has promoted the use of chatbot technology in sustainable education. Many studies examined the effect of chatbots on learning outcomes. However, scant studies summarized the effectiveness of chatbots in education. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of chatbot-assisted learning on various components and how different moderator variables influenced the effectiveness. This study, through a meta-analysis, reviewed 32 empirical studies with 2201 participants published between 2010 and 2022. The results showed that chatbot technology exerted a medium-to-high effect on overall learning outcomes regardless of moderator variables, i.e., intervention duration, chatbot roles, and learning content. In terms of learning components, chatbots could significantly improve explicit reasoning, learning achievement, knowledge retention, and learning interest despite negative findings in critical thinking, learning engagement, and motivation. Future research could expand chatbot research by including different learning components.",

    "Abstract": "Computer-based learning applications and mobile technology have transformed many aspects of the educational experience over the last decade, producing software aimed at improving learning efficiency and streamlining the presentation of course materials. One such class of software, purpose-created to take advantage of spaced learning and spaced testing principles, are electronic flashcard applications. We provide a perspective on the novel use of the Quizlet flashcard application in a tertiary educational setting. To reduce cognitive load for international graduate dental students taking a pharmacology review course, we implemented Quizlet, which integrates both spaced learning and self-testing, to improve the student learning experience. This study assessed students' perceptions of the Quizlet flashcard system in a student cohort comprised of two consecutive years' classes (n = 51 students in total). Results indicated broad acceptance of Quizlet based on ease of use of the software and ease of study of the material. Our data provide insight into the use of this common software in a professional healthcare tertiary education setting and further demonstrate the successful application of electronic flashcards for a mixed international student cohort. Further research should include an assessment of the impact of flashcard on long-term knowledge retention in this setting.Computer-based learning applications and mobile technology have transformed many aspects of the educational experience over the last decade, producing software aimed at improving learning efficiency and streamlining the presentation of course materials.

    "Abstract": "Embodied cognition theory denotes that knowledge is incorporated into the body’s sensorimotor system, which facilitates learning and understanding abstract concepts. In this context, several interaction modalities have been introduced to design learning experiences that promote multisensory processing. This study examined the impacts of the type of embodied interaction modality on learning gains in a real classroom context. The researchers designed learning interfaces involving different interaction modalities including tablet application, tangible user interface, motion-based technology, and multimodal interaction. Thirty-six primary school students (aged 7 to 9) were assigned to four groups to learn the basics of the human body anatomy. The study adopted an immediate and a 20-day delayed post-test to measure students’ knowledge retention. Regardless of interaction modality type, participants showed significant immediate learning gains. However, participants in the multimodal embodiment conditions performed better on the delayed post-test. The findings suggested that multimodal embodied interaction, merging between body movements and tangible user interfaces, may lead to better knowledge retention. The process of performing body movements and physical interaction offered an alternative and a complementary encoding strategy for understanding and memorizing the learning concepts.",

    "Abstract": "Disease education is a fundamental component in health science and medicine curricula, as it prepares students for their progression into health profession careers. However, this requires an ability to integrate concepts across multiple disciplines. Technology-enhanced interventions may bridge this gap, and this study assessed the effectiveness of a textbook-style or a three-dimensional mixed reality (MR, a hybrid of augmented and virtual reality) HoloLens resource for student learning and knowledge retention using asthma as a model of disease. Sixty-seven first-year undergraduate health science and medical students were randomized into two groups to complete a lesson on the physiology, anatomy, pathology, and pharmacology of asthma, delivered through either a textbook-style ( n  = 34) or MR ( n  = 33) resource. Participants took part in the study in small groups and completed the intervention and surveys in separate areas of a large laboratory space. A pre-test prior to the lesson included multiple-choice questions, with the post-test having additional multiple-choice questions to assess learning. A follow-up test to assess retention was performed two weeks later. Pre- and post-test scores revealed increased learning across both the textbook ( p  = 0.001) and MR ( p  = 0.05) interventions, although higher test results were obtained by those using the textbook-style resource ( p  < 0.05). There was no difference between groups in knowledge retention scores. Although the textbook-style resource was more effective for increasing test results, participants perceived MR as more favorable, highlighting the experience as enjoyable and useful. This study presents MR as an option for integration in cases where educators wish to enhance student enjoyment of the learning experience. However, the results suggest that traditional text-based resources persist as a fundamental delivery mode within a modern curriculum.Disease education is a fundamental component in health science and medicine curricula, as it prepares students for their progression into health profession careers.

BACKGROUND Virtual reality learning environments (VRLEs) are a potentially valuable learning tool that have recently increased in popularity due to widespread availability and decreased cost. VRLEs can provide an immersive learning environment that increases the understanding of three-dimensional relationships between anatomical structures. However, there is a paucity of evidence in the literature supporting its use within Midwifery education.To explore the effectiveness of a VRLE as an educational tool in midwifery education. OBJECTIVES To explore the effectiveness of a VRLE as an educational tool in midwifery education.A large University in Ireland, with institutional ethical approval. SETTING A large University in Ireland, with institutional ethical approval.Undergraduate and graduate degree midwifery students. PARTICIPANTS Undergraduate and graduate degree midwifery students.A descriptive qualitative and quantitative study was carried out. Data collection was carried out between September 2020 and March 2021. DESIGN A descriptive qualitative and quantitative study was carried out. Data collection was carried out between September 2020 and March 2021.Participants underwent a VRLE lesson based on the topic of fetal lie, position, and presentation in pregnancy. A multiple-choice questionnaire was used to quantitatively evaluate knowledge before and immediately after the intervention, and knowledge retention after one week. Qualitative data was collected using open-ended questions in the questionnaire. The primary outcome was a difference in pre- and post-intervention knowledge scores. Data was analysed using repeated measures one-way ANOVA. Qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis and simple content analysis. All students participated in the quantitative and qualitative components of the study. Secondary outcomes included participant satisfaction and self-confidence in learning which were analysed using thematic analysis. The side effect profile of the virtual reality device was also explored using open-ended questions in the questionnaire.

Repeated measures one-way ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences in knowledge scores pre- and post-intervention. Participants rated high satisfaction and self-confidence scores with regard to the VRLE as a learning modality. Side effects most commonly experienced by participants included dizziness (49 %), disorientation (30 %) and symptoms similar to motion sickness (32 %). The following themes were identified: \"Learning in 3D\", \"The Power of Visual Learning\", \"The value of Educational Technology\", \"Learning can be fun and enjoyable\".

    "Abstract": "A significant number of instructors, researchers and students have claimed that chemistry is a challenging subject to teach and learn at all education levels. Its main learning difficulties are in line with certain sights of its phenomena that are abstract, and some chemistry teachers do not specify what to be learned and assessed in chemistry lesson. The current work investigates the use of formative assessment rubrics for supporting secondary school students’ progressive learning in organic chemistry through a technology-based learning project approach in Rwanda. The investigators used a convergent parallel research design, and quantitative data were gathered by distributing questionnaires to the students, and the answers were statistically analyzed. Qualitative data were obtained through observation and interview and were narratively analyzed. The results from this study showed that rubric-based formative assessment supported students’ learning of organic chemistry via technology-based learning approach. This is accredited to the fact that students were motivated while doing their assessment and they were able to do self-assessment by applying the provided rubrics via technology. The students understood instructors’ expectations, encouraged their learning, sharpened their technology skills, and their knowledge retention was also increased. The instructors were able to grade the students’ tasks fast with the help of an analytic rubric and good formative feedback was availed to students on time. The instructors were also able to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of the learners and give them quick formative feedback.",

BACKGROUND Active engagement of nursing students has deteriorated overtime, especially during the global pandemic. Therefore, there has been a widespread search for learning methods that incorporate digital technologies and active student participation in recent years. Game-based learning may be an option, as it uses game-design elements to enhance academic performance and learning.

OBJECTIVES The literature review aimed to explore student experience and learning when using game-based learning and to understand its uses in the nursing curriculum.Systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis. DESIGN Systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis.ESBCO Discovery Service was used to search healthcare, science and education-related databases. DATA SOURCES ESBCO Discovery Service was used to search healthcare, science and education-related databases.A comprehensive search of English language primary research published between 2017 and 2022 on the use of game-based learning in nursing undergraduate education was conducted. Data was analysed using thematic analysis. REVIEW METHODS A comprehensive search of English language primary research published between 2017 and 2022 on the use of game-based learning in nursing undergraduate education was conducted. Data was analysed using thematic analysis.Seventeen papers from 4 different countries were included. The studies explored interventions and subjects of increased teaching complexity that required increased levels of knowledge retention and critical thinking, such as nursing theory and complex clinical skills. Three themes emerged from the literature, including: approaches to game-based learning; student experience and engagement; impact of game-based learning on student learning and knowledge retention. Studies used a wide range of learning methods, such as quizzes, escape rooms and serious games. These methods were in general well-accepted by students, who endorsed its widespread use in the nursing curriculum. Most studies reported an increase in student experience and learning when using game-based learning, although time-limited games can often increase anxiety on students.

    "Abstract": "Purpose > As older adults are increasingly active in virtual communities (VCs), these platforms for knowledge exchange present opportunities for companies to use elder human capital. The purpose of this study is to understand the antecedent factors that motivate older adults’ knowledge contribution and knowledge seeking (KS) behaviors in VCs. Design/methodology/approach > Rooted in socio-emotional selectivity and social cognitive theories, this study included five key variables and developed models for older adults’ knowledge contributing (KC)/KS behaviors. This paper tested the hypotheses using data from a sample of 204 older adults in 3 VCs in China. Findings > The results provide support for most of the hypotheses and show that while other members’ participation (MP) acts as a substitute for meaning in life and attitude toward aging, it acts as a complement for outcome expectations (OE) focused on others and OE focused on oneself in their impacts on KC/KS activities. Practical implications > The study provides practical insights for developing elder human resources via VCs to avoid knowledge loss. Originality/value > This study described older adults’ unique characteristics when modeling their information and communication technologies-related behaviors and built two models to explain their KC/KS behaviors. It confirmed that the same factor has different levels of impact on older adults’ KC/KS behaviors in VCs. In addition, it confirmed and reinforced the complementary and substitutive effects of other MP as an environmental factor on these behaviors.",

Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines four electronic databases were systematically searched. Inclusion criteria: empirical studies using any type of AR intervention in patient education across all medical specialties. Quality assessment of the retrieved literature was carried out. Results: Ten papers, comprising 788 patients, were identified and included (Randomized controlled trial (RCT)(n = 3), non-randomized controlled trial (n = 3), before-and-after study (n = 3), and qualitative survey (n = 1)). Retrieved literature showed itself to be highly heterogeneous. The studied population included patients suffering from a diverse spectrum of chronic diseases (e.g., prostate cancer, diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy). Quantitative results indicated that the use of AR had a positive effect on knowledge retention and patient satisfaction. Qualitative findings suggested that patients liked the technology and felt comfortable with its use for educational purposes. The quality of the retrieved results was shown to be moderate to low. Conclusion: The limited evidence of this topic suggests the possible potential of AR in patient education. Practice implication: More research, using high-quality study designs and more evidence-based interventions, is needed to fully appreciate the value of AR on patient education.

    "Abstract": "Purpose According to World Health Organization, our planet will need more than 40 million new doctors, nurses, frontline healthcare workers, and other healthcare professionals by the year 2030, which is double the current medical workforce (1). The existing training model (a master teaching a limited number of apprentices over the course of several years) is unable to meet the level of healthcare professionals needed. Empirical evidence from other industries demonstrates virtual reality (VR) technology is an effective and efficient way of improving training. Methods VR technology allows users to interact with a computer-simulated environment. VR implementation in medicine focuses on the rapid acceleration of human learning in medical training. It aims to provide technology for medical staff to reskill and upskill more effectively, without a large time investment. The combination of cognitive training in an experience-based learning virtual environment enabled by advanced VR software and hardware provides several advantages: (1) unrestricted training time, increased training access during COVID-19 restrictions; (2) remote training access: growing demand for health professionals in countries with less developed infrastructure; (3) modernizing standards: during simulated training competency evaluations for residents are performed. Results (1) Increased trainee engagement and knowledge retention (70%) compared to videos (10%) or lecturing (5%) (2) Decreased training time, 29% less OR training time due to skill transfer from VR to OR (3) Decreased training costs. Conclusions An intelligent VR training simulation for dental healthcare professionals results in a proven skills transfer and embodied cognition in a fail-safe environment, in scalable training with low-cost and on-demand VR software, as well as in progress achieved through learning curricula faster, at lower cost and with the highest fidelity.",

    "Abstract": "The advent of new digital technologies changes the nature and forms of knowledge assets defining the organisations' value drivers and the knowledge processes for accessing, assessing and managing critical knowledge resources, defining core competencies and dynamic capabilities of organisations. [...]digital transformation has a holistic impact on organisations requiring to re-think how they create and deliver value to their stakeholders. Considering the rising influence and dependence on digital technologies and applications in many different sectors/industries, the relevance and importance of managing strategic knowledge in organisations has a more significant impact than ever before in the growth and sustenance of organisational competitiveness and value (Dragicevic et al., 2019; Venkitachalam and Willmott, 2015). Besides the significance of strategic knowledge, the extant literature on digitally connected conceptualisations [e.g. cloud computing, Internet of things (IoT), big data and business analytics] also see them as useful pathways to solve organisations' challenges that are often related to attaining and maintaining value for its stakeholders (Pauleen and Wang, 2017; Uden and He, 2017). [...]this can result in reinvention and loss of knowledge assets and massive costs for organisations (Dragicevic et al., 2019; Venkitachalam and Willmott, 2016). [...]adopting technologies aims to enhance the operational capacity of an organisation to perform and deliver superior value to stakeholders. [...]from a strategic point of view, knowledge management and digital transformation can be seen as two aspects of the same reality aiming to equip organisations with an ever-increasing capacity to define, create and deliver stakeholder value.",

    "Abstract": "Advances in 3-dimensional modeling have revolutionized presurgical planning for maxillofacial reconstruction, yet little is known about how this technology may affect patient education. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of 2-dimensional computed tomography versus 3-dimensional computed tomography for patient education in maxillofacial reconstruction. OBJECTIVE Advances in 3-dimensional modeling have revolutionized presurgical planning for maxillofacial reconstruction, yet little is known about how this technology may affect patient education. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of 2-dimensional computed tomography versus 3-dimensional computed tomography for patient education in maxillofacial reconstruction.Crossover study. STUDY DESIGN Crossover study.General otolaryngology outpatients from a tertiary referral center were recruited. SETTING General otolaryngology outpatients from a tertiary referral center were recruited.A single computed tomography data set of a zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture was used to generate 2 educational video tutorials: one in a 2-dimensional format and one in a 3-dimensional format. The tutorials were embedded into the Qualtrics XM platform. Participants were randomly assigned into 2 groups. Group 1 viewed the 2-dimensional tutorial, took a self-assessment survey, took an information recall survey, viewed the 3-dimensional tutorial, and finally took a tutorial comparison survey. Group 2 followed the same sequence but viewed the 3-dimensional tutorial followed by the 2-dimensional tutorial.

Group 2 followed the same sequence but viewed the 3-dimensional tutorial followed by the 2-dimensional tutorial.Group 2 participants (viewing the 3-dimensional tutorial first) scored better on the self-assessment survey than their counterparts in group 1 did ( P = .023). Group 2 also scored better on the recall survey ( P = .042). Of all participants, 61% preferred the 3-dimensional tutorial, and 31% preferred the use of both tutorials together in the comparison survey. RESULTS Group 2 participants (viewing the 3-dimensional tutorial first) scored better on the self-assessment survey than their counterparts in group 1 did (P = .023). Group 2 also scored better on the recall survey (P = .042). Of all participants, 61% preferred the 3-dimensional tutorial, and 31% preferred the use of both tutorials together in the comparison survey.Three-dimensional patient educational tutorial regarding a zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture resulted in better knowledge retention and was preferred over the 2-dimensional format.

    "Abstract": "The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions. This means there is a growing need to integrate UAV training into STEM education. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a UAV education module and laboratory exercise for natural resource science students. The study used a series of reusable learning objects (RLOs) to assess students' prior knowledge of remote sensing and UAVs. Students were taught the steps of UAV data acquisition and processing through lectures and UAV simulation videos. Students applied this knowledge by completing a laboratory exercise that used previously collected UAV data. Student knowledge retention and understanding were evaluated using an online quiz to determine the effectiveness of the education module. The average quiz score was 92%, indicating that the UAV laboratory exercise effectively taught students about UAV data acquisition and processing for natural resource research. Overall, students expressed positive opinions about the UAV education module. Student feedback indicated that the laboratory exercise was engaging, but some students would have preferred a hands-on experience for some parts of the exercise. However, in-person UAV instruction may not be accessible for all educators because of UAV cost or lack of instructor training. This study provides educators with crucial recommendations for designing UAV exercises to improve access to UAV-related educational content. This study indicates that online training can effectively introduce students to UAVs. Given the wide range of UAV uses across STEM fields, students in many STEM disciplines would benefit from UAV education.

    "Abstract": "Sociolinguists suggest language death entails significant cultural, personal, and ecological loss. Socio-cultural and socio-political factors exacerbate language erosion and encourage supplantation by another more dominant language. Hence, we ask: what are the sociocognitive principles which make language death hurtful and symbolic? Within this article, we attempt to outline a sociocognitive account of language death, situating the Hallidayan perspective of language as a “social-semiotic” system alongside a Cognitive Linguistic approach. We further contextualise language as inseparable from culture, drawing insight from the sociological thought of Bourdieu. We contend that language death entails psychological trauma, representing the destruction of cultural genealogy and the loss of knowledge intrinsic to personal self-imagery and identity. To this end, we present a case study of the Māori languaculture in Aotearoa (New Zealand), tracing the impact of colonialism and marginalisation to current efforts and ambitions to ensure the languacultural survival of Māori and reclaim space in Aotearoa as a respected knowledge system and means of expression, particularly in the socio-technical age of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Web. We argue that our analysis bodes practical implications for language maintenance and revitalisation, concluding that sociolinguistic practitioners should consider a socio-cognitivist as well as socio-technical paradigm for language intervention. In closing, we discuss leveraging AI technologies towards language heritage, archival, and preservation to limit the destructive impact of the death of a language.",

    "Abstract": "A significant number of instructors, researchers and students have claimed that chemistry is a challenging subject to teach and learn at all education levels. Its main learning difficulties are in line with certain sights of its phenomena that are abstract, and some chemistry teachers do not specify what to be learned and assessed in chemistry lesson. The current work investigates the use of formative assessment rubrics for supporting secondary school students' progressive learning in organic chemistry through a technology-based learning project approach in Rwanda. The investigators used a convergent parallel research design, and quantitative data were gathered by distributing questionnaires to the students, and the answers were statistically analyzed. Qualitative data were obtained through observation and interview and were narratively analyzed. The results from this study showed that rubric-based formative assessment supported students' learning of organic chemistry \"via\" technology-based learning approach. This is accredited to the fact that students were motivated while doing their assessment and they were able to do self-assessment by applying the provided rubrics \"via\" technology. The students understood instructors' expectations, encouraged their learning, sharpened their technology skills, and their knowledge retention was also increased. The instructors were able to grade the students' tasks fast with the help of an analytic rubric and good formative feedback was availed to students on time. The instructors were also able to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of the learners and give them quick formative feedback.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: As older adults are increasingly active in virtual communities (VCs), these platforms for knowledge exchange present opportunities for companies to use elder human capital. The purpose of this study is to understand the antecedent factors that motivate older adults’ knowledge contribution and knowledge seeking (KS) behaviors in VCs. Design/methodology/approach: Rooted in socio-emotional selectivity and social cognitive theories, this study included five key variables and developed models for older adults’ knowledge contributing (KC)/KS behaviors. This paper tested the hypotheses using data from a sample of 204 older adults in 3 VCs in China. Findings: The results provide support for most of the hypotheses and show that while other members’ participation (MP) acts as a substitute for meaning in life and attitude toward aging, it acts as a complement for outcome expectations (OE) focused on others and OE focused on oneself in their impacts on KC/KS activities. Practical implications: The study provides practical insights for developing elder human resources via VCs to avoid knowledge loss. Originality/value: This study described older adults’ unique characteristics when modeling their information and communication technologies-related behaviors and built two models to explain their KC/KS behaviors. It confirmed that the same factor has different levels of impact on older adults’ KC/KS behaviors in VCs. In addition, it confirmed and reinforced the complementary and substitutive effects of other MP as an environmental factor on these behaviors.

    "Abstract": "The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions. This means there is a growing need to integrate UAV training into STEM education. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a UAV education module and laboratory exercise for natural resource science students. The study used a series of reusable learning objects (RLOs) to assess students' prior knowledge of remote sensing and UAVs. Students were taught the steps of UAV data acquisition and processing through lectures and UAV simulation videos. Students applied this knowledge by completing a laboratory exercise that used previously collected UAV data. Student knowledge retention and understanding were evaluated using an online quiz to determine the effectiveness of the education module. The average quiz score was 92%, indicating that the UAV laboratory exercise effectively taught students about UAV data acquisition and processing for natural resource research. Overall, students expressed positive opinions about the UAV education module. Student feedback indicated that the laboratory exercise was engaging, but some students would have preferred a hands-on experience for some parts of the exercise. However, in-person UAV instruction may not be accessible for all educators because of UAV cost or lack of instructor training. This study provides educators with crucial recommendations for designing UAV exercises to improve access to UAV-related educational content.

    "Abstract": "In the twenty-first century, the use of software is growing due to many applications requiring large and complex software. Many people do not realise that the use of software has influenced the operation of computer hardware to move indirectly as it affects the hardware’s energy consumption and carbon emissions. Previous studies focused more on models and tools to measure the impact of power consumption and energy efficiency from hardware than on software development studies. Energy consumption can be optimised by the greening software process throughout all phases of development activity. Besides, the current green software process models are more focused on environmental and economic elements and do not integrate with the waste elements in the development phase. Integrating sustainability and waste elements is essential to ensure that the development process complies with green process standards. A qualitative method is used through interviews involving eight informants from Malaysia’s public and private sectors. The objectives of the empirical study are to reveal the current practices of the green software process in industry, identify software process waste and determine green factors associated with the software process. The analysis is guided by a thematic approach using Atlas.ti 8 software. This paper describes the results from the qualitative study that consists of three main themes: best practices of a software process, nine software wastes (building the wrong feature, rework, unnecessarily complex solutions, extraneous cognitive load, psychological distress, waiting, knowledge loss, ineffective communication, delay), and six green factors (resources, people, organisational, technical, environmental, technology). The analysis findings indicate that the software industry needs elements of best practices, green practices, and software technologies in each development phase to produce a green and sustainable software process. The advancement of computing today presents technology as an essential factor in green elements to ensure that the software process is constantly updated and always green.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose > The construction site operates under a hazardous environment that requires a high level of understanding in building systems to minimise accidents. However, the current building education generally adopts paper-based learning approaches that lack hands-on experiences. Furthermore, to achieve Industrial Revolution 4.0 in line with any unforeseen pandemic, the most optimum solution is to transition from physical to technological-based building education. This paper aims to address the problems by proposing a game-based virtual reality (GBVR) for building utility inspection training. Design/methodology/approach > The feasibility of the GBVR for building the utility inspection training approach is validated on a sample of undergraduate engineering students through user experience (survey) and performance-based comparisons against traditional paper-based training method. Findings > The results show that the developed GBVR training has higher system usability in terms of visual output and knowledge retention than paper-based training due to visualisation technologies. The GBVR training method has also higher user-friendliness because of the higher motivational and engagement factors through the adoption of virtual reality and game-based learning. Research limitations/implications > GBVR training required a longer training duration and achieved a lower performance score (effectiveness) but can be improved by transitioning into hands-on tasks. This study has the potentials to be extended to vocational training platforms for competency development in the construction workforce by using cutting-edge extended reality technologies. Originality/value > This paper portrays the benefits of integrating virtual reality technology in building education to overcome the low practicality and engagement of paper-based training.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge is the primary factor for firm creativity that is mostly embedded in employees. Meanwhile, R&D employee mobility is quite frequently in high technology firms. This situation suggests a critical management task of firm creativity and innovation: how to retain the knowledge of the current R&D employee and benefit from the knowledge brought by new R&D employees to improve firm creativity. Based on extant studies which found that the collaboration network correlated with employees’ knowledge retention, knowledge flow, and cognitive lock-in this article proposed that the characteristics of a firm's co-inventive network and industrial co-inventive network moderate the influence of R&D employees’ mobility on firm creativity. Empirical results based on the Chinese firms’ invention patents in the information and communication technology industry demonstrate that the highly connected firm's co-inventive networks impair the damage of R&D employees’ outward mobility to firm creativity. Moreover, the firm's low degree of centrality in the industrial co-inventive network decreases the contribution of R&D employees’ inward mobility to firm creativity, and the firm's low betweenness centrality in the industrial co-inventive network helps it obtain the benefit from R&D employees’ inward mobility. We discussed these results, which are meaningful to both R&D managers and industrial policymakers.",

    "Abstract": "The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions. This means there is a growing need to integrate UAV training into STEM education. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a UAV education module and laboratory exercise for natural resource science students. The study used a series of reusable learning objects (RLOs) to assess students’ prior knowledge of remote sensing and UAVs. Students were taught the steps of UAV data acquisition and processing through lectures and UAV simulation videos. Students applied this knowledge by completing a laboratory exercise that used previously collected UAV data. Student knowledge retention and understanding were evaluated using an online quiz to determine the effectiveness of the education module. The average quiz score was 92%, indicating that the UAV laboratory exercise effectively taught students about UAV data acquisition and processing for natural resource research. Overall, students expressed positive opinions about the UAV education module. Student feedback indicated that the laboratory exercise was engaging, but some students would have preferred a hands-on experience for some parts of the exercise. However, in-person UAV instruction may not be accessible for all educators because of UAV cost or lack of instructor training. This study provides educators with crucial recommendations for designing UAV exercises to improve access to UAV-related educational content. This study indicates that online training can effectively introduce students to UAVs. Given the wide range of UAV uses across STEM fields, students in many STEM disciplines would benefit from UAV education.",

    "Abstract": "Modern medical curricula adopt the use self-directed learning approaches, which frequently include the use of technology enhanced learning resources. Often, students prefer those which are available via mobile devices because it can facilitate flexibility and autonomy with their learning, more so than with traditional modalities. Although the production value of resources may be appealing to users, those that work most effectively for education align well to existing pedagogies. One such pedagogy is the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. It is a framework that can be used to facilitate the construction of educational video, that can benefit learning gain through reducing the cognitive load.Although much research has been conducted on how information should be presented in video resources, there is very limited evidence within the subject of clinical anatomy and physiology or when applying different types of educational video, such as screencasts, or interactive video. In the field of anatomy education recent approaches have sought to standardize a robust methodology to evaluate digital resources. This procedure utilizes a combination of normalized learning gain and learner perceptions to gain an accurate picture of educational impact.The current study investigated the impact of both interactive educational videos and screencasts compared with traditional teaching techniques in the challenging subjects of histology and pain physiology. A quasi-randomized, cross-sectional study was conducted with 135 medical students enrolled at the University of Southampton. Sixty fourth- and fifth-year students assessed the histology resources, and 75 second-year students assessed the pain histology resources. Participants were randomly assigned to either a text-based resource, interactive video, or screencast group. Outcomes measured were: 1. Normalized knowledge gain (and retention) assessed using one-best-answer multiple choice question tests 2. Student perceptions using 1-10 Likert-scale style questionnaires. A significant improvement in mean normalized knowledge gain was observed for all teaching modalities. For pain physiology, the means were: Text-49.0% (n = 23), interactive video-70.1% (n = 26), and screencast-53.8% (n = 26). For all learning gains, P < 0.001. For histology, there was a mean normalized learning gain for text-80.0% (n = 20), interactive video-74.4% (n = 20), and screencast groups-68.3% (n = 20). For all learning gains, P < 0.001.For pain physiology resources, interactive videos significantly improved learning gain compared to the screencast (P < 0.05) and the text resource groups (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between those who used the text or screencast resources. There was also no significant difference in knowledge retention between the different teaching methods for each subject.Following teaching, all three teaching modalities had similar effects on student confidence in the subjects, desire for educational channels dedicated to each topic, and preference for locally produced vs. externally produced videos. These findings have the potential to inform educators on which types of resources to create or to select for their students to have the best impact on learning.Modern medical curricula adopt the use self-directed learning approaches, which frequently include the use of technology enhanced learning resources.
